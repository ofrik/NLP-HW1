"1" "\"<i>The President.</i> Happy New Year, everybody. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Happy New Year, Mr. President. <p><i>The President.</i> A central promise of my campaign for President was to change the Tax Code that was too skewed towards the wealthy at the expense of working middle class Americans. Tonight we've done that. Thanks to the votes of Democrats and Republicans in Congress, I will sign a law that raises taxes on the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans while preventing a middle class tax hike that could have sent the economy back into recession and obviously had a severe impact on families all across America. <p>I want to thank all the leaders of the House and Senate. In particular, I want to thank the work that was done by my extraordinary Vice President Joe Biden, as well as Leader Harry Reid, Speaker Boehner, Nancy Pelosi, and Mitch McConnell. Everybody worked very hard on this, and I appreciate it. And, Joe, once again, I want to thank you for your great work. <p>Under this law, more than 98 percent of Americans and 97 percent of small businesses will not see their income taxes go up. Millions of families will continue to receive tax credits to help raise their kids and send them to college. Companies will continue to receive tax credits for the research that they do, the investments they make, and the clean energy jobs that they create. And 2 million Americans who are out of work, but out there looking, pounding the pavement every day, are going to continue to receive unemployment benefits as long as they're actively looking for a job. <p>But I think we all recognize, this law is just one step in the broader effort to strengthen our economy and broaden opportunity for everybody. The fact is, the deficit is still too high, and we're still investing too little in the things that we need for the economy to grow as fast as it should. <p>And that's why Speaker Boehner and I originally tried to negotiate a larger agreement that would put this country on a path to paying down its debt while also putting Americans back to work rebuilding our roads and bridges and providing investments in areas like education and job training. Unfortunately, there just wasn't enough support or time for that kind of large agreement in a lame duck session of Congress. And that failure comes with a cost, as the messy nature of the process over the past several weeks has made business more uncertain and consumers less confident. <p>But we are continuing to chip away at this problem, step by step. Last year, I signed into law $1.7 trillion in deficit reduction. Tonight's agreement further reduces the deficit by raising $620 billion in revenue from the wealthiest households in America. And there will be more deficit reduction as Congress decides what to do about the automatic spending cuts that we have now delayed for 2 months. <p>I want to make this point: As I've demonstrated throughout the past several weeks, I am very open to compromise. I agree with Democrats and Republicans that the aging population and the rising cost of health care makes Medicare the biggest contributor to our deficit. I believe we've got to find ways to reform that program without hurting seniors who count on it to survive. And I believe that there's further unnecessary spending in Government that we can eliminate. <p>But we can't simply cut our way to prosperity. Cutting spending has to go hand in hand with further reforms to our Tax Code so that the wealthiest corporations and individuals can't take advantage of loopholes and deductions that aren't available to most Americans. And we can't keep cutting things like basic research and new technology and still expect to succeed in a 21st-century economy. So we're going to have to continue to move forward in deficit reduction, but we have to do it in a balanced way, making sure that we are growing even as we get a handle on our spending. <p>Now, one last point I want to make: While I will negotiate over many things, I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they've already racked up through the laws that they passed. Let me repeat: We can't not pay bills that we've already incurred. If Congress refuses to give the United States Government the ability to pay these bills on time, the consequences for the entire global economy would be catastrophic, far worse than the impact of a fiscal cliff. <p>People will remember, back in 2011, the last time this course of action was threatened, our entire recovery was put at risk. Consumer confidence plunged. Business investment plunged. Growth dropped. We can't go down that path again. <p>Now, today's agreement enshrines, I think, a principle into law that will remain in place as long as I am President: The deficit needs to be reduced in a way that's balanced. Everyone pays their fair share. Everyone does their part. That's how our economy works best. That's how we grow. <p>The sum total of all the budget agreements we've reached so far proves that there is a path forward, that it is possible if we focus not on our politics, but what's&mdash;but on what's right for the country. And the one thing that, I think, hopefully, in the new year we'll focus on is seeing if we can put a package like this together with a little bit less drama, a little less brinksmanship, not scare the heck out of folks quite as much. <p>We can come together as Democrats and Republicans to cut spending and raise revenue in a way that reduces our deficit, protects our middle class, provides ladders into the middle class for everybody who's willing to work hard. We can find a way to afford the investments that we need to grow and compete. We can settle this debate, or at the very least, not allow it to be so all-consuming all the time that it stops us from meeting a host of other challenges that we face: creating jobs, boosting incomes, fixing our infrastructure, fixing our immigration system, protecting our planet from the harmful effects of climate change, boosting domestic energy production, protecting our kids from the horrors of gun violence. <p>It's not just possible to do these things, it's an obligation to ourselves and to future generations. And I look forward to working with every single Member of Congress to meet this obligation in the new year. <p>And I hope that everybody now gets at least a day off, I guess, or a few days off, so that people can refresh themselves, because we're going to have a lot of work to do in 2013. <p>Thanks, everybody. Happy New Year.\" "
"2" "\"Hi, everybody. Over the past year, as I traveled across the country campaigning for this office, I told you that if I was fortunate enough to be reelected, I'd work to change a Tax Code that too often benefited the wealthy at the expense of the middle class. <p>This week, we did that. For the first time in two decades, we raised taxes on the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans in a bipartisan way, while preventing a middle class tax hike that could have thrown our economy back into recession. <p>Under this law, more than 98 percent of Americans and 97 percent of small businesses will not see their income taxes go up one dime. We also made sure that millions of families will continue to receive tax credits to help raise their children and send them to college. Companies will continue to receive tax credits for the research they do, the investments that they make, and the clean energy jobs that they create. And 2 million Americans who are out of work will continue to receive unemployment benefits so long as they are actively looking for a job. <p>But all this was just one step in the broader effort to grow our economy and shrink our deficits. We still need to do more to put Americans back to work while also putting this country on a path to pay down its debt. And our economy can't afford more protracted showdowns or manufactured crises along the way. Because even as our businesses created 2 million new jobs last year&mdash;including 168,000 new jobs last month&mdash;the messy brinksmanship in Congress made business owners more uncertain and consumers less confident. <p>We know there's a path forward. Last year, I signed into law $1.7 trillion in deficit reduction. This week's action further reduces the deficit by $737 billion, making it one of the largest deficit reduction bills passed by Congress in over a decade. And I'm willing to do more. <p>I believe we can find more places to cut spending without shortchanging things like education, job training, research, and technology, all of which are critical to our prosperity in a 21st-century economy. But spending cuts must be balanced with more reforms to our Tax Code. The wealthiest individuals and the biggest corporations shouldn't be able to take advantage of loopholes and deductions that aren't available to most Americans. <p>And as I said earlier this week, one thing I will not compromise over is whether or not Congress should pay the tab for a bill they've already racked up. If Congress refuses to give the United States the ability to pay its bills on time, the consequences for the entire global economy could be catastrophic. The last time Congress threatened this course of action, our entire economy suffered for it. Our families and our businesses cannot afford that dangerous game again. <p>I congratulate the newly sworn-in Members of Congress, and I look forward to working with the new Congress in a bipartisan way. If we focus on the interests of our country above the interests of party, I'm convinced we can cut spending and raise revenue in a manner that reduces our deficit and protects the middle class. And we can step up to meet the important business that awaits us this year: creating jobs, boosting incomes, fixing our infrastructure and our immigration system, promoting our energy independence while protecting our planet from the harmful effects of climate change, educating our children, and shielding them from the horrors of gun violence. <p>These aren't just things we should do, they're things we must do. And in this new year, I'll fight as hard as I know how to get them done. Happy New Year, everybody.\" "
"3" "\"Hi, everybody. This week, I welcomed President Hamid Karzai to the White House to discuss the way ahead in Afghanistan. And today I want to update you on how we will end this war, bring our troops home, and continue the work of rebuilding America. <p>Over the past 4 years, thanks to our brave men and women in uniform, we've dealt devastating blows to Al Qaida. We've pushed the Taliban out of their strongholds. And our core objective&mdash;the reason we went to war in the first place&mdash;is now within reach: ensuring that Al Qaida can never again use Afghanistan to launch attacks against America. <p>The 33,000 additional forces that I ordered to Afghanistan served with honor. They completed their mission and, as promised, returned home last fall. This week, we agreed that this spring, Afghan forces will take the lead for security across the entire country and our troops will shift to a support role. In the coming months, I'll announce the next phase of our drawdown. And by the end of next year, America's war in Afghanistan will be over. <p>This progress has only been possible because of the heroic sacrifices of our troops and diplomats, alongside forces from many other nations. More than a half million Americans&mdash;military and civilian&mdash;have served in Afghanistan. Thousands have been wounded. More than 2,000 have given their lives. <p>This remains a very difficult mission. The work ahead will not be easy. Our forces are still in harm's way. But make no mistake: Our path is clear, and we are moving forward. Because after more than a decade of war, the nation we need to rebuild is our own. <p>As we do, we have to care of our troops and veterans who fought in our name. We have to grow our economy and shrink our deficits, create new jobs and boost family incomes. We have to fix our infrastructure and our immigration system. We have to protect our planet from the destructive effects of climate change and protect our children from the horrors of gun violence. <p>These, too, will be difficult missions for America, but they must be met. And if we can just summon a fraction of the determination of our men and women in uniform, I know we can meet them. And I intend to work as hard as I know how to make sure we do. <p>Thank you.\" "
"4" "\"<i>Vice President Joe Biden.</i> Before I begin today, let me say to the families of the innocents who were murdered 33 days ago, our heart goes out to you. And you show incredible courage&mdash;incredible courage&mdash;being here. And the President and I are going to do everything in our power to honor the memory of your children and your wives with the work we take up here today. <p>It's been 33 days since the Nation's heart was broken by the horrific, senseless violence that took place at Sandy Hook Elementary School: twenty&mdash;20&mdash;beautiful first-graders gunned down in a place that's supposed to be their second sanctuary; six&mdash;six&mdash;members of the staff killed trying to save those children. It's literally been hard for the Nation to comprehend, hard for the Nation to fathom. <p>And I know for the families who are here that time is not measured in days, but it's measured in minutes, in seconds, since you received that news. Another minute without your daughter. Another minute without your son. Another minute without your wife. Another minute without your mom. <p>I want to personally thank Chris and Lynn McDonnell, who lost their beautiful daughter Grace, and the other parents who I had a chance to speak to, for their suggestions and for&mdash;again, just for the courage of all of you to be here today. I admire the grace and the resolve that you all are showing. And I must say I've been deeply affected by your faith as well. And the President and I are going to do everything to try to match the resolve you've demonstrated. <p>No one can know for certain if this senseless act could have been prevented, but we all know we have a moral obligation&mdash;a moral obligation&mdash;to do everything in our power to diminish the prospect that something like this could happen again. <p>As the President knows, I've worked in this field a long time, in the United States Senate, having chaired a Committee that had jurisdiction over these issues of guns and crime and having drafted the first gun violence legislation&mdash;the last gun violence legislation, I should say. And I have no illusions about what we're up against or how hard the task is in front of us. But I also have never seen the Nation's conscience so shaken by what happened at Sandy Hook. The world has changed, and it's demanding action. <p>It's in this context that the President asked me to put together, along with Cabinet members, a set of recommendations about how we should proceed to meet that moral obligation we have. And toward that end, the Cabinet members and I sat down with 229 groups&mdash;not just individuals, representing groups&mdash;229 groups, from law enforcement agencies to public health officials, to gun officials, to gun advocacy groups, to sportsmen and hunters and religious leaders. And I've spoken with Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, had extensive conversation with mayors and Governors and county officials. <p>And the recommendations we provided to the President on Monday call for executive actions he could sign, legislation he could call for, and long-term research that should be undertaken. They're based on the emerging consensus we heard from all the groups with whom we spoke, including some of you who are victims of this god-awful occurrence, ways to keep guns out of the wrong hands, as well as ways to take comprehensive action to prevent violence in the first place. <p>We should do as much as we can, as quickly as we can. And we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. So some of what you will hear from the President will happen immediately; some will take some time. But we have begun. And we are starting here today, and we're resolved to continue this fight. <p>During the meetings that we held, we met with a young man who's here today; I think Colin Goddard is here. Where are you, Colin? Colin was one of the survivors of the Virginia Tech massacre. He was in the classroom. He calls himself one of the lucky seven. And he'll tell you he was shot four times on that day, and he has three bullets that are still inside him. <p>And when I asked Colin about what he thought we should be doing, he said that, he said: \\"I'm not here because of what happened to me. I'm here because of what happened to me keeps happening to other people and we have to do something about it.\\" <p>Colin, we will. Colin, I promise you, we will. This is our intention. We must do what we can now. And there's no person who is more committed to acting on this moral obligation we have than the President of the United States of America. <p>Ladies and gentlemen, President Barack Obama. <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you, everybody. Please have a seat. Good afternoon, everybody. <p>Let me begin by thanking our Vice President, Joe Biden, for your dedication, Joe, to this issue, for bringing so many different voices to the table. Because while reducing gun violence is a complicated challenge, protecting our children from harm shouldn't be a divisive one. <p>Over the month since the tragedy in Newtown, we've heard from so many, and obviously, none have affected us more than the families of those gorgeous children and their teachers and guardians who were lost. And so we're grateful to all of you for taking the time to be here and recognizing that we honor their memories in part by doing everything we can to prevent this from happening again. <p>But we also heard from some unexpected people. In particular, I started getting a lot of letters from kids. Four of them are here today: Grant Fritz, Julia Stokes, Hinna Zeejah, and Taejah Goode. They're pretty representative of some of the messages that I got. These are some pretty smart letters from some pretty smart young people. <p>Hinna, a third-grader&mdash;you can go ahead and wave, Hinna. Yes, you. [<i>Laughter</i>] Hinna wrote: \\"I feel terrible for the parents who lost their children&hellip;I love my country, and I want everybody to be happy and safe.\\" <p>And then, Grant&mdash;go ahead and wave, Grant. [<i>Laughter</i>] Grant said: \\"I think there should be some changes. We should learn from what happened at Sandy Hook. I feel really bad.\\" <p>And then, Julia said&mdash;Julia, where are you? There you go. \\"I'm not scared for my safety, I'm scared for others. I have four brothers and sisters, and I know I would not be able to bear the thought of losing any of them.\\" <p>These are our kids. This is what they're thinking about. And so what we should be thinking about is our responsibility to care for them and shield them from harm and give them the tools they need to grow up and do everything that they're capable of doing, not just to pursue their own dreams, but to help build this country. This is our first task as a society: keeping our children safe. This is how we will be judged. And their voices should compel us to change. <p>And that's why, last month, I asked Joe to lead an effort, along with members of my Cabinet, to come up with some concrete steps we can take right now to keep our children safe, to help prevent mass shootings, to reduce the broader epidemic of gun violence in this country. <p>And we can't put this off any longer. Just last Thursday, as TV networks were covering one of Joe's meetings on this topic, news broke of another school shooting, this one in California. In the month since 20 precious children and 6 brave adults were violently taken from us at Sandy Hook Elementary, more than 900 of our fellow Americans have reportedly died at the end of a gun&mdash;900 in the past month. And every day we wait, that number will keep growing. <p>So I'm putting forward a specific set of proposals based on the work of Joe's task force. And in the days ahead, I intend to use whatever weight this office holds to make them a reality. Because while there is no law or set of laws that can prevent every senseless act of violence completely, no piece of legislation that will prevent every tragedy, every act of evil, if there is even one thing we can do to reduce this violence, if there is even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try. <p>And I'm going to do my part. As soon as I'm finished speaking here, I will sit at that desk, and I will sign a directive giving law enforcement, schools, mental health professionals, and the public health community some of the tools they need to help reduce gun violence. <p>We will make it easier to keep guns out of the hands of criminals by strengthening the background check system. We will help schools hire more resource officers, if they want them, and develop emergency preparedness plans. We will make sure mental health professionals know their options for reporting threats of violence, even as we acknowledge that someone with a mental illness is far more likely to be a victim of violent crime than the perpetrator. <p>And while year after year, those who oppose even modest gun safety measures have threatened to defund scientific or medical research into the causes of gun violence, I will direct the Centers for Disease Control to go ahead and study the best ways to reduce it. And Congress should fund research into the effects that violent video games have on young minds. We don't benefit from ignorance. We don't benefit from not knowing the science of this epidemic of violence. <p>Now, these are a few of the 23 executive actions that I'm announcing today. But as important as these steps are, they are in no way a substitute for action from Members of Congress. To make a real and lasting difference, Congress, too, must act, and Congress must act soon. And I'm calling on Congress to pass some very specific proposals right away. <p>First, it's time for Congress to require a universal background check for anyone trying to buy a gun. The law already requires licensed gun dealers to run background checks, and over the last 14 years, that's kept 1.5 million of the wrong people from getting their hands on a gun. But it's hard to enforce that law when as many as 40 percent of all gun purchases are conducted without a background check. That's not safe. That's not smart. It's not fair to responsible gun buyers or sellers. <p>If you want to buy a gun&mdash;whether it's from a licensed dealer or a private seller&mdash;you should at least have to show you are not a felon or somebody legally prohibited from buying one. This is common sense. And an overwhelming majority of Americans agree with us on the need for universal background checks, including more than 70 percent of the National Rifle Association's members, according to one survey. So there's no reason we can't do this. <p>Second, Congress should restore a ban on military-style assault weapons and a 10-round limit for magazines. The type of assault rifle used in Aurora, for example, when paired with high-capacity magazines, has one purpose: to pump out as many bullets as possible, as quickly as possible; to do as much damage, using bullets often designed to inflict maximum damage. <p>And that's what allowed the gunman in Aurora to shoot 70 people&mdash;70 people&mdash;killing 12 in a matter of minutes. Weapons designed for the theater of war have no place in a movie theater. A majority of Americans agree with us on this. <p>And by the way, so did Ronald Reagan, one of the staunchest defenders of the Second Amendment, who wrote to Congress in 1994, urging them&mdash;this is Ronald Reagan speaking&mdash;urging them to listen to the American public and to the law enforcement community and support a ban on the further manufacture of military-style assault weapons. <p>And finally, Congress needs to help, rather than hinder, law enforcement as it does its job. We should get tougher on people who buy guns with the express purpose of turning around and selling them to criminals. And we should severely punish anybody who helps them do this. Since Congress hasn't confirmed a Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in 6 years, they should confirm Todd Jones, who will be&mdash;who has been Acting, and I will be nominating for the post. <p>And at a time when budget cuts are forcing many communities to reduce their police force, we should put more cops back on the job and back on our streets. <p>Now, let me be absolutely clear. Like most Americans, I believe the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to bear arms. I respect our strong tradition of gun ownership and the rights of hunters and sportsmen. There are millions of responsible, law-abiding gun owners in America who cherish their right to bear arms for hunting or sport or protection or collection. <p>I also believe most gun owners agree that we can respect the Second Amendment while keeping an irresponsible, law-breaking few from inflicting harm on a massive scale. I believe most of them agree that if America worked harder to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people, there would be fewer atrocities like the one that occurred in Newtown. That's what these reforms are designed to do. They're commonsense measures. They have the support of the majority of the American people. <p>And yet that doesn't mean any of this is going to be easy to enact or implement. If it were, we'd already have universal background checks. The ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines never would have been allowed to expire. More of our fellow Americans might still be alive, celebrating birthdays and anniversaries and graduations. <p>This will be difficult. There will be pundits and politicians and special interest lobbyists publicly warning of a tyrannical, all-out assault on liberty, not because that's true, but because they want to gin up fear or higher ratings or revenue for themselves. And behind the scenes, they'll do everything they can to block any commonsense reform and make sure nothing changes whatsoever. <p>The only way we will be able to change is if their audience, their constituents, their membership says this time must be different, that this time, we must do something to protect our communities and our kids. <p>I will put everything I've got into this, and so will Joe. But I tell you, the only way we can change is if the American people demand it. And by the way, that doesn't just mean from certain parts of the country. We're going to need voices in those areas, in those congressional districts, where the tradition of gun ownership is strong to speak up and to say this is important. It can't just be the usual suspects. We have to examine ourselves and our hearts and ask ourselves what is important. <p>This will not happen unless the American people demand it. If parents and teachers, police officers and pastors, if hunters and sportsmen, if responsible gun owners, if Americans of every background stand up and say: \\"Enough. We've suffered too much pain and care too much about our children to allow this to continue.\\" Then change will come. That's what it's going to take. <p>In the letter that Julia wrote me, she said, \\"I know that laws have to be passed by Congress, but I beg you to try very hard.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Julia, I will try very hard. But she's right: The most important changes we can make depend on congressional action. They need to bring these proposals up for a vote, and the American people need to make sure that they do. <p>Get them on record. Ask your Member of Congress if they support universal background checks to keep guns out of the wrong hands. Ask them if they support renewing a ban on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And if they say no, ask them why not. Ask them what's more important: doing whatever it takes to get a A grade from the gun lobby that funds their campaigns or giving parents some peace of mind when they drop their child off for first grade? <p>This is the land of the free, and it always will be. As Americans, we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights that no man or government can take away from us. But we've also long recognized, as our Founders recognized, that with rights come responsibilities. Along with our freedom to live our lives as we will comes an obligation to allow others to do the same. We don't live in isolation. We live in a society, a government of and by and for the people. We are responsible for each other. <p>The right to worship freely and safely, that right was denied to Sikhs in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. The right to assemble peacefully, that right was denied shoppers in Clackamas, Oregon, and moviegoers in Aurora, Colorado. That most fundamental set of rights to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness, fundamental rights that were denied to college students at Virginia Tech and high school students at Columbine and elementary school students in Newtown and kids on street corners in Chicago on too frequent a basis to tolerate and all the families who've never imagined that they'd lose a loved one to a bullet, those rights are at stake. We're responsible. <p>When I visited Newtown last month, I spent some private time with many of the families who lost their children that day. And one was the family of Grace McDonnell. Grace's parents are here. Grace was 7 years old when she was struck down, just a gorgeous, caring, joyful little girl. I'm told she loved pink. She loved the beach. She dreamed of becoming a painter. <p>And so just before I left, Chris, her father, gave me one of her paintings, and I hung it in my private study just off the Oval Office. And every time I look at that painting, I think about Grace. And I think about the life that she lived and the life that lay ahead of her, and most of all, I think about how, when it comes to protecting the most vulnerable among us, we must act now. For Grace. For the 25 other innocent children and devoted educators who had so much left to give. For the men and women in big cities and small towns who fall victim to senseless violence each and every day. For all the Americans who are counting on us to keep them safe from harm. Let's do the right thing. Let's do the right thing for them and for this country that we love so much. <p>Thank you. Let's sign these orders. <p>[<i>At this point, the President signed memorandums to increase research by Federal agencies into the causes and prevention of gun violence, improve the availability of records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, and strengthen firearms tracing efforts by Federal law enforcement agencies.</i>] <p>All right, there we go.\" "
"5" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! Well, this is a good-looking crew here. First of all, we just want to acknowledge Burrville Elementary School and the principal here, Tui Roper, who is doing outstanding work. If you see Tui, you may think she's a student, but no, she's the principal. <p>As I look around the room, I see friends from all across the country, people who have been such great supporters of ours, but more importantly, everybody here&mdash;adults to children&mdash;understand the importance of giving back. And as we think about not so much Inauguration, but we think about the fact that this is Dr. King's birthday that we're going to be celebrating this weekend, I'm always reminded that he said, everybody wants to be first, everybody wants to be a drum major; but if you're going to be a drum major, be a drum major for service, be a drum major for justice, be a drum major for looking out for other people. <p>And organizations like City Year, the Corporation for National Service&mdash;all these&mdash;all the great work that's being done day in, day out shows that there's a huge hunger on the part of young people to get involved and to get engaged. And it was interesting&mdash;we were talking to one of the young people, I was staining a shelf&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The First Lady.</i> He did a fine job. <p><i>The President.</i> And Michelle says I did a fine job. [<i>Laughter</i>] And one of the City Year folks&mdash;I was talking to them, I said, how'd you get involved&mdash;they said, our parents every holiday we'd always do service, and so I was taught at a very young age. So the fact that we've got some outstanding young people here today, I want to say thank you to the parents for showing early on to all our young people how gratifying and how fulfilling this is. <p>This is really what America is about. This is what we celebrate. This Inauguration we're going to be&mdash;it's a symbol of how our democracy works and how we peacefully transfer power, but it should also be an affirmation that we're all in this together and that we've got to look out for each other and work hard on behalf of each other. <p>So we're thrilled that all of you are here. We hope you guys are having a great time. I hear reports that the very young people did some really good work and some of the older folks like me, who it hurt getting our knees, kind of bending down a little bit, we were able to manage also, and somehow, Michelle looked stylish the whole time she was doing it. <p>So, Mich, you want to say a few words? <p><i>The First Lady.</i> You all, thank you so much. It's wonderful to have such great turnout for this Day of Service. And I know that we have a lot of family members in the audience&mdash;and we always force our family, when they come up and do something really cool, they have to serve, and they do it happily. So I'm proud of our families for always being there for us. We love you guys. <p>So as Barack said, this is a weekend of celebration, but through it all, we have to remember that the reason why we're here, why we're standing here, why we're able to celebrate this weekend is because a lot of people worked hard and supported us. And we've got a job to do. And this is a symbol of the kind of work that we need to be doing for the next 4 years and beyond. <p>[<i>At this point, there was a loud crash.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> That was a cameraman. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> That was the press. This is press. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's okay, though, it's okay. Hope you didn't break it. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So for all the young people, and we've got a lot of young people&mdash;City Year members, the students here at this school&mdash;you know, as Barack says, we're passing the baton onto you all. So the goal is, is that as you make your way through life, who are you pulling up behind you? And as long as you're pulling somebody up behind you, you're doing the right thing. <p>So thank you all. We're very proud of you and we're going to come down and shake some hands.\" "
"6" "\"Hi, everybody. This week, I announced a series of concrete steps we should take to protect our children and our communities from gun violence. <p>These proposals grew out of meetings Vice President Biden and his task force held over the last month with more than 200 different groups, from parents and teachers to law enforcement and sportsmen, to religious leaders and mental health professionals. And in the weeks ahead, I'll do everything in my power to make them a reality, because while we may not be able to prevent every senseless act of violence in this country, if there is even one thing that we can do to reduce it, if even one life can be saved, we've got an obligation to try. <p>My administration is taking a series of actions right away, from strengthening our background check system to helping schools hire more resource officers if they want them, to directing the Centers for Disease Control to study the best ways to reduce gun violence. But the truth is, making a real and lasting difference also requires Congress to act and act soon. <p>First, it's time for Congress to require a universal background check for anyone trying to buy a gun. The law already requires licensed gun dealers to perform these checks, but as many as 40 percent of all gun purchases are conducted without one. That's not safe, it's not smart, and it's not fair to responsible gun buyers or sellers. An overwhelming majority of Americans agree that anyone trying to buy a gun should at least have to prove that they're not a felon or somebody legally prohibited from owning one. That's just common sense. <p>Second, Congress should restore a ban on military-style assault weapons and a 10-round limit for magazines. Many assault rifles, when combined with high-capacity magazines, have one purpose and one purpose only: to fire as many bullets as possible as quickly as possible. These weapons have no place in our communities, and a majority of the American people agree with me. <p>Finally, Congress needs to make it easier, rather than harder, for law enforcement to do its job. We should get tougher on people who buy guns only to turn around and sell them to criminals. And at a time when many communities have been forced to make cuts to their police force, we should put more cops back on the job and back on the street. <p>Like most Americans, I believe the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to bear arms. We have a strong tradition of gun ownership in this country, and the vast majority of gun owners act responsibly. But I also believe most gun owners agree that we can respect the Second Amendment while keeping an irresponsible, law-breaking few from causing harm on a massive scale. That's what these reforms are designed to do. <p>None of this will be easy. Already, we're seeing pundits and politicians and special interest lobbyists calling any attempt at commonsense reform an all-out assault on liberty, not because that's true, but because that's how they get higher ratings or make more money. And behind the scenes, they're doing everything they can to protect the status quo. <p>But this time, it can't be up to them. It's got to be up to you. If, like me, you want this time to be different, then I need your help to make it different. Ask your Member of Congress if they support universal background checks and renewing a ban on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And if the answer is no, ask them why not. Ask them why an A grade from the gun lobby is more important than keeping kids safe in a first grade classroom. <p>Since the tragedy in Newtown, I've gotten letters from all over the country, including many from our young people. One of them was from 8-year-old Rachel, who lives in Brooklyn, New York. She wrote: \\"Please do something so that bad people cannot get guns to kill other people. Children should be safe, especially in school.\\" <p>Rachel is counting on us. Let's get this done for her and all the other children in this country, and let's make sure this country is a safer place for all children to learn and to grow. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"7" "\"[<i>Vice President Joe Biden's remarks were joined in progress.</i>] <p><i>Vice President Biden.</i> Ladies and gentlemen, it's my great honor to introduce you to a magnificent, a truly magnificent First Lady Michelle Obama and the guy she hangs out with, my friend, President Barack Obama. <p>Hey. [<i>Laughter</i>] I thought you weren't coming out. [<i>Laughter</i>] I thought you weren't coming. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Hi, everybody. Excuse our tardiness. But you know what, when Stevie Wonder has a few words to say to you&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;you don't rush Stevie Wonder. [<i>Laughter</i>] So pardon our delay, but thank you. Thanks so much, Jill. Thank you for that kind introduction. But more importantly, thank you for your leadership and service. <p>I love Joe Biden. I love Jill a little bit more. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I want to thank you both for making this journey so much more fun. Our families have bonded and this has just been a phenomenal 4 years. And I'm ready to do 4 more with both of you. <p><i>The President.</i> Four more. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Four more. <p>And most of all, I want to thank all of you here tonight for everything&mdash;everything&mdash;that you've done to bring this Inauguration to life. This weekend has been such a wonderful celebration for our people and for the future. And we know that none of it could have happened without all of you. And that's why it was so important for all of us to be here and to spend some time with you. <p>So this weekend, as we look ahead to the next 4 years, we should absolutely take some time to truly enjoy this next few days. I mean, the last one was kind of fast. [<i>Laughter</i>] So we've all agreed that we're going to take some time to just breathe in and enjoy it. <p>But let's also remember that this Inauguration is about more than all of the events that we will all enjoy this weekend. It's about more than swearing in a President. It's about more than we accomplish together over the next 4 years. It's also about the opportunities we have to make a real difference in people's lives. I mean, the truth is it's about our opportunity to continue to lift up our families, to help more of our children achieve their dreams, and to put our country on a solid foundation not just for these next few years, but for generations to come. <p>So tonight let us rededicate ourselves to that work. Let us keep building on the progress that we've made. And let's keep working and fighting and pushing forward&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The President.</i> Forward. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Forward. <p><i>The President.</i> Forward. <p><i>The First Lady. &mdash;</i>&mdash;forward to make the real changes that's happened. <p>And that's what this man, my husband, has been doing for these last 4 years. And let me tell you, it has just been a true thrill to watch this handsome, charming&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;individual grow into the man and the President that he is. We have seen him every single day&mdash;his integrity, his character, his sense of humor&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;his compassion, his courage. And no matter what the obstacles, we have seen him be so steady facing the challenges that lie ahead and, as always, held true to one unwavering belief, and that is that we love this country and we can all work together to change it. <p>So, ladies and gentlemen, it is my distinct honor and pleasure to welcome the love of my life and our President for the next 4 years, Barack Obama. <p><i>The President.</i> Good evening. Now, first of all, I love Michelle Obama. And to address the most significant event of this weekend, I love her bangs. [<i>Laughter</i>] She looks good. She always looks good. <p>You know, as President, you make a lot of important decisions. Probably the most important decision is who is going to be your partner during the course of your Presidency. And there have been some decisions I got right, some maybe folks might question. But one decision I know was absolutely correct, absolutely spot on, was my choice of Vice President. I could not have a better partner than Joe Biden. And Joe Biden couldn't have a better partner than Dr. Jill Biden. We love these folks. Give them a round of applause. <p>Now, some of you may have heard the story of Andrew Jackson's Inaugural reception. Party-goers got so rowdy they broke several thousands of dollars' worth of White House china. [<i>Laughter</i>] So my first big thank you tonight is to the National Building Museum for hosting us here. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I also want to thank the Source for their outstanding entertainment, the U.S. Navy Sea Chanters, and a guy who has been known to make pretty good music, Mr. Stevie Wonder. <p>I'm delivering another speech tomorrow, so tonight I'm going to be pretty brief, because there are a limited amount of good lines and you don't want to use them all up tonight. [<i>Laughter</i>] My main purpose tonight is just to say thank you. <p>As I look out on the room, we've got people from every walk of life, every corner and nook and cranny of this country&mdash;every State, every city, every suburb&mdash;people who have invested so much heart, soul, time, money, energy. One of the things that made this campaign unique was the degree of investment and ownership people had in this common project of ours, because you understood this was not just about a candidate, it was not just about Joe Biden or Barack Obama. This was about us, who we are as a nation, what values we cherish, how hard we're willing to fight to make sure that those values live not just for today but for future generations. <p>All of you here understood and were committed to the basic notion that when we put our shoulders to the wheel of history, it moves. It moves. It moves forward. And that's part of what we celebrate when we come together for Inauguration. <p>Yesterday Americans in all 50 States took part in a National Day of Service. Tomorrow hundreds of thousands will join us in the National Mall. And what the Inauguration reminds us of is the role we have as fellow citizens in promoting a common good even as we carry out our individual responsibilities: the sense that there's something larger than ourselves that gives shape and meaning to our lives. <p>The theme of this year's Inauguration is \\"Our People and Our Future.\\" And throughout my career, what's always given me energy and inspiration and hope, what's allowed me to stand up when I've been knocked down, are folks like you: the decency, the goodness, the resilience, the neighborliness, the patriotism, the sense of duty, the sense of responsibility of the American people. You have inspired me throughout. <p>And so whenever I think about the challenges that Joe and I and Jill and Michelle face, we know that we stand amongst friends and colleagues and fellow citizens and that the work is not just ours, that we are working together. <p>So I just want to say thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. And I want all of you to know that even as we celebrate over the next couple of days&mdash;and feel free to stay up as late as you want. Tomorrow is not a school night. Make sure to bundle up, although it won't be as cold as it was 4 years ago. [<i>Laughter</i>] Make sure you know that what we're celebrating is not the election or swearing-in of a President; What we're doing is celebrating each other and celebrating this incredible Nation that we call home. <p>And after we celebrate, let's make sure to work as hard as we can to pass on an America that is worthy not only of our past, but also of our future. <p>God bless you guys. I love you. We'll see you tomorrow.\" "
"8" "\"Thank you. Thank you so much. <p>Vice President Biden, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the United States Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens: <p>Each time we gather to inaugurate a President we bear witness to the enduring strength of our Constitution. We affirm the promise of our democracy. We recall that what binds this Nation together is not the colors of our skin or the tenets of our faith or the origins of our names. What makes us exceptional&mdash;what makes us American&mdash;is our allegiance to an idea articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago: <p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. <p>Today we continue a never-ending journey to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time. For history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident, they've never been self-executing; that while freedom is a gift from God, it must be secured by His people here on Earth. The patriots of 1776 did not fight to replace the tyranny of a king with the privileges of a few or the rule of a mob. They gave to us a republic, a government of and by and for the people, entrusting each generation to keep safe our founding creed. <p>And for more than 200 years, we have. <p>Through blood drawn by lash and blood drawn by sword, we learned that no union founded on the principles of liberty and equality could survive half-slave and half-free. We made ourselves anew, and vowed to move forward together. <p>Together, we determined that a modern economy requires railroads and highways to speed travel and commerce, schools and colleges to train our workers. <p>Together, we discovered that a free market only thrives when there are rules to ensure competition and fair play. <p>Together, we resolved that a great nation must care for the vulnerable and protect its people from life's worst hazards and misfortune. <p>Through it all, we have never relinquished our skepticism of central authority nor have we succumbed to the fiction that all society's ills can be cured through government alone. Our celebration of initiative and enterprise, our insistence on hard work and personal responsibility, these are constants in our character. <p>But we have always understood that when times change, so must we; that fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges; that preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action. For the American people can no more meet the demands of today's world by acting alone than American soldiers could have met the forces of fascism or communism with muskets and militias. No single person can train all the math and science teachers we'll need to equip our children for the future, or build the roads and networks and research labs that will bring new jobs and businesses to our shores. Now more than ever, we must do these things together, as one nation and one people. <p>This generation of Americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and proved our resilience. A decade of war is now ending. An economic recovery has begun. America's possibilities are limitless, for we possess all the qualities that this world without boundaries demands: youth and drive; diversity and openness; an endless capacity for risk and a gift for reinvention. My fellow Americans, we are made for this moment and we will seize it&mdash;so long as we seize it together. <p>For we, the people, understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it. We believe that America's prosperity must rest upon the broad shoulders of a rising middle class. We know that America thrives when every person can find independence and pride in their work; when the wages of honest labor liberate families from the brink of hardship. We are true to our creed when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows that she has the same chance to succeed as anybody else, because she is an American; she is free and she is equal, not just in the eyes of God, but also in our own. <p>We understand that outworn programs are inadequate to the needs of our time. So we must harness new ideas and technology to remake our government, revamp our Tax Code, reform our schools, and empower our citizens with the skills they need to work harder, learn more, reach higher. But while the means will change, our purpose endures: a nation that rewards the effort and determination of every single American. That is what this moment requires. That is what will give real meaning to our creed. <p>We, the people, still believe that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security and dignity. We must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit. But we reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future. For we remember the lessons of our past, when twilight years were spent in poverty and parents of a child with a disability had nowhere to turn. <p>We do not believe that in this country freedom is reserved for the lucky, or happiness for the few. We recognize that no matter how responsibly we live our lives, any one of us at any time may face a job loss or a sudden illness or a home swept away in a terrible storm. The commitments we make to each other through Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security, these things do not sap our initiative, they strengthen us. They do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great. <p>We, the people, still believe that our obligations as Americans are not just to ourselves, but to all posterity. We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations. Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms. <p>The path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult. But America cannot resist this transition, we must lead it. We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries, we must claim its promise. That's how we will maintain our economic vitality and our national treasure&mdash;our forests and waterways, our crop lands and snow-capped peaks. That is how we will preserve our planet, commanded to our care by God. That's what will lend meaning to the creed our fathers once declared. <p>We, the people, still believe that enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war. Our brave men and women in uniform, tempered by the flames of battle, are unmatched in skill and courage. Our citizens, seared by the memory of those we have lost, know too well the price that is paid for liberty. The knowledge of their sacrifice will keep us forever vigilant against those who would do us harm. But we are also heirs to those who won the peace and not just the war; who turned sworn enemies into the surest of friends&mdash;and we must carry those lessons into this time as well. <p>We will defend our people and uphold our values through strength of arms and rule of law. We will show the courage to try and resolve our differences with other nations peacefully&mdash;not because we are naive about the dangers we face, but because engagement can more durably lift suspicion and fear. <p>America will remain the anchor of strong alliances in every corner of the globe. And we will renew those institutions that extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad, for no one has a greater stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful nation. We will support democracy from Asia to Africa, from the Americas to the Middle East, because our interests and our conscience compel us to act on behalf of those who long for freedom. And we must be a source of hope to the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the victims of prejudice&mdash;not out of mere charity, but because peace in our time requires the constant advance of those principles that our common creed describes: tolerance and opportunity, human dignity and justice. <p>We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths&mdash;that all of us are created equal&mdash;is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall; just as it guided all those men and women, sung and unsung, who left footprints along this great Mall, to hear a preacher say that we cannot walk alone; to hear a King proclaim that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on Earth. <p>It is now our generation's task to carry on what those pioneers began. For our journey is not complete until our wives, our mothers and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts. Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law&mdash;for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well. Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote. Our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity&mdash;until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country. Our journey is not complete until all our children, from the streets of Detroit to the hills of Appalachia, to the quiet lanes of Newtown, know that they are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm. <p>That is our generation's task&mdash;to make these words, these rights, these values of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every American. Being true to our founding documents does not require us to agree on every contour of life. It does not mean we all define liberty in exactly the same way or follow the same precise path to happiness. Progress does not compel us to settle centuries-long debates about the role of government for all time, but it does require us to act in our time. <p>For now decisions are upon us and we cannot afford delay. We cannot mistake absolutism for principle or substitute spectacle for politics or treat name-calling as reasoned debate. We must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect. We must act, we must act knowing that today's victories will be only partial and that it will be up to those who stand here in 4 years and 40 years and 400 years hence to advance the timeless spirit once conferred to us in a spare Philadelphia hall. <p>My fellow Americans, the oath I have sworn before you today, like the one recited by others who serve in this Capitol, was an oath to God and country, not party or faction. And we must faithfully execute that pledge during the duration of our service. But the words I spoke today are not so different from the oath that is taken each time a soldier signs up for duty or an immigrant realizes her dream. My oath is not so different from the pledge we all make to the flag that waves above and that fills our hearts with pride. <p>They are the words of citizens and they represent our greatest hope. You and I, as citizens, have the power to set this country's course. You and I, as citizens, have the obligation to shape the debates of our time&mdash;not only with the votes we cast, but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring ideals. <p>Let us, each of us, now embrace with solemn duty and awesome joy what is our lasting birthright. With common effort and common purpose, with passion and dedication, let us answer the call of history and carry into an uncertain future that precious light of freedom. <p>Thank you. God bless you, and may He forever bless these United States of America.\" "
"9" "\"<i>Sen. Charles E. Schumer.</i> Mr. President, Dr. Biden, and your whole wonderful family and family, I now rise to toast the Vice President of the United States and my former colleague and my friend, Joe Biden. <p>Mr. Vice President, you've been an extraordinary leader of this Nation and a true partner to our President these past 4 years. You play many roles: adviser, advocate, implementer, persuader, strategist, and most important of all, friend. We're confident this unique partnership between you and our great President will only grow stronger and more productive over the next 4 years. <p>Mr. Vice President, on the surface, we don't share a common ancestry, but on a deeper level, we do share a common story, an American story, of achieving our dreams thanks to the sacrifice of our immigrant forebears. <p>As you embark on your well-deserved second term, in the spirit of those who came before us, and on behalf of all Americans, we offer you all our support and warmest wishes, and we say to you, <i>Slainte</i>, <i>l'chaim</i>, <i>salud</i>, <i>cent'anni, </i>and cheers. To our great Vice President. <p>[<i>At this point, a toast was offered</i>.] <p><i>Vice President Joe Biden.</i> Mr. President, and to all the Presidents assembled: I always enjoyed this lunch more than anything we did in the Capitol. For the 36 years I served in the Senate, I had the great honor of being included in this lunch of former Presidents and Vice Presidents and&mdash;because it really is the place where we get together in a way unlike any other time when we gather. It's always a new beginning every time we're in this room. And there's a sense of possibilities and a sense of opportunity and a sense&mdash;sometimes it's fleeting&mdash;but a sense that maybe we can really, really begin to work together. <p>And, Chuck, we may come from different ancestries, but as all our colleagues know over the years, we're cut from the same cloth: that we share that same common, absolute conviction that was expressed by Harry Truman when he said: \\"America was not built on fear. America was built on courage, on imagination, and an unbeatable determination to do the job at hand.\\" <p>That's what you've done throughout your career, and that's what almost everyone in this room has done. At the end of the day, it's an absolute confidence&mdash;absolute confidence&mdash;there's not a thing&mdash;a single thing&mdash;this country can't do. <p>I spent too much time with all of you not to know you feel it with every fiber in your being that there's nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;this country is incapable of. <p>I must say, the President kids me occasionally&mdash;I know Harry Reid always calls me a Senate man. I am proud to have been a Senate man. I am proud to be President of the Senate. But that pride is exceeded only by the fact I'm proud to be Vice President of the United States, serving as Barack Obama's Vice President. It's been one of the great privileges&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;one of the great privileges of my life. <p>As a matter of fact, if the President will forgive me, as we were walking out and he was, as he said, savoring the moment, looking out at the crowd and all those Americans assembled, I found myself&mdash;surprised me, even&mdash;I turned to him saying, thank you. Thanks. Thanks for the chance. Thanks for the chance to continue to serve. <p>And so, folks, I raise my glass to a man who never, never, never operates out of fear, only operates out of confidence&mdash;and I'm toasting you, Chuck. [<i>Laughter</i>] And a guy who I plan on working with&mdash;you can't get rid of me, man. Remember, I'm still part of the Senate. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>God bless you, Chuck. You've done a great job. And, Lamar, you have as well. To Chuck Schumer. Good to see you, pal. <p>[<i>At toast was offered</i>.] <p><i>Sen. Schumer.</i> The best parts of these events are unscripted. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I'd now like to introduce our Senate Majority Leader, my good friend and, really, foxhole buddy, a great man, Harry Reid, to offer the official toast to the President. <p><i>Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid.</i> Americans today are wishing the President Godspeed for the next 4 years. People all over the world are looking at us, and our exemplary democracy, and wishing the President the best in the years to come. <p>I've had the good fortune for the last many years to work on a very close, personal basis with President Obama. I've watched him in the most difficult challenges that a person could face. I've watched him do this with brilliance, with patience, with courage, wisdom, and kindness, for which I have learned a great deal. <p>So, Mr. President, I toast and pray for you, your wonderful family, and our great country: Four more successful years. <p>Barack Obama. <p>[<i>At toast was offered</i>.] <p><i>The President.</i> Michelle and the Speaker of the House came to a meeting of the minds that I may be delaying the proceedings too much. And so I'm just going to be extraordinarily brief and say thank you: to my Vice President, who has not only been an extraordinary partner, but an extraordinary friend and to Dr. Jill Biden, who has partnered with my wife with an extraordinary generosity on behalf of our men and women in uniform. <p>To the entire Cabinet that is here, I am grateful to you. Some of you are staying, and some of you are leaving, but I know the extraordinary sacrifices that you and my team have made to try to advance the cause of progress in this country, and I'm always going to be grateful to you for that. <p>To the Speaker of the House and Nancy Pelosi, to Democratic Leader Harry Reid, as well as Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, and to all the congressional leaders and all the Members of Congress who are here: I recognize that democracy is not always easy, and I recognize there are profound differences in this room, but I just want to say thank you for your service, and I want to thank your families for their service, because regardless of our political persuasions and perspectives, I know that all of us serve because we believe that we can make America for future generations. <p>And I'm confident that we can act at this moment in a way that makes a difference for our children and our children's children. I know that former President .Carter, President Clinton, they understand the irony of the Presidential office, which is, the longer you're there the more humble you become and the more mindful you are that it is beyond your poor powers individually to move this great country. You can only do it because you have extraordinary partners and a spirit of good will, and most of all, because of the strength and resilience and fundamental goodness of the American people. <p>And so I would like to join all of you not only in toasting the extraordinary work that Chuck Schumer and Lamar Alexander and others have done to create this special day for us, but I also want to thank each and every one of you for not only your service in the past, but hopefully your service in the future as well. <p>And I would like to offer one last toast, and that is to my extraordinary wife, Michelle. There is controversy about the quality of the President, no controversy about the quality of our current First Lady. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you, and God bless America.\" "
"10" "\"<i>The President.</i> Let me begin by just saying you all dress up pretty nice. I hope everybody is having a wonderful time. Now, those of you who are in uniform, you look outstanding. Your dates do look better though. I just want to point this out. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, I'm not going to give a long speech. What I really want to do is come down and express the extraordinary gratitude not just of me as your Commander in Chief, but more importantly, the thanks of all the American people. <p>I want to start by thanking some of our outstanding leaders who are here: our hosts, our senior enlisted advisers from all five branches of our military. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Marty Dempsey, who promised to sing sometime tonight, so you should hold him to it. [<i>Laughter</i>] The Vice Chairman, Sandy Winnefeld, and all our outstanding members of the Joint Chiefs. Our Secretary of Veterans Affairs and Vietnam veteran, Ric Shinseki, who is here. <p>And we're honored to be joined by some truly extraordinary Americans, our wounded warriors, who inspire us with their incredible strength and resolve. Our enlisted men and women and junior officers: the backbone of our military. Our amazing military families, including the families of the fallen&mdash;our Gold Star families&mdash;we will stand with you always. <p>The members of the legendary Tuskegee Airmen in the house. And the recipients of our Nation's highest military decoration&mdash;the Medal of Honor&mdash;we are honored by your presence. <p>Today we experienced the majesty of our democracy, a ritual only possible in a form of government that is of and by and for the people, a day made possible because there are patriots like each and every one of you who defend our freedom every single day. <p>So this little party is just another way to say something we can never say enough: thank you. Thank you for volunteering. Thank you for stepping up. Thank you for keeping us strong. Thank you for always making us proud. I have no greater honor than being your Commander in Chief. <p>It's because of you that, with honor, we were able to end the war in Iraq, because of you that we delivered justice to Usama bin Laden, because of you that it's even possible to give Afghans a chance to determine their own destiny. We are going forward, and we'll keep our military the finest fighting force that the world has ever known. <p>Now, tonight we're also joined by some of our servicemembers in Afghanistan. They can't see us, but we can see them on this monitor. <p>Who we got there? General, are you there? Abe? <p><i>Maj. Gen. Robert B \\"Abe\\". Abrams, USA</i>. Sir, good evening. Mr. President, congratulations on your inauguration. It is Major General Abrams, commanding general of the 3d Infantry Division and Regional Command&mdash;South.

Congratulations, Mr. President. Sergeant First Class Orlando Jackson from Lake Charles, Louisiana, 3d Infantry Division, Falcon Brigade, Task Force Light Horse. I just wanted to congratulate you on a job well done. <p><i>Master Sgt. Robert Skowronski, USAF.</i> Mr. President, Master Sergeant Robert Skowronski, superintendent, 807th Expeditionary Air Support Operations Squadron, hailing from Detroit, Michigan. I want to say, go Tigers! <p><i>SFC David Wood, USA</i>. Good evening, Mr. President. My name is Sergeant First Class David Wood. I'm out of Monument, Colorado, 3d Infantry Division, Falcon Brigade, Task Force Light Horse. Thank you very much for having us here at your party. Congratulations. <p><i>Master Sgt. James Godlewski, USAF.</i> Good evening, Mr. President. Master Sergeant James Godlewski. I'm the operations superintendent, the 807th Expeditionary Air Support Operations Squadron and the world's greatest Air Force. I want to say congratulations on tonight. And you guys have a blessed evening. <p><i>Maj. Gen. Abrams</i>. Mr. President, we're honored to be able to join you tonight. And we've got one more thing for all of you there: Rock of the Marne! <p><i>The President.</i> [<i>Laughter</i>] Well, listen, to all of you who are there, we know it's tough being away from your families. We know the incredible sacrifices and challenges that you meet every single day. But I can tell you that you've got a room full of patriots here. And although I've got to admit that they're a little spiffied up right now&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;their heart and soul, their dedication, their sense of duty is at one with every single one of the folks who are in Kandahar right now. <p>And I want you to know that when I was standing on the steps of the Capitol today, looking out over close to a million people, the single biggest cheer that I always get&mdash;and today was no different at my Inauguration&mdash;was when I spoke about the extraordinary men and women in uniform that preserve our freedom and keep our country strong. So know that every single day we are thinking of you. <p>We're going to make sure that you've got the equipment, the strategy, the mission that allows you to succeed and keep our country safe. Know that we are going to be looking after and thinking about your families every single day and that when you get back home, you're going to be greeted by a grateful nation and that you will be on our minds tonight and every single night until our mission in Afghanistan is completed. <p>Can everybody please give our comrades-in-arms a huge round of applause? And please, all of you give our very best to your families back home, because I know it's just as tough, if not tougher, for them to see you in harm's way and away from the family. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you. <p>Now, there's one last thing I've got to do. I've got a date with me here. She inspires me every day. She makes me a better man and a better President. The fact that she is so devoted to taking care of our troops and our military families is just one more sign of her extraordinary love and grace and strength. I'm just lucky to have her. <p>I said today at the lunch over at the Congress that some may dispute the quality of our President, but nobody disputes the quality of our First Lady. <p>Ladies and gentlemen, my better half and my dance partner, Michelle Obama.\" "
"11" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! You all clean up pretty good. You are looking good. <p>Couple of acknowledgements I want to make. First of all, please give it up for DJ Mel Sandico. The U.S. Army Band is in the house. We're so proud; they can play anything, anything. Go ahead and make a request; they'll play it. They are outstanding. And we are so grateful for their service to our country each and every day. <p>Now, this is just a little gathering, little party, among friends. Represented here are our outstanding OFA staff and volunteers; our amazing PIC, that would be Presidential Inaugural Committee team. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> This has been a great Inauguration. They've done a great job. <p><i>The President.</i> Michelle just said, \\"this has been a great Inauguration,\\" and you've \\"done a great job.\\" <p>We've got the DNC convention team that did an amazing job. We've got the DNC team that did an amazing job. And we've got the White House team, which is pretty good. They did an amazing job. <p><i>Audience member.</i> And you! <p><i>The President.</i> I'm here too, that's true. And the First Lady of the United States, bangs and all, looking very sparkly and twinkly. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, I'm not going to speak long, mainly because I've been speaking a lot and you all have heard me before. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> And the entertainment is pretty good. <p><i>The President.</i> And, more importantly, we've got a couple of people, who are pretty good musicians, named Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett in the house. This is like my&mdash;Michelle is like doing interpretive dance of everything I say. It's been a long weekend; she's getting a little silly now. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But my main job here tonight is real simple, and it's just to say thank you. Some of you were involved the very first time I ran, back in 2007, 2008. Some of you were 14 at the time and so just got involved this time out. You know who you are. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> That's right. <p><i>The President.</i> But regardless of whether you got involved 6 years ago or you got involved 6 months ago, what is true is that all of you have come to represent for me and Michelle our deepest hopes for America. The average age here is probably around 20-something, and that's only because I'm here, which brings the average age up quite a bit. But when I think about traveling around the country during the course of the campaign and getting to know some of you and meeting some of you and seeing the work you do in the White House&mdash;or the work that you did during the convention&mdash;and I meet young people who are so much smarter and more thoughtful and more caring about the future than I ever was at your age, so much more capable, so much more serious, so much more poised, it makes me know that America's future is in good hands. <p>As long as all of you understand the immense and incredible power that you possess when you work together, when you join voices, when you extend yourselves not just on behalf of your own ambitions, but on behalf of a larger cause, you cannot be stopped. And part of the reason I know that America will succeed is when I look at how you work together&mdash;what I saw in offices from Vegas to Richmond, to Colorado Springs, to Manchester, New Hampshire, to Orlando, Florida, it didn't matter&mdash;&mdash;it didn't matter where I was. I'd walk into a volunteer office, and what you saw was people from every walk of life&mdash;Black, White, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, young, gay, straight. It didn't matter where you came from. You came together with a mission in mind and a vision in mind. And you were willing to set aside whatever surface differences you had because you understood you were working on behalf of an America that was a little more just and a little more fair and a little more compassionate&mdash;and better stewards for our environment. <p>And seeing that kind of spirit operate day in, day out&mdash;no matter how hard the work, no matter how little you got paid, no matter how bad your candidate screwed up, it didn't matter, you just kept on going. And there were times during the course of this year where I might have gotten down, but you picked me back up. You lifted me up on your shoulders. And you said, yes, we know he's gotten kind of old and gray haired and we know sometimes he stumbles, but we are going to carry him across the finish line. Because this is not about him; this is about us; this is about America. This is about what we believe. This is about what our values are. This is what our ideals are all about. We are going to go out there and change America. That's what you did every single day. And so this weekend belonged to you&mdash;to you. <p>So my final message, because I'm already breaking my promise, I said I wasn't going to talk, is to say that you can't stop now. I know some of you got to go back to school. I know some of your parents are all like, okay, you did your own little thing, but now you've got to go back and get your degree. I know some of you've got some rent to pay, so you've got to&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Some loans. <p><i>The President. &mdash;</i>&mdash;get some loans to repay. You may be making a whole range of career choices and decisions right now. And look, not all of you will end up staying in politics. Not all of you will end up pursuing professionally public service. But every single one of you, in your communities, in your neighborhoods, in your workplaces, wherever you decide to put down roots, wherever you decide to make a difference, as long as you retain that spirit that you've shown during the course of these campaigns&mdash;the idea that you're a citizen, that America only works when you make it work, that you have the power to move this country and, as a consequence, the world&mdash;if you retain that sense and never lose it, then I tell you, not only is America going to be in good hands, but what's going to happen is you're going to influence your peers and your friends and the folks you live next to and your neighbors and people in your workplace. And suddenly, like Robert Kennedy described, you're like a stone thrown in a pool, and it starts rippling out. And you don't know where those ripples are going to go, and that's the future that I see for you. <p>I know that every single person here donated $10 to a memorial on behalf of Alex Okrent Memorial. And Alex was one of you: This incredibly thoughtful, talented, compassionate, caring young person, who decided to get involved because he thought he could make a difference. And tragically, he ended up leaving us while working in the campaign. Some of the people here were there when it happened. And it was heartbreaking, and it reminded us of how precious our time on this Earth is. <p>We don't have a lot of time. I know when you're young it seems like it goes on forever. It turns out things are fragile. And yet, the thing that outlives each of us is what we do for somebody else, what difference did we make. And we know Alex made a difference. And so his impact outlives him. And that means&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member</i>s. [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p>That's all right. Somebody is over there, and they've probably fainted because they've been standing too long. Many of you have been at rallies&mdash;there's one over here. We've got EMS folks here. People, bend your knees while you're here. [<i>Laughter</i>] And try to get hydrated as well. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> You know, you've got to drink some water! <p><i>The President.</i> Drink water is what I mean. Juice is okay too. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But in the same way that Alex left this indelible mark on my life, Michelle's life, and many of your lives, you will leave an indelible mark as well, as long as you decide that you're going to spend your life giving something back. <p>You've already given me an incredible gift. You've given America an incredible gift. Don't stop. Keep on going. Don't stop. Stay fired up. <p>Are you fired up? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Fired up! <p><i>The President.</i> Are you ready to go? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Ready to go! <p><i>The President.</i> Fired up? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Fired up! <p><i>The President.</i> Ready to go? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Ready to go! <p><i>The President.</i> I think Lady Gaga is fired up too. <p>God bless you, guys! I love you! Thank you! God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"12" "\"Hi, everybody. Here in America, we know the free market is the greatest force for economic progress the world has ever known. But we also know the free market works best for everybody when we have smart, commonsense rules in place to prevent irresponsible behavior. <p>That's why we passed tough reforms to protect consumers and our financial system from the kind of abuse that nearly brought our economy to its knees. And that's why we've taken steps to end taxpayer-funded bailouts and make sure businesses and individuals who do the right thing aren't undermined by those who don't. <p>But it's not enough to change the law, we also need cops on the beat to enforce the law. And that's why, on Thursday, I nominated Mary Jo White to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission and Richard Cordray to continue leading the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. <p>Mary Jo White has decades of experience cracking down on white-collar criminals and bringing mobsters and terrorists to justice. At the SEC, she will help complete the task of reforming Wall Street and keep going after irresponsible behavior in the financial industry so that taxpayers don't pay the price. <p>Richard Cordray is a champion for American consumers. After the Senate refused to allow Richard an up-or-down vote when I nominated him in 2011, I took action to appoint him on my own. And since then, he's helped protect Americans from predatory lenders, launched a \\"Know Before You Owe\\" campaign to help families make smart decisions about paying for college, and cracked down on credit card companies that charge hidden fees. But Richard's appointment runs out at the end of the year, and in order for him to stay on the job, the Senate needs to finally give him the vote he deserves. <p>As President, my top priority is simple: to do everything in my power to fight for middle class families and give every American the tools they need to reach the middle class. <p>That means bringing in people like Mary Jo and Richard whose job it is to stand up for you. It means encouraging businesses to create more jobs and pay higher wages and improving education and job training so that more people can get the skills that businesses are looking for. It means reforming our immigration system and keeping our children safe from the menace of gun violence. And it means bringing down our deficit in a balanced way by making necessary reforms and asking every American to pay their fair share. <p>I am honored and humbled to continue to serve as your President. And I'm more hopeful than ever that 4 years from now, with your help, this country will be more prosperous, more open, and more committed to the principles on which we were founded. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"13" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat. Well, today I am honored to welcome a little up-and-coming basketball team&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;to the White House called the world champion Miami Heat. <p>Now, for many of teams that come here, this is a lot of cameras in one place. It's a little overwhelming. [<i>Laughter</i>] But for the Heat, this is what practice looks like. [<i>Laughter</i>] This is normal. I know this is the first trip for some of these players, but a few of them were here a couple of years ago for a pickup game on my birthday. <p>Now, I'm not trying to take all the credit, Coach, but I think that it's clear that going up against me prepared them to take on Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook. [<i>Laughter</i>] It sharpened their skills. It gave them the competitive edge that they needed. And I think part of the reason they came back today is they want another shot at the old guy. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But first, I have to congratulate the Heat on their well-earned title. This team traveled a long road to get to where they are. In 2011, the Heat got all the way to the finals only to come up short. But when you fall, the real test is whether you can ignore the naysayers, pick yourself up, and come back stronger. And that's true in basketball, but it's also true in life. That's exactly what these guys did. <p>Instead of getting down, they got better. Dwyane Wade worked on his core. LeBron learned some post moves from Hakeem. Shane Battier came on board. They became a more complete team. They got to know each other better and trust each other more. And they became more fun to watch. <p>In game four against the Thunder last year, we saw LeBron carried off the floor with cramps, only to come back a few minutes later and hit a dagger of a 3-pointer to put the Heat ahead. During game six, we saw him pull off one of the greatest performances in basketball playoff history, dropping 45 points, and he had a scary look in his eye. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We saw Dwyane Wade, the heart and soul of this team, continue to do whatever it takes to win, including leading the team in blocks. And at the postgame press conferences, he dressed well enough to land himself in GQ magazine. [<i>Laughter</i>] Show them your kicks here, Dwyane. [<i>Laughter</i>] If any of you can pull this off&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;other than Dwyane Wade, let me know. We saw Chris Bosh get injured, but get healthy right at the perfect time and do outstanding work throughout the rest of the playoffs. <p>And it wasn't just the Big Three. Mike Miller could barely walk. Mike, you look better now. [<i>Laughter</i>] You looked broke down last year&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but still hit seven 3-pointers in the final game. I don't know how he did it because he could not walk. He looked like an old man. [<i>Laughter</i>] Mario Chalmers earned himself a nickname from Dwyane Wade that I'm not allowed to repeat. [<i>Laughter</i>] But he did a great job. <p>Shane Battier, as always, played impeccable defense, hit big threes. Juwan Howard&mdash;Grandpa&mdash;became the first member of the Fab Five to win a ring. And Coach continually set the tone and kept these guys motivated the entire way. <p>So that team mentality&mdash;with everybody doing their part&mdash;is what finally put the Heat over the top. And it's especially impressive when you think about everything they've had to deal with over the last few years. This team inspired a lot of passions on both sides. And I'm just talking about their dance moves now. [<i>Laughter</i>] We saw that video, LeBron. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But even though I'm a little disappointed that the Bulls didn't make it, I do want to congratulate the Heat for a well-earned championship. LeBron said, \\"It's about damn time.\\" And I want to thank them for taking the time this afternoon to spend with wounded warriors at Walter Reed, because you guys are heroes to them, but they are heroes to all of us. <p>And let me just say one last thing about these guys, and I mentioned this as we were coming in. Now, there's a lot of focus on what happens on the court, but what's also important is what happens off the court. And I don't know all these guys, but I do know LeBron and Dwyane and Chris. And one of the things I'm proudest of is that they take their roles as fathers seriously. And for all the young men out there who are looking up to them all the time, for them to see somebody who cares about their kids and is there for them day in, day out, that's a good message to send. It's a positive message to send, and we're very proud of them for that. So the&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>So congratulations again to the Miami Heat. And now we are going to take a picture that makes me look very short. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm accustomed to it, but first I'm going to ask Coach to say a few words. Thank you, Coach. <p><i>Head Coach Erik Spoelstra.</i> Well, on behalf of Micky Arison, Pat Riley, the entire Miami Heat organization, and our families, we want to thank you for your hospitality today to be in the White House and also to be inspired by the great men and women of the Walter Reed Hospital. We are honored and truly, truly humbled to be here. <p>Because we actually hope that this team serves as an inspiration to the Nation of what a group can do when you come together and sacrifice your egos for a greater goal, to come together with a real hardhat work ethic, and to be able to persevere through adversity and a whole heck of a lot of criticism&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and still be able to accomplish the ultimate dream. <p><i>The President.</i> Fantastic. Thank you so much. <p><i>Forward LeBron James.</i> Am I supposed to say something? <p><i>The President.</i> Hey, you can if you want. It's your world, man. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Mr. James.</i> I mean, on behalf of myself and my teammates, we just want to thank you&mdash;to piggyback what Spo' said&mdash;for the hospitality, for allowing us to be, I mean, in the White House. I mean, we're in the White House. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean&mdash;and Coach said&mdash;and the Prez said this real casual. So I mean, we're kids from Chicago and Dallas, Texas and Michigan and Ohio and South Dakota&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;Miami. I mean&mdash;and we're in the White House right now. This is like, \\"Hey, mama, I made it.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Guard Dwyane Wade.</i> All I've got to say is, we've got a 10-day contract left? <p><i>The President.</i> Yes. <p><i>Mr. Wade.</i> Pick my man up. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> You guys could use a shooter. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Mr. Wade.</i> My point guard. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. Thank you. All right.\" "
"14" "\"Well, Vice President Biden and I just want to thank the police chiefs and sheriffs who are here today representing law enforcement officials all across the country who obviously share our deep concern about issues of gun safety and how we can protect our communities and keep our kids safe. <p>A couple of weeks ago, I appeared along with Joe to present the administration's ideas in terms of steps that we have to take. And I issued a number of executive actions that can&mdash;could be taken unilaterally in order to improve our collection of data, to make sure that we're coordinating more effectively with State and local governments, and to do everything that we could to improve the issue of gun safety and to make our communities safer. <p>But as we've indicated before, the only way that we're going to be able to do everything that needs to be done is with the cooperation of Congress. And that means passing serious laws that restrict the access and availability of assault weapons and magazine clips that aren't necessary for hunters and sportsmen and those who&mdash;responsible gun owners who are out there. It means that we are serious about universal background checks. It means that we take seriously issues of mental health and school safety. <p>We recognize that this is an issue that elicits a lot of passion all across the country. And Joe and my Cabinet members who have been involved in this have been on a listening session over the last several months. No group is more important for us to listen to than our law enforcement officials. They are where the rubber hits the road. <p>And so I welcome this opportunity to work with them, to hear their views in terms of what will make the biggest difference to prevent something like Newtown or Oak Creek from happening again. But many of them also recognize that it's not only the high-profile mass shootings that are of concern here, it's also what happens on a day-in-day-out basis in places like Chicago or Philadelphia, where young people are victims of gun violence every single day. That's why part of the conversation that we're going to be having today relates not only to the issue of new laws or better enforcement of our gun laws, it also means what are we doing to make sure that we've got the strongest possible law enforcement teams on the ground? What are we doing to hire more cops? What are we doing to make sure that they're getting the training that they need? What are we doing to make sure our sheriff's offices in rural counties have access to some of the resources that some of the big cities do in order to deal with some of these emergencies? <p>So I'm looking forward to a robust conversation. I know that this is not a shy group, mainly because they're dealing with life-and-death situations every single day. But I'm very grateful to them for their participation. This is a representative group. It comes from a wide cross-section of communities across the country. And hopefully, if law enforcement officials who are dealing with this stuff every single day can come to some basic consensus in terms of steps that we need to take, Congress is going to be paying attention to them and we'll be able to make progress. <p>All right? Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"15" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you so much. Well, it is good to be back in Las Vegas! And it is good to be among so many good friends. <p>Let me start off by thanking everybody at Del Sol High School for hosting us. Go Dragons! Let me especially thank your outstanding principal, Lisa Primas. <p>There are all kinds of notable guests here, but I just want to mention a few. First of all, our outstanding Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano is here. Our wonderful Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar; former Secretary of Labor, Hilda Solis. Two of the outstanding Members of the congressional delegation from Nevada, Steve Horsford and Dina Titus; your own mayor, Carolyn Goodman. <p>But we also have some mayors that flew in because they know how important the issue we're going to talk about today is: Marie Lopez Rogers from Avondale, Arizona; Kasim Reed from Atlanta, Georgia; Greg Stanton from Phoenix, Arizona; and Ashley Swearengin from Fresno, California. <p>And all of you are here, as well as some of the top labor leaders in the country. And we are just so grateful. Some outstanding business leaders are here as well. And of course, we've got wonderful students here, so I could not be prouder of our students. <p>Now, those of you have a seat, feel free to take a seat. I don't mind. <p><i>Audience member.</i> I love you, Mr. President! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. <p>Now, last week, I had the honor of being sworn in for a second term as President of the United States. And during my Inaugural Address, I talked about how making progress on the defining challenges of our time doesn't require us to settle every debate or ignore every difference that we may have, but it does require us to find common ground and move forward in common purpose. It requires us to act. <p>I know that some issues will be harder to lift than others. Some debates will be more contentious. That's to be expected. But the reason I came here today is because of a challenge where the differences are dwindling, where a broad consensus is emerging, and where a call for action can now be heard coming from all across America. I'm here today because the time has come for commonsense, comprehensive immigration reform. The time is now. [<i>Applause</i>] Now is the time. Now is the time. Now is the time. <p><i>Audience members.</i> <i>Si se puede! Si se puede! Si se puede! </i><p><i>The President.</i> Now is the time. <p>I'm here because most Americans agree that it's time to fix a system that's been broken for way too long. I'm here because business leaders, faith leaders, labor leaders, law enforcement, and leaders from both parties are coming together to say now is the time to find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as the land of opportunity. Now is the time to do this so we can strengthen our economy and strengthen our country's future. <p>Think about it: We define ourselves as a nation of immigrants. That's who we are in our bones. The promise we see in those who come here from every corner of the globe, that's always been one of our greatest strengths. It keeps our workforce young. It keeps our country on the cutting edge. And it's helped build the greatest economic engine the world has ever known. <p>After all, immigrants helped start businesses like Google and Yahoo. They created entire new industries that, in turn, created new jobs and new prosperity for our citizens. In recent years, one in four high-tech startups in America were founded by immigrants. One in four new small-business owners were immigrants, including right here in Nevada: folks who came here seeking opportunity and now want to share that opportunity with other Americans. <p>But we all know that today, we have an immigration system that's out of date and badly broken; a system that's holding us back instead of helping us grow our economy and strengthen our middle class. <p>Right now we have 11 million undocumented immigrants in America; 11 million men and women from all over the world who live their lives in the shadows. Yes, they broke the rules. They crossed the border illegally. Maybe they overstayed their visas. Those are the facts. Nobody disputes them. But these 11 million men and women are now here. Many of them have been here for years. And the overwhelming majority of these individuals aren't looking for any trouble. They're contributing members of the community. They're looking out for their families. They're looking out for their neighbors. They're woven into the fabric of our lives. <p>Every day, like the rest of us, they go out and try to earn a living. Often, they do that in a shadow economy, a place where employers may offer them less than the minimum wage or make them work overtime without extra pay. And when that happens, it's not just bad for them, it's bad for the entire economy. Because all the businesses that are trying to do the right thing&mdash;that are hiring people legally, paying a decent wage, following the rules&mdash;they're the ones who suffer. They've got to compete against companies that are breaking the rules. And the wages and working conditions of American workers are threatened too. <p>So if we're truly committed to strengthening our middle class and providing more ladders of opportunity to those who are willing to work hard to make it into the middle class, we've got to fix the system. <p>We have to make sure that every business and every worker in America is playing by the same set of rules. We have to bring this shadow economy into the light so that everybody is held accountable: businesses for who they hire and immigrants for getting on the right side of the law. That's common sense. And that's why we need comprehensive immigration reform. <p>And&mdash;now, there's another economic reason why we need reform. It's not just about the folks who come here illegally and have the effect they have on our economy. It's also about the folks who try to come here legally but have a hard time doing so and the effect that has on our economy. <p>Right now there are brilliant students from all over the world sitting in classrooms at our top universities. They're earning degrees in the fields of the future, like engineering and computer science. But once they finish school, once they earn that diploma, there's a good chance they'll have to leave our country. Now, think about that. <p>Intel was started with the help of an immigrant who studied here and then stayed here. Instagram was started with the help of an immigrant who studied here and then stayed here. Right now in one of those classrooms, there's a student wrestling with how to turn their big idea&mdash;their Intel or Instagram&mdash;into a big business. We're giving them all the skills they need to figure that out, but then we're going to turn around and tell them to start that business and create those jobs in China or India or Mexico or someplace else. That's not how you grow new industries in America. That's how you give new industries to our competitors. That's why we need comprehensive immigration reform. <p>Now, now during my first term, we took steps to try and patch up some of the worst cracks in the system. <p>First, we strengthened security at the borders so that we could finally stem the tide of illegal immigrants. We put more boots on the ground on the southern border than at any time in our history. And today, illegal crossings are down nearly 80 percent from their peak in 2000. <p>Second, we focused our enforcement efforts on criminals who are here illegally and who endanger our communities. And today, deportations of criminals is at its highest level ever. <p>And third, we took up the cause of the dreamers: the young people who were brought to this country as children, young people who have grown up here, built their lives here, have futures here. We said that if you're able to meet some basic criteria, like pursuing an education, then we'll consider offering you the chance to come out of the shadows so that you can live here and work here legally, so that you can finally have the dignity of knowing you belong. <p>But because this change isn't permanent, we need Congress to act, and not just on the \\"DREAM Act.\\" We need Congress to act on a comprehensive approach that finally deals with the 11 million undocumented immigrants who are in the country right now. That's what we need. <p>Now, the good news is that for the first time in many years, Republicans and Democrats seem ready to tackle this problem together. Members of both parties, in both Chambers, are actively working on a solution. Yesterday a bipartisan group of Senators announced their principles for comprehensive immigration reform, which are very much in line with the principles I've proposed and campaigned on for the last few years. So at this moment, it looks like there's a genuine desire to get this done soon, and that's very encouraging. <p>But this time, action must follow. We can't allow immigration reform to get bogged down in an endless debate. We've been debating this a very long time. So it's not as if we don't know technically what needs to get done. As a consequence, to help move this process along, today I'm laying out my ideas for immigration reform. And my hope is that this provides some key markers to Members of Congress as they craft a bill, because the ideas I'm proposing have traditionally been supported by both Democrats like Ted Kennedy and Republicans like President George W. Bush. You don't get that matchup very often. [<i>Laughter</i>] So we know where the consensus should be. <p>Now, of course, there will be rigorous debate about many of the details, and every stakeholder should engage in real give and take in the process. But it's important for us to recognize that the foundation for bipartisan action is already in place. And if Congress is unable to move forward in a timely fashion, I will send up a bill based on my proposal and insist that they vote on it right away. <p>So the principles are pretty straightforward. There are a lot of details behind it. We're going to hand out a bunch of paper so that everybody will know exactly what we're talking about. But the principles are pretty straightforward. <p>First, I believe we need to stay focused on enforcement. That means continuing to strengthen security at our borders. It means cracking down more forcefully on businesses that knowingly hire undocumented workers. To be fair, most businesses want to do the right thing, but a lot of them have a hard time figuring out who's here legally, who's not. So we need to implement a national system that allows businesses to quickly and accurately verify someone's employment status. And if they still knowingly hire undocumented workers, then we need to ramp up the penalties. <p>Second, we have to deal with the 11 million individuals who are here illegally. We all agree that these men and women should have to earn their way to citizenship. But for comprehensive immigration reform to work, it must be clear from the outset that there is a pathway to citizenship. <p>We've got to lay out a path: a process that includes passing a background check, paying taxes, paying a penalty, learning English, and then going to the back of the line, behind all the folks who are trying to come here legally. That's only fair, right? <p>So that means it won't be a quick process, but it will be a fair process. And it will lift these individuals out of the shadows and give them a chance to earn their way to a green card and eventually to citizenship. <p>And the third principle is we've got to bring our legal immigration system into the 21st century because it no longer reflects the realities of our time. For example, if you are a citizen, you shouldn't have to wait years before your family is able to join you in America. You shouldn't have to wait years. <p>If you're a foreign student who wants to pursue a career in science or technology or a foreign entrepreneur who wants to start a business with the backing of American investors, we should help you do that here. Because if you succeed, you'll create American businesses and American jobs. You'll help us grow our economy. You'll help us strengthen our middle class. <p>So that's what comprehensive immigration reform looks like: smarter enforcement, a pathway to earned citizenship, improvements in the legal immigration system so that we continue to be a magnet for the best and the brightest all around the world. It's pretty straightforward. <p>The question now is simple: Do we have the resolve as a people, as a country, as a Government to finally put this issue behind us? I believe that we do. [<i>Applause</i>] I believe that we do. I believe we are finally at a moment where comprehensive immigration reform is within our grasp. <p>But I promise you this: The closer we get, the more emotional this debate is going to become. Immigration's always been an issue that enflames passions. That's not surprising. There are few things that are more important to us as a society than who gets to come here and call our country home, who gets the privilege of becoming a citizen of the United States of America. That's a big deal. <p>When we talk about that in the abstract, it's easy sometimes for the discussion to take on a feeling of us versus them And when that happens, a lot of folks forget that most of us used to be them. We forget that. <p>It's really important for us to remember our history. Unless you're one of the first Americans, a Native American, you came from someplace else. Somebody brought you. <p>Ken Salazar, he's of Mexican American descent, but he points that his family's been living where he lives for 400 years, so he didn't immigrate anywhere. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>The Irish who left behind a land of famine, the Germans who fled persecution, the Scandinavians who arrived eager to pioneer out west, the Polish, the Russians, the Italians, the Chinese, the Japanese, the West Indians, the huddled masses who came through Ellis Island on one coast and Angel Island on the other&mdash;all those folks, before they were us, they were them. <p>And when each new wave of immigrants arrived, they faced resistance from those who were already here. They faced hardship. They faced racism. They faced ridicule. But over time, as they went about their daily lives, as they earned a living, as they raised a family, as they built a community, as their kids went to school here, they did their part to build a nation. <p>They were the Einsteins and the Carnegies. But they were also the millions of women and men whose names history may not remember, but whose actions helped make us who we are, who built this country hand by hand, brick by brick. They all came here knowing that what makes somebody an American is not just blood or birth, but allegiance to our founding principles and the faith in the idea that anyone from anywhere can write the next great chapter of our story. <p>And that's still true today. Just ask Alan Aleman. Alan is here this afternoon; where is Alan? He's around here; there he is right here. Now, Alan was born in Mexico. He was brought to this country by his parents when he was a child. Growing up, Alan went to an American school, pledged allegiance to the American flag, felt American in every way. And he was, except for one: on paper. <p>In high school, Alan watched his friends come of age: driving around town with their new licenses, earning some extra cash from their summer jobs at the mall. He knew he couldn't do those things. But it didn't matter that much. What mattered to Alan was earning an education so that he could live up to his God-given potential. <p>Last year, when Alan heard the news that we were going to offer a chance for folks like him to emerge from the shadows&mdash;even if it's just for 2 years at a time&mdash;he was one of the first to sign up. And a few months ago, he was one of the first people in Nevada to get approved. In that moment, Alan said: \\"I felt the fear vanish. I felt accepted.\\" <p>So today, Alan's in his second year at the College of Southern Nevada. Alan is studying to become a doctor. He hopes to join the Air Force. He's working hard every single day to build a better life for himself and his family. And all he wants is the opportunity to do his part to build a better America. <p>So in the coming weeks, as the idea of reform becomes more real and the debate becomes more heated, and there are folks who are trying to pull this thing apart, remember Alan and all those who share the same hopes and the same dreams. Remember that this is not just a debate about policy. It's about people. It's about men and women and young people who want nothing more than the chance to earn their way into the American story. <p>And throughout our history, that has only made our Nation stronger. And it's how we will make sure that this century is the same as the last: an American century, welcoming of everybody who aspires to do something more and is willing to work hard to do it and is willing to pledge that allegiance to our flag. <p>Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.\" "
"16" "\"For nearly 2 years, the Asad regime has waged a brutal war against the Syrian people, murdering innocent men, women, and children in their homes, in bread lines, and at universities. In the face of this barbarism, the United States has joined with nations around the world in calling for an end to the Asad regime and a transition that leads to a peaceful, inclusive, and democratic Syria, where the rights of all Syrians are protected. We've worked to isolate Asad and his regime, impose sanctions that starve the regime of funds, recognize the Syrian opposition coalition as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people, call for accountability for perpetrators of atrocities, and provide humanitarian relief to Syrians in need. <p>The relief we send doesn't say \\"Made in America,\\" but make no mistake, our aid reflects the commitment of the American people. American aid means food and clean water for millions of Syrians. American aid means medicine and treatment for hundreds of thousands of patients in Damascus, Dara'a, and Homs. It means immunizations for 1 million Syrian children. American aid means winter supplies for more than half a million people in Aleppo, Homs, and Dayr az Zawr. And we're working with allies and partners so that this aid reaches those in need. <p>Today we're taking another step. I've approved an additional $155 million in humanitarian aid for people in Syria and refugees fleeing the violence. Here, I want to speak directly to the people of Syria. This new aid will mean more warm clothing for children and medicine for the elderly; flour and wheat for your families; and blankets, boots, and stoves for those huddled in damaged buildings. It will mean health care for victims of sexual violence and field hospitals for the wounded. Even as we work to end the violence against you, this aid will help address some of the immediate needs you face each day. <p>This new commitment will bring America's total humanitarian aid to Syria to $365 million, making us the largest single donor of humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people. Today I also call on the international community to do more to help these Syrians in need and to contribute to the latest U.N. humanitarian appeal. <p>We're under no illusions. The days ahead will continue to be very difficult. But what's clear is that the regime continues to weaken and lose control of territory. The opposition continues to grow stronger. More Syrians are standing up for their dignity. The Asad regime will come to an end. The Syrian people will have their chance to forge their own future. And they will continue to find a partner in the United States of America.\" "
"17" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you so much. Please, everyone have a seat. Well, it is my incredible pleasure and honor to welcome this incredibly talented group of men and women in the White House. And I want to congratulate them on earning America's highest honor for invention and discovery: the National Medals of Science and the National Medals of Technology and Innovation. <p>Before we start, I want to acknowledge the head of the National Science Foundation, Dr. Subra Suresh, as well as the members of my Cabinet who are with us here today. Where is everybody? Where did Subra go? [<i>Laughter</i>] There you go. All right, I just wanted to make sure they all showed up. <p>I especially want to thank Secretary Steven Chu, who announced this morning that he will be leaving the Department of Energy. That will be a loss for us. Steve has been a great friend, a tremendous colleague over the past 4 years, working on a whole range of energy issues, but also designing a cap to plug a hole in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico when nobody else could figure it out. And that's typical of the incredible contributions that he's made to this country. Because of his leadership, this country is further along on the path to energy independence. It's better positioned for the jobs and industries of the future. <p>So, Steve, you have earned more than your fair share of relaxation time, but we are grateful for your extraordinary service. So thank you. <p>Now, this is the most collection of brainpower we've had under this roof in a long time&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;maybe since the last time we gave out these medals. I have no way to prove that, and I know this crowd likes proof. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I can't imagine too many people competing with those who we honor here today. <p>If there is one idea that sets this country apart, one idea that makes us different from every other nation on Earth, it's that here in America, success does not depend on where you were born or what your last name is. Success depends on the ideas that you can dream up, the possibilities that you envision, and the hard work, the blood, sweat, and tears you're willing to put in to make them real. <p>We don't always recognize the genius behind these ideas right away. The New York Times once described Robert Goddard's belief that rockets could one day go to the Moon as, quote, \\"lacking the knowledge ladled out daily in high schools.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] One engineer called Einstein's brand-new theory of relativity \\"voodoo nonsense.\\" But with enough time, we usually come around. And we don't give folks the same treatment that Galileo got when he came up with new ideas. [<i>Laughter</i>] And today, it's clearer than ever that our future as a nation depends on keeping that spirit of curiosity and innovation alive in our time. <p>So these honorees are at the forefront of that mission. Thanks to the sacrifices they've made, the chances they've taken, the gallons of coffee they've consumed&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;we now have batteries that power everything from cell phones to electric cars. We have a map of the human genome and new ways to produce renewable energy. We're learning to grow organs in the lab and better understand what's happening in our deepest oceans. And if that's not enough, the people on this stage are also going to be responsible for devising a formula to tame frizzy hair&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;as well as inspiring the game Tetris. <p>But what also makes these individuals unique is how they've gotten here: the obstacles they've overcome and the commitments they've made to push the boundaries of our understanding. <p>Jim Gates's father, for example, was in the Army, and by the time Jim was in sixth grade, he had attended six different schools. But he still remembers the day he came home and saw his father standing on the porch with a big smile on his face. And that's how Jim knew he had gotten into MIT, on his way to becoming one of our foremost experts in supersymmetry and string theory. <p>When Gholam Peyman first accepted a position at the University of Illinois, his office was a converted restroom. [<i>Laughter</i>] But he carved out enough space for himself, his secretary, and his lab equipment. And today, he's known as the father of LASIK eye surgery. <p>Sandra Moore Faber had a passion for astronomy from the very beginning. But when she visited one of our Nation's top observatories as a grad student, they didn't have a dorm for female astronomers, so Sandra ended up sleeping on the sofa in the caretaker's cottage. Now, luckily, that didn't slow her down, and she became one of the world's foremost experts in the evolution of the universe. <p>You know, in a global economy where the best jobs follow talent&mdash;whether in Calcutta or Cleveland&mdash;we need to do everything we can to encourage that same kind of passion, make it easier for more young people to blaze a new trail. <p>Right now only about a third of undergraduate students are graduating with degrees in science, technology, engineering, and math, areas that will be crucial if we expect to complete the work that has been done by these folks and compete for the jobs of the future. And that's why we've worked to make more affordable college opportunities and set a goal of training 100,000 new math and science teachers over the next decade. And we're working to train 2 million Americans at our community colleges with the skills businesses are looking for right now. <p>We also need to do something about all the students who come here from around the world to study, but we then send home once they graduate. On Tuesday, I was in Las Vegas talking about the need for comprehensive immigration reform. And one important piece of that reform is allowing more of the best and brightest minds from around the world to start businesses, initiate new discoveries, create jobs here in the United States of America. If we want to grow our economy and strengthen the middle class, we need an immigration system built for the 21st century. It's that simple. <p>One of the scientists being honored today is Jan Vilcek. Jan was born in Slovakia to Jewish parents who fled the Nazis during World War II. To keep their young son safe, his parents placed him in an orphanage run by Catholic nuns. And later, he and his mother were taken in by some brave farmers in a remote Slovak village and hidden until the war was over. And today, Jan is a pioneer in the study of the immune system and the treatment of inflammatory diseases like arthritis. <p>People like Jan obviously had enormous talent. In some fundamental ways, they were destined to be on this stage. The minds they were born with, the drive they innately possess, the positive forces that shaped their lives were more powerful than the forces aligned against them. So they beat the odds. But even with all those gifts, every one of today's honorees also had somebody who offered them a hand: a teacher who sparked their interest, a scholarship that paved the way, and an opportunity to come to America and bring even the most distant dream within our reach. <p>And that reminds us of our obligations to each other and to this country. We can&mdash;no matter how many talented folks there are in this country, if we're not offering a hand up, a lot of those folks are going to miss out on what might be their destiny. We can make it easier for our young people to learn the skills of the future. We can attract the brightest minds to our shore. We can celebrate and lift up and spotlight researchers and scientists like the ones here today, so that somewhere, a boy on an Army base or a girl looking through a telescope or a young scientist working out of a converted bathroom can make it their goal to stand where these honorees will be standing when they receive their medals. <p>That's what we can do and that's what we must do. That's what I intend to do as long as I'm President. <p>So I want to congratulate these extraordinary Americans once again for all their accomplishments. I want to wish our military aides the best of luck as they attempt to read the citations. [<i>Laughter</i>] Because I can assure you they practiced hard on this all week long. <p>You good? You feel good? [<i>Laughter</i>] All right. There are a lot of syllables in some of these things. [<i>Laughter</i>] I won't know the difference, but they will. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Congratulations, everybody. <p>[<i>At this point, Lt. Cmdr. Scott Phy, USCG, Coast Guard Aide to the President, read the citations and the President presented the medals, assisted by Lt. Cmdr. Tiffany Hill, USN, Navy Aide to the President</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> That wasn't bad. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Well, again, I just want to congratulate all the honorees here today. Can everybody please give them one more big round of applause? [<i>Applause</i>] <p>We are so grateful to all of you. The incredible contributions that you've made have enhanced our lives in immeasurable ways, in ways that are practical, but also inspirational. <p>And so we know that you are going to continue to inspire and in many cases teach the next generation of inventors and scientists who will discover things that we can't even dream of at this point. So thank you so much for everything that you've done. <p>I hope that all of you enjoy this wonderful reception. Feel free to party here. [<i>Laughter</i>] This looks like a somewhat wild crowd. [<i>Laughter</i>] So just remember there are Secret Service here&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;if you guys get out of hand. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"18" "\"Hi, everybody. <p>In the coming weeks, we face some important decisions about how to pay down our debt in a way that grows our economy and creates good jobs, decisions that will make a real difference in the strength and pace of our recovery. <p>We began this year with economists and business leaders saying that we are poised to grow in 2013, and there are real signs of progress. Home prices are starting to climb again. Car sales are at a 5-year high. Manufacturing is roaring back. Our businesses created 2.2 million jobs last year. And we just learned that our economy created more jobs over the last few months than economists originally thought. <p>But this week, we also received the first estimate of America's economic growth over the last few months. And it reminded us that bad decisions in Washington can get in the way of our economic progress. <p>We all agree that it's critical to cut unnecessary spending. But we can't just cut our way to prosperity. It hasn't worked in the past, and it won't work today. It could slow down our recovery, it could weaken our economy, and it could cost us jobs, not just now, but in the future. <p>What we need instead is a balanced approach, an approach that says let's cut what we can't afford, but let's make the investments we can't afford to live without&mdash;investments in education, in infrastructure, research and development&mdash;the things that will help America compete for the best jobs and new industries. <p>Already, Republicans and Democrats have worked together to reduce our deficits by $2.5 trillion. That's a good start, but to get the rest of the way, we need a balanced set of reforms. <p>For example, we need to lower the cost of health care in programs like Medicare that are the biggest drivers of our deficit, without just passing the burden off to seniors. And these reforms must go hand-in-hand with eliminating excess spending in our Tax Code so that the wealthiest individuals and biggest corporations can't take advantage of loopholes and deductions that aren't available to most Americans. <p>Two-thousand-thirteen can be a year of solid growth, more jobs, and higher wages. But that will only happen if we put a stop to self-inflicted wounds in Washington. Everyone in Washington needs to focus not on politics, but on what's right for the country, on what's right for you and your families. That's how we'll get our economy growing faster, that's how we'll strengthen our middle class, and that's how we'll build a country that rewards the effort and determination of every single American. <p>Thanks. And have a great weekend.\" "
"19" "\"Hello, everybody. Please have a seat. Have a seat. <p>Well, it is good to be back in Minnesota. It is good to be back. Although I was commenting that they don't really have winter in Washington, DC. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I've gotten soft over these last 4 years. When I was in Chicago, this was nothing. Now it's something. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I'm grateful for all of you being here today. I want to thank Chief Harteau and the entire Minneapolis Police Department for having me here today. <p>There are a number of other people that I just want to acknowledge here. First of all, a wonderful man and one of America's greatest public servants is here: Walter Mondale, former Vice President. Your outstanding Governor, Mark Dayton, is here. Two great mayors: Mayor R.T. Rybak of Minneapolis and Mayor Chris Coleman of St. Paul. And your outstanding congressional delegation: Senator Amy Klobuchar, Senator Al Franken, Representative Keith Ellison, and Representative Betty McCollum. <p>And I should acknowledge my outstanding Attorney General-----what's your name again? [<i>Laughter</i>] He does a great job every single day, and I could not be prouder of Eric Holder for his leadership on this issue in particular. <p>Now, I just had a chance to sit down with some local police officers, but also community leaders, as well as folks who themselves had been victims or whose families had been victims of gun violence, to hear their ideas about how we can protect our kids and address the broader epidemic of gun violence in this country. Because if we're serious about preventing the kinds of tragedies that happened in Newtown or the tragedies that happen every day in places like Chicago or Philadelphia or Minneapolis, then law enforcement and other community leaders must have a seat at the table. <p>All the folks standing here behind me today, they're the ones on the front line of this fight. They see the awful consequences: the lives lost, the families shattered. They know what works, they know what doesn't work, and they know how to get things done without regard for politics. <p>So we've had a very productive discussion. And one of the things that struck me was that even though those who were sitting around that table represented very different communities, from big cities to small towns, they all believe it's time to take some basic, commonsense steps to reduce gun violence. We may not be able to prevent every massacre or random shooting. No law or set of laws can keep our children completely safe. But if there's even one thing we can do, if there's just one life we can save, we've got an obligation to try. <p>That's been the philosophy here in Minneapolis. A few years back, you suffered a spike in violent crime involving young people. So this city came together. You launched a series of youth initiatives that have reduced the number of young people injured by guns by 40 percent-----40 percent. So when it comes to protecting our children from gun violence, you've shown that progress is possible. We've still got to deal with the 60 percent that remains, but that 40 percent means lives saved, parents whose hearts aren't broken, communities that aren't terrorized and afraid. <p>We don't have to agree on everything to agree it's time to do something. That's my main message here today. <p>And each of us has a role to play. A few weeks ago, I took action on my own to strengthen background checks, to help schools get more resource officers if they want them, and to direct the Centers for Disease Control to study the causes of violence. Because for a long time, even looking at the evidence was considered somehow tough politics. And so Congress had taken the approach that we don't want to know. Well, that's never the answer to a problem, is not wanting to know what is going on. <p>So we've been able to take some steps through administrative action. But while these steps are important, real and lasting change also requires Congress to do its part and to do it soon, not to wait. The good news is that we're starting to see a consensus emerge about the action Congress needs to take. <p>The vast majority of Americans-----including a majority of gun owners-----support requiring criminal background checks for anyone trying to buy a gun. So right now Democrats and Republicans in the Senate are working on a bill that would ban anyone from selling a gun to somebody legally prohibited from owning one. That's common sense. There's no reason why we can't get that done. That is not a liberal idea or a conservative idea, it's not a Democratic or Republican idea, that is a smart idea. We want to keep those guns out of hands of folks who shouldn't have them. <p>Senators from both parties have also come together and proposed a bill that would crack down on people who buy guns only to turn them around and sell them to criminals. It's a bill that would keep more guns off the street and out of the hands of people with the intent of doing harm. <p>And by the way, in addition to reducing violence on the streets, it would also make life a lot easier and a lot safer for the people standing behind me here today. <p>We shouldn't stop there. We should restore the ban on military-style assault weapons and a 10-round limit for magazines. And that deserves a vote in Congress, because weapons of war have no place on our streets or in our schools or threatening our law enforcement officers. Our law enforcement officers should never be outgunned on the streets. <p>But we also know that if we're going to solve the problem of gun violence, then we've got to look at root causes as well. That means we should make it easier for young people to get access to mental health treatment. We should help communities like this one keep more cops on the beat. And since Congress hasn't confirmed a director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in 6 years, they should confirm your U.S. Attorney from Minnesota, Todd Jones, who is here today and who I've nominated for this post. <p>These are commonsense measures supported by Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, and many of them are responsible gun owners. And we're seeing Members of Congress from both parties put aside their differences and work together to make many of them a reality. <p>But if there's one thing that I've learned over the last 4 years, it's that you can't count on anything in Washington until it's done. And nothing is done yet. There's been a lot of talk, a lot of conversation, a lot of publicity, but we haven't actually taken concrete steps yet. <p>Last week, the Senate held its first hearing since Newtown on the need to address gun violence and the best way to move forward, and the first people to offer testimony were Gabby Giffords and her husband Mark Kelly. They talked about how a complex problem like this has no single solution, but if we still had a 10-round limit on magazines, for example, the gunman who shot Gabby may never have been able to inflict 33 gunshot wounds in 15 seconds. Fifteen seconds, 33 rounds fired. Some of the six people who lost their lives that day in Tucson might still be with us. <p>Now, changing the status quo is never easy; this will be no exception. The only way we can reduce gun violence in this country is if the American people decide it's important. If you decide it's important. If parents and teachers, police officers and pastors, hunters and sportsmen, Americans of every background stand up and say this time it's got to be different, we've suffered too much pain to stand by and do nothing. <p>And by the way, it's really important for us to engage with folks who don't agree with us on everything, because we hope that we can find some areas where we do agree. And we have to recognize that there are going to be regional differences and geographic differences. The experience that people have of guns in an urban neighborhood may not be the same as in a rural community. <p>But we know, for example, from polling that universal background checks are universally supported, just about, by gun owners. The majority of gun owners, overwhelming majority of gun owners, think that's a good idea. So if we've got lobbyists in Washington claiming to speak for gun owners saying something different, we need to go to the source and reach out to people directly. We can't allow those filters to get in the way of common sense. <p>That's why I need everybody who's listening to keep the pressure on your Member of Congress to do the right thing. Ask them if they support commonsense reforms like requiring universal background checks or restoring the ban on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Tell them there's no legislation to eliminate all guns, there's no legislation being proposed to subvert the Second Amendment. Tell them specifically what we're talking about, things that the majority of Americans, when they're asked, support. And tell them now is the time for action. That we're not going to wait until the next Newtown or the next Aurora. We're not going to wait until after we lose more innocent Americans on street corners all across the country. We're not going to wait until somebody else's father or son are murdered. <p>Some of the officers here today know what it's like to look into the eyes of a parent or a grandparent, a brother or a sister who has just lost a loved one to an act of violence; to see the pain and the heartbreak from wondering why this precious life, this piece of your heart was in the wrong place at the wrong time. It changes you. You're not the same afterwards. <p>And obviously, whatever that experience is like is nothing compared to the experience that those families are actually going through. And it makes you realize that if there's even one thing we can do to keep our children and our community safe, if there's just one step we can take to prevent more families from feeling what they feel after they've lost a loved one, we've got an obligation to take that step. We've got an obligation to give our police officers and our communities the tools they need to make some of the same progress that's been made here in Minneapolis. <p>There won't be perfect solutions. We're not going to save every life. But we can make a difference. And that's our responsibility as Americans. And that's what I'll do every single day as long I've got the honor of serving as your President. <p>So thank you. God bless you. God bless these United States of America. Thank you.\" "
"20" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. <p>I wanted to say a few words about the looming deadlines and decisions that we face on our budget and on our deficit, and these are decisions that will have real and lasting impacts on the strength and pace of our recovery. <p>Economists and business leaders from across the spectrum have said that our economy is poised for progress in 2013. And we've seen signs of this progress over the last several weeks. Home prices continue to climb. Car sales are at a 5-year high. Manufacturing has been strong. And we've created more than 6 million jobs in the last 35 months. <p>But we've also seen the effects that political dysfunction can have on our economic progress. The drawn-out process for resolving the fiscal cliff hurt consumer confidence. The threat of massive automatic cuts have already started to affect business decisions. So we've been reminded that while it's critical for us to cut wasteful spending, we can't just cut our way to prosperity. Deep, indiscriminate cuts to things like education and training, energy and national security will cost us jobs, and it will slow down our recovery. It's not the right thing to do for the economy; it's not the right thing for folks who are out there still looking for work. <p>And the good news is this doesn't have to happen. For all the drama and disagreements that we've had over the past few years, Democrats and Republicans have still been able to come together and cut the deficit by more than $2.5 trillion through a mix of spending cuts and higher rates on taxes for the wealthy. A balanced approach has achieved more than $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction. That's more than halfway towards the $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists and elected officials from both parties believe is required to stabilize our debt. So we've made progress. And I still believe that we can finish the job with a balanced mix of spending cuts and more tax reform. <p>The proposals that I put forward during the fiscal cliff negotiations in discussions with Speaker Boehner and others are still very much on the table. I just want to repeat: The deals that I put forward, the balanced approach of spending cuts and entitlement reform and tax reform that I put forward are still on the table. <p>I've offered sensible reforms to Medicare and other entitlements, and my health care proposals achieve the same amount of savings by the beginning of the next decade as the reforms that have been proposed by the bipartisan Bowles-Simpson fiscal commission. These reforms would reduce our Government's bill&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>] <p>[<i>At this point, there was a loud crash.</i>] <p>What's up, cameraman? [<i>Laughter</i>] Come on, guys. [<i>Laughter</i>] They're breaking my flow all the time. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>These reforms would reduce our Government's bills by reducing the cost of health care, not shifting all those costs on to middle class seniors or the working poor or children with disabilities, but nevertheless, achieving the kinds of savings that we're looking for. <p>But in order to achieve the full $4 trillion in deficit reductions that is the stated goal of economists and our elected leaders, these modest reforms in our social insurance programs have to go hand-in-hand with a process of tax reform so that the wealthiest individuals and corporations can't take advantage of loopholes and deductions that aren't available to most Americans. <p>Leaders in both parties have already identified the need to get rid of these loopholes and deductions. There's no reason why we should keep them at a time when we're trying to cut down on our deficit. And if we are going to close these loopholes, then there's no reason we should use the savings that we obtain and turn around and spend that on new tax breaks for the wealthiest or for corporations. If we're serious about paying down the deficit, the savings we achieve from tax reform should be used to pay down the deficit and, potentially, to make our businesses more competitive. <p>Now, I think this balanced mix of spending cuts and tax reform is the best way to finish the job of deficit reduction. The overwhelming majority of the American people&mdash;Democrats and Republicans, as well as Independents&mdash;have the same view. And both the House and the Senate are working towards budget proposals that I hope reflect this balanced approach. Having said that, I know that a full budget may not be finished before March 1, and unfortunately, that's the date when a series of harmful automatic cuts to job-creating investments and defense spending&mdash;also known as the sequester&mdash;are scheduled to take effect. <p>So if Congress can't act immediately on a bigger package, if they can't get a bigger package done by the time the sequester is scheduled to go into effect, then I believe that they should at least pass a smaller package of spending cuts and tax reforms that would delay the economically damaging effects of the sequester for a few more months until Congress finds a way to replace these cuts with a smarter solution. <p>There is no reason that the jobs of thousands of Americans who work in national security or education or clean energy, not to mention the growth of the entire economy should be put in jeopardy just because folks in Washington couldn't come together to eliminate a few special interest tax loopholes or Government programs that we agree need some reform. <p>Congress is already working towards a budget that would permanently replace the sequester. At the very least, we should give them the chance to come up with this budget instead of making indiscriminate cuts now that will cost us jobs and significantly slow down our recovery. <p>So let me just repeat: Our economy right now is headed in the right direction, and it will stay that way as long as there aren't any more self-inflicted wounds coming out of Washington. So let's keep on chipping away at this problem together, as Democrats and Republicans, to give our workers and our businesses the support that they need to thrive in the weeks and months ahead. <p>Thanks very much. And I know that you're going to have a whole bunch of other questions. And that's why I hired this guy, Jay Carney&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;to take those questions.  <p>Thank you, everybody.\" "
"21" "\"Thank you, everybody. Please have a seat. Xavier, thank you for that very gracious introduction and your outstanding leadership. <p>Let me begin by saying that I could not be happier that one of my most important friends and partners is still leading our Democrats in the House of Representatives. I love Nancy Pelosi. Give her a big round of applause. Love Nancy Pelosi. Also, she just generates good-looking grandbabies. [<i>Laughter</i>] They're all so handsome and sharp and beautiful. <p>To Steny Hoyer and Jim Clyburn, as well as Xavier and Joe Crowley, thank you so much for the great work that you guys are doing each and every day. And to Steve Israel, who worked tirelessly to bring on 49 new outstanding members of this caucus. I am looking forward to spending time with all 49 of you. And hopefully, we'll be seeing you over at the White House and at various events, but obviously, I know that you came here to get something done. And I am looking forward to working with you every single day to make sure that we're doing right by the people who sent us here. <p>Now, I actually just changed the format here. I called an audible, because originally, the way this was scheduled was I was just going to talk and then I was going to shake some hands, and I thought, since this is not a shy bunch, it might make sense for me to take some questions and some advice I'm sure you guys have for me. [<i>Laughter</i>] So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to make s few points at the top, and then what I'd like is maybe Xavier or Steve or somebody can come up here, you can call on folks, and we'll spend a little time with Q-and-A before I get a chance to say hello to everybody. <p>And part of the reason I want to keep my remarks short is because I just made a pretty long speech a couple of weeks ago, and I'm about to make another one next week, and I don't want you guys tired of me. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But obviously, I'm deeply grateful to have been reelected, and I'm humbled by the support that I received from all across the country. And I said at the National Prayer Breakfast this morning&mdash;and I was telling the truth&mdash;I genuinely am humbled. The fascinating thing about this job is the longer you're in it, the more humble you get and the more you recognize your own imperfections. And you try to make up with effort and hard work those gaps in your personality or your intelligence that become so apparent to everybody on the daily news every day. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But even as I think it's important to be humbled by the privilege of this office and the privilege of serving in the United States Congress, even as it's important not to read too much into any particular political victory&mdash;because this country is big, it is diverse, it is contentious, and we don't have a monopoly on wisdom, and we need to remember that&mdash;despite all those things, I think it's also important for us to feel confident and bold about the values we care about and what we stand for. <p>And I tried to do that in my Inauguration speech, and I'm hoping that we all do that over the next 4 years. Because when I think about what it means to be a Democrat in this day and age, I start with the basic proposition that we are all created equal, that we're all endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights. And my governing philosophy and my interest in public service grows out of how we make that Union more perfect for more people, day in, day out. <p>And that starts with an economy that works for everybody. Throughout my campaign, and throughout many of your campaigns, we talked about this bedrock notion that our economy succeeds and our economy grows when everybody is getting a fair shot and everybody is getting a fair shake and everybody is playing by the same rules. That we have an economy in which we're growing a vibrant middle class; that it grows from the middle out and the bottom up, not from the top down. <p>And over the next 4 years, as I work with this caucus and every caucus, the question I will ask myself on every item, every issue is, is this helping to make sure that everybody has got a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same rules. Because I believe that is a growth agenda&mdash;not just an equity agenda, not just a fairness agenda&mdash;that is a growth agenda. That is when we have grown fastest. <p>And that means that what you'll hear from me next week, I'm going to be talking about making sure that we're focused on job creation here in the United States of America. It means that we're focused on education and that every young person is equipped with the skills they need to compete in the 21st century. It means that we've got an energy agenda that can make us less dependent on foreign oil, but also that we're cultivating the kind of clean energy strategy that will maintain our leadership well into the future. <p>It means that we're going to talk about, yes, deficits and taxes and sequesters and potential Government shutdowns and debt ceiling. We'll talk about that stuff, but all from the perspective of how are we making sure that somebody who works hard in this country&mdash;a cop or a teacher or a construction worker or a receptionist&mdash;that they can make it if they work hard and that their kids can make it and dream even bigger dreams than they have achieved. <p>And obviously, a lot of what we'll be working on initially over the next few weeks is going to be on how do we deal with the sequester issue. And I just want to make this quick point. I had a press conference this week in which I reiterated, I am prepared, eager, and anxious to do a big deal, a big package that ends this governance by crisis, where every 2 weeks or every 2 months or every 6 months, we are threatening this hard-won recovery, where finally housing is starting to pick up, and commercial real estate is starting to do better, and the unemployment numbers are still too high, but we're seeing some job growth, and businesses are investing and manufacturing is doing well; and we continue to have these self-inflicted crises here in Washington that suddenly leads everybody to tap the brakes. <p>And so what I said this week was I want to do something big to provide certainty and steadiness for the economy and for American families. And that means a balanced package that will reduce our long-term deficit and debt, but that still allows us to invest in those things that we need to grow right now, because that's also a deficit reduction agenda, us growing faster. <p>And in order to have a balanced package, that means that&mdash;we've already done a lot of cuts. We've done some revenue now. And so the rest of the way moving forward, we can do some additional reforms and make our health care programs work better and make them more efficient, and we can cut out programs that we don't need. But it also means that we've got to be able to close some tax loopholes and deductions that the average American cannot take advantage of, to raise the revenue to actually do the job in a way that allows us to continue to grow. <p>Now, the reason this is relevant is because I gather&mdash;and I haven't gotten this from firsthand sources, but from secondhand sources in the press&mdash;that our friends on the other side of the aisle, their position is: We're concerned about the sequester. We recognize that just cutting the Federal spending with a meat ax, as opposed to scalpel, is probably damaging; it will damage our national security; it will damage our educational system. We'll have kids getting kicked off of Head Start. It will mean people who have disabled kids suddenly having less help. <p>They recognize that the sequester is a bad idea, but what they've suggested is that the only way to replace it now is for us to cut Social Security, cut Medicare, and not close a single loophole, not raise any additional revenue from the wealthiest Americans or corporations who have a lot of lawyers and accountants who are able to maneuver and manage and work and game the system. <p>And I have to tell you, if that's an argument that they want to have before the court of public opinion, that is an argument I'm more than willing to engage in. Because I believe the American people understand, I believe the American people understand that yes, we need to reduce the deficit, but it shouldn't just be on the backs of seniors; it shouldn't just be on the backs of young people who are trying to get a college education; it should not just be on the backs of parents who are trying to give their kids a better start in life; that all of us have to participate; and that if, in fact, it's important for us to make sure we've got a strong national defense and that we reduce our spending in a smart way, we sure as heck should be willing to ask those of us who are luckiest in this society to close a few loopholes and deductions that the average American doesn't get. <p>And if that's the choice that we've got, I promise you we can win that debate, because we're on the right side of this argument. And I expect that you guys will be with me on that. <p>Last point I'll make, obviously, economic growth is a priority. But making sure that we're opening up opportunity for everybody is also important. And that's why immigration reform is so critical. I said this is going to be a top priority and an early priority of my administration. I am heartened to see Republicans and Democrats starting to be in a serious conversation about getting this done. Now is the time. <p>I recognize that the politics aren't always easy. There are regional variations. I understand that in some places this may end up being a tough issue. But what I also know is that part of our strength is our youth and our dynamism and our history of attracting talent from all around the globe. And I've seen that talent in some of the young dreamers that I've met who want to serve in our military, want to get an engineering degree, want to help build this country, want to start a business. And I want to make sure that that American future is secured. <p>So we need to get immigration reform done. And I'm going to be pushing hard to get it done early. <p>And we're also going to have to make sure that we keep the American people safe, which means that we're going to continue to work, even as we draw down our troops in Afghanistan, to go after those who would attack America. <p>And we've got to be mindful about steps we can take to end the cycle of gun violence in this country. And we should do so recognizing that, again, there are regional differences here, and we should respect those, and guns mean something different for somebody who grew up on a farm in a rural community than somebody who grew up in an inner city, and they're different realities, and we have to respect them. But what we know is the majority of responsible gun owners recognize we cannot have a situation in which 20 more of our children or a 100 more of our children or a 1,000 more of our children are shot and killed in a senseless fashion, and that there are some commonsense steps that we can take and build a consensus around. And we cannot shy away from taking those steps. <p>So the bottom line is this, people: We've got a lot of work to do. What we've learned over the last 4 years&mdash;at least what I've learned over the last 4 years&mdash;is that it won't be smooth; it won't be simple. There will be frustrations. There will be times when you guys are mad at me&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and I'll occasionally read about it. But as long as we keep in mind why we came here in the first place, as long as we think back to whatever inspired each of us to say, maybe I can give something back, maybe I can make a difference, maybe my purpose here on Earth is not just thinking about what's in it for me, but thinking about what's in it for the broader community&mdash;for my neighborhood, for my State, for my country&mdash;if we keep that in mind every single day, I have no doubt that we will continue the extraordinary progress that we've made already. <p>And as a byproduct of doing that good work and keeping that focus, I would expect that Nancy Pelosi is going to be Speaker again pretty soon. <p>All right? So thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.\" "
"22" "\"<i>The President.</i> In the years between the world wars, a young married couple in Italy packed up what few belongings that they had and boarded a boat for a new world. They passed under the Statue of Liberty and went through the lines of Ellis Island. <p>Carmelo and Carmelina Panetta had no money and spoke little English. But they had a dream of a better life. They worked hard. They went west to California. They started a family and taught their sons that if they studied and worked, if they gave back to this country, that they, too, could share in America's promise. <p>Today we pay tribute to their son&mdash;Leon Panetta&mdash;a man who hasn't simply lived up to the American Dream, but has helped to protect it for all of us. <p>Leon, our presence here today&mdash;Members of Congress, Deputy Secretary Carter, General Dempsey and the members of the Joint Chiefs, service secretaries, and the men and women of the greatest military that the world has ever known&mdash;all this is a reflection of our personal appreciation to you and the gratitude of a nation that you have helped to keep strong and to keep free. <p>By the time I came to office, Leon Panetta was already regarded as one of our Nation's finest public servants, with an extraordinary career across more than four decades. He and Sylvia had settled into the good life: their beautiful Monterey, their beloved walnut farm. Now, Leon will deny it, but I hear he was growing restless; he wanted less time on the tractor and enjoying good weather and more time in the office; less time in California, more time in Washington, interacting with the West Wing and Members of Congress. Who wouldn't? [<i>Laughter</i>] And so we gave him his wish. <p>Leon, I'll always be grateful that you agreed to return to public service. And, Sylvia, I am so grateful that you put up with him. Your leadership of the CIA will forever be remembered for the blows that we struck against Al Qaida and perhaps the greatest intelligence success in American history: delivering justice to Usama bin Laden. <p>By then, Leon had every right to expect that he could return home. And I'll admit that when we first asked him to stay on and lead the Pentagon, his answer was simple: No. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I kept asking. I am persistent; that's how Michelle married me. I just kept at it. And it is a testament to Leon's patriotism, to his sense of duty, that he agreed to serve on this one last tour. <p>And perhaps it was the memory, during World War II, of his parents opening up their homes to GIs headed for the Pacific. Perhaps it was because Leon served himself, as a young lieutenant in the Army. Perhaps it was the experience of watching his youngest son deploy to Afghanistan. What we do know is this: As our Nation's 23d Secretary of Defense, every action Leon Panetta has taken, every decision that he has made, has been with one goal in mind: taking care of our sons and our daughters in uniform and keeping America safe. <p>And just think of the progress under his watch. Because we ended the war in Iraq and are winding down the war in Afghanistan, our troops are coming home and next year our war in Afghanistan will come to an end. We've put the core of Al Qaida on the path to defeat, and we've been relentless against its affiliates. Because we have a sacred obligation to our troops&mdash;to take care of them like they've taken care of us&mdash;we're improving treatment for our wounded warriors, stepping up support for our military families, and doing more than ever to help our newest veterans transition to civilian life&mdash;and that includes the jobs our veterans need as we do some nation-building here at home. <p>Because we believe in opportunity for all Americans, the tenure of Secretary Leon Panetta, this son of immigrants, this first-generation American, will be remembered for historic progress in welcoming more of our fellow citizens to military service; for the formal and final repeal of \\"don't ask, don't tell\\"; for opening combat roles to our incredible women in uniform; in short, for making our military and our Nation that much stronger. <p>Because we forged a new defense strategy, we'll be better prepared for the future, better prepared to meet the threats that we face without larger military footprints, better prepared against cyber attacks, better prepared to advance our interests in the Asia-Pacific region, and after more than a decade of war, better prepared for the broadest range of contingencies. <p>Keeping us prepared will be the mission of my nominee to be the next Secretary of Defense: a combat veteran with the experience, judgment, and vision that our troops deserve, Chuck Hagel. <p>And since we are now just weeks away from deep, automatic cuts to Federal spending, including defense, let me say this: There is no reason&mdash;no reason&mdash;for that to happen. Putting our fiscal house in order calls for a balanced approach, not massive, indiscriminate cuts that could have a severe impact on our military preparedness. <p>So here today, for the sake of our prosperity, for the sake of all these men and women in uniform and all their brothers and sisters in uniform that they represent, now is the time to act, for Democrats and Republicans to come together in the same spirit that Leon Panetta always brought to public service: solving problems, not trying to score points; doing right for the country, not for any particular political agenda; sustaining our economic recovery; balancing budgets&mdash;Leon knows something about it&mdash;but also maintaining the finest military in history. <p>Leon, this, too, will be part of your legacy, for no one has raised their voice as firmly or as forcefully on behalf of our troops as you have. You've served with integrity and decency and grace. You're a reminder of what public service ought to be. You've led with heart, and you've led with humor. Indeed, they say that you've never seen our wounded warriors smile as wide or heard them laugh as loud as when they get a visit from their Secretary of Defense. And whatever the challenge, Leon, you always give it to us straight, sometimes in words that can't be repeated here in public. <p>Today we want to make sure to thank Sylvia and the entire Panetta family for sharing their husband, their father, and their grandfather with the rest of us, for sharing Bravo, the First Dog of the Pentagon. Sylvia, Leon's service has also been your sacrifice. And we promise, this time, he really is coming home. <p>Leon, from your first day in uniform until today, your dedicated service to America has spanned nearly 50 remarkable years. And as you review these fine troops one last time, as you return home and walk your farm, know that the grand arc of your life speaks to our larger American story. For you can say with confidence and with pride that you've fulfilled the hopes that brought Carmelo and Carmelina Panetta to these shores all those years ago. You've made them proud. You've helped to keep alive the American Dream for not only your children and grandchildren, but for all of our children and grandchildren. And for that, we will be eternally grateful. <p>So, Leon, as your parents would say, <i>grazie</i>. God bless you, and God bless these United States of America. <p>Ladies and gentlemen, our Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta. <p><i>Secretary Panetta.</i> Thank you very much. Mr. President, I'm deeply touched by your moving words about me, about my family, more importantly, about the men and women who serve in the Department of Defense. All of us are truly honored by your presence, and I thank you. <p>[<i>At this point, Secretary Panetta made remarks, concluding as follows.</i>] <p>It has been the honor of my life to have served in the position as Secretary of Defense. And wherever I go and whatever I do, I will thank God every day for the men and women in this country who are willing to put their lives on the line for all of us. They have responded to the call of the bugle with courage and with selfless dedication to country. My prayer, as I leave, is that we all have the same courage and dedication to protecting our Nation: the United States of America, the home of the free and the brave. <p>God bless America, God bless you, and God bless the men and women in the Department of Defense.\" "
"23" "\"Hi, everybody. Over the last few years, Democrats and Republicans have come together and cut our deficit by more than $2.5 trillion through a balanced mix of spending cuts and higher tax rates for the wealthiest Americans. That's more than halfway towards the $4 trillion in deficit reductions that economists and elected officials from both parties say we need to stabilize our debt. I believe we can finish the job the same way we started it, with a balanced mix of more spending cuts and more tax reform. And the overwhelming majority of the American people agree, both Democrats and Republicans. <p>Now, my preference, and the preference of many Members of Congress, is to do that in a balanced, comprehensive way, by making sensible changes to entitlement programs and reforming our Tax Code. As we speak, both the House and Senate are working towards budget proposals that, I hope, will lay out this kind of balanced path going forward. <p>But the budget process takes time. And right now if Congress doesn't act by March 1, a series of harmful, automatic cuts to job-creating investment and defense spending, also known as the sequester, are scheduled to take effect. And the result could be a huge blow to middle class families and our economy as a whole. <p>If the sequester is allowed to go forward, thousands of Americans who work in fields like national security, education, or clean energy are likely to be laid off. Firefighters and food inspectors could also find themselves out of work, leaving our communities vulnerable. Programs like Head Start would be cut, and lifesaving research into diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's could be scaled back. Small businesses could be prevented from getting the resources and support they need to keep their doors open. People with disabilities who are waiting for their benefits could be forced to wait even longer. All our economic progress could be put at risk. <p>And then, there's the impact on our military readiness. Already, the threat of deep cuts has forced the Navy to delay an aircraft carrier that was supposed to deploy to the Persian Gulf. As our military leaders have made clear, changes like this affect our ability to respond to threats in an unstable part of the world. And we'll be forced to make even more tough decisions in the weeks ahead if Congress fails to act. <p>The good news is, there's another option. Two months ago, we faced a similar deadline, and instead of making deep, indiscriminate cuts that would have cost jobs and slowed down our recovery, Democrats and Republicans came together and made responsible cuts and manageable changes to our Tax Code that will bring down our deficit. This time, Congress should pass a similar set of balanced cuts and close more tax loopholes until they can find a way to replace the sequester with a smarter, longer term solution. <p>Right now most Members of Congress, including many Republicans, don't think it's a good idea to put thousands of jobs at risk and do unnecessary damage to our economy. And yet the current Republican plan puts the burden of avoiding those cuts mainly on seniors and middle class families. They'd rather ask more from the vast majority of Americans and put our recovery at risk than close even a single tax loophole that benefits the wealthy. <p>Over the last few years, we've made good progress towards reducing our deficit in a balanced way. There's no reason we can't keep chipping away at this problem. And there's certainly no reason that middle class families and small businesses should suffer just because Washington couldn't come together and eliminate a few special interest tax loopholes or Government programs that just don't work. At a time when economists and business leaders from across the spectrum have said that our economy is poised for progress, we shouldn't allow self-inflicted wounds to put that progress in jeopardy. <p>So my message to Congress is this: Let's keep working together to solve this problem. And let's give our workers and our businesses the support they need to grow and to thrive. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"24" "\"<i>The President. </i>Please be seated, everybody. Good afternoon. And on behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the White House. <p>Every day at the White House, we receive thousands of letters from folks all across America. And at night, upstairs in my study, I read a few. About 3 years ago, I received a letter from a mom in West Virginia. Her son, Stephan, a specialist in the Army, just 21 years old, had given his life in Afghanistan. She had received the condolence letter that I'd sent to her family, as I send to every family of the fallen. And she wrote me back: \\"Mr. President,\\" she said, \\"you wrote me a letter telling me that my son was a hero. I just wanted you to know what kind of hero he was.\\" <p>\\"My son was a great soldier,\\" she wrote. \\"As far back as I can remember, Stephan wanted to serve his country.\\" She spoke of how he \\"loved his brothers in B Troop,\\" how he \\"would do anything for them.\\" And of the brave actions that would cost Stephan his life, she wrote, \\"His sacrifice was driven by pure love.\\" <p>Today we are honored to be joined by Stephan's mother Vanessa and his father Larry. Please stand, Vanessa and Larry. [<i>Applause</i>] <p>We're joined by the families of the seven other patriots who also gave their lives that day. Can we please have them stand so we can acknowledge them as well. [<i>Applause</i>] <p>We're joined by members of Bravo Troop, whose courage that day was \\"driven by pure love.\\" And we gather to present the Medal of Honor to one of these soldiers: Staff Sergeant Clinton L. Romesha. <p>Clint, this is our Nation's highest military decoration. It reflects the gratitude of our entire country. So we're joined by Members of Congress; leaders from across our Armed Forces, including Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Marty Dempsey, Army Secretary John McHugh, and Army Chief of Staff General Ray Odierno. We are especially honored to be joined by Clint's 4th Infantry Division&mdash;\\"Iron Horse\\"&mdash;soldiers, and members of the Medal of Honor Society, who today welcome you into their ranks. <p>Now, despite all this attention, you may already have a sense that Clint is a pretty humble guy. We just spent some time together in the Oval Office. He grew up in Lake City, California, population less than a hundred. We welcomed his family, including mom and dad, Tish and Gary. Clint&mdash;I hope he doesn't mind&mdash;he shared that Clint was actually born at home. These days, Clint works in the oilfields of North Dakota. He is a man of faith, and after more than a decade in uniform, he says the thing he looks forward to the most is just being a husband and a father. <p>In fact, this is not even the biggest event for Clint this week because tomorrow he and his wife Tammy will celebrate their 13th wedding anniversary. Clint and Tammy, this is probably not the kind of intimate anniversary you planned. [<i>Laughter</i>] But we're so glad that you're here, along with your three beautiful children: Dessi, Gwen, and Colin. Colin is not as shy as Clint. [<i>Laughter</i>] He was in the Oval Office, and he was racing around pretty good and sampled a number of the apples before he found the one that was just right. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, to truly understand the extraordinary actions for which Clint is being honored, you need to understand the almost unbelievable conditions under which he and B Troop served. This was a time, in 2009, when many of our troops still served in small, rugged outposts, even as our commanders were shifting their focus to larger towns and cities. So Combat Outpost Keating was a collection of buildings of concrete and plywood with trenches and sandbags. <p>Of all the outposts in Afghanistan, Keating was among the most remote. It sat at the bottom of a steep valley, surrounded by mountains, terrain that a later investigation said gave \\"ideal\\" cover for insurgents to attack. COP Keating, the investigation found, was \\"tactically indefensible.\\" But that's what these soldiers were asked to do: defend the indefensible. <p>The attack came in the morning, just as the sun rose. Some of our guys were standing guard. Most, like Clint, were still sleeping. The explosions shook them out of their beds and sent them rushing for their weapons. And soon, the awful odds became clear: These 53 Americans were surrounded by more than 300 Taliban fighters. <p>What happened next has been described as one of the most intense battles of the entire war in Afghanistan. The attackers had the advantage: the high ground, the mountains above. And they were unleashing everything they had: rocket-propelled grenades, heavy machineguns, mortars, snipers taking aim. To those Americans down below, the fire was coming in from every single direction. They'd never seen anything like it. <p>With gunfire impacting all around him, Clint raced to one of the barracks and grabbed a machinegun. He took aim at one of the enemy machine teams and took it out. A rocket-propelled grenade exploded, sending shrapnel into his hip, his arm, and his neck. But he kept fighting, disregarding his own wounds, and tending to an injured comrade instead. <p>Then, over the radio, came words no soldier ever wants to hear: \\"enemy in the wire.\\" The Taliban had penetrated the camp. They were taking over buildings. The combat was close, at times, as close as 10 feet. When Clint took aim at three of them, they never took another step. <p>But still, the enemy advanced. So the Americans pulled back, to buildings that were easier to defend, to make one last stand. One of them was later compared to the Alamo&mdash;one of them later compared it to the Alamo. Keating, it seemed, was going to be overrun. And that's when Clint Romesha decided to retake that camp. <p>Clint gathered up his guys. And they began to fight their way back, storming one building, then another, pushing the enemy back, having to actually shoot up at the enemy in the mountains above. By now, most of the camp was on fire. Amid the flames and smoke, Clint stood in a doorway, calling in airstrikes that shook the earth all around them. <p>Over the radio, they heard comrades who were pinned down in a Humvee. So Clint and his team unloaded everything they had into the enemy positions. And with that cover, three wounded Americans made their escape, including a grievously injured Stephan Mace. <p>But more Americans, their bodies, were still out there. And Clint Romesha lives the Soldier's Creed: \\"I will never leave a fallen comrade.\\" So he and his team started charging as enemy fire poured down. And they kept charging: 50 meters, 80 meters, ultimately, a 100-meter run through a hail of bullets. And they reached their fallen friends, and they brought them home. <p>Now, throughout history, the question has often been asked, why? Why do those in uniform take such extraordinary risks? And what compels them to such courage? You ask Clint and any of these soldiers who are here today, and they'll tell you: Yes, they fight for their country, and they fight for our freedom; yes, they fight to come home to their families. But most of all, they fight for each other, to keep each other safe and to have each other's backs. <p>When I called Clint to tell him that he would receive this medal, he said he was honored, but he also said, \\"It wasn't just me out there; it was a team effort.\\" And so today we also honor this American team, including those who made the ultimate sacrifice: Private First Class Kevin Thomson, who would have turned 26 years old today; Sergeant Michael Scusa; Sergeant Joshua Kirk; Sergeant Christopher Griffin; Staff Sergeant Justin Gallegos; Staff Sergeant Vernon Martin; Sergeant Joshua Hardt; and Specialist Stephan Mace. <p>Each of these patriots gave their lives looking out for each other. In a battle that raged all day, that brand of selflessness was displayed again and again and again&mdash;soldiers exposing themselves to enemy fire to pull a comrade to safety, tending to each other's wounds, performing \\"buddy transfusions,\\" giving each other their own blood. And if you seek a measure of that day, you need to look no further than the medals and ribbons that grace their chests: for their sustained heroism, 37 Army Commendation Medals; for their wounds, 27 Purple Hearts; for their valor, 18 Bronze Stars; for their gallantry, 9 Silver Stars. <p>These men were outnumbered, outgunned, and almost overrun. Looking back, one of them said, \\"I'm surprised any of us made it out.\\" But they are here today, and I would ask these soldiers, this band of brothers, to stand and accept the gratitude of our entire Nation. [<i>Applause</i>] <p>There were many lessons from COP Keating. One of them is that our troops should never, ever, be put in a position where they have to defend the indefensible. But that's what these soldiers did for each other, in sacrifice, \\"driven by pure love.\\" And because they did, eight grieving families were at least able to welcome their soldiers home one last time. And more than 40 American soldiers are alive today to carry on, to keep alive the memory of their fallen brothers, to help make sure that this country, that we love so much, remains strong and free. <p>What was it that turned the tide that day? How was it that so few Americans prevailed against so many? As we prepare for the reading of the citation, I leave you with the words of Clint himself, because they say something about our Army and they say something about America. They say something about our spirit, which will never be broken: \\"We weren't going to be beat that day,\\" Clint said. \\"You're not going to back down in the face of adversity like that. We were just going to win, plain and simple.\\" <p>God bless you, Clint Romesha, and all of your team. God bless all who serve. And God bless the United States of America. <p>With that, I'd like the citation to be read. <p>[<i>At this point, Maj. Gary Marlowe, USAF, Air Force Aide to the President, read the citation. The President then presented the medal, assisted by Lt. Col. Owen G. Ray, USA, Army USA, Army Aide to the President.</i>] <p><i>The President. </i>Well, thank you, everybody. Most of all, thank you for Clint and the entire team for their extraordinary service and devotion to our country. <p>We're going to have an opportunity to celebrate, and there's going to be a wonderful reception. I hear the food around here is pretty good; I know the band is good; and Colin really needs to get down. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So enjoy, everybody. Give our newest recipient of the Medal of Honor a big round of applause once again.\" "
"25" "\"Please, everybody, have a seat. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, fellow Americans: Fifty-one years ago, John F. Kennedy declared to this Chamber that \\"the Constitution makes us not rivals for power, but partners for progress.\\" \\"It is my task,\\" he said, \\"to report the state of the Union; to improve it is the task of us all.\\" <p>Tonight, thanks to the grit and determination of the American people, there is much progress to report. After a decade of grinding war, our brave men and women in uniform are coming home. After years of grueling recession, our businesses have created over 6 million new jobs. We buy more American cars than we have in 5 years and less foreign oil than we have in 20. Our housing market is healing, our stock market is rebounding, and consumers, patients, and homeowners enjoy stronger protections than ever before. <p>So together, we have cleared away the rubble of crisis, and we can say with renewed confidence that the state of our Union is stronger. <p>But we gather here knowing that there are millions of Americans whose hard work and dedication have not yet been rewarded. Our economy is adding jobs, but too many people still can't find full-time employment. Corporate profits have skyrocketed to alltime highs, but for more than a decade, wages and incomes have barely budged. <p>It is our generation's task, then, to reignite the true engine of America's economic growth: a rising, thriving middle class. <p>It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country: the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead, no matter where you come from, no matter what you look like or who you love. <p>It is our unfinished task to make sure that this Government works on behalf of the many, and not just the few; that it encourages free enterprise, rewards individual initiative, and opens the doors of opportunity to every child across this great Nation. <p>The American people don't expect government to solve every problem. They don't expect those of us in this Chamber to agree on every issue. But they do expect us to put the Nation's interests before party. They do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can. For they know that America moves forward only when we do so together and that the responsibility of improving this Union remains the task of us all. <p>Now, our work must begin by making some basic decisions about our budget, decisions that will have a huge impact on the strength of our recovery. <p>Over the last few years, both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than $2.5 trillion, mostly through spending cuts, but also by raising tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. As a result, we are more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances. <p>Now we need to finish the job. And the question is, how? <p>In 2011, Congress passed a law saying that if both parties couldn't agree on a plan to reach our deficit goal, about a trillion dollars' worth of budget cuts would automatically go into effect this year. These sudden, harsh, arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military readiness. They'd devastate priorities like education and energy and medical research. They would certainly slow our recovery and cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs. And that's why Democrats, Republicans, business leaders, and economists have already said that these cuts&mdash;known here in Washington as the sequester&mdash;are a really bad idea. <p>Now, some in Congress have proposed preventing only the defense cuts by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job training, Medicare, and Social Security benefits. That idea is even worse. <p>Yes, the biggest driver of our long-term debt is the rising cost of health care for an aging population. And those of us who care deeply about programs like Medicare must embrace the need for modest reforms; otherwise, our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations. <p>But we can't ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and the most powerful. We won't grow the middle class simply by shifting the cost of health care or college onto families that are already struggling or by forcing communities to lay off more teachers and more cops and more firefighters. Most Americans&mdash;Democrats, Republicans, and Independents&mdash;understand that we can't just cut our way to prosperity. They know that broad-based economic growth requires a balanced approach to deficit reduction, with spending cuts and revenue and with everybody doing their fair share. And that's the approach I offer tonight. <p>On Medicare, I'm prepared to enact reforms that will achieve the same amount of health care savings by the beginning of the next decade as the reforms proposed by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles Commission. <p>Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs. And the reforms I'm proposing go even further. We'll reduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies and ask more from the wealthiest seniors. We'll bring down costs by changing the way our Government pays for Medicare, because our medical bills shouldn't be based on the number of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital; they should be based on the quality of care that our seniors receive. And I am open to additional reforms from both parties, so long as they don't violate the guarantee of a secure retirement. Our Government shouldn't make promises we cannot keep, but we must keep the promises we've already made. <p>To hit the rest of our deficit reduction target, we should do what leaders in both parties have already suggested and save hundreds of billions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well-off and the well-connected. After all, why would we choose to make deeper cuts to education and Medicare just to protect special interest tax breaks? How is that fair? Why is it that deficit reduction is a big emergency justifying making cuts in Social Security benefits, but not closing some loopholes? How does that promote growth? <p>Now is our best chance for bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit. We can get this done. The American people deserve a Tax Code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms and more time expanding and hiring; a Tax Code that ensures billionaires with high-powered accountants can't work the system and pay a lower rate than their hard-working secretaries; a Tax Code that lowers incentives to move jobs overseas and lowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that are creating jobs right here in the United States of America. That's what tax reform can deliver. That's what we can do together. <p>I realize that tax reform and entitlement reform will not be easy. The politics will be hard for both sides. None of us will get a hundred percent of what we want. But the alternative will cost us jobs, hurt our economy, visit hardship on millions of hard-working Americans. So let's set party interests aside and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future. And let's do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors. The greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next. We can't do it. <p>Let's agree right here, right now to keep the people's Government open and pay our bills on time and always uphold the full faith and credit of the United States of America. The American people have worked too hard, for too long, rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials cause another. <p>Now, most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of our agenda. But let's be clear: Deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan. A growing economy that creates good, middle class jobs, that must be the north star that guides our efforts. Every day, we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation: How do we attract more jobs to our shores? How do we equip our people with the skills they need to get those jobs? And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living? <p>Now, a year and a half ago, I put forward an American Jobs Act that independent economists said would create more than 1 million new jobs. And I thank the last Congress for passing some of that agenda. I urge this Congress to pass the rest. But tonight I'll lay out additional proposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget framework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago. Let me repeat: Nothing I'm proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime. It is not a bigger Government we need, but a smarter Government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth. That's what we should be looking for. <p>Our first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing. After shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past 3. Caterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan. Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico. And this year, Apple will start making Macs in America again. <p>There are things we can do right now to accelerate this trend. Last year, we created our first manufacturing innovation institute in Youngstown, Ohio. A once-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the-art lab where new workers are mastering the 3-D printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything. There's no reason this can't happen in other towns. <p>So tonight I'm announcing the launch of three more of these manufacturing hubs, where businesses will partner with the Department of Defense and Energy to turn regions left behind by globalization into global centers of high-tech jobs. And I ask this Congress to help create a network of 15 of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is made right here in America. We can get that done. <p>Now, if we want to make the best products, we also have to invest in the best ideas. Every dollar we invested to map the human genome returned $140 to our economy&mdash;every dollar. Today, our scientists are mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimer's. They're developing drugs to regenerate damaged organs, devising new materials to make batteries 10 times more powerful. Now is not the time to gut these job-creating investments in science and innovation, now is the time to reach a level of research and development not seen since the height of the space race. We need to make those investments. <p>Today, no area holds more promise than our investments in American energy. After years of talking about it, we're finally poised to control our own energy future. We produce more oil at home than we have in 15 years. We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar, with tens of thousands of good American jobs to show for it. We produce more natural gas than ever before, and nearly everyone's energy bill is lower because of it. And over the last 4 years, our emissions of the dangerous carbon pollution that threatens our planet have actually fallen. <p>But for the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to combat climate change. Now, it's true that no single event makes a trend. But the fact is, the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15. Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods&mdash;all are now more frequent and more intense. We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy and the most severe drought in decades and the worst wildfires some States have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence. Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science and act before it's too late. <p>Now, the good news is we can make meaningful progress on this issue while driving strong economic growth. I urge this Congress to get together, pursue a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change, like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago. But if Congress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will. I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy. <p>And 4 years ago, other countries dominated the clean energy market and the jobs that came with it. And we've begun to change that. Last year, wind energy added nearly half of all new power capacity in America. So let's generate even more. Solar energy gets cheaper by the year; let's drive down costs even further. As long as countries like China keep going all in on clean energy, so must we. <p>Now, in the meantime, the natural gas boom has led to cleaner power and greater energy independence. We need to encourage that. And that's why my administration will keep cutting redtape and speeding up new oil and gas permits. That's got to be part of an all-of-the-above plan. But I also want to work with this Congress to encourage the research and technology that helps natural gas burn even cleaner and protects our air and our water. <p>In fact, much of our new-found energy is drawn from lands and waters that we, the public, own together. So tonight I propose we use some of our oil and gas revenues to fund an energy security trust that will drive new research and technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil for good. If a nonpartisan coalition of CEOs and retired generals and admirals can get behind this idea, then so can we. Let's take their advice and free our families and businesses from the painful spikes in gas prices we've put up with for far too long. <p>I'm also issuing a new goal for America: Let's cut in half the energy wasted by our homes and businesses over the next 20 years. We'll work with the States to do it. Those States with the best ideas to create jobs and lower energy bills by constructing more efficient buildings will receive Federal support to help make that happen. <p>America's energy sector is just one part of an aging infrastructure badly in need of repair. Ask any CEO where they'd rather locate and hire, a country with deteriorating roads and bridges or one with high-speed rail and Internet, high-tech schools, self-healing power grids. The CEO of Siemens America&mdash;a company that brought hundreds of new jobs to North Carolina&mdash;said that if we upgrade our infrastructure, they'll bring even more jobs. And that's the attitude of a lot of companies all around the world. And I know you want these job-creating projects in your district. I've seen all those ribbon-cuttings. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So tonight I propose a Fix-It-First program to put people to work as soon as possible on our most urgent repairs, like the nearly 70,000 structurally deficient bridges across the country. And to make sure taxpayers don't shoulder the whole burden, I'm also proposing a partnership to rebuild America that attracts private capital to upgrade what our businesses need most: modern ports to move our goods, modern pipelines to withstand a storm, modern schools worthy of our children. Let's prove there's no better place to do business than here in the United States of America, and let's start right away. We can get this done.<B> <p></B>And part of our rebuilding effort must also involve our housing sector. The good news is, our housing market is finally healing from the collapse of 2007. Home prices are rising at the fastest pace in 6 years. Home purchases are up nearly 50 percent, and construction is expanding again. <p>But even with mortgage rates near a 50-year low, too many families with solid credit who want to buy a home are being rejected. Too many families who never missed a payment and want to refinance are being told no. That's holding our entire economy back. We need to fix it. <p>Right now there's a bill in this Congress that would give every responsible homeowner in America the chance to save $3,000 a year by refinancing at today's rates. Democrats and Republicans have supported it before, so what are we waiting for? Take a vote and send me that bill. Why are&mdash;why would we be against that? Why would that be a partisan issue, helping folks refinance? Right now overlapping regulations keep responsible young families from buying their first home. What's holding us back? Let's streamline the process and help our economy grow. <p>These initiatives in manufacturing, energy, infrastructure, housing, all these things will help entrepreneurs and small-business owners expand and create new jobs. But none of it will matter unless we also equip our citizens with the skills and training to fill those jobs. <p>And that has to start at the earliest possible age. Study after study shows that the sooner a child begins learning, the better he or she does down the road. But today, fewer than 3 in 10 4-year-olds are enrolled in a high-quality preschool program. Most middle class parents can't afford a few hundred bucks a week for a private preschool. And for poor kids who need help the most, this lack of access to preschool education can shadow them for the rest of their lives. So tonight I propose working with States to make high-quality preschool available to every single child in America. That's something we should be able to do. <p>Every dollar we invest in high-quality early childhood education can save more than 7 dollars later on: by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, even reducing violent crime. In States that make it a priority to educate our youngest children, like Georgia or Oklahoma, studies show students grow up more likely to read and do math at grade level, graduate high school, hold a job, form more stable families of their own. We know this works. So let's do what works and make sure none of our children start the race of life already behind. Let's give our kids that chance. <p>Let's also make sure that a high school diploma puts our kids on a path to a good job. Right now countries like Germany focus on graduating their high school students with the equivalent of a technical degree from one of our community colleges. So those German kids, they're ready for a job when they graduate high school. They've been trained for the jobs that are there. Now at schools like P-TECH in Brooklyn, a collaboration between New York Public Schools and City University of New York and IBM, students will graduate with a high school diploma and an associate's degree in computers or engineering. We need to give every American student opportunities like this. <p>And 4 years ago, we started Race to the Top, a competition that convinced almost every State to develop smarter curricula and higher standards, all for about 1 percent of what we spend on education each year. Tonight I'm announcing a new challenge to redesign America's high schools so they better equip graduates for the demands of a high-tech economy. And we'll reward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and employers and create classes that focus on science, technology, engineering, and math: the skills today's employers are looking for to fill the jobs that are there right now and will be there in the future. <p>Now, even with better high schools, most young people will need some higher education. It's a simple fact: The more education you've got, the more likely you are to have a good job and work your way into the middle class. But today, skyrocketing costs price too many young people out of a higher education or saddle them with unsustainable debt. <p>Through tax credits, grants, and better loans, we've made college more affordable for millions of students and families over the last few years. But taxpayers can't keep on subsidizing higher and higher and higher costs for higher education. Colleges must do their part to keep costs down, and it's our job to make sure that they do. <p>So tonight I ask Congress to change the Higher Education Act so that affordability and value are included in determining which colleges receive certain types of Federal aid. And tomorrow my administration will release a new college scorecard that parents and students can use to compare schools based on a simple criterion: where you can get the most bang for your educational buck. <p>Now, to grow our middle class, our citizens have to have access to the education and training that today's jobs require. But we also have to make sure that America remains a place where everyone who's willing to work&mdash;everybody who's willing to work hard&mdash;has the chance to get ahead. <p>Our economy is stronger when we harness the talents and ingenuity of striving, hopeful immigrants. And right now leaders from the business, labor, law enforcement, faith communities, they all agree that the time has come to pass comprehensive immigration reform. Now is the time to do it. Now is the time to get it done. [<i>Applause</i>] Now is the time to get it done. <p>Real reform means stronger border security, and we can build on the progress my administration has already made: putting more boots on the southern border than at any time in our history and reducing illegal crossings to their lowest levels in 40 years. <p>Real reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earned citizenship, a path that includes passing a background check, paying taxes and a meaningful penalty, learning English, and going to the back of the line behind the folks trying to come here legally. <p>And real reform means fixing the legal immigration system to cut waiting periods and attract the highly skilled entrepreneurs and engineers that will help create jobs and grow our economy. <p>In other words, we know what needs to be done. And as we speak, bipartisan groups in both Chambers are working diligently to draft a bill, and I applaud their efforts. So let's get this done. Send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few months, and I will sign it right away. And America will be better for it. Let's get it done. [<i>Applause</i>] Let's get it done. <p>But we can't stop there. We know our economy is stronger when our wives, our mothers, our daughters can live their lives free from discrimination in the workplace and free from the fear of domestic violence. Today the Senate passed the \\"Violence Against Women's Act\\" that Joe Biden originally wrote almost 20 years ago. And I now urge the House to do the same. Good job, Joe. And I ask this Congress to declare that women should earn a living equal to their efforts, and finally pass the \\"Paycheck Fairness Act\\" this year. <p>We know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest day's work with honest wages. But today, a full-time worker making the minimum wage earns $14,500 a year. Even with the tax relief we put in place, a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the poverty line. That's wrong. That's why, since the last time this Congress raised the minimum wage, 19 States have chosen to bump theirs even higher. <p>Tonight let's declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty and raise the Federal minimum wage to $9 an hour. We should be able to get that done. <p>This single step would raise the incomes of millions of working families. It could mean the difference between groceries or the food bank, rent or eviction, scraping by or finally getting ahead. For businesses across the country, it would mean customers with more money in their pockets. And a whole lot of folks out there would probably need less help from government. In fact, working folks shouldn't have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up while CEO pay has never been higher. So here's an idea that Governor Romney and I actually agreed on last year: Let's tie the minimum wage to the cost of living so that it finally becomes a wage you can live on. <p>Tonight let's also recognize that there are communities in this country where no matter how hard you work, it is virtually impossible to get ahead: factory towns decimated from years of plants packing up; inescapable pockets of poverty, urban and rural, where young adults are still fighting for their first job. America is not a place where the chance of birth or circumstance should decide our destiny. And that's why we need to build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class for all who are willing to climb them. <p>Let's offer incentives to companies that hire Americans who've got what it takes to fill that job opening, but have been out of work so long that no one will give them a chance anymore. Let's put people back to work rebuilding vacant homes in rundown neighborhoods. And this year, my administration will begin to partner with 20 of the hardest hit towns in America to get these communities back on their feet. Now, we'll work with local leaders to target resources at public safety and education and housing. <p>We'll give new tax credits to businesses that hire and invest. And we'll work to strengthen families by removing the financial deterrents to marriage for low-income couples and do more to encourage fatherhood, because what makes you a man isn't the ability to conceive a child, it's having the courage to raise one. And we want to encourage that. We want to help that. <p>Stronger families. Stronger communities. A stronger America. It is this kind of prosperity&mdash;broad, shared, built on a thriving middle class&mdash;that has always been the source of our progress at home. It's also the foundation of our power and influence throughout the world. <p>Tonight we stand united in saluting the troops and civilians who sacrifice every day to protect us. Because of them, we can say with confidence that America will complete its mission in Afghanistan and achieve our objective of defeating the core of Al Qaida. <p>Already, we have brought home 33,000 of our brave service men and women. This spring, our forces will move into a support role, while Afghan security forces take the lead. Tonight I can announce that over the next year, another 34,000 American troops will come home from Afghanistan. This drawdown will continue, and by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistan will be over. <p>Beyond 2014, America's commitment to a unified and sovereign Afghanistan will endure, but the nature of our commitment will change. We're negotiating an agreement with the Afghan Government that focuses on two missions: training and equipping Afghan forces so that the country does not again slip into chaos and counterterrorism efforts that allow us to pursue the remnants of Al Qaida and their affiliates. <p>Today, the organization that attacked us on 9/11 is a shadow of its former self. It's true, different Al Qaida affiliates and extremist groups have emerged, from the Arabian Peninsula to Africa. The threat these groups pose is evolving. But to meet this threat, we don't need to send tens of thousands of our sons and daughters abroad or occupy other nations. Instead, we'll need to help countries like Yemen and Libya and Somalia provide for their own security and help allies who take the fight to terrorists, as we have in Mali. And where necessary, through a range of capabilities, we will continue to take direct action against those terrorists who pose the gravest threat to Americans. <p>Now, as we do, we must enlist our values in the fight. That's why my administration has worked tirelessly to forge a durable legal and policy framework to guide our counterterrorism efforts. Throughout, we have kept Congress fully informed of our efforts. I recognize that in our democracy, no one should just take my word for it that we're doing things the right way. So, in the months ahead, I will continue to engage Congress to ensure not only that our targeting, detention, and prosecution of terrorists remains consistent with our laws and system of checks and balances, but that our efforts are even more transparent to the American people and to the world. <p>Of course, our challenges don't end with Al Qaida. America will continue to lead the effort to prevent the spread of the world's most dangerous weapons. The regime in North Korea must know they will only achieve security and prosperity by meeting their international obligations. Provocations of the sort we saw last night will only further isolate them, as we stand by our allies, strengthen our own missile defense, and lead the world in taking firm action in response to these threats. <p>Likewise, the leaders of Iran must recognize that now is the time for a diplomatic solution, because a coalition stands united in demanding that they meet their obligations, and we will do what is necessary to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon. <p>At the same time, we'll engage Russia to seek further reductions in our nuclear arsenals and continue leading the global effort to secure nuclear materials that could fall into the wrong hands, because our ability to influence others depends on our willingness to lead and meet our obligations. <p>America must also face the rapidly growing threat from cyber attacks. Now, we know hackers steal people's identities and infiltrate private e-mails. We know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets. Now our enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our power grid, our financial institutions, our air traffic control systems. We cannot look back years from now and wonder why we did nothing in the face of real threats to our security and our economy. <p>And that's why, earlier today, I signed a new Executive order that will strengthen our cyber defenses by increasing information sharing and developing standards to protect our national security, our jobs, and our privacy. <p>But now Congress must act as well, by passing legislation to give our Government a greater capacity to secure our networks and deter attacks. This is something we should be able to get done on a bipartisan basis. <p>Now, even as we protect our people, we should remember that today's world presents not just dangers, not just threats, it presents opportunities. To boost American exports, support American jobs and level the playing field in the growing markets of Asia, we intend to complete negotiations on a Trans-Pacific Partnership. And tonight I'm announcing that we will launch talks on a comprehensive transatlantic trade and investment partnership with the European Union, because trade that is fair and free across the Atlantic supports millions of good-paying American jobs. <p>We also know that progress in the most impoverished parts of our world enriches us all, not only because it creates new markets, more stable order in certain regions of the world, but also because it's the right thing to do. In many places, people live on little more than a dollar a day. So the United States will join with our allies to eradicate such extreme poverty in the next two decades by connecting more people to the global economy, by empowering women, by giving our young and brightest minds new opportunities to serve and helping communities to feed and power and educate themselves, by saving the world's children from preventable deaths, and by realizing the promise of an AIDS-free generation, which is within our reach. <p>You see, America must remain a beacon to all who seek freedom during this period of historic change. I saw the power of hope last year in Rangoon, in Burma, when Aung San Suu Kyi welcomed an American President into the home where she had been imprisoned for years; when thousands of Burmese lined the streets, waving American flags, including a man who said: \\"There is justice and law in the United States. I want our country to be like that.\\" <p>In defense of freedom, we'll remain the anchor of strong alliances from the Americas to Africa, from Europe to Asia. In the Middle East, we will stand with citizens as they demand their universal rights and support stable transitions to democracy. <p>We know the process will be messy, and we cannot presume to dictate the course of change in countries like Egypt, but we can and will insist on respect for the fundamental rights of all people. We'll keep the pressure on a Syrian regime that has murdered its own people and support opposition leaders that respect the rights of every Syrian. And we will stand steadfast with Israel in pursuit of security and a lasting peace. <p>These are the messages I'll deliver when I travel to the Middle East next month. And all this work depends on the courage and sacrifice of those who serve in dangerous places at great personal risk: our diplomats, our intelligence officers, and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces. As long as I'm Commander in Chief, we will do whatever we must to protect those who serve their country abroad, and we will maintain the best military the world has ever known. <p>We'll invest in new capabilities, even as we reduce waste and wartime spending. We will ensure equal treatment for all servicemembers and equal benefits for their families, gay and straight. We will draw upon the courage and skills of our sisters and daughters and moms, because women have proven under fire that they are ready for combat. <p>We will keep faith with our veterans, investing in world-class care&mdash;including mental health care&mdash;for our wounded warriors, supporting our military families, giving our veterans the benefits and education and job opportunities that they have earned. And I want to thank my wife Michelle and Dr. Jill Biden for their continued dedication to serving our military families as well as they have served us. Thank you, honey. Thank you, Jill. <p>Defending our freedom, though, is not just the job of our military alone. We must all do our part to make sure our God-given rights are protected here at home. That includes one of the most fundamental rights of a democracy: the right to vote. Now, when any American, no matter where they live or what their party, are denied that right because they can't afford to wait for 5 or 6 or 7 hours just to cast their ballot, we are betraying our ideals. <p>So tonight I'm announcing a nonpartisan commission to improve the voting experience in America. And it definitely needs improvement. I'm asking two long-time experts in the field&mdash;who, by the way, recently served as the top attorneys for my campaign and for Governor Romney's campaign&mdash;to lead it. We can fix this, and we will. The American people demand it, and so does our democracy. <p>Of course, what I've said tonight matters little if we don't come together to protect our most precious resource: our children. It has been 2 months since Newtown. I know this is not the first time this country has debated how to reduce gun violence. But this time is different. Overwhelming majorities of Americans&mdash;Americans who believe in the Second Amendment&mdash;have come together around commonsense reform, like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun. Senators of both parties are working together on tough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to criminals. Police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and massive ammunition magazines off our streets, because these police chiefs, they're tired of seeing their guys and gals being outgunned. <p>Each of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress. Now, if you want to vote no, that's your choice. But these proposals deserve a vote. Because in the 2 months since Newtown, more than a thousand birthdays, graduations, anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun&mdash;more than a thousand. <p>One of those we lost was a young girl named Hadiya Pendleton. She was 15 years old. She loved Fig Newtons and lip gloss. She was a majorette. She was so good to her friends, they all thought they were her best friend. Just 3 weeks ago, she was here, in Washington, with her classmates, performing for her country at my Inauguration. And a week later, she was shot and killed in a Chicago park after school, just a mile away from my house. <p>Hadiya's parents, Nate and Cleo, are in this Chamber tonight, along with more than two dozen Americans whose lives have been torn apart by gun violence. They deserve a vote. They deserve a vote. [<i>Applause</i>] They deserve a vote. Gabby Giffords deserves a vote. The families of Newtown deserve a vote. The families of Aurora deserve a vote. The families of Oak Creek and Tucson and Blacksburg, and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence, they deserve a simple vote. They deserve a simple vote. <p>Our actions will not prevent every senseless act of violence in this country. In fact, no laws, no initiatives, no administrative acts will perfectly solve all the challenges I've outlined tonight. But we were never sent here to be perfect. We were sent here to make what difference we can, to secure this Nation, expand opportunity, uphold our ideals through the hard, often frustrating, but absolutely necessary work of self-government. <p>We were sent here to look out for our fellow Americans the same way they look out for one another, every single day, usually without fanfare, all across this country. We should follow their example. <p>We should follow the example of a New York City nurse named Menchu Sanchez. When Hurricane Sandy plunged her hospital into darkness, she wasn't thinking about how her own home was faring. Her mind was on the 20 precious newborns in her care and the rescue plan she devised that kept them all safe. <p>We should follow the example of a North Miami woman named Desiline Victor. When Desiline arrived at her polling place, she was told the wait to vote might be 6 hours. And as time ticked by, her concern was not with her tired body or aching feet, but whether folks like her would get to have their say. And hour after hour, a throng of people stayed in line to support her, because Desiline is 102 years old. And they erupted in cheers when she finally put on a sticker that read, \\"I voted.\\" [<i>Applause</i>] There's Desiline. <p>We should follow the example of a police officer named Brian Murphy. When a gunman opened fire on a Sikh temple in Wisconsin and Brian was the first to arrive&mdash;and he did not consider his own safety. He fought back until help arrived and ordered his fellow officers to protect the safety of the Americans worshiping inside, even as he lay bleeding from 12 bullet wounds. And when asked how he did that, Brian said, \\"That's just the way we're made.\\" <p>That's just the way we're made. We may do different jobs and wear different uniforms and hold different views than the person beside us. But as Americans, we all share the same proud title: We are citizens. It's a word that doesn't just describe our nationality or legal status. It describes the way we're made. It describes what we believe. It captures the enduring idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations; that our rights are wrapped up in the rights of others; and that well into our third century as a nation, it remains the task of us all, as citizens of these United States, to be the authors of the next great chapter of our American story. <p>Thank you. God bless you, and God bless these United States of America.\" "
"26" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! Hello, North Carolina! It is good to be back. I love coming to Asheville. Love coming to Asheville. The&mdash;Michelle and I always talk about how after this whole Presidency thing, and we're looking for a little spot to&mdash;you know? <p><i>Audience member.</i> Come on down. <p><i>The President.</i> Come on down. Play a little golf, do a little hiking, fishing, barbecue. There are two things that keep bringing me back here. Number one is I really like the people. And number two is 12 Bones, which I will be stopping on the way back to the airport. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, I want to start off by thanking Stratton for the wonderful introduction. And what made it wonderful was not only did he do a great job, but it was really brief. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I also want to thank Frank and Jim and everybody at Linamar for hosting us and giving me this terrific tour of the plant. <p>I want to point out two elected officials who are with us here today&mdash;first of all, your mayor, Terry Bellamy. Where is Mayor Bellamy? There she is. Good to see you. Plus, you got a wonderful mayor. I like that in you too. And also, Congressman Mel Watt is here. So give Congressman Watt a big round of applause. <p>So last night I delivered the State of the Union Address. And I talked about steps we can take right now to strengthen our recovery, but also to build up our middle class. And I said that while we're seeing some signs of solid progress&mdash;car sales are up, housing is starting to recover&mdash;we're still a ways away from where we need to be. There are still too many Americans who are out there every day, they're pounding the pavement; they're looking for work. You guys probably know friends or family members who are still pretty strapped, having a difficult time. And while it's true that corporate profits have skyrocketed to an alltime high, it's also true that for more than a decade now, wages and incomes haven't gone up at all, just about. <p>So we've got a lot of work to do. And our job&mdash;and this is a job for everybody; it's not a Democratic thing or a Republican thing&mdash;our job as Americans is to restore that basic bargain that says if you work hard, if you're willing to meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead. [<i>Applause</i>] You can get ahead. It doesn't matter what you look like. It doesn't matter where you come from. That's what we should be focused on: How do we make sure that people who are willing to work hard can make a decent living and look after their family? <p>Because the true engine of America's economic growth has always been our middle class. Now, there are a lot of countries that have folks at the top who are doing real well and a bunch of folks at the bottom, but part of what set America apart was ordinary folks, if they worked hard, they could do well. Our middle class&mdash;when it's growing, when it's thriving, when there are ladders of opportunity for people to do a little bit better each year and then make sure that their kids are doing even better than them&mdash;that's the American Dream. That's what we got to fight for. That has to be the north star that guides everything we do. <p>And as I said last night, we should be asking ourselves three questions every single day. It doesn't matter whether you're in North Carolina or Texas or California or Oregon. It doesn't matter. Wherever we are, three things we should be asking. Number one, how do we bring more jobs to America? Number two, how do we equip people with the skills they need to do those jobs? And number three, how do we make sure that once they have a job, it leads to a decent living? <p>I believe we reward effort and determination with wages that allow working families to raise their kids and get ahead. And that's part of the reason why I said last night that it's time for an increase in the minimum wage, because if you work full time, you shouldn't be poverty&mdash;in poverty. <p>I also believe we provide our people skills and training by investing in education, and that has to start early. It has to start early. So I talked about making sure that kids are getting an early childhood education, making sure that our high schools are preparing our children for a high-tech economy, and making sure that colleges are affordable and accessible to every single American. <p>And I believe we attract new jobs to America by investing in new sources of energy and new infrastructure and the next generation of high-wage, high-tech American manufacturing. I believe in manufacturing. I think it makes our country stronger. <p>So that's what we can do together. And that's why I wanted to come down here to Asheville, because there's a good story to tell here. I know that a few years ago, manufacturing comebacks in North Carolina, a manufacturing comeback in Asheville, may not have seemed real likely, because Volvo had just left town. This plant had gone dark. Twenty-eight&mdash;22&mdash;228 jobs had vanished. And that was a big blow for this area, because part of what happens is, when those manufacturing jobs go away, then suddenly, the restaurant has fewer customers, and suppliers for the plant start withering. And it's hard for everybody. It has a ripple effect. <p>But then local officials started reaching out to companies, offering new incentives to take over this plant. Some of the workers who got laid off, like Stratton, went back to school, and they learned new skills. And then, a year later, Linamar showed up. They were looking for a place to build some big parts. And these parts are big, I got to say&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;hubs and wheels and anchors for 400-ton mining trucks. And while they could have gone any place in the world, they saw this incredible potential right here in Asheville. They saw the most promise in this workforce, so they chose to invest in Asheville, in North Carolina, in the United States of America. <p>So to date, Linamar has hired 160 workers. It will be 200 by the end of the year, and it's just going to keep on going after that. So the folks at Linamar said, they came to Asheville to grow their business. They came here to stay and put down some roots. <p>And the good news is, what's happening here is happening all around the country. Because just as it's becoming more and more expensive to do business in places like China, America is getting more competitive and more productive. <p>And after shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our manufacturers have now added about 500,000 jobs over the past 3 years. All right? And I mentioned this last night: Caterpillar, which I know you guys supply, they're bringing jobs back from Japan. Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico. After placing plants in other countries like China, Intel is opening its most advanced plant here in the United States. Apple is starting to make Macs in America again. <p>So we're seeing this trend of what we call insourcing, not just outsourcing. And the reason is because America has got outstanding workers. We're starting to produce more homegrown energy, which is driving down our energy costs. And obviously, we've still got the biggest market in the world. And if we try to improve our infrastructure a little bit more, then we're going to be even that much more competitive. <p>Now, I want to be honest with you. We're not going to bring back every job that's been lost to outsourcing and automation over the last decade. Now, I was talking to some of the guys who were showing me their facilities, who had been in manufacturing for 20 years, and they explained how things had changed. It used to be you had to&mdash;you wanted to do the kind of stuff you guys are doing here, everything was done manually. Right? Now you've got a computer, and you're punching in stuff. So it's changed, and that means that you can just produce a lot more with fewer people. <p>But there are things we can do right now to accelerate the resurgence of American manufacturing. <p>Number one, we can create more centers for high-tech manufacturing in America. Last year, my administration created our first manufacturing innovation institute. We put it in Youngstown, Ohio, which had been really hard hit when manufacturing started going overseas. And so you had a once-shuttered warehouse, it's now a state-of-the art lab where new workers are mastering what's called 3-D printing, which has the potential to revolutionize the way we make everything. That's the future. And there's no reason that those same kinds of projects can't take root in other cities and towns. <p>So last night I announced the launch of three more institutes. And I'm calling on Congress to help us set up 15 institutes: global centers of high-tech jobs and advanced manufacturing around the country. <p>The second thing we need to do is make our Tax Code more competitive. Right now companies get all kinds of tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas, but companies that stay here get hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world. That doesn't make any sense. So what I'm proposing is that we reform our Tax Code, stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, reward companies that are creating jobs right here in the United States of America. That makes sense. <p>Number three, if you're a manufacturing town, especially one that's taken a hit&mdash;that's seen a company close up shop or a plant shut down&mdash;I want to partner with local leaders to help you attract new investment. Because once that investment starts coming in, things can start turning around. And that means infrastructure gets modernized and research facilities get built, and suddenly, a community that was knocked down is getting back up, and they're attracting new manufacturers who want to come and expand and hire. <p>So I want us to focus on, if a place like&mdash;when Asheville lost the Volvo plant, we've got to come in here real quick and help them figure out, all right, what is it that we need to attract a new employer. <p>Number four, we've got to help our workers get the training to compete for the industries of tomorrow. At least a couple of the guys that I had a chance to meet as we were taking the tour told me they were out of work for a year, in one case, 2 years. In part because we kept unemployment insurance in place so folks could get back on their feet, they were able to go back to school and now are gainfully employed. No job in America should go unfilled because somebody doesn't have the right skills to get that job&mdash;nobody. <p>So if there is a job open, we should train those folks right away, so that they can do the job. And that's why I'm proposing a national goal of training 2 million Americans with skills that will lead directly to a job. And we know this works. After Linamar came to town, they started working with AB-Tech, one of the community colleges here in Asheville. And AB-Tech and Linamar worked together to do something that is really smart. Rather than have kids just&mdash;or in some cases not kids, older workers&mdash;show up and they're taking a bunch of classes, but they don't know how this is directly going to lead to a job, what you do is you customize the class to train people so they can come and work at the plant and they're getting experience that's directly applicable to what's being done here at the job. <p>That's good for the community. It's good for Linamar because they're getting workers who they know can do the job. It's good for the folks who are going to the community college because they know if they work hard and they do well in the class, there's a job waiting for them. It's good for the economy as a whole. <p>So those are four commonsense steps that we can take right now to strengthen manufacturing in America. Now, there's no magic bullet here. It's just some commonsense stuff. People still have to work hard. Companies like Linamar still have to make good products. But the point is, is that if we can just do a few things, then over time, what happens is we start rebuilding our manufacturing base in a way that strengthens our economy as a whole. <p>Now, I'm doing what I can just through administrative action, but I need Congress to help. I need Congress to do their part. [<i>Applause</i>] I need Congress to do their part. I need Congress to take up these initiatives, because we've come too far and we've worked too hard to turn back now. <p>And you think about all that this city and all of you have been through over the last few years. Think about folks like Jeff Brower. Now, Jeff was in the trucking industry for over a decade. Two years ago, he got laid off, lost his job as a diesel mechanic. That's a tough thing to go through, even though Jeff's a pretty tough guy. But he bounced back. He decided it was time for him to change careers. He decided it was time to get some new skills. He went to AB-Tech, took a class in automated machining. A few months ago, Jeff got his diploma. He graduated on a Wednesday, interviewed at this plant on Thursday. By Friday, he was working as a machine operator. <p>Where's Jeff? There he is, right here. Now, obviously, Jeff is pretty good at interviews&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;because he just got hired like that. I hope he can give me some advice. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But here's the thing. The reason Jeff did all that&mdash;obviously, a lot of it was to support himself and his family&mdash;but it wasn't just to punch a clock at a new plant or pick up a paycheck from a new company. It was to make sure he could have a better future for his family and for his community and his country. Jeff said: \\"Getting my foot in the door has opened my eyes to bigger horizons. And I want to keep on going.\\" I want to keep on going. <p>So that's our story. That's the American story. We don't give up. We get up. We innovate. We adapt. We learn new skills. We keep going. And I just want everybody here to know at this plant&mdash;but everybody in Asheville, everybody in North Carolina, and everybody all across the country&mdash;I want you to know as long as you're out here fighting every day to better your lives and to better the lives of your children, then I'll be back in Washington fighting for you. I will be back there fighting for you, because there's nothing we can't do and no possibilities we can't reach when we're working together. We just have to work together. <p>And we've got to stop with some of the politics that we see in Washington sometimes that's focused on who's up and who's down. Let's just focus on the same kind of common sense and cooperation that we're seeing at this plant and we see all across the country. <p>So thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America. Thank you.\" "
"27" "\"Hello, everybody! Well, it is great to be in Georgia! Great to be in Decatur! <p>You know, I can't imagine a more romantic way to spend Valentine's Day&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;than with all of you, with all the press here. Actually, Michelle says hello. She made me promise to get back in time for our date tonight. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's important. That's important. I've already got a gift, got the flowers. I was telling folks the flowers are a little easier, though, because I've got this Rose Garden. [<i>Laughter</i>] Lot of people keeping flowers around. <p>I want to acknowledge a few people who are here. First of all, Congressman Hank Johnson is here. Where's Hank? Your mayor, Jim Baskett, is here. Another mayor you may know, Kasim Reed, snuck in here. I want to acknowledge the Decatur School Board, who I had a chance to meet and has helped to do so much great work around here. Folks right here. <p>And of course, I want to thank Mary for the wonderful introduction and for teaching me how to count earlier today. [<i>Laughter</i>] I've got to tell you it was wonderful to be there. I want to thank all the teachers and the parents and the administrators of Decatur City Schools, because behind every child who is doing great there is a great teacher, and I'm proud of every single one of you for the work that you do here today. <p>Now, on Tuesday, I delivered my State of the Union Address. And I laid out a plan for reigniting what I believe is the true engine of America's economic growth, and that is a thriving, growing, rising middle class. And that also means ladders for people to get into the middle class. And the plan I put forward says we need to make smart choices as a country, both to grow our economy, shrink our deficits in a balanced way by cutting what we don't need, but then investing in the things that we do need to make sure that everybody has a chance to get ahead in life. <p>What we need is to make America a magnet for new jobs by investing in manufacturing and energy and better roads and bridges and schools. We've got to make sure hard work is rewarded with a wage that you can live on and raise a family on. <p>We need to make sure that we've got shared responsibility for giving every American the chance to earn the skills and education that they need for a really competitive, global job market. <p>As I said on Tuesday night, that education has to start at the earliest possible age. And that's what you have realized here in Decatur. [<i>Applause</i>] Study after study shows that the earlier a child begins learning, the better he or she does down the road. But here's the thing: We are not doing enough to give all of our kids that chance. The kids we saw today that I had a chance to spend time with in Mary's classroom, they're some of the lucky ones, because fewer than 3 in 10 4-year-olds are enrolled in a high-quality preschool program. <p>Most middle class parents can't afford a few hundred bucks a week for private preschool. And for the poor children who need it the most, the lack of access to a great preschool education can have an impact on their entire lives. And we all pay a price for that. And as I said, this is not speculation. Study after study shows the achievement gap starts off very young. Kids who, when they go into kindergarten, their first day, if they already have a lot fewer vocabulary words, they don't know their numbers and their shapes and have the capacity for focus, they're going to be behind that first day. And it's very hard for them to catch up over time. <p>And then, at a certain point&mdash;I bet a lot of teachers have seen this&mdash;kids aren't stupid. They know they're behind at a certain point, and then they start pulling back, and they act like they're disinterested in school because they're frustrated that they're not doing as well as they should, and then you may lose them. <p>And that's why, on Tuesday night, I proposed working with States like Georgia to make high-quality preschool available to every child in America. Every child. <p>Every dollar we invest in high-quality early education can save more than 7 dollars later on: boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, reducing violent crime. In States like Georgia that have made it a priority to educate our youngest children, States like Oklahoma, students don't just show up in kindergarten and first grade more prepared to learn, they're also more likely to grow up reading and doing math at grade level, graduating from high school, holding a job, even forming more stable families. <p>Hope is found in what works. This works. We know it works. If you are looking for a good bang for your educational buck, this is it, right here. <p>That's why, even in times of tight budgets, States like Georgia and Oklahoma have worked to make a preschool slot available for nearly every parent who is looking for one for their child. And they're being staffed with folks like Mary: qualified, highly educated teachers. This is not babysitting, all right, this is teaching. <p>So at the age that our children are just sponges soaking stuff in, their minds are growing fastest, what we saw in the classroom here today was kids are taught numbers, they're taught shapes, but also how to answer questions, discover patterns, play well with others. And the teachers who were in the classroom, they've got a coach who's coming in and working with them on best practices and paying attention to how they can constantly improve what they're doing. <p>And that whole playing well with others, by the way, is a trait we could use more in Washington. So maybe we need to bring the teachers up. Every once in a while, have some quiet time. [<i>Laughter</i>] Time out. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So at the College Heights Early Childhood Learning Center that I visited earlier today, nearly 200 little kids are spending full days learning in classrooms with highly qualified teachers. And so I was working with them to build towers and replicate sculptures and sing songs. And look, I've got to admit, I was not always the fastest guy on some of this stuff. The kids were beating me to the punch. But through this interactive learning, they're learning math, writing, how to tell stories. <p>And one of the things that you've done here in Decatur that's wonderful also is, is that you've combined kids from different income levels: You've got disabled kids all in the same classroom so we're all learning together. And what that means is, is that all the kids are being leveled up, and you're not seeing some of that same stratification that you see that eventually leads to these massive achievement gaps. <p>So before you know it, these kids are going to be moving on to bigger and better things in kindergarten, and they're going to be better prepared to succeed. And what's more, I don't think you'll find a working parent in America who wouldn't appreciate the peace of mind that their child is in a safe, high-quality learning environment every single day. <p>Michelle and I remember how tough it can be to find good childcare. I remember how expensive it can be too. The size of your paycheck, though, shouldn't determine your child's future. So let's fix this. Let's make sure none of our kids start out the race of life already a step behind. Let's make it a national priority to give every child access to a high-quality early education. Let's give our kids that chance. <p>Now, I do have to warn the parents who are here who still have young kids, they grow up to be, like, 5'10\\"&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and even if they're still nice to you, they basically don't have a lot of time for you during the weekends. [<i>Laughter</i>] They have sleepovers and dates. [<i>Laughter</i>] So all that early investment&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;just leads them to go away. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, what I also said on Tuesday night is that our commitment to our kids' education has to continue throughout their academic lives. So from the time our kids start grade school, we need to equip them with the skills they need to compete in a high-tech economy. That's why we're working to recruit and train 100,000 new teachers in the fields of the future: in science and technology and engineering and math, where we are most likely to fall behind. <p>We've got to redesign our high schools so that a diploma puts our kids on a path to a good job. We want to reward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and employers and create classes that focus on science and technology and engineering and math, all the things that can help our kids fill those jobs that are there right now, but also in the future. <p>And obviously, once our kids graduate from high school, we've got to make sure that skyrocketing costs don't price middle class families out of a higher education or saddle them with unsustainable debt. I mean, some of the younger teachers who are here, they've chosen a career path that is terrific, but let's face it, you don't go into teaching to get rich. [<i>Laughter</i>] And it is very important that we make sure that they can afford to get a great education and can choose to be a teacher, can choose to be in a teaching profession. <p>So we've worked to make college more affordable for millions of students and families already through tax credits and grants and loans that go farther than before. But taxpayers can't keep subsidizing ever-escalating price tags for higher education. At some point you run out of money. So colleges have to do their part. And colleges that don't do enough to keep costs in check should get less Federal support, so that we're incentivizing colleges to think about how to keep their costs down. <p>And just yesterday we released what we're calling a new College Scorecard that gives parents and students all the information they need to compare schools by value and affordability so that they can make the best choice. And any interested parent, by the way, who's out there can check it out at WhiteHouse.gov. <p>Now, in the end, that's what this is all about: giving our kids the best possible shot at life; equipping them with the skills, education that a 21st-century economy demands; giving them every chance to go as far as their hard work and God-given potential will take them. <p>That's not just going to make sure that they do well, that will strengthen our economy and our country for all of us. Because if their generation prospers, if they've got the skills they need to get a good job, that means businesses want to locate here. And it also means, by the way, they're well-equipped as citizens with the critical thinking skills that they need in order to help guide our democracy. We'll all prosper that way. That's what we're fighting for. They're the ones who are going to write that next great chapter in the American story, and we've got to make sure that we're providing that investment. <p>I am so proud of every single teacher who is here who has dedicated their lives to making sure those kids get a good start in life. I want to make sure that I'm helping, and I want to make sure that the country is behind you every step of the way. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"28" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hey, Chicago! Hello, Chicago! Hello, everybody. Hello, Hyde Park! It is good to be home! It is good to be home. Everybody, have a seat. You all relax. It's just me. You all know me. It is good to be back home. <p>A couple of people I want to acknowledge: First of all, I want to thank your mayor, my great friend, Rahm Emanuel for his outstanding leadership of the city and his kind introduction. I want to thank everybody here at Hyde Park Academy for welcoming me here today. <p>I want to acknowledge your principal and your assistant principal&mdash;although, they really make me feel old, because when I saw them&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;where are they? Where are they? Stand up, stand up. They are doing outstanding work. We're very, very proud them. But you do make me feel old. Sit down. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>A couple other people I want to acknowledge: Governor Pat Quinn is here doing great work down in Springfield. My great friend and senior Senator, Dick .Durbin is in the house. Congressman Bobby .Rush is here; we're in his district. Attorney General&mdash;and former seatmate of mine when I was in the State senate&mdash;Lisa Madigan; County Board President&mdash;used to be my alderwoman&mdash;Tony Preckwinkle in the house. <p>And I've got&mdash;I see a lot of reverend clergy here, but I'm not going to mention them, because if I miss one, I'm in trouble. [<i>Laughter</i>] They're all friends of mine. They've been knowing me. <p>You know, some people may not know this, but obviously, this is my old neighborhood. I used to teach right around the corner. This is where Michelle and I met, where we fell in love. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Aww! <p><i>The President.</i> This is where we raised our daughters, in a house just about a mile away from here&mdash;less than a mile. And that's really what I've come here to talk about today: raising our kids. <p><i>Audience members.</i> We love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you too. I love you too. <p>I'm here to make sure that we talk about and then work towards giving every child every chance in life, building stronger communities and new ladders of opportunity that they can climb into the middle class and beyond, and most importantly, keeping them safe from harm. <p>Michelle was born and raised here: a proud daughter of the South Side. Last weekend, she came home, but it was to attend the funeral of Hadiya Pendleton. And Hadiya's parents, by the way, are here, and I want to just acknowledge them. They are just wonderful, wonderful people. <p>And as you know, this week, in my State of the Union, I talked about Hadiya on Tuesday night and the fact that unfortunately what happened to Hadiya is not unique. It's not unique to Chicago. It's not unique to this country. Too many of our children are being taken away from us. <p>Two months ago, America mourned 26 innocent first-graders and their educators in Newtown. And today I had the high honor of giving the highest civilian award I can give to the parent&mdash;or the families of the educators who had been killed in Newtown. And there was something profound and uniquely heartbreaking and tragic, obviously, about a group of 6-year-olds being killed. But last year, there were 443 murders with a firearm on the streets of this city, and 65 of those victims were 18 and under. So that's the equivalent of a Newtown every 4 months. <p>And that's precisely why the overwhelming majority of Americans are asking for some commonsense proposals to make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun. And as I said on Tuesday night, I recognize not everybody agrees with every issue. There are regional differences. The experience of gun ownership is different in urban areas than it is in rural areas, different from upstate and downstate Illinois. But these proposals deserve a vote in Congress. They deserve a vote. [<i>Applause</i>] They deserve a vote. And I want to thank those Members of Congress who are working together in a serious way to try to address this issue. <p>But I've also said no law or set of laws can prevent every senseless act of violence in this country. When a child opens fire on another child, there's a hole in that child's heart that government can't fill; only community and parents and teachers and clergy can fill that hole. In too many neighborhoods today&mdash;whether here in Chicago or the farthest reaches of rural America&mdash;it can feel like for a lot of young people the future only extends to the next street corner or the outskirts of town, that no matter how much you work or how hard you try, your destiny was determined the moment you were born. There are entire neighborhoods where young people, they don't see an example of somebody succeeding. And for a lot of young boys and young men, in particular, they don't see an example of fathers or grandfathers, uncles, who are in a position to support families and be held up and respected. <p>And so that means that this is not just a gun issue, it's also an issue of the kinds of communities that we're building. And for that, we all share a responsibility, as citizens, to fix it. We all share a responsibility to move this country closer to our founding vision that no matter who you are or where you come from, here in America, you can decide your own destiny. You can succeed if you work hard and fulfill your responsibilities. <p>Now, that means we've got to grow our economy and create more good jobs. It means we've got to equip every American with the skills and the training to fill those jobs. And it means we've got to rebuild ladders of opportunity for everybody willing to climb them. <p>Now, that starts at home. There's no more important ingredient for success, nothing that would be more important for us reducing violence than strong, stable families, which means we should do more to promote marriage and encourage fatherhood. Don't get me wrong: As the son of a single mom, who gave everything she had to raise me with the help of my grandparents, I turned out okay. [<i>Laughter</i>] But&mdash;no, no, but I think it's&mdash;so we've got single moms out here, they're heroic in what they're doing, and we are so proud of them. But at the same time, I wish I had had a father who was around and involved. Loving, supportive parents&mdash;and by the way, that's all kinds of parents&mdash;that includes foster parents, and that includes grandparents and extended families; it includes gay or straight parents. <p>Those parents&mdash;those parents supporting kids&mdash;that's the single most important thing. Unconditional love for your child, that makes a difference. If a child grows up with parents who have work and have some education and can be role models and can teach integrity and responsibility and discipline and delayed gratification&mdash;all those things give a child the kind of foundation that allows them to say, my future, I can make it what I want. And we've got to make sure that every child has that, and in some cases, we may have to fill the gap and the void if children don't have that. <p>So we should encourage marriage by removing the financial disincentives for couples who love one another, but may find it financially disadvantageous if they get married. We should reform our child support laws to get more men working and engaged with their children. And my administration will continue to work with the faith community and the private sector this year on a campaign to encourage strong parenting and fatherhood. Because what makes you a man is not the ability to make a child, it's the courage to raise one. <p>We also know, though, that there is no surer path to success in the middle class than a good education. And what we now know is that that has to begin in the earliest years. Study after study shows that the earlier a child starts learning, the more likely they are to succeed: the more likely they are to do well at Hyde Park Academy; the more likely they are to graduate; the more likely they are to get a good job; the more likely they are to form stable families and then be able to raise children themselves who get off to a good start. <p>Chicago already has a competition, thanks to what the mayor is doing, that rewards the best preschools in the city; so Rahm has already prioritized this. But what I've also done is say, let's give every child across America access to high-quality, public preschool. Every child, not just some. Every dollar we put into early childhood education can save $7 down the road by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, reducing violent crime, reducing the welfare rolls, making sure that folks who have work, now they're paying taxes. All this stuff pays back huge dividends if we make the investment. So let's make this happen. Let's make sure every child has the chance they deserve. <p>As kids go through school, we'll recruit new math and science teachers to make sure that they've got the skills that the future demands. We'll help more young people in low-income neighborhoods get summer jobs. We'll redesign our high schools and encourage our kids to stay in high school, so that the diploma they get leads directly to a good job once they graduate. <p>Right here in Chicago, five new high schools have partnered with companies and community colleges to prepare our kids with the skills that businesses are looking for right now. And your College to Careers program helps community college students get access to the same kinds of real-world experiences. So we know what works. Let's just do it in more places. Let's reach more young people. Let's give more kids a chance. <p>So we know how important families are. We know how important education is. We recognize that government alone can't solve these problems of violence and poverty, that everybody has to be involved. But we also have to remember that the broader economic environment of communities is critical as well. For example, we need to make sure that folks who are working now, often in the hardest jobs, see their work rewarded with wages that allow them to raise a family without falling into poverty. <p>Today, a family with two kids that works hard and relies on a minimum wage salary still lives below the poverty line. That's wrong, and we should fix it. We should reward an honest day's work with honest wages. And that's why we should raise the minimum wage to $9 an hour and make it a wage you can live on. <p>And even though some cities have bounced back pretty quickly from the recession, we know that there are communities and neighborhoods within cities or in small towns that haven't bounced back. Cities like Chicago are ringed with former factory towns that never came back all the way from plants packing up; there are pockets of poverty where young adults are still looking for their first job. <p>And that's why on Tuesday, I announced&mdash;and that's part of what I want to focus on here in Chicago and across the country&mdash;is my intention to partner with 20 of the hardest hit communities in America to get them back in the game&mdash;get them back in the game. <p>First of all, we'll work with local leaders to cut through redtape and improve things like public safety and education and housing. And we'll bring all the resources to bear in a coordinated fashion so that we can get that tipping point where suddenly a community starts feeling like things are changing and we can come back. <p>Second of all, if you're willing to play a role in a child's education, then we'll help you reform your schools. We want to seed more and more partnerships of the kind that Rahm is trying to set up. <p>Third, we're going to help bring jobs and growth to hard-hit neighborhoods by giving tax breaks to business owners who invest and hire in those neighborhoods. <p>Fourth, and specific to the issue of violence, because it's very hard to develop economically if people don't feel safe. If they don't feel like they can walk down the street and shop at a store without getting hit over head or worse, then commerce dries up, businesses don't want to locate, families move out, you get into the wrong cycle. So we're going to target neighborhoods struggling to deal with violent crime and help them reduce that violence in ways that have been proven to work. And I know this is a priority of your mayor's; it's going to be a priority of mine. <p>And finally, we're going to keep working in communities all across the country, including here in Chicago, to replace rundown public housing that doesn't offer much hope or safety with new, healthy homes for low- and moderate-income families. <p>And here in Woodlawn, you've seen some of the progress that we can make when we come together to rebuild our neighborhoods, and attract new businesses and improve our schools. Woodlawn is not all the way where it needs to be, but thanks to wonderful institutions like Apostolic Church, we've made great progress. <p>So we want to help more communities follow your example. And let's go even farther by offering incentives to companies that hire unemployed Americans who have got what it takes to fill a job opening, but they may have been out of work so long that nobody is willing to give them a chance right now. Let's put our people back to work rebuilding vacant homes in need of repair. Young people can get experience, apprenticeships, learn a trade. And we're removing blight from our community. <p>If we gather together what works, we can extend more ladders of opportunity for anybody who's working to build a strong, middle class life for themselves. Because in America, your destiny shouldn't be determined by where you live, where you were born. It should be determined by how big you're willing to dream, how much effort and sweat and tears you're willing to put in to realizing that dream. <p>When I first moved to Chicago, before any of the students in this room were born&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and a whole lot of people who are in the audience remember me from those days&mdash;I lived in a community on the South Side right up the block, but I also worked further south where communities had been devastated by some of the steel plants closing. And my job was to work with churches and laypeople and local leaders to rebuild neighborhoods and improve schools and help young people who felt like they had nowhere to turn. <p>And those of you who worked with me, Reverend Love, you remember, it wasn't easy. Progress didn't come quickly. Sometimes I got so discouraged I thought about just giving up. But what kept me going was the belief that with enough determination and effort and persistence and perseverance, change is always possible; that we may not be able to help everybody, but if we help a few, then that propels progress forward. We may not be able to save every child from gun violence, but if we save a few, that starts changing the atmosphere in our communities. We may not be able to get everybody a job right away, but if we get a few folks a job, then everybody starts feeling a little more hopeful and a little more encouraged. Neighborhood by neighborhood, one block by one block, one family at a time. <p>Now, this is what I had a chance to talk about when I met with some young men from Hyde Park Academy who were participating in this B.A.M. program. Where are the guys I talked to? Stand up you all, so we can all see you guys. So these are some&mdash;these are all some exceptional young men, and I couldn't be prouder of them. And the reason I'm proud of them is because a lot of them have had some issues. That's part of the reason why you guys are in the program. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But what I explained to them was, I had issues too when I was their age. I just had an environment that was a little more forgiving. So when I screwed up, the consequences weren't as high as when kids on the South Side screw up. So I had more of a safety net. But these guys are no different than me, and we had that conversation about what does it take to change. And the same thing that it takes for us individually to change, I said to them, well, that's what it takes for communities to change. That's what it takes for countries to change. It's not easy. <p>But it does require us, first of all, having a vision about where we want to be. It requires us recognizing that it will be hard work getting there. It requires us being able to overcome and persevere in the face of roadblocks and disappointments and failures. It requires us reflecting internally about who we are and what we believe in and facing up to our own fears and insecurities and admitting when we're wrong. And that same thing that we have to do in our individual lives that these guys talked about, that's what we have to do for our communities. And it will not be easy, but it can be done. <p>When Hadiya Pendleton and her classmates visited Washington 3 weeks ago, they spent time visiting the monuments, including the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Memorial just off the National Mall. And that memorial stands as a tribute to everything Dr. King achieved in his lifetime. But it also reminds us of how hard that work was and how many disappointments he experienced. He was here in Chicago fighting poverty, and just like a lot of us, there were times where he felt like he was losing hope. So in some ways, that memorial is a testament not to work that's completed, but it's a testament to the work that remains unfinished. <p>His goal was to free us not only from the shackles of discrimination, but from the shadow of poverty that haunts too many of our communities, the self-destructive impulses and the mindless violence that claims so many lives of so many innocent young people. <p>These are difficult challenges. No solution we offer will be perfect. But perfection has never been our goal. Our goal has been to try and make whatever difference we can. Our goal has been to engage in the hard, but necessary work of bringing America one step closer to the Nation we know we can be. <p>If we do that, if we're striving with every fiber of our being to strengthen our middle class, to extend ladders of opportunity for everybody who is trying to&mdash;as hard as they can&mdash;to create a better life for themselves; if we do everything in our power to keep our children safe from harm; if we're fulfilling our obligations to one another and to future generations; if we make that effort, then I'm confident, I'm confident that we will write the next great chapter in our American story. I'm not going to be able to do it by myself, though. Nobody can. We're going to have to do it together. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"29" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you very much, everybody. Please, please have a seat. Well, it is a pleasure to welcome some of our Nation's finest citizens here to the people's house. And let me be the first to congratulate each of you and your family members for the receipt of the highest honor a civilian can receive: the Citizens Medal. <p>We host a lot of events at the White House, but I have to admit this is one of my favorites, because it's a moment when, as a people, we get to recognize some extraordinary men and women who have gone above and beyond for their country and for their fellow citizens, often without fanfare, often with not a lot of attention, very rarely for any profit. You do it because it's the right thing to do, because you want to give back. And today we honor you, we celebrate you, and most of all, we have a chance to say thank you. Because all of us&mdash;are what the rest of us aspire to be. <p>In America, we have the benefit of living in this big and diverse nation. We're home to 315 million people who come from every background, who worship every faith, who hold every single point of view. But what binds us together, what unites us is, a single sacred word: citizen. <p>It's a word that, as I said in my State of the Union Address, doesn't just describe our nationality or our legal status, the fact that we hold a passport. It defines our way our life. It captures our belief in something bigger than ourselves: our willingness to accept certain obligations to one another and to embrace the idea that we're all in this together, that out of many, we are one. It's the thing that de Tocqueville noticed about America when he first came to visit: these folks participate, they get involved, they have a point of view; they don't just wait for somebody else to do something, they go out there and do it, and they join, and they become part of groups, and they mobilize, and they organize. <p>That's who we are; that's in our DNA. That's what it means to be a citizen of the United States of America. We've all got busy lives. We've got bills to pay. We've got kids to carpool, errands to get done. And in the midst of all the running around, it would be easy and even understandable for folks to just focus on themselves, to worry about our own lives, to look down the street and see a neighbor in need and say, \\"I'd like to help, but I've got problems of my own.\\" To look across town at a community that's in despair and say, \\"That's just too big a challenge for us to be able to take on.\\" <p>That's not who we are. That's not what we do. That's not what built this country. In this country, we look out for one another. We get each other's backs, especially in times of hardship or challenge. It's part of the reason why applications to AmeriCorps are at an alltime high. That's why volunteering in America is at the highest level it's been in years. And I know that makes Harris proud to hear. <p>Now, Harris Wofford has devoted his entire life to creating opportunities for Americans to serve. And the reason it's such a privilege for me to share the stage with him and all the others who are participating here today, is because you've taken commitment to a whole new level. Every day, you're out there righting wrongs, healing hurts, changing lives. <p>And when Janice Jackson was hit by a car at the age of 24, she was told by her doctors that the only thing she would ever move again were her shoulders. After suffering an injury like that, nobody would have faulted Janice for just focusing on herself. But as she recovered, and she regained her strength, she resolved to give some of that strength to others in need. Janice said that \\"From a wheelchair, I decided to devote my life to women with disabilities to tell them that even though you have limitations, you also have abilities.\\" And every day, through her mentorship and through her advocacy, that's exactly what she's doing. <p>When Adam Burke returned from Iraq, he had more than earned the right to just focus on himself. He had served our Nation with honor: a recipient of the Purple Heart for wounds he received while rescuing a comrade from enemy fire. Because of that attack&mdash;because of the shrapnel that tore through his head and his legs&mdash;when Adam came home, he came home a wounded warrior, suffering from a traumatic brain injury, posttraumatic stress disorder. But a few years later, Adam found himself back on the family farm, and he noticed that working the land was therapeutic. His coordination improved. He was able to put aside his cane. So he decided to use farming to help other veterans with similar injuries see similar benefits. And by starting Veterans Farm, he's doing that every day. <p>When Jeanne Manford learned that her son Morty had been badly beaten up at a gay rights demonstration, nobody would have faulted her for bringing him home, holding him close, just focusing on her child. This was back in 1972. There was a lot of hate, a lot of vitriol towards gays and lesbians and anyone who supported them. But instead, she wrote to the local newspaper and took to the streets with a simple message: No matter who her son was&mdash;no matter who he loved&mdash;she loved him and wouldn't put up with this kind of nonsense. And in that simple act, she inspired a movement and gave rise to a national organization that has given so much support to parents and families and friends and helped to change this country. We lost Jeanne last month, but her legacy carries on, every day, in the countless lives that she touched. <p>And then when Dawn Hochsprung and Mary Sherlach, Vicki Soto, Lauren Rousseau, Rachel D'Avino, Anne Marie Murphy, when they showed up for work at Sandy Hook Elementary on December 14 of last year, they expected a day like any other, doing what was right for their kids, spent a chilly morning readying classrooms and welcoming young students. They had no idea that evil was about to strike. And when it did, they could have taken shelter by themselves. They could have focused on their own safety, on their own well-being. But they didn't. They gave their lives to protect the precious children in their care. They gave all they had for the most innocent and helpless among us. <p>And that's what we honor today: the courageous heart, the selfless spirit, the inspiring actions of extraordinary Americans, extraordinary citizens. <p>We are a nation of 315 million people. Out of all these folks, around 6,000 were nominated for this medal. And today you're the ones receiving it not just for what you do, but for what you represent: for the shining example that you set every single day and the inspiration that you give each of us as fellow citizens, including your President. <p>So congratulations to the recipients. And now I would like our military aide to read the citations. <p>[At this point, Lt. Col. Owen G. Ray, USA, Army Aide to the President, read the citations and the President presented the medals, assisted by Maj. Gary Marlowe, USAF, Air Force Aide to the President.] <p><i>The President.</i> Let me close by just saying a few words of thanks: first of all, to Wendy and all the people at the Corporation for National and Community Service, thank you for all that you do to make our communities and our country stronger. We're very grateful. <p>To those who nominated these outstanding individuals, thank you for taking the time to share their stories. The competition was stiff. And your words gave life to their work. <p>To all the family and friends who are here celebrating with the winners, thank you for the love and support that you provide to them every single day, because they couldn't do what they do unless somebody had that love and support for them. I know the awardees would agree that this honor belongs not just to themselves, but to everybody who supports them. <p>And finally, to the winners of this year's Citizens Medal, we want to congratulate you once again. A special note just to the families who are here from Sandy Hook: We are so blessed to be with you. I've gotten to know many of you during the course of some very difficult weeks. And your courage and love for each other and your communities shines through every single day. And we could not be more blessed and grateful for your loved ones who gave everything they had on behalf of our kids. <p>On behalf of a grateful nation, thanks to all of you for showing us what it means to be a citizen of this country that we love. Hopefully, we will all draw inspiration from this and remember why it is that we're lucky to be living in the greatest nation on Earth. Thank you all for coming and enjoy the reception.\" "
"30" "\"This week I've been traveling across the country from North Carolina to Georgia, to here at Hyde Park Academy in my hometown of Chicago, talking with folks about the important task that I laid out in my State of the Union Address: reigniting the true engine of America's economic growth, a rising, thriving, middle class. <p>Every day, we should ask ourselves three questions: How do we bring good jobs to America? How do we equip people with the skills those jobs require? And how do we make sure your hard work leads to a decent living? <p>I believe all that starts by making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing. After shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past 3. What we need to do now is simple: We need to accelerate that trend. We need to launch manufacturing hubs across the country that will transform hard hit regions into global centers of high-tech jobs and manufacturing. We need to make our Tax Code more competitive, ending tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and rewarding companies that create jobs here at home. And we need to invest in the research and technology that will allow us to harness more of our energy and put more people back to work repairing our crumbling roads and bridges. <p>These steps will help our businesses expand and create new jobs. But we also need to provide every American with the skills and training that they need to fill those jobs. Let's start in the earliest years by offering high-quality preschool to every child in America because we know kids in these programs do better throughout their lives. Let's redesign our high schools so that our students graduate with the skills that employers are looking for right now. And because taxpayers can't continue to subsidize the soaring cost of higher education, I've called on Congress to take affordability and value into account when determining which colleges receive certain types of Federal aid. <p>So those are steps we can take to help bring good jobs to America and equip our people with the skills those jobs require. And that brings us to the third question: How do we make sure hard work leads to a decent living? <p>No one in America should work full time and raise their children in poverty. So let's raise the minimum wage so that it's a wage you can live on. And it's time to harness the talents and ingenuity of hard-working immigrants by finally passing comprehensive immigration reform: securing our borders, establishing a responsible path to earned citizenship, and attracting the highly skilled entrepreneurs and engineers that will help create jobs. <p>These steps will help grow our economy and rebuild a rising, thriving, middle class. And we can do it while shrinking our deficits. We don't have to choose between the two. We just have to make smarter choices. <p>Over the last few years, both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than $2.5 trillion, which puts us more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances. Now we need to finish the job. <p>But I disagree with Republicans who think we should do that by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job training or Medicare and Social Security benefits. That would force our senior citizens and working families to bear the burden of deficit reduction while the wealthiest are asked to do nothing more. That won't work. We can't just cut our way to prosperity. <p>Instead, I've proposed a balanced approach, one that makes responsible reforms to bring down the cost of health care and saves hundreds of billions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well-off and well-connected. And we should finally pursue bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit. So we know what we need to do. All the steps I've mentioned are common sense. And, together, they will help us grow our economy and strengthen our middle class. <p>In the coming weeks and months, our work won't be easy and we won't agree on everything. But America only moves forward when we do so together, when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations. That's the American story, and that is how we will write the next great chapter&mdash;together. <p>Thanks and have a great weekend.\" "
"31" "\"<i>The President.</i> Good morning, everybody. Please have a seat. Well, welcome to the White House. <p>As I said in my State of the Union Address last week, our top priority must be to do everything we can to grow the economy and create good, middle class jobs. That's our top priority. That's our north star. That drives every decision we make. And it has to drive every decision that Congress and everybody in Washington makes over the next several years. <p>And that's why it's so troubling that just 10 days from now, Congress might allow a series of automatic, severe budget cuts to take place that will do the exact opposite: won't help the economy, won't create jobs, will visit hardship on a whole lot of people. <p>Here's what's at stake. Over the last few years, both parties have worked together to reduce our deficits by more than $2.5 trillion. More than two-thirds of that was through some pretty tough spending cuts. The rest of it was through raising taxes&mdash;tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. And together, when you take the spending cuts and the increased tax rates on the top 1 percent, it puts us more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances. <p>Now, Congress, back in 2011, also passed a law saying that if both parties couldn't agree on a plan to reach that $4 trillion goal, about a trillion dollars of additional, arbitrary budget cuts would start to take effect this year. And by the way, the whole design of these arbitrary cuts was to make them so unattractive and unappealing that Democrats and Republicans would actually get together and find a good compromise of sensible cuts as well as closing tax loopholes and so forth. And so this was all designed to say we can't do these bad cuts; let's do something smarter. That was the whole point of this so-called sequestration. <p>Unfortunately, Congress didn't compromise. They haven't come together and done their jobs, and so as a consequence, we've got these automatic, brutal spending cuts that are poised to happen next Friday. <p>Now, if Congress allows this meat cleaver approach to take place, it will jeopardize our military readiness; it will eviscerate job-creating investments in education and energy and medical research. It won't consider whether we're cutting some bloated program that has outlived its usefulness or a vital service that Americans depend on every single day. It doesn't make those distinctions. <p>Emergency responders like the ones who are here today, their ability to help communities respond to and recover from disasters will be degraded. Border Patrol agents will see their hours reduced. FBI agents will be furloughed. Federal prosecutors will have to close cases and let criminals go. Air traffic controllers and airport security will see cutbacks, which means more delays at airports across the country. Thousands of teachers and educators will be laid off. Tens of thousands of parents will have to scramble to find childcare for their kids. Hundreds of thousands of Americans will lose access to primary care and preventive care like flu vaccinations and cancer screenings. <p>And already, the threat of these cuts has forced the Navy to delay an aircraft carrier that was supposed to deploy to the Persian Gulf. And as our military leaders have made clear, changes like this&mdash;not well thought through, not phased in properly&mdash;changes like this affect our ability to respond to threats in unstable parts of the world. <p>So these cuts are not smart. They are not fair. They will hurt our economy. They will add hundreds of thousands of Americans to the unemployment rolls. This is not an abstraction: people will lose their jobs; the unemployment rate might tick up again. <p>And that's why Democrats, Republicans, business leaders, and economists, they've already said that these cuts, known here in Washington as sequestration, are a bad idea. They're not good for our economy. They're not how we should run our Government. <p>And here's the thing: They don't have to happen. There is a smarter way to do this: to reduce our deficits without harming our economy. But Congress has to act in order for that to happen. <p>Now, for 2 years, I've offered a balanced approach to deficit reduction that would prevent these harmful cuts. I outlined it again last week at the State of the Union. I am willing to cut more spending that we don't need, get rid of programs that aren't working. I've laid out specific reforms to our entitlement programs that can achieve the same amount of health care savings by the beginning of the next decade as the reforms that were proposed by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission. I'm willing to save hundreds of billions of dollars by enacting comprehensive tax reform that gets rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well off and well connected, without raising tax rates. <p>I believe such a balanced approach that combines tax reform with some additional spending reforms, done in a smart, thoughtful way, is the best way to finish the job of deficit reduction and avoid these cuts once and for all that could hurt our economy, slow our recovery, put people out of work. And most Americans agree with me. <p>Now, the House and the Senate are working on budgets that I hope reflect on&mdash;reflect this approach. But if they can't get such a budget agreement done by next Friday, the day these harmful cuts begin to take effect, then at minimum, Congress should pass a smaller package of spending cuts and tax reforms that would prevent these harmful cuts, not to kick the can down the road, but to give them time to work together on a plan that finishes the job of deficit reduction in a sensible way. <p>I know Democrats in the House and in the Senate have proposed such a plan, a balanced plan, one that pairs more spending cuts with tax reform that closes special interest loopholes and makes sure that billionaires can't pay a lower tax rate than their salary&mdash;their secretaries. <p>And I know that Republicans have proposed some ideas too. I have to say, though, that so far, at least, the ideas that the Republicans have proposed ask nothing of the wealthiest Americans or biggest corporations, so the burden is all on first responders or seniors or middle class families. They double down, in fact, on the harsh, harmful cuts that I've outlined. They slash Medicare and investments that create good, middle class jobs. And so far, at least, what they've expressed is a preference where they'd rather have these cuts go into effect than close a single tax loophole for the wealthiest Americans. Not one. <p>Well, that's not balanced. That would be like Democrats saying we have to close our deficits without any spending cuts whatsoever. It's all taxes. That's not the position Democrats have taken. That's certainly not the position I've taken. It's wrong to ask the middle class to bear the full burden of deficit reduction. And that's why I will not sign a plan that harms the middle class. <p>So now Republicans in Congress face a simple choice: Are they willing to compromise to protect vital investments in education and health care and national security and all the jobs that depend on them? Or would they rather put hundreds of thousands of jobs and our entire economy at risk just to protect a few special interest tax loopholes that benefit only the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations? That's the choice. <p>Are you willing to see a bunch of first responders lose their job because you want to protect some special interest tax loophole? Are you willing to have teachers laid off or kids not have access to Head Start or deeper cuts in student loan programs just because you want to protect a special tax interest loophole that the vast majority of Americans don't benefit from? That's the choice. That's the question. <p>And this is not an abstraction. There are people whose livelihoods are at stake. There are communities that are going to be impacted in a negative way. And I know that sometimes all this squabbling in Washington seems very abstract, and in the abstract, people like the idea, you know, there must be some spending we can cut, there must be some waste out there. There absolutely is. But this isn't the right way to do it. <p>So my door is open. I've put tough cuts and reforms on the table. I am willing to work with anybody to get this job done. None of us will get 100 percent of what we want. But nobody should want these cuts to go through, because the last thing our families can afford right now is pain imposed unnecessarily by partisan recklessness and ideological rigidity here in Washington. <p>As I said at the State of the Union, the American people have worked too hard, too long rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials cause yet another one. And it seems like every 3 months around here there's some manufactured crisis. We've got more work to do than to just try to dig ourselves out of these self-inflicted wounds. <p>And while a plan to reduce our deficit has to be part of our agenda, we also have to remember deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan. We learned in the 1990s, when Bill Clinton was President, nothing shrinks the deficit faster than a growing economy that creates good, middle class jobs. That should be our driving focus: making America a magnet for good jobs, equipping our people with the skills required to fill those jobs, making sure their hard work leads to a decent living. Those are the things we should be pushing ourselves to think about and work on every single day. That's what the American people expect. That's what I'm going to work on every single day to help deliver. <p>So I need everybody who's watching today to understand, we've got a few days. Congress can do the right thing. We can avert just one more Washington-manufactured problem that slows our recovery and bring down our deficits in a balanced, responsible way. That's my goal. That's what would do right by these first responders. That's what would do right by America's middle class. That's what I'm going to be working on and fighting for not just over the next few weeks, but over the next few years. <p>Thanks very much, everybody. Thank you, guys, for your service.\" "
"32" "\"Hi, everybody. Our top priority as a country right now should be doing everything we can to grow our economy and create good, middle class jobs. <p>And yet, less than 1 week from now, Congress is poised to allow a series of arbitrary, automatic budget cuts that will do the exact opposite. They'll slow our economy. They'll eliminate good jobs. They'll leave many families who are already stretched to the limit scrambling to figure out what to do. <p>But here's the thing: These cuts don't have to happen. Congress can turn them off anytime with just a little compromise. They can pass a balanced plan for deficit reduction. They can cut spending in a smart way and close wasteful tax loopholes for the well off and well connected. <p>Unfortunately, it appears that Republicans in Congress have decided that instead of compromising&mdash;instead of asking anything of the wealthiest Americans&mdash;they'd rather let these cuts fall squarely on the middle class. <p>And here's what that choice means. Once these cuts take effect, thousands of teachers and educators will be laid off, and tens of thousands of parents will have to scramble to find child care for their kids. Air traffic controllers and airport security will see cutbacks, causing delays across the country. Even President Bush's Director of the National Institutes of Health says these cuts will set back medical science for a generation. <p>Already, the threat of these cuts has forced the Navy to delay the deployment of an aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf, affecting our ability to respond to threats in an unstable part of the world. And just this week, the Pentagon announced that if these cuts go through, almost 800,000 defense employees&mdash;the equivalent of every person in Miami and Cleveland combined&mdash;will be forced to take an unpaid leave. <p>That's what this choice means. Are Republicans in Congress really willing to let these cuts fall on our kids' schools and mental health care just to protect tax loopholes for corporate jet owners? Are they really willing to slash military health care and the border patrol just because they refuse to eliminate tax breaks for big oil companies? Are they seriously prepared to inflict more pain on the middle class because they refuse to ask anything more of those at the very top? <p>These are the questions Republicans in Congress need to ask themselves. And I'm hopeful they'll change their minds. Because the American people have worked too hard for too long to see everything they've built undone by partisan recklessness in Washington. <p>Instead of these reckless, unbalanced cuts, I believe we should work together to build on the more than $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction we've already achieved. We should do it in a balanced way: with smart spending cuts, entitlement reform, and tax reform. That's my plan. It's got tough cuts, tough reforms, and asks more of the wealthiest Americans. It's on the White House web site for everybody to see. And it requires Democrats and Republicans to meet halfway to resolve the problem. That's what the American people expect. And that's what you deserve. <p>We just need Republicans in Washington to come around. Because we need their help to finish the job of reducing our deficit in a smart way that doesn't hurt our economy or our people. After all, as we learned in the 1990s, nothing shrinks the deficit faster than a growing economy that creates good, middle class jobs. That has to be our driving focus. That has to be our north star: making America a magnet for good jobs, equipping our people with the skills required to fill those jobs, making sure your hard work leads to a decent living. That's what this city should be focused on like a laser. And I'm going to keep pushing folks here to remember that. <p>Thanks so much.\" "
"33" "\"Welcome, everybody. It is wonderful for us to have you here at the White House. Michelle and I are so happy to host you, and I want to start by acknowledging your outstanding chair, Jack Markell, and your vice chair, Mary Fallin. But more importantly, I want to recognize the First Lady of Delaware and the First Gentleman of Oklahoma because we know that the spouses put up with an awful lot. That's who this dinner's really for. [<i>Laughter]</i> And we hope that you all get a chance to celebrate a little bit tonight. <p>Last year, I got to see firsthand some of the great work that our governors are helping to accomplish all across the country. Now, it's true that I had the chance to see some accomplishments in some States more than others: Ohio&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>], Iowa&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>], Colorado&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>], Virginia. But I hope to see more of you this year, the rest of you. <p>But all of you have helped to steer your states through some of the nation's toughest times. You've had to make hard choices. You've had to make wise investments and mobilize the constituencies to do what needs to be done to grow your State. And that work is paying off. Companies are bringing jobs back to our shores. New homes are popping up in our neighborhoods. Small businesses are revitalizing our communities. <p>And many of you also had to deal with some incredible natural disasters. And, obviously, it's always painful to see the loss and the hardship that our families have suffered, but it's always wonderful to see the way in which governors in particular are able to lead and mobilize their states and their communities, rallying around neighbors, friends and communities. <p>So we know we've got more work to do&mdash;more jobs to create and more children to educate, and more roads to repair. The task before us is to find smart, common-sense solutions to each of these challenges that we can move forward on. And I'm looking for good partners. Because while nobody in this room sees eye to eye on everything, we know that when we work together&mdash;Democrats and Republicans, North, South, East and West&mdash;we can accomplish so much more than we can on our own. Whether it's helping our citizens rebuild from a horrific hurricane or a turbulent economic storm, we're stronger when we work together as a team. <p>One of my predecessors, a former Governor himself, put it well: \\"America is nothing if it consists merely of each us\\"&mdash;\\"if it consists merely of each of us,\\" Woodrow Wilson said. \\"It's something only if it consists of all of us.\\" <p>And nearly 100 years later, I expect that those words continue to be true, and they should be guiding all of our efforts. <p>So I want to wish everybody a toast. For the good that we've accomplished together, for the good that's yet to be done. I look forward to a year of progress working with all of you. I am grateful for your service. To those who are recently elected, congratulations. We look forward to seeing you again over the next several years. Cheers. <p>[<i>At this point, a toast was offered</i>.] <p>And with that, I would like to present your chairman&mdash;Jack Markell. <p>[<i>Gov. Jack A. Markell of Delaware made brief remarks</i>.]\" "
"34" "\"Thank you, guys. Please have a seat. Well, welcome, everybody. Thanks for being here. <p>We all have a lot on our plate, everything from our immigration system to our education system. As Joe talked about, our goal is to make sure that we can be an effective partner with you. <p>I want to thank the members of my Cabinet who are here, and members of the administration. I want to thank Jack and Mary for their leadership of the NGA. And, everybody else, I just want to say thanks to you for being on your best behavior last night. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm told nothing was broken. No silverware is missing. [<i>Laughter</i>] I didn't get any calls from the neighbors about the noise, although I can't speak for Joe's after-party at the Observatory. I hear that was wild. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, I always enjoy this weekend when I have a chance to see the Governors. As leaders, we share responsibility to do whatever we can to help grow our economy and create good middle class jobs and open up new doors of opportunity for all of our people. That's our true north, our highest priority. And it's got to guide every decision that we make at every level. <p>As I've said, we should be asking ourselves three questions every single day: How do we make America a magnet for good jobs? How do we equip our people with the skills and the training to get those jobs? And how do we make sure if they get those jobs that their hard work actually pays off? <p>As Governors, you're the ones who are on the ground, seeing firsthand every single day what works, what doesn't work, and that's what makes you so indispensable. Whatever your party, you ran for office to do everything that you could to make our folks' lives better. And one thing I know unites all of us and all of you&mdash;Democrats and Republicans&mdash;and that is the last thing you want to see is Washington get in the way of progress. <p>Unfortunately, in just 4 days, Congress is poised to allow a series of arbitrary, automatic budget cuts to kick in that will slow our economy, eliminate good jobs, and leave a lot of folks who are already pretty thinly stretched scrambling to figure out what to do. <p>This morning, you received a report outlining exactly how these cuts will harm middle class families in your States. Thousands of teachers and educators will be laid off. Tens of thousands of parents will have to deal with finding child care for their children. Hundreds of thousands of Americans will lose access to primary care and preventive care like flu vaccinations and cancer screenings. Tomorrow, for example, I'll be in the Tidewater region of Virginia, where workers will sit idle when they should be repairing ships, and a carrier sits idle when it should be deploying to the Persian Gulf. <p>Now, these impacts will not all be felt on day one. But rest assured, the uncertainty is already having an effect. Companies are preparing layoff notices. Families are preparing to cut back on expenses. And the longer these cuts are in place, the bigger the impact will become. <p>So while you are in town, I hope that you speak with your congressional delegation and remind them in no uncertain terms exactly what is at stake and exactly who is at risk. Because here's the thing: These cuts do not have to happen. Congress can turn them off any time with just a little bit of compromise. To do so, Democrats like me need to acknowledge that we're going to have to make modest reforms in Medicare if we want the program there for future generations and if we hope to maintain our ability to invest in critical things like education, research, and infrastructure. <p>I've made that commitment. It's reflected in proposals I made last year and the year before that and will be reflected in my budget, and I stand by those commitments to make the reforms for smart spending cuts. <p>But we also need Republicans to adopt the same approach to tax reform that Speaker Boehner championed just 2 months ago. Under our concept of tax reform, nobody's rates would go up, but we'd be able to reduce the deficit by making some tough, smart spending cuts and getting rid of wasteful tax loopholes that benefit the well off and the well connected. <p>I know that sometimes folks in Congress think that compromise is a bad word. They figure they'll pay a higher price at the polls for working with the other side than they will for standing pat or engaging in obstructionism. But as Governors, some of you with legislatures controlled by the other party, you know that compromise is essential to getting things done. And so is prioritizing, making smart choices. <p>That's how Governor O'Malley in Maryland put his State on track to all but eliminate his deficit while keeping tuition down and making Maryland's public schools among the best in America 5 years running. That's how Governor Haslam balanced his budget last year in Tennessee while still investing in key areas like education for Tennessee's kids. Like the rest of us, they know we can't just cut our way to prosperity. Cutting alone is not an economic policy. We've got to make the tough, smart choices to cut what we don't need so that we can invest in the things that we do need. <p>Let me highlight two examples of what we do need. The first is infrastructure. This didn't used to be a partisan issue. I don't know when exactly that happened. It should be a no-brainer. Businesses are not going to set up shop in places where roads and bridges and ports and schools are falling apart. They're going to open their doors wherever they can connect the best transportation and communications networks to their businesses and to their customers. <p>And that's why I proposed what we're calling Fix-It-First&mdash;I talked about this in my State of the Union Address&mdash;to put people to work right now on urgent repairs, like the nearly 70,000 structurally deficient bridges across the country. And to make sure taxpayers don't shoulder the entire burden, I also proposed a partnership to rebuild America that attracts private capital to upgrade what our businesses need most: modern ports to move our goods, modern pipelines to withstand a storm, modern schools that are worthy of our children. <p>I know that some people in Congress reflexively oppose any idea that I put forward, even if it's an idea that they once supported, but rebuilding infrastructure is not my idea. It's everybody's idea. It's what built this country. Governor Kitzhaber, a Democrat in Oregon, has made clean energy infrastructure a top priority. Governor Brownback of Kansas, a Republican, has been fighting to upgrade water infrastructure there. <p>And folks who think spending really is our biggest problem should be more concerned than anybody about improving our infrastructure right now. We're talking about deferred maintenance here. We know we're going to have to spend the money. And the longer we wait, the more it's going to cost. That is a fact. I think Matt Mead, a Republican, put it pretty well in Wyoming's State of&mdash;State address. He said failing to maintain our roads \\"is not a plan for being fiscally conservative.\\" Well, what's true in Wyoming is true all across the United States. <p>And we could be putting folks back to work right now. We know contractors are begging for work. They'll come in on time, under budget, which never happens. And we could make a whole lot of progress right now on things that we know we're going to have to do at some point. This is like fixing the roof or repairing a boiler that's broken. It will save us money in the long term. <p>I know that one of the biggest hurdles that you face when it comes to fixing infrastructure is redtape. And oftentimes, that comes out of Washington with regulations. In my first term, we started to take some steps to address that. And we've shaved months&mdash;in some cases, even years&mdash;off the timeline of infrastructure projects across America. <p>So today, I'm accelerating that effort. We're setting up regional teams that will focus on some of the unique needs each of you have in various parts of the country. We're going to help the Pacific Northwest move faster on renewable energy projects. We're going to help the Northeast Corridor move faster on high-speed rail service. We're going to help the Midwest and other States like Colorado move faster on projects that help farmers deal with worsening drought. We're going to help States like North Dakota and South Dakota and Montana move faster on oil and gas production. All of these projects will get more Americans back to work faster. And we can do even more if we can get Congress to act. <p>The second priority that I want to talk about is education, and in particular, education that starts at the earliest age. I want to partner with each of you to make high-quality preschool available to every child in America. <p>Now, this is an area where we've already seen great bipartisan work at the State level. I was just in Governor Deal's State to highlight this issue because Georgia has made it a priority to educate our youngest kids. And in the school district where I visited in Decatur, Georgia, you're already seeing closing of the achievement gap. Kids who are poor are leveling up. And everybody is seeing real improvement, because it's high-quality, early childhood education. <p>Study after study shows that the sooner children begin to learn in these high-quality settings, the better he or she does down the road, and we all end up saving money. Unfortunately, today, fewer than 3 in 10 4-year-olds are enrolled in a high-quality preschool program. Most middle class parents can't afford a few hundred bucks a week in additional income for these kinds of preschool programs. And poor kids, who need it most, lack access. And that lack of access can shadow them for the rest of their lives. We all pay a price for that. <p>Every dollar we invest in early childhood education can save more than 7 dollars later on: boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, even reducing incidents of violent crime. <p>And again, I'm not the first person to focus on this. Governor Bentley has made this a priority in Alabama. Governor Snyder is making it a priority in Michigan. Governor Tomblin has made this a priority in West Virginia. Even in a time of tight budgets, Republicans and Democrats are focused on high-quality early childhood education. We want to make sure that we can be an effective partner in that process. <p>We should be able to do that for every child, everywhere&mdash;Democrat, Republican, blue State, red State&mdash;it shouldn't matter. All of us want our kids to grow up more likely to read and write and do math at grade level, to graduate high school, hold a job, and form more stable families of their own. That will be better for every State. That will be better for this country. That's what high-quality early childhood education can deliver. And I hope that you're willing to partner with us to make that happen. <p>Let me just close with this. There are always going to be areas where we have some genuine disagreement, here in Washington and in your respective States. But there are more areas where we can do a lot more cooperating than I think we've seen over the last several years. To do that, though, this town has to get past its obsession with focusing on the next election instead of the next generation. <p>All of us are elected officials. All of us are concerned about our politics, both in our own party's as well as the other party's. But at some point, we've got to do some governing. And certainly, what we can't do is keep careening from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. As I said in the State of the Union, the American people have worked hard and long to dig themselves out of one crisis; they don't need us creating another one. And unfortunately, that's what we've been seeing too much out there. <p>The American people are out there every single day, meeting their responsibilities, giving it their all to provide for their families and their communities. A lot of you are doing the same things in your respective States. Well, we need that same kind of attitude here in Washington. At the very least, the American people have a right to expect that from their representatives. <p>And so I look forward to working with all of you not just to strengthen our economy for the short term, but also to reignite what has always been the central premise of America's economic engine, and that is that we build a strong, growing, thriving middle class, where if you work hard in this country, no matter who you are, what you look like, you can make it; you can succeed. That's our goal, and I know that's the goal of all of you as well. <p>So I look forward to our partnering. And with that, what I want to do is clear out the press so we can take some questions. All right?\" "
"35" "\"Hello, Newport News! Well, it is good to see all of you here today. <p>I want to thank your CEO, Mike Petters, for showing me around. I usually don't get a chance to hang out with nuclear submarines, especially submarines that my wife has sponsored. So right there, that was worth the trip. But most importantly, it's a great chance to see the incredible men and women who, every single day, are helping to keep America safe and are just the bedrock of this country's manufacturing base. Thank you to all of you. <p>I want to thank our outstanding Secretary of the Navy, Ray Mabus, who's here. There he is right there: the good-looking guy there, over at the end. [<i>Laughter</i>] I want to thank your mayor, McKinley Price, who served this Nation bravely in the U.S. Army. I want to thank two outstanding Congressmen who care about this facility, care about Virginia, and care about the country: Congressman Bobby Scott is here, and Congressman Scott Rigell is here as well. <p>Now, the reason I came here today, in addition to seeing just some incredible stuff&mdash;it's true, every time I come to these places, I don't know how you all do it; it is just amazing work&mdash;but the main reason I'm here is to call attention to the important work that you're doing on behalf of the Nation's defense and to let the American people know that this work, along with hundreds of thousands of jobs, are currently in jeopardy because of politics in Washington. <p>In a few days, Congress might allow a series of immediate, painful, arbitrary budget cuts to take place, known in Washington as the sequester. Now, that's a pretty bad name: sequester. But the effects are even worse than the name. Instead of cutting out the Government spending we don't need&mdash;wasteful programs that don't work, special interest tax loopholes, and tax breaks&mdash;what the sequester does is it uses a meat cleaver approach to gut critical investments in things like education and national security and lifesaving medical research. And the impact of this policy won't be felt overnight, but it will be real. The sequester will weaken America's economic recovery, it will weaken our military readiness, and it will weaken the basic services that the American people depend on every single day. <p>Already, the uncertainty around these cuts is having an effect. Companies are starting to prepare for layoff notices. Families are preparing to cut back on expenses. And the longer these cuts are in place, the greater the damage. <p>So here at Newport News Shipbuilding, you guys have made an enormous investment, because we've said in order to maintain the finest Navy that the world has ever known, we've got to make sure that there is an orderly process whereby we are continually upgrading our ships, building new ships, maintaining our ships properly. And these are some big ships, so it's expensive and it's complicated. And you've got 5,000 suppliers all across the country, and you've got to have some certainty and some knowledge about how things are going to proceed over the long term for Mike and others to plan properly. So you're rightly concerned, Mike is properly concerned, about the impact that these cuts will have on not just this company, but companies and small businesses from all 50 States that supply you with parts and equipment. <p>Mike was telling me that you guys have already made a billion dollars' worth of capital investment. You've got half a billion dollars in training costs as you recruit and hire new people. Well, those aren't commitments that you make lightly. You've got to have the capacity to plan and have some certainty in terms of what it is that we're going to be doing. And you know that if Congress can't get together and plan our Nation's finances for the long term, that over time, some of your jobs and businesses could be at risk. <p>Over at the Norfolk naval station, the threat of these cuts has already forced the Navy to cancel the deployment or delay the repair of certain aircraft carriers. One that's currently being built might not get finished. Another carrier might not get started at all. And that hurts your bottom line; that hurts this community. <p>Because of these automatic cuts, about 90,000 Virginians who work for the Department of Defense would be forced to take unpaid leave from their jobs. So that's money out of their pockets, money out of their paychecks. And then that means there's going to be a ripple effect on thousands of other jobs and businesses and services throughout the Commonwealth, because if they don't have money in their pockets&mdash;or less money in their pockets&mdash;that means they're less able to afford to buy goods and services from other businesses. So it's not just restricted to the defense industry. <p>All told, the sequester could cost tens of thousands of jobs right here in Virginia. But it doesn't just stop there. If the sequester goes into effect, more than 2,000 college students would lose their financial aid. Early education like Head Start and Early Start would be eliminated for nearly 1,000 children, and around 18,000 fewer Virginians would get the skills and training they need to find a job. <p>Across the country, these cuts will force Federal prosecutors to close cases and potentially let criminals go. Air traffic controllers and airport security will see cutbacks, and that could cause delays at airports across the country. Tens of thousands of parents will have to scramble to find childcare for their kids. Hundreds of thousands of Americans will lose access to primary care and preventive care like flu vaccinations and cancer screenings, including more than 3,500 children right here in Virginia. <p>So these cuts are wrong. They're not smart. They're not fair. They're a self-inflicted wound that doesn't have to happen. <p>Now, the reason that we're even thinking about the sequester is because people are rightly concerned about the deficit and the debt. But there is a sensible way of doing things, and there is a dumb way of doing things. I mean, think about your own family, right? Let's say that suddenly you've got a little less money coming in. Are you going to say, well, we'll cut out college tuition for the kid, we'll stop feeding the little guy over here, we won't pay our car note even though that means we can't get to work. That's not what you do, right? <p>You step back, and you say, what is it that's important: our child's education, making sure they're healthy, making sure we can get to the job, keeping our house repaired? And then you say, here are the things that aren't so important, and you cut those out. You prioritize, and you make smart decisions. Well, we should be doing the same thing. <p>Now, I've laid out a plan that details how we can pay down our deficit in a way that's balanced and responsible. We have the plan right on a web site, the White House web site. Everybody can go see it. It details exactly how we can cut programs that don't work, how we can raise money by closing loopholes that are only serving a few, as opposed to the average American. We detailed $930 billion in sensible spending cuts that we're willing to make and $580 billion in wasteful tax loopholes and deductions that we're willing to eliminate through tax reform. <p>And what I've said is if the Republicans in Congress don't like every detail of my proposal, which I don't expect them to; I've told them my door is open. I am more than willing to negotiate; I want to compromise. There's no reason why we can't come together and find a sensible way to reduce the deficit over the long term without affecting vital services, without hurting families, without impacting outstanding facilities like this one and our national defense. There's a way of doing this. <p>And the fact is, there are leaders in both parties throughout this country who want to do the same. I've got to give Scott Rigell credit. He is one of your Republican Congressmen who's with us here today, and that's not always healthy for a Republican, being with me. But the reason he's doing it is because he knows it's important to you. And he's asked his colleagues in the House to consider closing tax loopholes instead of letting these automatic cuts go through. He's concerned about the deficit, and he's more than prepared to make some really tough cuts, but he wants to do it in a smart way. <p>Bobby Scott, same thing. Some of the cuts we've proposed, Bobby might not think are perfect, but he knows that we've got to make some tough decisions. He just wants to make sure that you aren't the ones who are adversely impacted and that we're sharing the sacrifice in bringing down our deficit, we're not just dumping it on a few people, and we're not doing it in a dumb way. Senators like John McCain have made similar statements to what Scott said. Your Republican Governor, along with other Governors around the country, have said they want Congress to stop the sequester, to stop these cuts. <p>But I just have to be honest with you. There are too many Republicans in Congress right now who refuse to compromise even an inch when it comes to closing tax loopholes and special interest tax breaks. And that's what's holding things up right now. <p>Keep in mind, nobody is asking them to raise income tax rates. All we're asking is to consider closing tax loopholes and deductions that the Speaker of the House, John Boehner, said he was willing to do just a few months ago. He said there were a bunch of loopholes and deductions you could close. He said you could raise 800 billion, a trillion dollars, by closing loopholes. <p>Well, we're not even asking for that much. All we're asking is that they close loopholes for the well off and the well connected&mdash;for hedge fund managers or oil companies or corporate jet owners, who are all doing very well and don't need these tax loopholes&mdash;so we can avoid laying off workers or kicking kids off Head Start or reducing financial aid for college students. I don't think that's too much to ask. I do not think that is partisan. The majority of the American people agree with me. The majority of Newport News agrees with me. We need to get this done. <p>But the choice is up to Congress. Only Congress has the power to pass a law that stops these damaging cuts and replaces them with smart savings and tax reform. And the second I get that bill on my desk, I will sign it into law. But I've got to get Congress to pass it. <p>None of us will get 100 percent of what we want. Democrats, they've got to make some tough choices too. Democrats like me, we've said we're prepared to make some tough cuts and reforms, including to programs like Medicare. But if we're willing to compromise, then Republicans in the House have to compromise as well. That's what democracy is about. That's what this country needs right now. <p>So let me just make one last point, by the way, for those of you who are following this. Now, lately, some people have been saying, well, maybe we'll just give the President some flexibility. He could make the cuts the way he wants, and that way it won't be as damaging. The problem is when you're cutting $85 billion in 7 months, which represents over a 10 percent cut in the defense budget in 7 months, there's no smart way to do that. There's no smart way to do that. You don't want to have to choose between&mdash;let's see, do I close funding for the disabled kid or the poor kid? Do I close this Navy shipyard or some other one? When you're doing things in a way that's not smart, you can't gloss over the pain and the impact it's going to have on the economy. <p>And the broader point is, Virginia, we can't just cut our way to prosperity. We can't just cut our way to prosperity. We can't ask seniors and working families like yours to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and the most powerful. We're not going to grow the middle class just by shifting the cost of health care or college onto families that are already struggling, or forcing communities to lay off more teachers or cops or firefighters or shipbuilders, and then folks who are doing really well don't have to do anything more. That's not fair, and it's not good for the economy. <p>And the other thing we've got to do is to stop having these crises manufactured every month. It seems like&mdash;I know you guys must get tired of it&mdash;didn't we just solve this thing? Now we've got another thing coming up? I mean, think about if Mike Petters ran his business this way: Once every month or two, there would be some crisis, and you wouldn't be sure whether or not you're working or not. Even if it got solved eventually or ultimately, it would be pretty discouraging on people. You would be less productive. Ships wouldn't get built as fast. You would waste money because you don't know exactly what to expect. Folks aren't sure: Am I showing up to work today, or not? If it's not a good way to run a business, it's sure not a good way to run a country. <p>Now, all of you, the American people, you've worked too hard for too long rebuilding and digging our way out of the financial crisis back in 2007 and 2008 just to have&mdash;to see Congress cause another one. The greatest nation on Earth can't keep on conducting its business drifting from one crisis to the next. <p>We've got to have a plan. We've got to invest in our common future. Our true north is a growing economy that creates good middle class jobs, a country that provides its people with the skills they need to get those jobs and makes sure that you're getting paid a decent wage for working hard so you can support your families. That's what we should be focused on right now&mdash;not weakening the economy&mdash;not laying people off. <p>That's what we should be talking about in Washington. And if you agree with me, I need you to make sure your voices are heard. Let your leaders know what you expect of them. Let them know what you believe. Let them know that what this country was built on was a sense of obligation to not just each other, but to future generations; that we've got to shoulder those obligations as one Nation and as one people. <p>I was in a conversation with some of the Governors from across the country yesterday, and I told them. I said, I've run my last election. Michelle is very happy about that. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm not interested in spin; I'm not interested in playing a blame game. At this point, all I'm interested in is just solving problems. All I'm interested in is making sure that when you get up early in the morning and get to this shift at 5:30 in the morning, that you know if you do a good job and if you work hard and if you're making sure that all the parts to this incredible ship that you're building is where they need to be&mdash;if you're doing what you do, then you can go home feeling satisfied. I did my job; I did my part. I can support my family. I can take pride in what I've done for this country. <p>That's all I want. I want us to be able to look back 5 years from now, 10 years from now, and say we took care of our business and we put an end to some of these games that maybe, I guess, are entertaining for some, but are hurting too many people. <p>But in order for us to make that happen, I'm going to need you. The one thing about being President is, after 4 years, you get pretty humble. [<i>Laughter</i>] You'd think maybe you wouldn't, but actually, you become more humble. You realize what you don't know. You realize all the mistakes you've made. But you also realize you can't do things by yourself. That's not how our system works. You've got to have the help and the goodwill of Congress, and what that means is you've got to make sure that constituents of Members of Congress are putting some pressure on them, making sure they're doing the right thing, putting an end to some of these political games. <p>So I need you, Virginia, to keep up the pressure. I need you to keep up the effort. I need you to keep up the fight. If you do, Congress will listen. If you stand up and speak out, Congress will listen. And together, we will unleash our true potential. And we'll remind the world just why it is the United States builds the greatest ships on Earth and is the greatest nation on Earth. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"36" "\"Thank you. Thank you very much. <p>Mr. Speaker, Leader Reid, Leader McConnell, Leader Pelosi, Assistant Leader Clyburn; to the friends and family of Rosa Parks; to the distinguished guests who are gathered here today. <p>This morning we celebrate a seamstress, slight in stature, but mighty in courage. She defied the odds, and she defied injustice. She lived a life of activism, but also a life of dignity and grace. And in a single moment, with the simplest of gestures, she helped change America&mdash;and change the world. <p>Rosa Parks held no elected office; she possessed no fortune, lived her life far from the formal seats of power. And yet today, she takes her rightful place among those who've shaped this Nation's course. I thank all those persons, in particular the members of the Congressional Black Caucus, both past and present, for making this moment possible. <p>A childhood friend once said about Mrs. Parks, \\"Nobody ever bossed Rosa around and got away with it.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] That's what an Alabama driver learned on December 1, 1955. Twelve years earlier, he had kicked Mrs. Parks off his bus simply because she entered through the front door when the back door was too crowded. He grabbed her sleeve, and he pushed her off the bus. It made her mad enough, she would recall, that she avoided riding his bus for a while. <p>And when they met again that winter evening in 1955, Rosa Parks would not be pushed. When the driver got up from his seat to insist that she give up hers, she would not be pushed. When he threatened to have her arrested, she simply replied, \\"You may do that.\\" And he did. <p>A few days later, Rosa Parks challenged her arrest. A little-known pastor, new to town and only 26 years old, stood with her, a man named Martin Luther King, Jr. So did thousands of Montgomery, Alabama, commuters: They began a boycott. Teachers and laborers, clergy and domestics, through rain and cold and sweltering heat, day after day, week after week, month after month, walking miles if they had to, arranging carpools where they could, not thinking about the blisters on their feet, the weariness after a full day of work. Walking for respect, walking for freedom, driven by a solemn determination to affirm their God-given dignity. <p>Three hundred and eighty-five days after Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat, the boycott ended. Black men and women and children reboarded the buses of Montgomery, newly desegregated, and sat in whatever seat happen to be open. And with that victory, the entire edifice of segregation, like the ancient walls of Jericho, began to slowly come tumbling down. <p>It's been often remarked that Rosa Parks's activism didn't begin on that bus. Long before she made headlines, she had stood up for freedom, stood up for equality: fighting for voting rights, rallying against discrimination in the criminal justice system, serving in the local chapter of the NAACP. Her quiet leadership would continue long after she became an icon of the civil rights movement, working with Congressman Conyers to find homes for the homeless, preparing disadvantaged youth for a path to success, striving each day to right some wrong somewhere in this world. <p>And yet our minds fasten on that single moment on the bus. Ms. Parks alone in that seat, clutching her purse, staring out a window, waiting to be arrested. That moment tells us something about how change happens, or doesn't happen; the choices we make, or don't make. \\"For now we see through a glass, darkly,\\" Scripture says, and it's true. Whether out of inertia or selfishness, whether out of fear or a simple lack of moral imagination, we so often spend our lives as if in a fog, accepting injustice, rationalizing inequity, tolerating the intolerable. <p>Like the busdriver, but also like the passengers on the bus, we see the way things are: children hungry in a land of plenty, entire neighborhoods ravaged by violence, families hobbled by job loss or illness. And we make excuses for inaction, and we say to ourselves: That's not my responsibility: there's nothing I can do. <p>Rosa Parks tell us there's always something we can do. She tells us that we all have responsibilities, to ourselves and to one another. She reminds us that this is how change happens, not mainly through the exploits of the famous and the powerful, but through the countless acts of often anonymous courage and kindness and fellow feeling and responsibility that continually, stubbornly expand our conception of justice, our conception of what is possible. <p>Rosa Parks's singular act of disobedience launched a movement. The tired feet of those who walked the dusty roads of Montgomery helped a nation see that to which it had once been blind. It is because of these men and women that I stand here today. It is because of them that our children grow up in a land more free and more fair&mdash;a land truer to its founding creed. <p>And that is why this statue belongs in this hall, to remind us, no matter how humble or lofty our positions, just what it is that leadership requires, just what it is that citizenship requires. Rosa Parks would have turned 100 years old this month. We do well by placing a statue of her here. But we can do no greater honor to her memory than to carry forward the power of her principle and a courage born of conviction. <p>May God bless the memory of Rosa Parks, and may God bless these United States of America.\" "
"37" "\"Thank you very much. Thank you. Please&mdash;I didn't think they were going to do the music. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Andrew, thank you very much for your introduction and your leadership. I want to say hello to everybody. Many of you I've known for a very long time, and some of you I've met more recently. But let me say at the top what I always like to emphasize when I get a chance to speak to our business leaders, and that is, I am very much rooting for your success, because what is absolutely true is that when your companies are thriving, when your bottom line is where it needs to be, then the possibilities of jobs and growth and people being able to achieve their dreams are greatly enhanced. <p>Now, the good news is, is that after 4 years of difficult times, we have seen a steady recovery, if not as robust as we would like. And we've seen over 6 million jobs created over the last 35 months. Housing is finally beginning to recover. There is reason for optimism as we move forward. <p>I think what everybody here is aware of, though, is that we've got a long way to go. Unemployment is still too high. Middle class families are still feeling enormous stresses and strains. And what I think everybody is concerned about is the enormous uncertainty in terms of the political framework, the tax framework, the debt framework within which all of you are going to be operating over the next several years. <p>And right now the biggest manifestation of that is the potential for a sequester that kicks in, starting at the end of this week. Now, I should point out and I'm sure you've heard from a number of experts and economists that this is not a cliff, but it is a tumble downward. It's conceivable that in the first week, the first 2 weeks, the first 3 weeks, the first month, that unless your business is directly related to the Defense Department, unless you live in a town that is directly impacted by a military installation, unless you're a family that now is trying to figure out where to keep your kids during the day because you just lost a Head Start slot, a lot of people may not notice the full impact of the sequester. <p>But this is going to be a big hit on the economy. And both private sector as well as public sector economists are estimating that we could lose as much as six-tenths of a point, maybe a little bit more, of economic growth. And that means, inevitably, hundreds of thousands of people who are not going to get jobs that otherwise would get them. It means that you have fewer customers with money in their pockets ready to buy your goods and services. It means that the global economy will be weaker, because although we obviously still have a long way to go in recovery, we're actually doing significantly better than some of the other developed nations. And the worst part of it is, it's entirely unnecessary. It's not what we should be doing. <p>I've said this before, I will say it again, and I suspect I will be repeating it during the question-and-answer session, but if you look right now at what our economy needs, taking $85 billion out of it over the next 6 months&mdash;indiscriminately, arbitrarily, without a strategy behind it&mdash;that's not a smart thing to do if we're serious about making sure that America grows and that our middle class is thriving and there are ladders of opportunity into the middle class. <p>What we should be doing&mdash;and what I've been calling for repeatedly over the last not just several months, but several years&mdash;is a balanced approach to deficit reduction that combines some tough spending cuts, particularly focused on how do we deal with long-term trends on some of our entitlement programs, and a tax reform agenda that without raising tax rates further could in fact raise sufficient revenues that combined would yield about $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade, would replace the sequester, would bring our deficit-to-GDP ratios below the 3 percent threshold that we need for stabilization, that would stabilize our debt-to-GDP ratios for the next decade, and would lay the groundwork for more expansive growth because we would have simplified our tax system, closed some loopholes, broadened our base, seen an opportunity for corporate tax reform that could also make the whole system more sensible and give you guys a more competitive posture internationally. That's what we should be doing. <p>Now, you'll be happy to know that that's what I offered to my Republican friends back in December after my election, before the fiscal cliff. Many of you were involved in voicing support for such a balanced approach, even if you didn't sign on to every detail and every line item in our recommended budget. And what I've said is that that continues to be the offer on the table. I am prepared to make some tough decisions, some of which will garner some significant frustration on the part of members of my party, but I think it's the right thing to do. <p>What I can't do is to abide by a set of decisions here in Washington that would put the entire burden of deficit reduction on our seniors, making their health care more expensive; students, that would make their student loans and going to college more expensive; that would gut our investments in education and research and infrastructure&mdash;all the foundations for long-term growth. That's not what we're going to do, because it wouldn't be good for the country, and frankly, it would not be good for your businesses. <p>Now, the question then becomes, how do we get from here to there? And I was telling Andrew before we came out, the issue is not technical, the issue is political. And the question is whether or not we are going to see a willingness on the part of all parties to compromise in a meaningful way. And what that means is Democrats have to accept the need for entitlement reform. But it also means that Republicans have to accept the need for additional revenues if we're going to be able to actually close this deficit and provide the kind of certainty that you need to make your long-term investments. <p>Whether that can be done in the next 2 days&mdash;I haven't seen things done in 2 days here in Washington in quite some time. On the other hand, the good news is that I think the public is beginning to pay attention to this, and one thing I'm certain about is that the country as a whole is weary of Washington for presiding over a manufactured crisis every 3 months. It's not good for business confidence. It's certainly not good for consumer confidence. It's unnecessary. <p>And my strong hope, and the case that I'm taking to the American people, is that we can once and for all resolve this in a way that is equitable, in a way that is focused on growth, in a way that provides opportunity for everybody in this country who's willing to work hard, regardless of what they look like or where they come from or what region of the country they live in. And it's right there. It's there for the taking. <p>And what I strongly believe is that if the business community speaks out for such a sensible, balanced, responsible approach, then eventually it will get done. I think it was Winston Churchill who once said that Americans always do the right thing after they've exhausted every other possibility. And we're getting to the point where we've now exhausted every other possibility. And I have confidence that what's been true for our country in the past will be true for this country in the future. <p>So with that, let me just open it up and take some questions. I think we're going to move the press out of the way. Thank you.\" "
"38" "\"Hi, everybody. On Friday, I met with leaders of both parties in Congress to try and find a way forward in light of the severe budget cuts, known in Washington as the sequester, that have already started to inflict pain on communities across the country. These cuts are not smart. They'll hurt our economy and cost us jobs. And Congress can turn them off at any time, as soon as both sides are willing to compromise. <p>As a nation, we've already fought back from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes and we'll get through this too. But at a time when our businesses are finally gaining some traction, hiring new workers, bringing jobs back to America, the last thing Washington should do is to get in their way. That's what these cuts to education and research and defense will do. It's unnecessary. And at a time when too many of our friends and neighbors are still looking for work, it's inexcusable. <p>Now, it's important to understand that, while not everyone will feel the pain of these cuts right away, the pain will be real. Many middle class families will have their lives disrupted in a significant way. Beginning this week, businesses that work with the military will have to lay folks off. Communities near military bases will take a serious blow. Hundreds of thousands of Americans who serve their country&mdash;Border Patrol agents, FBI agents, civilians who work for the Defense Department&mdash;will see their wages cut and their hours reduced. <p>This will cause a ripple effect across the economy. Businesses will suffer because customers will have less money to spend. The longer these cuts remain in place, the greater the damage. Economists estimate they could eventually cost us more than 750,000 jobs and slow our economy by over one-half of 1 percent. <p>Here's the thing: None of this is necessary. It's happening because Republicans in Congress chose this outcome over closing a single wasteful tax loophole that helps reduce the deficit. Just this week, they decided that protecting special interest tax breaks for the well off and well connected is more important than protecting our military and middle class families from these cuts. <p>I still believe we can and must replace these cuts with a balanced approach, one that combines smart spending cuts with entitlement reform and changes to our Tax Code that make it more fair for families and businesses without raising anyone's tax rates. That's how we can reduce our deficit without laying off workers or forcing parents and students to pay the price. I don't think that's too much to ask. It's the kind of approach I've proposed for 2 years now. A majority of the American people agree with me on this approach, including a majority of Republicans. We just need Republicans in Congress to catch up with their own party and the rest of the country. <p>Now, I know there are Republicans in Congress who would actually rather see tax loopholes closed than let these cuts go through. And I know there are Democrats who'd rather do smart entitlement reform than let these cuts go through. There's a caucus of common sense out there, and I'm going to keep reaching out to them to fix this for good. <p>Because the American people are weary of perpetual partisanship and brinksmanship. This is America, and in America, we don't just bounce from one manufactured crisis to another. We make smart choices: We plan, we prioritize. So I'm going to push through this paralysis and keep fighting for the real challenges facing middle class families. I'm going to keep pushing for high-quality preschool for every family that wants it and make sure the minimum wage becomes a wage you can live on. I'm going to keep pushing to fix our immigration system, repair our transportation system, and keep our children safe from gun violence. <p>That's the work you elected me to do. That's what I'm focused on every single day. Thanks so much.\" "
"39" "\"Well, this is my 17th meeting with my Cabinet; the first one in a second term. And obviously, we've got some familiar faces, we have some new faces, we have some familiar faces in new positions. I want to make sure that I say thank you to all of you for the work that you've already done and the work that you're going to be doing. <p>I want to welcome Jack Lew, former Chief of Staff and OMB Director and now Secretary of the Treasury. We're thrilled to have him in that position. I want to welcome Mr. Chuck Hagel, who's in the position of Secretary of Defense. And to all of you, I appreciate everything that you've done. <p>Obviously, we're going to be spending some time talking about the potential impact of the sequester on all the agencies and missions across the board. It is an area of deep concern, and I think everybody knows where I stand on this issue. We are going to manage it as best we can, to try to minimize the impacts on American families, but it's not the right way for us to go about deficit reduction. <p>It makes sense for us to take a balanced approach that takes a long view and doesn't reduce our commitment to things like education and basic research that will help us grow over the long term. And so I will continue to seek out partners on the other side of the aisle so that we can create the kind of balanced approach of spending cuts, revenues, entitlement reform that everybody knows is the right way to do things. <p>In the meantime, we're going to do our best to make sure that our agencies have the support they need to try to make some very difficult decisions, understanding that there are going to be families and communities that are hurt and that this will slow our growth. It will mean lower employment in the United States than otherwise would have been. <p>But we can manage through it, and we're going to rely on the outstanding leadership of all these agencies to make sure that we do whatever it is that we need to get done to help America's families. <p>Now, my agenda obviously is broader than just the sequester, because I laid out both in the Inauguration and during the State of the Union a very robust agenda to make sure that we're doing everything we can to grow this economy and to help families thrive and expand their opportunities. We want to make sure we've got a growing middle class and more ladders of opportunity into the middle class. <p>So in addition to talking about budget issues, we're also going to spend some time talking about making sure that we have comprehensive immigration reform done. And I want to again thank Members of Congress who on a bipartisan basis are moving forward on that agenda. We're going to have the opportunity to talk about initiatives like early childhood education that can have an enormous impact on our kids and, ultimately, our growth and productivity. We'll have a chance to hear from Joe and other members of the Cabinet about progress in reducing gun violence in this country. <p>So one of the things that I've instructed not just my White House, but every agency is to make sure that, regardless of some of the challenges that they may face because of sequestration, we're not going to stop working on behalf of the American people to make sure that we're doing everything we can to continue to grow this economy and improve people's prospects. All right. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"40" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. Thank you, everybody! Thank you. Well, please, everybody, have a seat. Have a seat. <p>I want to thank all of you for being here. I want to thank Secretary Salazar, my great friend, for letting us into the building. Make sure everybody picks up their stray soda cans and stuff afterwards. [<i>Laughter</i>] I want to thank Attorney General Holder for joining us. He's doing a great job. <p>We usually host these bill signings over at the White House, but there were just too many of you who helped to make this happen. [<i>Laughter</i>] And you all deserve to be a part of this moment. I want to thank everybody on this stage. Joe just mentioned the extraordinary work that each and every one of these leaders, both advocates as well as legislators&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Vice President Joe Biden.</i> And I left out Congressman Tom Cole. <p><i>The President.</i> Well, there you go. Give Tom a big round of applause. <p>But everybody on this stage worked extraordinarily hard. Most of all, though, this is your day. This is the day of the advocates, the day of the survivors: This is your victory. <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you, Mr. President! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back! <p>And this victory shows that when the American people make their voices heard, Washington listens. So I want to join Joe in thanking all the Members of Congress from both parties who came together, got this bill across the finish line. <p>I want to say a special thanks to Pat Leahy and Mike Crapo as well. Thank you, guys, for your leadership. And I want to give much love to Gwen Moore, who worked so hard on this. <p>And I also want to take a minute before I begin to thank the Senators who, just a few hours ago, took another big step towards sensible gun safety reforms by advancing a Federal gun trafficking bill. That's real progress. Now, the Senate Judiciary Committee sent legislation to the Senate floor that would crack down on folks who buy guns only to turn around and funnel them to dangerous criminals. <p>It's a bill named, in part, for Hadiya Pendleton, who was murdered in Chicago earlier this year. You'll remember I told this story about how she had marched in the Inauguration parade and just a few weeks later had been gunned down about a mile away from my house. <p>So I urge the Senate to give that bill a vote; I urge the House to follow suit. And I urge Congress to move on other areas that have support of the American people, from requiring universal background checks to getting assault weapons off our streets, because we need to stop the flow of illegal guns to criminals and because Hadiya's family and too many other families really do deserve a vote. <p>Finally, I want to thank Joe Biden for being such an outstanding Vice President. That's right, you can stand for Joe. Stand for Joe: Give it up for Joe Biden! Joe is a hard-working Vice President. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes, he is! <p><i>The President.</i> And he told me when he agreed&mdash;when I asked him to be Vice President, he said, \\"Well, I don't want to just be sitting around.\\" I said: \\"I promise you, I won't let you just sit around.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] And he has not. He has played a key role in forging the gun safety reforms that I talked about, largely by working closely with survivors of gun violence and their families. He forged the Violence Against Women Act 20 years ago, never forgetting who it was all about. <p>So on behalf of everybody here and all the lives that you've had a positive impact and touched through the Violence Against Women Act&mdash;the survivors who are alive today because of this law, the women who are no longer hiding in fear because of this law, the girls who are growing up aware of their right to be free from abuse because of this law&mdash;on behalf of them and all their families, I want to thank Joe Biden for making this one of the causes of his career. <p>Now, as Joe said earlier, we've come a long way. Back when Joe wrote this law, domestic abuse was too often seen as a private matter, best hidden behind closed doors. Victims too often stayed silent or felt that they had to live in shame, that somehow they had done something wrong. Even when they went to the hospital or the police station, too often they were sent back home without any real intervention or support. They felt trapped, isolated. And as a result, domestic violence too often ended in greater tragedy. <p>So one of the great legacies of this law is that it didn't just change the rules: It changed our culture. It empowered people to start speaking out. It made it okay for us, as a society, to talk about domestic abuse. It made it possible for us, as a country, to address the problem in a real and meaningful way. And it made clear to victims that they were not alone, that they always had a place to go, and they always had people on their side. <p>And today, because members of both parties worked together, we're able to renew that commitment. Reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act is something I called for in my State of the Union Address. And when I see how quick it got done, I'm feeling&mdash;makes me feel optimistic. <p>Because of this bill, we'll keep in place all the protections and services that Joe described, and, as he said, we'll expand them to cover even more women. Because this is a country where everybody should be able to pursue their own measure of happiness and live their lives free from fear, no matter who you are, no matter who you love. That's got to be our priority. That's what today is about. <p>Today is about the millions of women, the victims of domestic abuse and sexual assault, who are out there right now looking for a lifeline, looking for support. Because of this bill, they'll continue to have access to all the services that Joe first helped establish 19 years ago: the national hotline, network of shelters, protection orders that carry across State lines. And because of this bill, we're also expanding housing assistance so that no woman has to choose between a violent home and no home at all. That's what today is all about. <p>Today is about all the law enforcement officials like Police Chief Jim Johnson. They're the first to respond when a victim calls for help. And because of this bill, we're continuing all the training and support that's proven so effective in bridging some gaps that were in actual enforcement of the law so that we can actually bring more offenders to justice. And we're giving our law enforcement better tools to investigate cases of rape, which remains a consistently underreported crime in our country. Helping police officers deliver on the most important part of their job&mdash;preventing harm and saving lives&mdash;that's what today is all about. <p>Today is about women like Diane. I'm so grateful Diane shared her story. That takes great courage. And tragically, it is a common story. I know we've got tribal leaders here today, and I want to thank all of you for fighting so hard on behalf of your people to make this bill a reality. <p>Indian Country has some of the highest rates of domestic abuse in America. And one of the reasons is that when Native American women are abused on tribal lands by an attacker who is not Native American, the attacker is immune from prosecution by tribal courts. Well, as soon as I sign this bill, that ends. That ends, that ends. Tribal governments have an inherent right to protect their people, and all women deserve the right to live free from fear. And that is what today is all about. <p>Today is about all the Americans who face discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity when they seek help. So I want to thank Sharon Stapel, who's here. Where did she go? There she is, right there&mdash;for the work she's doing, the great work she's doing with the Anti-Violence Project. But Sharon and all the other advocates who are focused on this community, they can't do it alone. And then now they won't have to. That's what today is all about. That's what today is all about. <p>Today is about the women who come to Rosie Hidalgo looking for support, immigrants who are victims of domestic abuse. I mean, imagine the dilemma for so many: If your immigration status is tied to a husband who beats you or abuses you, if you're an undocumented immigrant, you may feel there's too much to lose by coming forward. The Violence Against Women Act already had protections so that victims could call the police without fear of deportation, and those protections saved lives. And because we fought hard to keep them in place, they remain a lifeline for so many women. That's part of what today is all about. <p>Today is about young women like Tye, who brought&mdash;who was brought into the sex trade by a neighbor when she was 12 years old. Tye was rescued with the help of an organization led by trafficking survivors. Today she's enrolled in college. She's working full-time to help at-risk girls stay out of the sex trade. Couldn't be prouder of her&mdash;so proud. So with this bill, we reauthorize the Trafficking Victims Protection Act to help more girls turn out like Tye. That's what today is all about. <p>So today is about all the survivors, all the advocates who are standing on this stage. But it's also about the millions more they represent, that you represent. It's about our commitment as a country to address this problem in every corner of America, every community, every town, every big city, as long as it takes. <p>And we've made incredible progress since 1994. But we cannot let up, not when domestic violence still kills three women a day, not when one in five women will be a victim of rape in their lifetime, not when one in three women is abused by a partner. <p>So I promise you, not just as your President, but as a son and a husband and a father, I'm going to keep at this. I know Vice President Biden is going to keep at it. My administration is going to keep at it for as long as it takes. <p>And I know that all the advocates up here, all the legislators, Republican and Democrat, who supported this, I know they could not be prouder of the work that they've done together. And I think I speak for all of them when we say we could not have done it without you. <p>So with that, let me sign this bill. <p>[<i>At this point, the President signed the bill.</i>]\" "
"41" "\"Before I begin, I know some of you have noticed that I'm dressed a little differently from the other gentlemen. Because of sequester, they cut my tails. My joke writers have been placed on furlough. [<i>Laughter</i>] I know a lot of you reported that no one will feel any immediate impact because of the sequester. Well, you're about to find out how wrong you are. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Of course, there's one thing in Washington that didn't get cut: the length of this dinner. Yet more proof that the sequester makes no sense. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>As you know, I last attended the Gridiron dinner 2 years ago. Back then, I addressed a number of topics: a dysfunctional Congress, a looming budget crisis, complaints that I don't spend enough time with the press. It's funny, it seems like it was just yesterday. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We noticed that some folks couldn't make it this evening. It's been noted that Bob Woodward sends his regrets, which Gene Sperling predicted. [<i>Laughter</i>] I have to admit this whole brouhaha had me a little surprised. Who knew Gene could be so intimidating? Or let me phrase it differently: Who knew anybody named Gene could be this intimidating? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, I know that some folks think we responded to Woodward too aggressively. But hey, when has&mdash;can anybody tell me when an administration has ever regretted picking a fight with Bob Woodward? What's the worst that could happen? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But don't worry. We're all friends again in the spirit of that wonderful song. As you may have heard, Bob invited Gene over to his place. And Bob says he actually thinks that I should make it too. And I might take him up on the offer. I mean, nothing says \\"not a threat\\" like showing up at somebody's house with guys with machine guns. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, since I don't often speak to a room full of journalists, I thought I should address a few concerns tonight. [<i>Laughter</i>] Some of you have said that I'm ignoring the Washington press corps, that we're too controlling. You know what, you were right. I was wrong, and I want to apologize in a video you can watch exclusively at whitehouse.gov. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>While we're on this subject, I want to acknowledge Ed Henry, who is here&mdash;who is the fearless leader of the Washington press corps now. And at Ed's request, tonight I will take one question from the press. Jay, do we have a question? [<i>Laughter</i>] Surprisingly, it's a question from Ed Henry. [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"Mr. President, will you be taking any questions tonight?\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm happy to answer that. No, Ed, I will not. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I also want to recognize David Corn. He's here from Mother Jones magazine. He brought his iPhone. So, Bobby Jindal, if you thought your remarks were off the record, ask Mitt Romney about that. <p>I have to say, I thought Bobby was incredibly funny this evening. I thought he was terrific. Amy Klobuchar was sparkling and fantastic and fabulous. I am worried about Al Franken though. [<i>Laughter</i>] How do you start off being one of the original writers for \\"Saturday Night Live\\" and end up being the second funniest Senator in Minnesota? [<i>Laughter</i>] How the mighty have fallen. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, I'm sure that you've noticed that there's somebody very special in my life who is missing tonight, somebody who has always got my back, stands with me no matter what, and gives me hope no matter how dark things seem. So tonight I want to publicly thank my rock, my foundation, thank you, Nate Silver. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Of course, as I begin my second term, our country is still facing enormous challenges. We have a lot of work to do. <p>[<i>At this point, the President took a sip of water.</i>] <p>That, Marco Rubio, is how you take a sip of water. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>As I was saying, we face major challenges. March, in particular, is going to be full of tough decisions. But I want to assure you, I have my top advisers working around the clock. After all, my March Madness bracket isn't going to fill itself out. [<i>Laughter</i>] And don't worry, there is an entire team in the Situation Room as we speak, planning my next golf outing, right now at this moment. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But those aren't the only issues on my mind. As you are aware&mdash;as has been noted this evening&mdash;we've had to make some very tough, huge budget cuts, apparently with no regard to long-term consequences, which means I know how you feel in journalism. [<i>Laughter</i>] I've been trying to explain this situation to the American people, but clearly I am not perfect. After a very public mixup last week, my communications team has provided me with an easy way to distinguish between \\"Star Trek\\" and \\"Star Wars.\\" Spock is what Maureen Dowd calls me. Darth Vader is what John Boehner calls me. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Of course, maintaining credibility in this cynical atmosphere is harder than ever, incredibly challenging. My administration recently put out a photo of me skeet shooting, and even that wasn't enough for some people. Next week, we're releasing a photo of me clinging to religion. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I'm also doing what I can to smooth things over with Republicans in Congress. In fact, these days, John McCain and I are spending so much time together that he told me we were becoming friends. I said: \\"John, stop. Chuck Hagel warned me how this ends up.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>It took a while, but I'm glad that the Senate finally confirmed my Secretary of Defense. And I have to say, I don't know what happened to Chuck in those hearings. I know he worked hard; he studied his brief. And I even lent him my Presidential debate team to work with him. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's confusing what happened. <p>But all these changes to my team are tough to handle, I've got to admit. After 9 years, I finally said goodbye to my chief speechwriter, Jon Favreau. I watched him grow up. He's almost like a son to me, he's been with me so long. And I said to him when he first informed me of his decision, I said, \\"Favs, you can't leave.\\" And he answered with three simple words: \\"Yes I can.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Fortunately, he did not take the prompter on his way out. That would have been a problem. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>With all these new faces, it's hard to keep track of who is in, who is out. And I know it's difficult for you guys as reporters. But I can offer you an easy way of remembering the new team. If Ted Cruz calls somebody a communist, then you know they're in my Cabinet. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Jack Lew is getting started on his new role as Treasury Secretary. Jack is so low key, he makes Tim .Geithner look like Tom Cruise. [<i>Laughter</i>] Don't worry, everybody, Jack signed off on that joke, or a 5-year-old drew a Slinky. [<i>Laughter</i>] I don't know which. <p>Another big change has been at the State Department. Everybody has noticed that obviously. And let's face it: Hillary is a tough act to follow. But John Kerry is doing great so far. He is doing everything he can to ensure continuity. Frankly, though, I think it's time for him to stop showing up at work in pantsuits. It's a disturbing image. [<i>Laughter</i>] It really is. I don't know where he buys them. He is a tall guy. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And even though I'm just beginning my second term, I know that some folks are looking ahead to bigger things. Look, it's no secret that my Vice President is still ambitious. But let's face it, his age is an issue. Just the other day, I had to take Joe aside and say, \\"Joe, you are way too young to be the Pope.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"You can't do it. You got to mature a little bit.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, I do want to end on a serious note. I know that there are people who get frustrated with the way journalism is practiced these days. And sometimes those people are me. [<i>Laughter</i>] But the truth is, our country needs you and our democracy needs you. <p>In an age when all it takes to attract attention is a Twitter handle and some followers, it's easier than ever to get it wrong. But it's more important than ever to get it right. And I am grateful for all the journalists who do one of the toughest jobs there is with integrity and insight and dedication&mdash;and a sense of purpose&mdash;that goes beyond a business model or a news cycle. <p>This year alone, reporters have exposed corruption here at home and around the world. They've risked everything to bring us stories from places like Syria and Kenya, stories that need to be told. And they've helped people understand the ways in which we're all connected: how something that happens or doesn't happen halfway around the world or here in Washington can have consequences for American families. <p>These are extraordinary times. The stakes are high and the tensions can sometimes be high as well. But while we'll always have disagreements, I believe that we share the belief that a free press&mdash;a press that questions us, that holds us accountable, that sometimes gets under our skin&mdash;is absolutely an essential part of our democracy. <p>So I want to thank everybody for not just a wonderful evening&mdash;and, Chuck, I want to thank you for your outstanding presidency&mdash;but I also just want to thank you for the work that you do each and every day. And in the words of one of my favorite \\"Star Trek\\" characters, Captain James T. Kirk of the USS <i>Enterprise</i>, \\"May the force be with you.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>]\" "
"42" "\"Hi, everybody. As I've said before, my top priority as President is making sure we do everything we can to reignite the true engine of America's economic growth: a rising, thriving middle class. <p>Yesterday we received some welcome news on that front. We learned that our businesses added nearly 250,000 new jobs last month. The unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent: still too high, but now lower than it was when I took office. <p>Our businesses have created jobs every month for 3 years straight, nearly 6.4 million new jobs in all. Our manufacturers are bringing jobs back to America. Our stock market has rebounded. New homes are being built and sold at a faster pace. And we need to do everything we can to keep that momentum going. <p>That means asking ourselves three questions every day: How do we make America a magnet for new jobs? How do we equip more of our people with the skills those jobs require? And how do we make sure that your hard work leads to a decent living? <p>And that has to be our driving focus, our north star. And at a time when our businesses are gaining a little more traction, the last thing we should do is allow Washington politics to get in the way. You deserve better than the same political gridlock and refusal to compromise that has too often passed for serious debate over the last few years. <p>And that's why I've been reaching out to Republicans and Democrats to see if we can untangle some of the gridlock. Earlier this week, for example, I met with some Republican Senators to see if there were smarter ways to grow our economy and reduce our deficits than the arbitrary cuts and the so-called sequester that recently went into place. We had an open and honest conversation about critical issues like immigration reform and gun violence, and other areas where we can work together to move this country forward. And next week, I'll attend both the Democratic and Republican Party meetings in the Capitol to continue those discussions. <p>The fact is, America is a nation of different beliefs and different points of view. That's part of what makes us strong and, frankly, makes our democratic debates messy and, a lot of times, pretty frustrating. But ultimately, what makes us special is when we summon the ability to see past those differences and come together around the belief that what binds us together will always be more powerful than what drives us apart. <p>As Democrats and Republicans, we may disagree on the best way to achieve our goals, but I'm confident we can agree on what those goals should be: a strong and vibrant middle class; an economy that allows businesses to grow and thrive; an education system that gives more Americans the skills they need to compete for the jobs of the future; an immigration system that actually works for families and businesses; stronger communities; and safer streets for our children. <p>Making progress on these issues won't be easy. In the months ahead, there will be more contentious debate and honest disagreement between principled people who want what's best for this country. But I still believe that compromise is possible. I still believe we can come together to do big things. And I know there are leaders on the other side of the aisle who share that belief. <p>So I'll keep fighting to solve the real challenges facing middle class families. And I'll enlist anyone who is willing to help. That's what this country needs right now, and that's what you deserve. <p>Thanks so much.\" "
"43" "\"<i>The President.</i> I want to get back to the official business at hand. But I did want to stop by. First of all, I just want to say thanks to the PEC for the unbelievable work that you guys have done and the extraordinary leadership that you've provided to our team and the administration as we've tried to promote exports all around the world. And I'm glad to see that we've got a couple of our outstanding Senators here as well who, I know, care deeply about exports because their States benefit from exports. We all do. <p>And I assume that part of these charts was Becky going over, the progress that we've made over the last several years, so I won't reiterate it. The good news is we are well on our way to meeting a very ambitious goal that we set several years ago to double U.S. exports. And what we know is, is that a lot of the growth, a lot of the new jobs that we've seen during the course of this recovery, have been export driven. <p>What's also encouraging is it's been coming from a whole variety of sectors. Obviously, our agricultural sector has always been strong, and it's gotten even stronger. But what we've also seen is, is that our manufacturing base, our high-tech, our services across the board, we're seeing significant increases. And the question now becomes how do we sustain this momentum? <p>Part of it is making sure that we get in place strong trade deals. And having ratified with the help of a number of our legislators the Panama, Colombia and, most significantly, South Korean trade deals, we've now been moving aggressively on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a high-standards trade regime that, we think, can advantage U.S. companies and U.S. workers because it sets a bar that ensures that trade is fair and free. And for those of us who abide by high labor standards and high environmental standards, obviously being able to lock in those kinds of high standards in the fastest growing region of the world and the most populous region of the world can yield enormous benefits and help to generate billions of dollars in trade and millions of jobs. <p>As I announced at the State of the Union Address, we're also going to be launching an effort to lock in a EU-U.S. trade deal as well. And already, Europe is our largest trading partner&mdash;the EU as a whole&mdash;and we think that we can expand that even further. And some of this has to do with us being able to break down some existing barriers across the Atlantic to U.S. products and services, but some of it also has to do with smoothing out differences in regulatory approaches, just trade frictions that arise that are unnecessary that are&mdash;carries over from earlier periods. And we think just as the TPP can be an enormous boost to U.S. trade and growth, that our trade with Europe can expand substantially and that will advantage U.S. companies and U.S. businesses. <p>But in order for us to do this, we're going to need the help of industry and labor and all the parties that are represented here. One of the things that we've also been trying to do during the course of this process is to make sure that it's not just the Xeroxes and the Dow Chemicals that are benefiting from this, although we want our Fortune 100 companies to be selling as much as possible. They also have a whole lot of suppliers, so small businesses stand to benefit immensely from this process. We actually think that there's room for small and medium-size businesses to export directly, not just supplying large businesses, but also to break open and enter into these markets. And that can make a huge difference in terms of our long-term prospects. <p>So overall, this is a good story, this is an optimistic story, but it's one that we're going to have to continue to sustain. <p>One last point, just because I had a chance to see Bob. I think many of you are aware of the fact that when tourists come here and spend money, that's an export. That goes on the export side of the ledger. And thanks to some of the great work that we've done in a public-private partnership, we've been able to accelerate visas. We've been able to make sure that we are out there actively seeking visitors to come here and promoting the U.S. as a tourist destination. <p>Just to give you a small example&mdash;something that I didn't realize until I went to Disneyworld&mdash;it turns out that in Florida, for example, Brazilians are the fastest growing&mdash;one of the largest sources of tourism in Florida. And by the way, when they come, they stay a lot longer, and they spend a lot more money. <p>The problem we had was we had, I think, three places&mdash;three places&mdash;to get visas in all of Brazil, which is a pretty big country. And so we've been able to cut down visa times drastically. We've seen as a consequence some significant expansion in tourism out of South America because of some of the steps that we've taken. That's the kind of smart, very cost-effective set of steps that we can take that can make a big difference. <p>And a lot of those ideas have been generated from this group. So I just want to say thank you to all of the terrific people who have been involved, and I'm looking forward to us just staying on this thing until we get it right. Okay? <p><i>President's Export Council Chairman W. James McNerney, Jr.</i> Great to have you here. <p><i>The President.</i> Good to be here. <p><i>Chairman McNerney.</i> We discussed a lot of the FTA momentum that was started during your first term and now you're doubling down in the second term, and many of us around the room are very supportive and delighted to be part of the effort. <p>I think maybe just another word or two on the European effort from your point of view. TPP, I think we all get, we're working on, we're in the flow. The European thing, because it is a stalled, back-and-forth situation right now because of their economy, just wondered what the theory of the case was from your&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The President.</i> Here's why we're modestly optimistic that we can get this done. I think in the past, the EU, because they've got to coordinate among so many countries, consistently had to pursue the lowest common denominator. And there are certain countries who&mdash;whose agricultural sector is very strong, who tended to block at critical junctures the kinds of broad-based trade agreements that would make it a good deal for us. If one of the areas where we've got the greatest comparative advantage is cordoned off from an overall trade deal, it's very hard to get something going. <p>What I think has changed is the recognition throughout Europe that it is hard for them to figure out a recipe for growth at this point, in part because of the austerity measures that have been put in place throughout the euro zone, in the absence of a more aggressive trade component. So I think they are hungrier for a deal than they have been in the past. <p>I think, thanks to the work of good people like Mike Froman, we've been able to narrow some of the differences. We've identified on the regulatory side, customs side, areas where we can synchronize without hurting either side, but simply lubricating more effective trade between the two countries. <p>So we've narrowed down the issues. I think it will still be a heavy slog. There's no guarantee that in the end, some of the countries that have been hard cases in the past won't block it again, but I think that you're going to see more pressure from more countries on the other side of the Atlantic to get this done than we've seen in the past. <p>Lael, Mike, is that a fair assessment? These guys spend more time in Europe than I do. <p><i>Deputy National Security Adviser for International Economic Affairs Michael Froman. </i>Yes. <p><i>Chairman McNerney.</i> Do you have time to take a couple questions&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The President.</i> Sure. <p><i>Chairman McNerney.</i> &mdash;&mdash;from the group? Anybody care to weigh in? <p><i>The President.</i> Or comments. <p><i>Chairman McNerney.</i> Or comments? Sure. <p><i>The President.</i> Everybody is just dying to get back to Becky's charts. [<i>Laughter</i>] They're nice-looking charts. <p><i>Sen. Amy J. Klobuchar.</i> They're very good. Mr. President, thank you for your leadership on this issue. And I just think setting that goal of doubling the exports was one that many of us have used over and over again. And many of us were talking about the need for more kids to go into science, engineering, technology. We are&mdash;literally have so many jobs that are unfilled right now, particularly in western Minnesota, and I think finding some simple goal like that of getting the increase in the number of kids going into these areas and selling it as something that they want to do would be a good idea. <p>And I wanted to commend the State Department&mdash;I did earlier&mdash;for the work on the visas. I still think there's so much more that can be done. We've doubled&mdash;doubled&mdash;the tourism. It's up 50 percent from China. And I think that there's even obviously more that we can do with videoconferencing on visa interviews, other things that we should try to use the technology that we have. <p>As you've noted, people are spending tons of money going to Disneyland; I would also add going to the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;a hot spot for Asia tourists, especially. Not as much Brazilians; it's too cold in our State for them. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I see so much promise here with the tourism. <p>And the last is what you mentioned, this growing political support for fair trade agreements is huge. And it's about the big companies, but when people see in their own towns these small and medium-sized companies where their brothers and sisters work, it creates a kind of support for trade that is much more organic and really goes in a grassroots way across the country. And I think we have to remember that as a piece of what's good for the economy, but also it will grow support for this new global economy. <p>So I just want to thank you for your efforts and hope that we can look at this&mdash;the workforce training issue&mdash;in a different way in terms of setting some goals for these kids so they see it as a career opportunity. <p><i>The President.</i> Well, look, what's absolutely true is that exports, trade are one brick in this broader economic foundation that we're trying to build. But we're not going to succeed in meeting our export goals if we're not making great products and delivering great services. And we're not going to be able to do that unless we've got a great workforce. <p>You may want to come with me, because I'm&mdash;after this I'm about to go these Intel National Science Award winners, where you meet 15- and 16-year-olds who invents plasmas&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and cure cancer, and most of the time, I have no idea what they're talking about. [L<i>aughter</i>] But they're very impressive and inspiring. <p>We are setting a set of goals for STEM education, number of engineers that we need to produce. All that stuff is going to be important. But what we also&mdash;one of the things that I've also been pointing out, when you look at a lot of those jobs that go unfilled, they're not necessarily Ph.D. jobs. The issue here is can we reintroduce an effective model for vocational training where&mdash;and part of the goal that we've set for ourselves with respect to high schools is duplicating some of the things that are being done, for example, by IBM, where they go into a high school in New York, and they say, we'll train you, and during high school, you will get the equivalent of an associate's degree so that by the time you graduate, maybe you take 2 years of community college, you are now fully trained for jobs that we know are out there and that people are hiring for, which makes the kids more engaged in high school, saves them money, reduces the number of Pell grants they're taking out. It's a win-win situation for everybody. And the employers then have great quality control in terms of knowing who it is that they're getting. <p>We want to see if we can duplicate that across the board. <p>Yes, Kirsten. <p><i>Sen. Kirsten E. Gillibrand</i>. Well, I want to thank you, Mr. President, for your vision because I am telling you it's making an absolute difference in my own State in high-tech manufacturing and increasing our exports. <p>We also had an easy win&mdash;I appreciate the leadership you took with regard to Canada, something so parochial, so easy&mdash;but increasing our exports to Canada. For New York State to have Montreal and Toronto a stone's throw away is such a huge market for our entrepreneurs. <p>And some work still can be done. There's no streamlining of what governmental requirements are required on both sides of the border, and that's something that we can actually fix: making a one-stop shop for a young entrepreneur who's starting a business who wants to know what forms do I have to fill out to export my product abroad. That's a place where we have enormous export potential. <p>And even just in agricultural products, for apples that are going from New York to Canada, they have to be inspected on both sides of the border. Unnecessary. So there's some real streamlining I think we could do, to increase exports just between those two areas of the country. <p>But I just want to thank you, because, as Amy said, in terms of filling these jobs, what's really worked is part of your initiatives of allowing the community colleges to work directly with the manufacturers to build the course work for the job the manufacturer needs. <p>And we had a fantastic example where Bombardier, who builds a lot of things, including subways, needed advanced welders. Well, they want to Adirondack Community College, built the course work, and those employees got their training, got a higher wage, and filled the spots. And so it's really exciting what you're doing in education innovation, which is training the people for the jobs that are available with the collaboration of the employers building the course work. It's a win-win for everybody. And I just want to congratulate you for your vision on that issue. <p><i>The President.</i> Great. <p>A couple more? <p><i>Mayor Alvin Brown of Jacksonville, FL</i>. Mr. President, I want to thank you for supporting the U.S. Conference of Mayors for the ports. Ports are a big economic engine in our cities, and they really focus on small business and entrepreneurs, helping them to export. So I want to thank you for that. <p>I know the policy you pushed to allow the study to be released early from the Army Corps of Engineers, which helped Jacksonville, Florida, by the way. Really appreciate that. Florida is very important. And like you said with Brazil, which is Florida's number-one trading partner, so we really appreciate your support on the ports and modernizing the port so that we can compete and position cities to really be competitive in the marketplace. <p><i>The President.</i> Well, one of the things that we talked about is if we're going to export effectively, we've got to have effective infrastructure. The ports issue all around the Gulf is going to be critical. The Panama Canal is being modified. You're going to have bigger ships coming in. And if you want to unload those ships, you got to have high-quality ports. That obviously is a gateway for everything that's happening in Central and South America. <p>Recently, we had the challenge of&mdash;I know I talked to Pat about this&mdash;getting goods from the Midwest down the Mississippi when the water started going down. And if, in fact, temperatures are warming&mdash;I know this is not our climate change meeting&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but I think we can anticipate that we may end up having some challenges in terms of managing our waterways. Well, whether or not we can continue to use barges to move a lot of product out of the American heartland to ports around the world, that's going to depend on our infrastructure. <p>So we are going to, in our budget, continue to push Congress to see if we can essentially deal with deferred maintenance. Sometimes, when it comes to Government spending, everybody thinks it's all the same. I think everybody around this table knows in your businesses, you think very differently about capital investments, long-term investments that are going to make your company more competitive, versus wasting money. And here's an example of where we should be doing less of some things that are not helping us grow. Building infrastructure is something that does help us grow. Okay? <p>All right, guys, I think you've got smarter people around the table than me to deal with some of these issues. Again, I just want to thank all of you who've been involved. We are going to continue to push this agenda. <p>One of the things I hope that you've seen during the course of these last 4 years is that if we hear good ideas, we'll implement them, we'll move them. So the great thing about a council like this is that it gives us insight into how things are actually operating or not operating, and we can start cutting through some of the redtape and get things done. <p>So continue to provide us with recommendations. We'll work them through. There's an interagency process; it's a good way for us to break down some of the silos that develop between various agencies. And I think we can make significant improvement and continue to build on the goals that we've set. <p>Thank you, everybody.\" "
"44" "\"Hello, everybody. Hello, hello. Thank you. Everybody have a seat. Have a seat. <p>Well, it's good to see all of you. I missed you. [<i>Laughter</i>] The&mdash;let me first of all thank Jim and Jon for organizing this. I want to thank all of you. I've got a bunch of friends in this room: people who have supported me even before I ran for President, new friends, old friends, everybody here in it for the right reasons, folks who care deeply about this country and want to see us to continue to move forward. <p>I said in 2008&mdash;and I'm pretty sure I repeated in 2012&mdash;that you run elections not simply to get elected. You run elections to have an opportunity to deliver on behalf of the American people. And the central premise of our campaign was always that this great country of ours is built on some foundational ideas, the most important of which is that anybody, anywhere, if they're willing to work hard and take responsibility, can succeed, and that if we've got a growing, thriving middle class and ladders of opportunity into the middle class, then nobody can beat us. That's the reason why we attracted immigrants from every corner of the world. That's the reason why our culture has always been viewed as dynamic and forward looking: not looking backwards, but consistently looking at that next horizon. <p>And the good news is that America in 2013 is poised, as it always has been, to succeed in ways that will make us the envy of the world if we make good policy decisions. <p>Since the election, since I saw many of you, we've made some progress on some fronts. We have seen that there's actually a bipartisan commitment&mdash;at least in the Senate&mdash;to potentially overhaul our immigration system so that we can continue to attract the best and brightest from around the world. <p>We are having terrific conversations around issues like cybersecurity and how we make sure that people's privacy and civil liberties are protected, but how we also protect our critical infrastructure and we make sure that the power of the Internet isn't used for ill as well as good. <p>We've seen some progress after the heartbreaking tragedy of Newtown, where people finally say we can do something about gun violence in a way that's respectful of the Second Amendment, but insists that no society should tolerate our children being gunned down, whether it's on the streets or in their classrooms. <p>And when it comes to issues of the budget, we've made progress in making sure that those at the very top are paying a greater share of what is required to run a Government and fund basic research, move education forward. <p>And so we've seen some progress. And I laid out in both the Inauguration and in the State of the Union a vision that doesn't require massive expansion of Government, but does require us to do certain things that we can't do as well by ourselves: whether it's providing early childhood education; whether it's investing in infrastructure so that our businesses can move goods and services more rapidly around the world; whether it's continuing to expand our manufacturing base and encouraging insourcing and not just outsourcing; whether it's making sure that we continue to be at the cutting edge of science and technology and research; or whether we are going to choose an energy future that doesn't just look at the energy source of the past, but also looks at the energy sources of tomorrow and addresses climate change in a serious way. <p>And some people remarked that I looked&mdash;I had a little more pep in my step in the Inauguration and in the State of the Union. And I have to tell you, it wasn't because I was off the campaign trail, because actually nothing energizes me like interacting with the American people day in and day out. The reason was I felt like this is a vision that, if we can get it implemented, really would allow America to take off. <p>Our economy is recovering. It is resilient. But it is not yet where it needs to be. We've got millions of people who are still out of work or underemployed. We've still got businesses that could be thriving if we were able to make sure that Washington doesn't engage in self-induced crises. <p>And so we're going to have a lot of work to do. And let's face it, there are still a lot of divisions and arguments here in Washington. And although we are doing our very best to reach out to the other side, and I think there's a genuine desire on the part of Republicans and Democrats to try to get something done, I think there is a weariness among membership in the Senate and in the House about this constant grind, day in, day out of argument and crises instead of productivity and movement forward. <p>The politics of a lot of these issues are tough, and Members sometimes are scared about making the right decisions. And they're particularly scared because they're subject to pressure from special interest groups and well-financed organizations that may be pushing in a different direction. <p>And so I think the idea here, the concept is, we've got 20 million people who got involved in the campaign or close to it. We have 4 million people who actively contributed to the campaign in $5 and $10 and $25 increments. Now, a sizable portion of those just wanted dinner with George Clooney&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but I think there was a large number of them that believed in our vision for the future as well. <p>And part of what Jim and Jon and I have spoken about is just how do we make sure that people stay involved? How do we make sure all those neighborhood groups are engaged, feel a sense of connection? We did not do as good of a job in 2008 as I would have hoped in making sure they still felt a part of the process. <p>And it's not just a matter of lobbying Congress. It's a matter of them taking ownership so that if we're setting up health care exchanges in their States, maybe they want to contact some friends in their&mdash;or neighbors who don't have health care and say, you know what, here's something that might help you. If we've got a disaster like we had during Sandy, is that community built in that allows us to go out and immediately help relief efforts. Can we sustain and maintain the sense of citizenship that arose during the course of the campaign outside of a campaign structure, outside of the immediate, okay, we're trying to win this many votes in this many States, but can, instead, we activate people around an agenda? <p>I think here in Washington, this idea has been viewed with puzzle&mdash;some both suspicion and people have been puzzled about what it is that we're trying to do. Because the usual idea is, well, this must just be a mechanism to try to win the next election in 2014. And what we've tried to explain to people is, is that, no, I actually just want to govern&mdash;at least for a couple of years&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but I also want to make sure that the voices of ordinary people are heard in the debates that are going to be taking place. <p>If you have a Senator or a Congressman in a swing district who is prepared to take a tough vote&mdash;or what they consider to be a tough vote&mdash;on immigration reform or legislation around background checks for guns, I want to make sure that they feel supported and that they know that there are constituencies of theirs who agree with them, even if they may be getting a lot of pushback in that district. If we move aggressively on an issue like climate change, that's not an easy issue for a lot of folks, because the benefits may be out in the future. And I want to make sure that a Congressman, Senator feels as if they've got the information and the grassroots network that's going to support them in that effort. <p>And so that more than anything is what inspired this idea. What we want is to make sure that the voices of the people who put me here continue to be heard: that they're not just heard during election time; that they're not just heard in terms of dollar solicitations; that we are helping to build or sustain a network of citizens who have a voice in the most critical debates that are going to be taking place over the next year and year and a half, and if it works, potentially beyond. <p>So that's part of the reason why I'm excited about this and why I'm so grateful that all of you are participating. One of the things I'm proudest of during the course of two campaigns, where we raised an awful lot of money, is that the people who got involved didn't ask me for stuff, except to be true to my vision and true to our agenda. <p>And all of you represent, like it or not, a bunch of true believers who got involved and are still here after all the ups and downs of the campaign. Well, there are going to be ups and downs in terms of governing as well. But if we do it well, then I'm confident that we can move strong immigration legislation through Congress. I'm confident that we can get commonsense gun safety legislation through Congress. I am confident that we can craft a budget that is responsible and reduces our deficit, but also makes sure that we're investing in those things we need to grow and that our basic safety&mdash;social safety net is preserved. But I can't do that by myself. <p>So I'll just close with this comment. You remember during the campaign, at one point I was asked about gridlock in Washington, and I said one of the lessons I've learned in my first 4 years is that you can't change Washington from the inside. And some people took that as saying, oh, Obama has given up and you know&mdash;no. That's what I've always claimed. <p>I've always said that I am representing people, and that change comes about because people are activated, people are involved. People shape the agenda. People determine the framework for debate. People let their Members of Congress know what is that they believe. And when those voices are heard, you can't stop it. That's when change happens. <p>Well, what was true back in 2008 is just as true today. And what we don't want to do is repeat the mistake, I think, that I believe in 2008 we made, where some of that energy just kind of dissipated and where we're only playing an inside game, and I'm sitting in a room with a bunch of folks negotiating all the time, but those voices are no longer heard. <p>Over the last several weeks, the press here in Washington has been reporting about Obama's charm offensive. Well, the truth of the matter is all I've been doing is just calling up folks and trying to see if we can break through some of the gobbledygook of our politics here. And I do believe that&mdash;at this juncture, one of the things I believe is that we've got to get Members of Congress involved in these discussions, not just leadership. Because I think a lot of them feel as if they don't have the opportunity to break out of some of this partisan gridlock. And ironically, I actually think some of the leadership want their membership to create a permission structure. They don't like getting too far ahead of their leadership. So we're reaching out to these individual Members so that they create a space where things can get done. <p>But the same principle applies doubly when it comes to the American people. And the only idea here that we're promoting is the notion that if the American people are speaking out, organized, activated, that may give space here in Washington to do the kind of work&mdash;hopefully, bipartisan work&mdash;that's required. But in order to do that I'm going to need all your help. <p>I used to say that being friends with a politician is like perpetually having a kid in college, because you're writing checks all the time and it doesn't seem like the kid ever graduates. Well, I've graduated. [<i>Laughter</i>] I've run my last campaign. But we're not done with the work that led me to run in the first place. And I'm hopeful that with your continued ideas and support, your voices, that we can continue to make progress over the next several years. All right? <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"45" "\"Hello, everybody! Hello, Illinois! Hello! It is good to be home! <p>Well, let me begin by thanking Ann for the great introduction, the great work she's doing, the leadership she's showing with her team on so many different, amazing technological breakthroughs. I want to thank Dr. Isaacs and Dr. Crabtree for giving me a great tour of your facilities. <p>It's not every day that I get to walk into a thermal test chamber. [<i>Laughter</i>] I told my girls that I was going to go into a thermal test chamber and they were pretty excited. I told them I'd come out looking like the Hulk. [<i>Laughter</i>] They didn't believe that. But&mdash;&mdash; <p>I want to thank my friend and your friend&mdash;a truly great U.S. Senator, Senator Dick Durbin&mdash;huge supporter of Argonne. An outstanding Member of Congress who actually could explain some of the stuff that's going on here, Bill Foster is here. Congressman Bobby Rush, a big supporter of Argonne, glad he's here. We've got a number of State and local officials with us, including your mayor, Brian Reaves. <p>And I could not come to Argonne without bringing my own Nobel Prize-winning scientist, someone who has served our country so well over the past 4 years, our Energy Secretary, Dr. Steven Chu. <p>Now, I'm here today to talk about what should be our top priority as a nation, and that's reigniting the true engine of America's economic growth: a rising, thriving middle class and an economy built on innovation. In my State of the Union Address, I said our most important task was to drive that economic growth, and I meant it. And every day, we should be asking ourselves three questions: How do we make America a magnet for good jobs? How do we equip our people with the skills and training to do those jobs? And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living? <p>Oh, those of you who have chairs&mdash;I wasn't sure everybody had chairs there. [<i>Laughter</i>] Please feel free to sit down, I'm sorry. Everybody was standing, and I thought Argonne&mdash;one of the effects of the sequester, you had to&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;get rid of chairs. That's good. I'm glad we've got some chairs. <p>So I chose Argonne National Lab because right now few areas hold more promise for creating good jobs and growing our economy than how we use American energy. <p>After years of talking about it, we're finally poised to take control of our energy future. We produce more oil than we have in 15 years. We import less oil than we have in 20 years. We've doubled the amount of renewable energy that we generate from sources like wind and solar, with 10,000&mdash;tens of thousands of good jobs to show for it. We're producing more natural gas than we ever have before, with hundreds of thousands of good jobs to show for it. We supported the first new nuclear power plant in America since the 1970s. And we're sending less carbon pollution into the environment than we have in nearly 20 years. <p>So we're making real progress across the board. And it's possible, in part, because of labs like this and outstanding scientists like so many of you, entrepreneurs, innovators&mdash;all of you who are working together to take your discoveries and turn them into a business. <p>So think about this: Just a few years ago, the American auto industry was flatlining. Today, thanks in part to discoveries made right here at Argonne, some of the most high-tech, fuel-efficient, pretty spiffy cars in the world are once again designed, engineered, and built here in the United States. <p>And that's why we have to keep investing in scientific research. It's why we have to maintain our edge, because the work you're doing today will end up in the products that we make and sell tomorrow. You're helping to secure our energy future. And if we do it well, then that's going to help us avoid some of the perils of climate change and leave a healthier planet for our kids. But to do it, we've got to make sure that we're making the right choices in Washington. <p>Just the other day, Dr. Isaacs and directors of two of our other national laboratories wrote about the effects of the so-called sequester&mdash;these across-the-board budget cuts put in place 2 weeks ago&mdash;and specifically, the effects it will have on America's scientific research. And one of the reasons I was opposed to these cuts is because they don't distinguish between wasteful programs and vital investments. They don't trim the fat; they cut into muscle and into bone, like research and development being done right here that not only gives a great place for young researchers to come and ply their trade, but also ends up creating all kinds of spinoffs that create good jobs and good wages. <p>So Dr. Isaacs said these cuts will force him to stop any new project that's coming down the line. And I'm quoting him now, he says, \\"This sudden halt on new starts will freeze American science in place while the rest of the world races forward, and it will knock a generation of young scientists off their stride, ultimately costing billions of dollars in missed future opportunities.\\" I mean, essentially because of this sequester, we're looking at 2 years where we don't start new research. And at a time when every month you've got to replace your smartphone because something new has come up, imagine what that means when China and Germany and Japan are all continuing to plump up their basic research and we're just sitting there doing nothing. <p>We can't afford to miss these opportunities while the rest of the world races forward. We have to seize these opportunities. I want the next great job-creating breakthroughs&mdash;whether it's in energy or nanotechnology or bioengineering&mdash;I want those breakthroughs to be right here in the United States of America, creating American jobs and maintaining our technological lead. <p>So I just want to be clear: These cuts will harm, not help, our economy. They aren't the smart way to cut our deficits. And that's why I'm reaching out to Republicans and Democrats to come together around a balanced approach, a smart, phased-in approach to deficit reduction that includes smart spending cuts and entitlement reforms and new revenue, and that won't hurt our middle class or slow economic growth. And if we do that, then we can move beyond governing from crisis to crisis to crisis, and we keep our focus on policies that actually create jobs and grow our economy and move forward to face all of the other challenges we face, from fixing our broken immigration system to educating our kids to keeping them safe from gun violence. <p>And few pieces of business are more important for us than getting our energy future right. So here at Argonne and other labs around the country, scientists are working on getting us where we need to get 10 years from now, 20 years from now. Today, what most Americans feel first when it comes to energy prices&mdash;or energy issues are prices that they pay at the pump. And over the past few weeks, we saw&mdash;we went through another spike in gas prices. And people are nodding here. They weren't happy about it. The problem is, this happens every year. It happened last year, the year before that. And it's a serious blow to family budgets. It feels like you're getting hit with a new tax coming right out of your pocket. And every time it happens, politicians, they dust off their three-point plans for $2 gas, but nothing happens, and then we go through the same cycle again. <p>But here's the thing: Over the past 4 years, we haven't just talked about it, we've actually started doing something about it. We've worked with the auto companies to put in place the toughest fuel economy standards in our history. What that means is, by the middle of the next decade, our cars will go twice as far on a gallon of gas. And the standards that we set are part of what's driving some of the amazing scientists and engineers who are working here at Argonne Labs. We've set some achievable, but ambitious goals. So in the middle of the next decade, we expect that you'll fill up half as often, which means you spend half as much. And over the life of a new car, the average family will save more than $8,000 at the pump. That's worth applauding. That's big news. <p>In fact, a new report issued today shows that America is becoming a global leader in advanced vehicles. You walk into any dealership today, and you'll see twice as many hybrids to choose from as there were 5 years ago. You'll see seven times as many cars that can go 40 miles a gallon or more. And as costs go down, sales are going up. <p>Last year, General Motors sold more hybrid vehicles than ever before. Ford is selling some of the most fuel-efficient cars so quickly that dealers are having a tough time keeping up with the demand. So by investing in our energy security, we're helping our businesses succeed and we're creating good middle class jobs right here in America. <p>So we're making progress, but the only way to really break this cycle of spiking gas prices, the only way to break that cycle for good is to shift our cars entirely&mdash;our cars and trucks&mdash;off oil. That's why, in my State of the Union Address, I called on Congress to set up an energy security trust to fund research into new technologies that will help us reach that goal. <p>Now, I'd like to take credit for this idea, because it's a good idea, but I can't. Basically, my proposal builds off a proposal that was put forward by a nonpartisan coalition that includes retired generals and admirals and leading CEOs. And these leaders came together around a simple idea: Much of our energy is drawn from lands and waters that we, the public, own together. So what they've proposed is let's take some of our oil and gas revenues from public lands and put it towards research that will benefit the public so we can support American ingenuity without adding a dime to our deficit. <p>We can support scientists who are designing new engines that are more energy efficient; support scientists that are developing cheaper batteries that can go farther on a single charge; support scientists and engineers that are devising new ways to fuel our cars and trucks with new sources of clean energy&mdash;like advanced biofuels and natural gas&mdash;so drivers can one day go coast to coast without using a drop of oil. <p>And the reason so many different people from the private sector, the public sector, our military support this idea is because it's not just about saving money, it's also about saving the environment, but it's also about our national security. For military officials&mdash;like General Paul Kelley, a former Commandant of the Marine Corps&mdash;this is about national security. Our reliance on oil makes us way too dependent on other parts of the world, many of which are very volatile. For business leaders&mdash;like Fred Smith, the CEO of FedEx&mdash;this is about economic security, because when fuel prices shoot up, it's harder to plan investments, expand operations, create new jobs. <p>So these leaders all say we need to fix this. This is not a Democratic idea or a Republican idea, this is just a smart idea. And we should be taking their advice. Let's set up an energy security trust that helps us free our families and our businesses from painful spikes in gas once and for all. Let's do that. We can do it. We've done it before; we innovated here at Argonne. <p>And in the meantime, we'll keep moving on the all-of-the-above energy strategy that we've been working on for the last couple years, where we're producing more oil and gas here at home, but we're also producing more biofuels, we're also producing more fuel-efficient vehicles, more solar power, more wind power. We're working to make sure that here in America, we're building cars and homes and businesses that waste less energy. <p>We can do this. The nature of America's miraculous rise has been our drive, our restless spirit, our willingness to reach out to new horizons, our willingness to take risks, our willingness to innovate. We are not satisfied just because things&mdash;this is how things have been. We're going to try something that maybe we just imagine now, but if we work at it, we'll achieve it. That's the nature of America. That's what Argonne National Lab is about. That's what this facility is about. <p>Two decades ago, scientists at Argonne, led by Mike Thackeray, who's here today. Where is Mike? There he is right here. Mike started work on a rechargeable lithium battery for cars. And some folks at the time said the idea wasn't worth the effort. They said that even if you had the technology, the car would cost too much, it wouldn't go far enough. <p>But Mike and his team knew better. They knew you could do better. And America, our Government, our Federal Government made it a priority, and we funded those efforts. And Mike went to work. And when others gave up, the team kept on at it. And when development hit a snag, the team found solutions. And a few years ago, all of this hard work paid off, and scientists here at Argonne helped create a lithium ion battery that costs less, lasts longer than any that had come before. <p>So what was just an idea two decades ago is now rolling off assembly lines in cutting-edge, fuel-efficient cars that you can plug in at night. Well, imagine all the ideas right now with all of these young scientists and engineers that 20 years ago&mdash;or 20 years from now will be offering solutions to our problems that we can't even comprehend, as long as we're still funding these young scientists and engineers; as long as the pipeline for research is maintained; as long as we recognize, there are some things we do together as a country, because individually we can't do it. And by the way, the private sector on its own will not invest in this research because it's too expensive. It's too risky. They can't afford it in terms of their bottom lines. <p>So we've got to support it. And we'll all benefit from it, and our kids will benefit from it, and our grandkids will benefit from it. That's who we are. That's been the American story. <p>We don't stand still, we look forward. We invent. We build. We turn new ideas into new industries. We change the way we can live our lives here at home and around the world. That's how we sent a man to the Moon. That's how we invented the Internet. <p>When somebody tells us we can't, we say, yes we can. And I'm telling all of you, I am absolutely confident that America is poised to succeed in the same way, as long as we don't lose that spirit of innovation and recognize that we can only do it together. And I'm going to work as hard as I can every single day to make sure that we do. All right? <p>So congratulations, Argonne. Let's keep it up. Thank you. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"46" "\"Hi, everybody. As a nation, our top priority is growing our economy and creating good, middle class jobs. That's why this week I'm speaking to you from the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, because few areas hold as much promise as what they're focused on right here: harnessing American energy. <p>You see, after years of talking about it, we're finally poised to take control of our energy future.

And we're sending less carbon pollution into the environment than we have in nearly 20 years. <p>So we're making real progress. But over the past few weeks, we've got a reminder that we have more work to do. We went through another spike in gas prices, just like last year and the year before that. It happens every year. It's a serious blow to your budget, like getting hit with a new tax coming right out of your pocket. <p>Over the past 4 years, as part of our all-of-the-above energy strategy, we've taken steps to soften that blow by making sure our cars use less gas. We've put in place the toughest fuel economy standards in our history so that by the middle of the next decade, our cars will go twice as far on a gallon of gas. Over the life of a new car, the average family will save more than $8,000 at the pump. <p>But the only way we're going to break this cycle of spiking gas prices for good is to shift our cars and trucks off of oil for good. That's why, in my State of the Union Address, I called on Congress to set up an energy security trust to fund research into new technologies that will help us reach that goal. <p>Here's how it would work. Much of our energy is drawn from lands and waters that we, the public, own together. So I'm proposing that we take some of our oil and gas revenues from public lands and put it towards research that will benefit the public so that we can support American ingenuity without adding a dime to our deficit. We can support scientists who are designing new engines that are more energy efficient, developing cheaper batteries that go farther on a single charge, and devising new ways to fuel our cars and trucks with new sources of clean energy&mdash;like advanced biofuels and natural gas&mdash;so drivers can one day go coast to coast without using a drop of oil. <p>Now, this idea isn't mine. It actually builds off a proposal put forward by a nonpartisan coalition of CEOs and retired generals and admirals. So let's take their advice and free our families and our businesses from painful spikes in gas prices once and for all. <p>And in the meantime, let's keep moving forward on an all-of-the-above energy strategy: a strategy where we produce more oil and gas here at home, but also more biofuels and fuel-efficient vehicles, more solar power and wind power; a strategy where we put more people to work building cars, homes, and businesses that waste less energy. We can do this. We're Americans. And when we commit ourselves to something, there's no telling how far we'll go. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"47" "\"<i>Dorood.</i> As you and your families come together to celebrate Nowruz, I want to extend my best wishes to this new spring and new year. Around the world, and here in the United States, you're gathering at the Nowruz table to give thanks for loved ones, reflect on your blessings, and welcome all the possibilities of a new season. <p>As I have every year as President, I want to take this opportunity to speak directly to the people and leaders of Iran. Since taking office, I've offered the Iranian Government an opportunity: If it meets its international obligations, then there could be a new relationship between our two countries, and Iran could begin to return to its rightful place among the community of nations. <p>I have no illusions about the difficulty of overcoming decades of mistrust. It will take a serious and sustained effort to resolve the many differences between Iran and the United States. This includes the world's serious and growing concerns about Iran's nuclear program, which threatens peace and security in the region and beyond. <p>Iran's leaders say that their nuclear program is for medical research and electricity. To date, however, they have been unable to convince the international community that their nuclear activities are solely for peaceful purposes. That's why the world is united in its resolve to address this issue and why Iran is now so isolated. The people of Iran have paid a high and unnecessary price because of your leaders' unwillingness to address this issue. <p>As I've said all along, the United States prefers to resolve this matter peacefully, diplomatically. Indeed, if&mdash;as Iran's leaders say&mdash;their nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, then there is a basis for a practical solution. It's a solution that would give Iran access to peaceful nuclear energy while resolving once and for all the serious questions that the world has about the true nature of the Iranian nuclear program. <p>The United States, alongside the rest of the international community, is ready to reach such a solution. Now is the time for the Iranian Government to take immediate and meaningful steps to reduce tensions and work toward an enduring, long-term settlement of the nuclear issue. <p>Finding a solution will be no easy task. But if we can, the Iranian people will begin to see the benefits of greater trade and ties with other nations, including the United States. Whereas, if the Iranian Government continues down its current path, it will only further isolate Iran. This is the choice now before Iran's leaders. <p>I hope they choose a better path for the sake of the Iranian people and for the sake of the world. Because there's no good reason for Iranians to be denied the opportunities enjoyed by people in other countries, just as Iranians deserve the same freedoms and rights as people everywhere. <p>Iran's isolation isn't good for the world either. Just as your forbearers enriched the arts and sciences throughout history, all nations would benefit from the talents and creativity of the Iranian people, especially your young people. Every day that you are cut off from us is a day we're not working together, building together, innovating together, and building a future of peace and prosperity that is at the heart of this holiday. <p>As you gather with family and friends this Nowruz, many of you will turn to the poet Hafez, who wrote: \\"Plant the tree of friendship that bears the fruit of fulfillment; uproot the sapling of enmity that bears endless suffering.\\" <p>As a new spring begins, I remain hopeful that our two countries can move beyond tension. And I will continue to work toward a new day between our nations that bears the fruit of friendship and peace. <p>Thank you, and <i>Eid-eh Shoma mobarak</i>.\" "
"48" "\"Well, hello, everybody! And can everybody please give Amanda another big round of applause? It seems to me she would be pretty good at sales. [<i>Laughter</i>] I was sold just listening to her right there. <p>Thank you, Amanda, for your&mdash;for sharing your story, the wonderful introduction. It is an honor to welcome all of you here to the White House. <p>Now, let's be clear: I am used to being surrounded every day by talented, accomplished women, from all the meetings I have in the West Wing to the dinner table with Michelle, Malia, and Sasha. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I have to say, even for somebody who is accustomed to it, this is a pretty exceptional group that I'm looking around here. We've got business leaders like Abbe Raven, CEO of the A&E Networks. There she is right there. We've got activists like Dolores Huerta and Lilly Ledbetter, all-star athletes like Tamika Catchings, and outstanding public servants from Congress and my administration, including Valerie Jarrett, who serves as our chair of the Council for Women and Girls here at the White House. <p>And when I look around this room, it is hard to believe that 100 years ago this month, thousands of women were marching right outside this house demanding one of our most fundamental rights: the right to vote, to have a say in our democracy. And today, a century later, its rooms are full of accomplished women who have overcome discrimination, shattered glass ceilings, and become outstanding role models for all of our sons and daughters. And that means we've come a long way, and that's thanks to the efforts of so many people like you. <p>Because of the hard work and exemplary leadership of the women in this room, military families have protected family and medical leave. Women have legal recourse to fight against pay discrimination, as Amanda took advantage of. Women have the opportunity to serve on the front lines of our military conflicts, and that means that they're getting paid and promoted equally. Women have the opportunity to make their own choices about their health. <p>We're also seeing expanded opportunity for womens&mdash;to reach their full potential all around the world. That's in large part because 4 years ago, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton&mdash;a tireless advocate for women herself&mdash;designated an Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues, whose sole job it is to make sure that women and girls are a central part of every aspect of our foreign policy, that their concerns are considered at the highest level of our diplomatic decisionmaking. <p>For 4 years, the incredible Melanne Verveer held that role. Where is Melanne? Is she here? All right, well, she's incredible. Take my word for it. [<i>Laughter</i>] We're so grateful for her service, along with the millions of women around the world that she helped to amplify and helped to fight alongside on the causes that are so important. But with Melanne leaving on, we've got some big shoes to fill. So today I am very pleased to announce that I will be nominating Cathy Russell as our next Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues. <p>Now, Cathy is a longtime advocate for women, for justice, for fairness. She's worked on preventing violence against women here and around the world. Throughout my first term, she's served as chief of staff to Dr. Jill Biden. She's worked tirelessly alongside Michelle and Jill to make sure that our military families get every single benefit and bit of assistance that they so richly deserve and have earned. I'm certain that Jill will miss Cathy, but I know she joins me in saying that we could not be prouder of Cathy's hard work and her advocacy. And we know that she's going to be a powerful voice on behalf of women and girls around the world. So thank you, Cathy, for your continued service. <p>It's women like Cathy, like Jill, like Amanda, like Michelle, like all of you, that inspire so much progress each and every day. And I've got to tell you, all of you inspire me to make sure that I'm doing everything that I can as President to carry on that progress and to do everything we can to ensure equality and opportunity for all women. Just last week, I was proud to sign the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women's Act, a law, by the way, that Cathy helped to make possible in the first place: securing for women the protections and the services to help them live their lives free from fear of violence and free to pursue their own measure of happiness. <p>And that's what everybody deserves in this country, the opportunity to make of their lives what they will, no matter who they are, what they look like, whether they are boys or girls, women or men. That's why I ran for President in the first place: to put the same rights and opportunities within the reach of all of our daughters and sons. And while there's still a lot of work to be done, I'm confident that we can reach that goal, that we can make sure that every single door is open, every dream is within reach&mdash;for Malia, for Sasha, for your daughters, for your granddaughters&mdash;to make sure that they never feel like there are barriers in front of them, and that if they work hard, they can make it. <p>So I want to thank all of you for your incredible advocacy. I could not be prouder of you. I'm glad that you had a chance to join us. I understand that we had some great panels earlier today, and I expect this conversation and, more importantly, the work will continue for many years to come. <p>So thank you very much, everybody. Enjoy the reception.\" "
"49" "\"<i>Shalom</i>. President Peres, Prime Minister Netanyahu, and most of all, to the people of Israel: thank you for this incredibly warm welcome. This is my third visit to Israel, so let me just say <i>tov lihiyot shuv ba-aretz</i>. <p>I'm so honored to be here as you prepare to celebrate the 65th anniversary of a free and independent State of Israel. Yet I know that in stepping foot on this land, I walk with you on the historic homeland of the Jewish people. <p>More than 3,000 years ago, the Jewish people lived here, tended the land here, prayed to God here. And after centuries of exile and persecution, unparalleled in the history of man, the founding of the Jewish State of Israel was a rebirth, a redemption unlike any in history. <p>Today, the sons of Abraham and the daughters of Sarah are fulfilling the dream of the ages to be masters of their own fate in their own sovereign state. And just as we have for these past 65 years, the United States is proud to stand with you as your strongest ally and your greatest friend. <p>As I begin my second term as President, Israel is the first stop on my first foreign trip. This is no accident. Across this region, the winds of change bring both promise and peril. So I see this visit as an opportunity to reaffirm the unbreakable bond between our nations, to restate America's unwavering commitment to Israel's security, and to speak directly to the people of Israel and to your neighbors. <p>I want to begin right now by answering a question that is sometimes asked about our relationship: Why? Why does the United States stand so strongly, so firmly with the State of Israel? And the answer is simple. We stand together because we share a common story: patriots determined to be a free people in our land, pioneers who forged a nation, heroes who sacrificed to preserve our freedom, and immigrants from every corner of the world who renew constantly our diverse societies. <p>We stand together because we are democracies. For as noisy and messy as it may be, we know that democracy is the greatest form of government ever devised by man. <p>We stand together because it makes us more prosperous. Our trade and investment create jobs for both our peoples. Our partnerships in science and medicine and health bring us closer to new cures, harness new energy, and have helped transform us into high-tech hubs of our global economy. <p>We stand together because we share a commitment to helping our fellow human beings around the world. When the earth shakes and the floods come, our doctors and rescuers reach out to help. When people are suffering, from Africa to Asia, we partner to fight disease and overcome hunger. <p>And we stand together because peace must come to the Holy Land. For even as we are clear eyed about the difficulties, we will never lose sight of the vision of an Israel at peace with its neighbors. <p>So, as I begin this visit, let me say as clearly as I can: the United States of America stands with the State of Israel because it is in our fundamental national security interest to stand with Israel, it makes us both stronger, it makes us both more prosperous, and it makes the world a better place. <p>That's why the United States was the very first nation to recognize the State of Israel 65 years ago. That's why the Star of David and the Stars and Stripes fly together today. And that is why I'm confident in declaring that our alliance is eternal. It is forever: <i>lanetzach</i>. <p>Thank you very much.\" "
"50" "\"<i>Shalom</i>. Thank you so much. Well, it is a great honor to be with you here in Jerusalem, and I'm so grateful for the welcome that I've received from the people of Israel. Thank you. I bring with me the support of the American people and the friendship that binds us together. <p>Over the last 2 days, I've reaffirmed the bonds between our countries with Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Peres. I've borne witness to the ancient history of the Jewish people at the Shrine of the Book, and I've seen Israel's shining future in your scientists and your entrepreneurs. This is a nation of museums and patents, timeless holy sites, groundbreaking innovation. Only in Israel could you see the Dead Sea Scrolls and the place where the technology onboard the Mars Rover originated at the same time. <p>But what I've most looked forward to is the ability to speak directly to you, the Israeli people&mdash;especially so many young people who are here today&mdash;to talk about the history that brought us here today and the future that you will make in the years to come. <p>Now, I know that in Israel's vibrant democracy, every word and every gesture is carefully scrutinized. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I want to clear something up just so you know: Any drama between me and my friend Bibi over the years was just a plot to create material for \\"Eretz Nehederet.\\" That's the only thing that was going on. We just wanted to make sure the writers had good material. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I also know that I come to Israel on the eve of a sacred holiday, the celebration of Passover. And that is where I would like to begin today. <p>Just a few days from now, Jews here in Israel and around the world will sit with family and friends at the seder table and celebrate with songs, wine, and symbolic foods. After enjoying seders with family and friends in Chicago and on the campaign trail, I'm proud that I've now brought this tradition into the White House, and I did so<i> </i>because I wanted my daughters to experience the <i>Haggadah</i> and the story at the center of Passover that makes this time of year so powerful. <p>It's a story of centuries of slavery and years of wandering in the desert, a story of perseverance amidst persecution and faith in God and the Torah. It's a story about finding freedom in your own land. And for the Jewish people, this story is central to who you've become. But it's also a story that holds within it the universal human experience, with all of its suffering, but also all of its salvation. <p>It's a part of the three great religions&mdash;Judaism, Christianity, and Islam&mdash;that trace their origins to Abraham and see Jerusalem as sacred. And it's a story that's inspired communities across the globe, including me and my fellow Americans. <p>In the United States, a nation made up of people who crossed oceans to start anew, we're naturally drawn to the idea of finding freedom in our land. To African Americans, the story of the Exodus was perhaps the central story, the most powerful image about emerging from the grip of bondage to reach for liberty and human dignity, a tale that was carried from slavery through the civil rights movement into today. <p>For generations, this promise helped people weather poverty and persecution, while holding on to the hope that a better day was on the horizon. For me, personally, growing up in far-flung parts of the world and without firm roots, the story spoke to a yearning within every human being for a home. <p>Of course, even as we draw strength from the story of God's will and His gift of freedom expressed on Passover, we also know that here on Earth, we must bear our responsibilities in an imperfect world. That means accepting our measure of sacrifice and struggle, just like previous generations. It means us working through generation after generation on behalf of that ideal of freedom. <p>As Dr. Martin Luther King said on the day before he was killed: \\"I may not get there with you. But I want you to know that we, as a people, will get to the promised land.\\" So just as Joshua carried on after Moses, the work goes on for all of you, the Joshua generation, for justice and dignity, for opportunity and freedom. <p>For the Jewish people, the journey to the promise of the State of Israel wound through countless generations. It involved centuries of suffering and exile, prejudice and pogroms and even genocide. Through it all, the Jewish people sustained their unique identity and traditions, as well as a longing to return home. And while Jews achieved extraordinary success in many parts of the world, the dream of true freedom finally found its full expression in the Zionist idea: to be a free people in your homeland. That's why I believe that Israel is rooted not just in history and tradition, but also in a simple and profound idea: the idea that people deserve to be free in a land of their own. <p>Over the last 65 years, when Israel has been at its best, Israelis have demonstrated that responsibility does not end when you reach the Promised Land, it only begins. And so Israel has been a refuge for the diaspora, welcoming Jews from Europe, from the former Soviet Union, from Ethiopia, from North Africa. <p>Israel has built a prosperous nation, through <i>kibbutzim</i> that made the desert bloom, business that broadened the middle class, innovators who reached new frontiers, from the smallest microchip to the orbits of space. Israel has established a thriving democracy, with a spirited civil society and proud political parties and a tireless free press and a lively public debate; \\"lively\\" may be an understatement. <p>And Israel has achieved all this even as it's overcome relentless threats to its security, through the courage of the Israel Defense Forces and the citizenry that is so resilient in the face of terror. <p>This is the story of Israel. This is the work that has brought the dreams of so many generations to life. And every step of the way, Israel has built unbreakable bonds of friendship with my country, the United States of America. <p>Those ties began only 11 minutes after Israeli independence, when the United States was the first nation to recognize the State of Israel. As President Truman said in explaining his decision to recognize Israel, he said, \\"I believe it has a glorious future before it not just as another sovereign nation, but as an embodiment of the great ideals of our civilization.\\" And since then, we've built a friendship that advances our shared interests. <p>Together, we share a commitment to security for our citizens and the stability of the Middle East and North Africa. Together, we share a focus on advancing economic growth around the globe and strengthening the middle class within our own countries. Together, we share a stake in the success of democracy. <p>But the source of our friendship extends beyond mere interests, just as it has transcended political parties and individual leaders. America is a nation of immigrants. America is strengthened by diversity. America is enriched by faith. We are governed not simply by men and women, but by laws. We're fueled by entrepreneurship and innovation, and we are defined by a democratic discourse that allows each generation to reimagine and renew our Union once more. So in Israel, we see values that we share, even as we recognize what makes us different. That is an essential part of our bond. <p>Now, I stand here today mindful that for both our nations, these are some complicated times. We have difficult issues to work through within our own countries, and we face dangers and upheaval around the world. And when I look at young people within the United States, I think about the choices that they must make in their lives to define who we'll be as a nation in this 21st century, particularly as we emerge from two wars and the worst recession since the Great Depression. But part of the reason I like talking to young people is because, no matter how great the challenges are, their idealism, their energy, their ambition always gives me hope. <p>And I see the same spirit in the young people here today. I believe that you will shape our future. And given the ties between our countries, I believe your future is bound to ours. <p>[<i>At this point, there was a disruption in the audience.</i>] <p>No, no, this is part of the lively debate that we talked about. This is good. You know, I have to say, we actually arranged for that, because it made me feel at home. [<i>Laughter</i>] I wouldn't feel comfortable if I didn't have at least one heckler. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I'd like to focus on how we&mdash;and when I say \\"we,\\" in particular, young people&mdash;can work together to make progress in three areas that will define our times: security, peace, and prosperity. <p>Let me begin with security. I'm proud that the security relationship between the United States and Israel has never been stronger. Never. More exercises between our militaries; more exchanges among our political and military and intelligence officials than ever before; the largest program to date to help you retain your qualitative military edge. These are the facts. These aren't my opinions, these are facts. But to me, this is not simply measured on a balance sheet. I know that here, in Israel, security is something personal. <p>Here's what I think about when I consider these issues. When I consider Israel's security, I think about children like Osher Twito, who I met in Sderot<i>: </i>children the same age as my own daughters, who went to bed at night fearful that a rocket would land in their bedroom simply because of who they are and where they live. <p>That reality is why we've invested in the Iron Dome system to save countless lives, because those children deserve to sleep better at night. That's why we've made it clear, time and again, that Israel cannot accept rocket attacks from Gaza, and we have stood up for Israel's right to defend itself. And that's why Israel has a right to expect Hamas to renounce violence and recognize Israel's right to exist. <p>When I think about Israel's security, I think about five Israelis who boarded a bus in Bulgaria, who were blown up because of where they came from, robbed of the ability to live and love and raise families. That's why every country that values justice should call Hizballah what it truly is: a terrorist organization. Because the world cannot tolerate an organization that murders innocent civilians, stockpiles rockets to shoot at cities, and supports the massacre of men and women and children in Syria right now. <p>The fact that Hizballah's ally, the Asad regime, has stockpiles of chemical weapons only heightens the urgency. We will continue to cooperate closely to guard against that danger. I've made it clear to Bashar al-Asad and all who follow his orders: We will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons against the Syrian people or the transfer of those weapons to terrorists. The world is watching; we will hold you accountable. <p>The Syrian people have the right to be freed from the grip of a dictator who would rather kill his own people than relinquish power. Asad must go so that Syria's future can begin. Because true stability in Syria depends upon establishing a government that is responsible to its people, one that protects all communities within its borders, while making peace with countries beyond them. <p>These are the things I think about when I think about Israel's security. When I consider Israel's security, I also think about a people who have a living memory of the Holocaust, faced with the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iranian Government that has called for Israel's destruction. It's no wonder Israelis view this as an existential threat. But this is not simply a challenge for Israel, it is a danger for the entire world, including the United States. A nuclear-armed Iran would raise the risk of nuclear terrorism. It would undermine the nonproliferation regime. It would spark an arms race in a volatile region. And it would embolden a Government that has shown no respect for the rights of its own people or the responsibilities of nations. <p>That's why America has built a coalition to increase the cost to Iran of failing to meet their obligations. The Iranian Government is now under more pressure than ever before, and that pressure is increasing. It is isolated. Its economy is in dire straits. Its leadership is divided. And its position&mdash;in the region and the world&mdash;has only grown weaker. <p>I do believe that all of us have an interest in resolving this issue peacefully. Strong and principled diplomacy is the best way to ensure that the Iranian Government forsakes nuclear weapons. Peace is far more preferable to war. And the inevitable costs, the unintended consequences that would come with war means that we have to do everything we can to try to resolve this diplomatically. Because of the cooperation between our governments, we know that there remains time to pursue a diplomatic resolution. That's what America will do, with clear eyes, working with a world that's united and with the sense of urgency that's required. <p>But Iran must know this time is not unlimited. And I've made the position of the United States of America clear: Iran must not get a nuclear weapon. This is not a danger that can be contained, and as President, I've said all options are on the table for achieving our objectives. America will do what we must to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. <p>For young Israelis, I know that these issues of security are rooted in an experience that is even more fundamental than the pressing threat of the day. You live in a neighborhood where many of your neighbors have rejected the right of your nation to exist. Your grandparents had to risk their lives and all that they had to make a place for themselves in this world. Your parents lived through war after war to ensure the survival of the Jewish State. Your children grow up knowing that people they've never met may hate them because of who they are, in a region that is full of turmoil and changing underneath your feet. <p>So that's what I think about when Israel is faced with these challenges, that sense of an Israel that is surrounded by many in this region who still reject it and many in the world who refuse to accept it. And that's why the security of the Jewish people in Israel is so important. It cannot be taken for granted. <p>But make no mistake: Those who adhere to the ideology of rejecting Israel's right to exist, they might as well reject the earth beneath them or the sky above, because Israel is not going anywhere. And today I want to tell you&mdash;particularly, the young people&mdash;so that there's no mistake here: So long as there is a United States of America: <i>Atem lo levad</i>&mdash;you are not alone. <p>The question is, what kind of future Israel will look forward to? Israel is not going anywhere, but especially for the young people in this audience, the question is, what does its future hold? And that brings me to the subject of peace. <p>I know Israel has taken risks for peace. Brave leaders&mdash;Menachem Begin, Yitzhak Rabin&mdash;reached treaties with two of your neighbors. You made credible proposals to the Palestinians at Annapolis. You withdrew from Gaza and Lebanon and then faced terror and rockets. Across the region, you've extended a hand of friendship and all too often, you've been confronted with rejection and, in some cases, the ugly reality of anti-Semitism. So I believe that the Israeli people do want peace, and I also understand why too many Israelis&mdash;maybe an increasing number, maybe a lot of young people here today&mdash;are skeptical that it can be achieved. <p>But today, Israel is at a crossroads. It can be tempting to put aside the frustrations and sacrifices that come with the pursuit of peace, particularly when Iron Dome repels rockets, barriers keep out suicide bombers. There's so many other pressing issues that demand your attention. And I know that only Israelis can make the fundamental decisions about your country's future. I recognize that. <p>I also know, by the way, that not everyone in this hall will agree with what I have to say about peace. I recognize that there are those who are not simply skeptical about peace, but question its underlying premise, have a different vision for Israel's future. And that's part of a democracy. That's part of the discourse between our two countries. I recognize that. But I also believe it's important to be open and honest, especially with your friends. I also believe that. <p>Politically, given the strong bipartisan support for Israel in America, the easiest thing for me to do would be to put this issue aside, just express unconditional support for whatever Israel decides to do. That would be the easiest political path. But I want you to know that I speak to you as a friend who is deeply concerned and committed to your future, and I ask you to consider three points. <p>First, peace is necessary. I believe that. I believe that peace is the only path to true security. You can be&mdash;you have the opportunity to be the generation that permanently secures the Zionist dream, or you can face a growing challenge to its future. Given the demographics west of the Jordan River, the only way for Israel to endure and thrive as a Jewish and democratic state is through the realization of an independent and viable Palestine. That is true. <p>There are other factors involved. Given the frustration in the international community about this conflict, Israel needs to reverse an undertow of isolation. And given the march of technology, the only way to truly protect the Israeli people over the long term is through the absence of war. Because no wall is high enough and no Iron Dome is strong enough or perfect enough to stop every enemy that is intent on doing so from inflicting harm. <p>And this truth is more pronounced given the changes sweeping the Arab world. I understand that with the uncertainty in the region&mdash;people in the streets, changes in leadership, the rise of nonsecular parties in politics&mdash;it's tempting to turn inward, because the situation outside of Israel seems so chaotic. But this is precisely the time to respond to the wave of revolution with a resolve and commitment for peace. Because as more governments respond to popular will, the days when Israel could seek peace simply with a handful of autocratic leaders, those days are over. Peace will have to be made among peoples, not just governments. <p>No one&mdash;no single step&mdash;can change overnight what lies in the hearts and minds of millions. No single step is going to erase years of history and propaganda. But progress with the Palestinians is a powerful way to begin, while sidelining extremists who thrive on conflict and thrive on division. It would make a difference. <p>So peace is necessary. But peace is also just. Peace is also just. There is no question that Israel has faced Palestinian factions who turned to terror, leaders who missed historic opportunities. That is all true. And that's why security must be at the center of any agreement. And there is no question that the only path to peace is through negotiations, which is why, despite the criticism we've received, the United States will oppose unilateral efforts to bypass negotiations through the United Nations. It has to be done by the parties. But the Palestinian people's right to self-determination, their right to justice, must also be recognized. <p>Put yourself in their shoes. Look at the world through their eyes. It is not fair that a Palestinian child cannot grow up in a state of their own, living their entire lives with the presence of a foreign army that controls the movements not just of those young people, but their parents, their grandparents, every single day. It's not just when settler violence against Palestinians goes unpunished. It's not right to prevent Palestinians from farming their lands or restricting a student's ability to move around the West Bank or displace Palestinian families from their homes. Neither occupation nor expulsion is the answer. Just as Israelis built a state in their homeland, Palestinians have a right to be a free people in their own land. <p>I'm going off script here for a second, but before I came here, I met with a group of young Palestinians from the age of 15 to 22. And talking to them, they weren't that different from my daughters. They weren't that different from your daughters or sons. I honestly believe that if any Israeli parent sat down with those kids, they'd say, I want these kids to succeed; I want them to prosper. I want them to have opportunities just like my kids do. I believe that's what Israeli parents would want for these kids if they had a chance to listen to them and talk to them. I believe that. <p>Now, only you can determine what kind of democracy you will have. But remember that as you make these decisions, you will define not simply the future of your relationship with the Palestinians, you will define the future of Israel as well. <p>As Ariel Sharon said&mdash;I'm quoting him&mdash;\\"It is impossible to have a Jewish democratic state, at the same time to control all of Eretz Israel. If we insist on fulfilling the dream in its entirety, we are liable to lose it all.\\" Or from a different perspective, I think of what the novelist David Grossman said shortly after losing his son, as he described the necessity of peace: \\"A peace of no choice,\\" he said, \\"must be approached with the same determination and creativity as one approaches a war of no choice.\\" <p>Now, Israel cannot be expected to negotiate with anyone who is dedicated to its destruction. But while I know you have had differences with the Palestinian Authority, I genuinely believe that you do have a true partner in President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad. I believe that. And they have a track record to prove it. Over the last few years, they have built institutions and maintained security on the West Bank in ways that few could have imagined just a few years ago. So many Palestinians&mdash;including young people&mdash;have rejected violence as a means of achieving their aspirations. <p>There is an opportunity there, there's a window, which brings me to my third point: Peace is possible. [<i>Applause</i>] It is possible. I'm not saying it's guaranteed. I can't even say that it is more likely than not. But it is possible. I know it doesn't seem that way. There are always going to be reasons to avoid risk. There are costs for failure. There will always be extremists who provide an excuse not to act. <p>I know there must be something exhausting about endless talks about talks and daily controversies and just the grinding status quo. And I'm sure there's a temptation just to say, ah, enough. Let me focus on my small corner of the world and my family and my job and what I can control. But it's possible. <p>Negotiations will be necessary, but there's little secret about where they must lead: two states for two peoples. [<i>Applause</i>] Two states for two peoples. <p>There will be differences about how to get there. There are going to be hard choices along the way. Arab States must adapt to a world that has changed. The days when they could condemn Israel to distract their people from a lack of opportunity or government corruption or mismanagement, those days need to be over. Now is the time for the Arab world to take steps towards normalizing relations with Israel. <p>Meanwhile, Palestinians must recognize that Israel will be a Jewish state and that Israelis have the right to insist upon their security. Israelis must recognize that continued settlement activity is counterproductive to the cause of peace and that an independent Palestine must be viable with real borders that have to be drawn. <p>I've suggested principles on territory and security that I believe can be the basis for these talks. But for the moment, put aside the plans and the process. I ask you instead to think about what can be done to build trust between people. <p>Now, 4 years ago, I stood in Cairo in front of an audience of young people; politically, religiously, they must seem a world away. But the things they want, they're not so different from what the young people here want. They want the ability to make their own decisions and to get an education, to get a good job, to worship God in their own way, to get married, to raise a family. The same is true of those young Palestinians that I met with this morning. The same is true for young Palestinians who yearn for a better life in Gaza. <p>That's where peace begins, not just in the plans of leaders, but in the hearts of people; not just in some carefully designed process, but in the daily connections, that sense of empathy that takes place among those who live together in this land and in this sacred city of Jerusalem. <p>And let me say this as a politician. I can promise you this: Political leaders will never take risks if the people do not push them to take some risks. You must create the change that you want to see. Ordinary people can accomplish extraordinary things. <p>I know this is possible. Look to the bridges being built in business and civil society by some of you here today. Look at the young people who've not yet learned a reason to mistrust or those young people who've learned to overcome a legacy of mistrust that they inherited from their parents because they simply recognize that we hold more hopes in common than fears that drive us apart. Your voices must be louder than those who would drown out hope. Your hopes must light the way forward. <p>Look to a future in which Jews and Muslims and Christians can all live in peace and greater prosperity in this Holy Land. Believe in that. And most of all, look to the future that you want for your own children, a future in which a Jewish, democratic, vibrant state is protected and accepted for this time and for all time. <p>There will be many who say this is not possible, but remember this: Israel is the most powerful country in this region. Israel has the unshakeable support of the most powerful country in the world. Israel is not going anywhere. Israel has the wisdom to see the world as it is, but&mdash;this is in your nature&mdash;Israel also has the courage to see the world as it should be. <p>Ben Gurion once said, \\"In Israel, in order to be a realist, you must believe in miracles.\\" Sometimes, the greatest miracle is recognizing that the world can change. That's a lesson that the world has learned from the Jewish people. <p>And that brings me to the final area that I'll focus on: prosperity and Israel's broader role in the world. I know that all the talk about security and peace can sometimes seem to dominate the headlines, but that's not where people live. And every day, even amidst the threats that you face, Israelis are defining themselves by the opportunities that you're creating. <p>Through talent and hard work, Israelis have put this small country at the forefront of the global economy. <p>Israelis understand the value of education and have produced 10 Nobel laureates. Israelis understand the power of invention, and your universities educate engineers and inventors. And that spirit has led to economic growth and human progress: solar power and electric cars; and bandages and prosthetic limbs that save lives; stem cell research and new drugs that treat disease; cell phones and computer technology that changed the way people around the world live. <p>So if people want to see the future of the world economy, they should look at Tel Aviv, home to hundreds of startups and research centers. Israelis are so active on social media that every day seemed to bring a different Facebook campaign about where I should give this speech. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>That innovation is just as important to the relationship between the United States and Israel as our security cooperation. Our first free trade agreement in the world was reached with Israel, nearly three decades ago. Today, the trade between our two countries is at $40 billion every year. More importantly, that partnership is creating new products and medical treatments; it's pushing new frontiers of science and exploration. <p>That's the kind of relationship that Israel should have&mdash;and could have&mdash;with every country in the world. Already, we see how that innovation could reshape this region. There's a program here in Jerusalem that brings together young Israelis and Palestinians to learn vital skills in technology and business. An Israeli and Palestinian have started a venture capital fund to finance Palestinian startups. Over 100 high-tech companies have found home on the West Bank, which speaks to the talent and entrepreneurial spirit of the Palestinian people. <p>One of the great ironies of what's happening in the broader region is that so much of what people are yearning for&mdash;education, entrepreneurship, the ability to start a business without paying a bribe, the ability to connect to the global economy&mdash;those are things that can be found here in Israel. This should be a hub for thriving regional trade and an engine for opportunity. <p>Israel is already a center for innovation that helps power the global economy. And I believe that all of that potential for prosperity can be enhanced with greater security, enhanced with lasting peace. <p>Here, in this small strip of land that has been the center of so much of the world's history, so much triumph and so much tragedy, Israelis have built something that few could have imagined 65 years ago. Tomorrow I will pay tribute to that history: at the grave of Herzl, a man who had the foresight to see the future of the Jewish people had to be reconnected to their past; at the grave of Rabin, who understood that Israel's victories in war had to be followed by the battles for peace; at Yad Vashem, where the world is reminded of the cloud of evil that can descend on the Jewish people and all of humanity if we ever fail to be vigilant. <p>We bear all that history on our shoulders. We carry all that history in our hearts. Today, as we face the twilight of Israel's founding generation, you, the young people of Israel, must now claim its future. It falls to you to write the next chapter in the great story of this great nation. <p>And as the President of a country that you can count on as your greatest friend, I am confident that you can help us find the promise in the days that lie ahead. And as a man who's been inspired in my own life by that timeless calling within the Jewish experience, <i>tikkun olam</i>, I am hopeful that we can draw upon what's best in ourselves to meet the challenges that will come, to win the battles for peace in the wake of so much war, and to do the work of repairing this world. That's your job. That's my job. That's the task of all of us. <p>May God bless you. May God bless Israel. May God bless the United States of America. <i>Toda raba.</i> Thank you.\" "
"51" "\"<i>President Peres</i>. I think that's the President's remarks. Mr. President, can I read your speech, if you want me to? [<i>Laughter</i>] They are mistaken. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>President Barack Obama, my dear friend, let me say first of all, bravo. Bravo, President. <p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you tonight. I was moved the way in which you spoke to the hearts of our young Israelis. Our youngsters, in time of need, are always willing to stand up and defend their country. Today you have seen how much the same young people long for peace. How enthusiastic they were, how engaged they were, listening to the vision of peace, which you beautifully delivered and moved the heart. <p>Mr. President, this morning several rockets were shot from the Gaza Strip toward the civilian targets in Israel, including Sderot, that you have visited. From here, in the name of all of us, I want to convey our love to the inhabitants of the south around Gaza, who carry this heavy burden courageously and continue to plow their land, their&mdash;plant their trees, raise their children. It is an inspiration to each of us. Today the enemies of peace spoke in the only language they know: the language of terror. I am convinced that together, we shall defeat them. <p>Dear Barack, your visit here is a historic event. We are so happy to receive you and your distinguished delegation. I am very glad to see Secretary John Kerry, a reassured friend. John, I know you are and I know you will be successful. I'm not sure that the prophets have had speechwriters&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but if they had, I imagine Isaiah would have said&mdash;but actually, he has said on that occasion, and I'm quoting him&mdash;\\"How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news, who proclaim peace, who bring good tidings, who proclaim salvation.\\" Well, you have to be satisfied with my tired language; I cannot speak like him. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>It is my privilege to present you with our country's highest honor: the Medal of Distinction. This award speaks to you, to your tireless work to make Israel strong, to make peace possible. Your Presidency has given the closest ties between Israel and the United States a new height, a sense of intimacy, a vision for the future. <p>The people of Israel are particularly moved by your unforgettable contribution to their security: You are defending our skies. To you&mdash;[<i>inaudible</i>]&mdash;in the domain of intelligence, which is the right way to preempt bloodshed. The diplomatic and the military bonds between us have reached an unprecedented level. <p>When I visit you in Washington, I thought in my heart, America is so great, and we are so small. I learned that you don't measure us by size, but by values. Thank you. When it comes to values, we are you, and you are us. On occasions when we were alone, you stood with us so we were not alone. We were alone together. We shall never forget it. <p>During your previous visit to Israel, you asked me if I had any advice to offer. Well, it's not my nature not to let questions go unanswered. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I suggested that, while people say that the future belongs to the young, it is the present that really belongs to the young. Leave the future to me. I have time. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I think I was right, because the moment you came into office, you immediately had to face daunting and demanding challenges day in, day out. I prayed that you would meet them with wisdom and determination, without losing hope, without allowing others to lose hope. The prayers were answered; after all, they came from Jerusalem, and they came to us as a great message. It is a tribute to your leadership, to the strength of your character, to your principles, that you have never surrendered to hopelessness. You stood and stand firmly by your vision. Your values serve your nation. They serve our nation as well. <p>So I know that you will never stop to strive for a better world, as you say today in a good Hebrew, <i>tikkun olam</i>. We have a rich heritage and a great dream. As I look back, I feel that the Israel of today has exceeded the vision we have had 65 years ago. Reality has surpassed the dreams. The United States of America helped us to make this possible. <p>Still, the path to tomorrow may be fraught with obstacles. I believe that we can overcome them by our determination and by your commitment. I'm convinced that you will do whatever is necessary to free the world's horizons and the skies of Jerusalem from the Iranian threat. Iran denies the Shoah and calls for a new one. Iran is building a nuclear bomb and denies it. The Iranian regime is the greatest danger to the world peace. History has shown time and again that peace, prosperity, and stable civil society cannot flourish when threats and belligerency abound. <p>Ladies and gentlemen, tonight the Iranian people are celebrating their New Year, Nowruz. I wish them, from the depths of my heart, a happy holiday and a real freedom. <p>Israel will seize any opportunity for peace. Being small, we have to maintain our qualitative edge. I know that you responded and will respond to it. The strength of Israel is its defense forces. They afford us the ability to seek peace. And what America has contributed to Israel's security is the best guarantee to end the march of folly, the march of terror and bloodshed. <p>We watch with admiration the way you lead the United States of America, the way you stayed true, time and again, to your bonds of friendship with us. Your commitment and deeds speaks volumes about the principles that guides America. To strive for freedom and democracy at home, but also all over the world, you send the boys to fight for the freedom of others. What is uplifting is that the United States brought freedom not only to its own people, but never stops, and never will stop, to help other people to become free. <p>You represent democracy at its best. You have deepened its meaning: namely, that democracy is not just the right to be equal, but the equal right to be different. Democracy is not just a free expression, but is self-expression as well. <p>You exemplify the spirit of democracy by striving for justice and equality of opportunity in the American society. As the world has now become global and yet remains individual, and you offer those principles. You have shown global responsibility and individual sensitivity. <p>On Monday night, Mr. President, we shall celebrate Passover, the festival of freedom, the celebration of spring. The celebration of spring means our journey from the house of slaves to the home of the free that started more than 3,000 years ago. We remember it every year. We are commended to feel as though each of us personally participated in that journey. We shall not forget where we came from. We shall remember always where we are headed to, which is to make the Promised Land a land of promise: a land of freedom, justice, and equality. <p>While reality calls for vigilance, Passover calls to remain believers. Israel is an island in a stormy sea. We have to make our island safe, and we wish that the sea will become tranquil. We converted our desert into a garden. It was achieved by the talents of our people and the potential of science. What we have done, Mr. President, can be done all over the Middle East, as you have rightly said tonight. Israel is described as a startup nation. The Middle East can become a startup region. <p>Dear President, you noted in your address today that peace is the greatest hope for the human being. I share your vision. Your call to reopen the peace process may pave the way for the implementation of the two-state solution agreed by all of us, as you said: a Jewish state, Israel; an Arab state, Palestine. <p>If I'm not wrong, next to you sits our Prime Minister, who was just reelected. He opened his address in the Knesset by reiterating his commitment to the two-state solution. Dear friends, I have seen in my life&mdash;I earned the right to believe&mdash;that peace is attainable. As you felt today, I know, this is the deep conviction of our people. With our resolve and your support, dear Barack Obama, we shall win, and it will happen. <p>Mr. President, I am privileged to bestow upon you the Medal of Distinction. It was recommended by a committee of seven prominent Israeli citizens, headed by our former Chief of Justice Meir Shamgar, and includes our former President Yitzhak Navon. It was my view and I was glad to accept their recommendation. You inspired the world with your leadership. <i>Toda raba</i>, Mr. President. <i>Toda</i> from a grateful nation to a very great leader. <p>God bless America. God bless Israel. <p>[<i>At this point, the citation was read, and the President received the medal</i>. <i>President Peres then offered a toast</i>.] <p><i>President Obama.</i> Thank you so much. President Peres; Prime Minister Netanyahu and First Lady Sara; distinguished guests and friends: This is a extraordinary honor for me, and I could not be more deeply moved. And I have to say, after the incredible welcome I've received over the past 2 days and the warmth of the Israeli people, the tribute from President Peres, the honor of this medal, I mean, as you say, <i>dayenu</i>. <p>Now, I'm told that the Talmud teaches that you shouldn't pronounce all the praises of a person in their presence. And, Mr. President, if I praised all the chapters of your remarkable life, then we would be here all night. [<i>Laughter</i>] So let me simply say this about our gracious host. Mr. President, the State of Israel has been the cause of your life: through bitter wars and fragile peace, through hardship and prosperity. You've built her. You've cared for her. You've strengthened her. You've nurtured the next generation who will inherit her. <p>Ben Gurion. Meir. Begin. Rabin. These giants have left us. Only you are with us still: a founding father in our midst. And we are so grateful for your vision, your friendship, but most of all, for your example, including the example of your extraordinary vitality. Every time I see your President, I ask him who his doctor is. [<i>Laughter</i>] We all want to know the secret. <p>So with gratitude for your life and your service, and as you prepare to celebrate your 90th birthday this summer&mdash;and since I'm starting to get pretty good at Hebrew&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;let me propose a toast, even though you've taken away my wine&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. Come on. Bring another one. <p>How are you? <p><i>Server</i>. Here you are, sir. You're welcome. <p><i>President Obama.</i> A toast. <i>Ad me'ah ve'esrim. L'chaim!</i> <p>[<i>A toast was offered</i>.] <p>Mmm, that's good wine. [<i>Laughter</i>] Actually, we should probably get this out of the photograph. All these people will say I'm having too much fun in Israel. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Just a few more words, Mr. President. You mentioned that this medal is presented in recognition of progress toward the ideals of equality and opportunity and justice. But I am mindful that I stand here tonight because of so many others, including the example and the sacrifices of the Jewish people. <p>In a few days, as we do at every seder, we'll break and hide a piece of matzoh. It's a great way to entertain the kids. Malia and Sasha, even though they are getting older, they still enjoy it. And there are a lot of good places to hide it in the White House. [<i>Laughter</i>] But on a much deeper level, it speaks to the scope of our human experience: how parts of our lives can be broken while other parts can be elusive; how we can never give up searching for the things that make us whole. And few know this better than the Jewish people. <p>After slavery and decades in the wilderness and with Moses gone, the future of the Israelites was in doubt. But with Joshua as their guide, they pushed on to victory. After the First Temple was destroyed, it seemed Jerusalem was lost. But with courage and resolve, the Second Temple reestablished the Jewish presence. After centuries of persecution and pogroms, the Shoah aimed to eliminate the entire Jewish people. But the gates of the camps flew open; there emerged the ultimate rebuke to hate and to ignorance: Survivors would live and love again. <p>When the moment of Israel's independence was met by aggression on all sides, it was unclear whether this nation would survive. But with heroism and sacrifice, the State of Israel not only endured, but thrived. And during 6 days in June and Yom Kippur one October, it seemed as though all you had built might be lost. But when the guns fell silent, it was clear: \\"The nation of Israel lives.\\" <p>As I said in my speech earlier today, this story&mdash;from slavery to salvation, of overcoming even the most overwhelming odds&mdash;is a message that's inspired the world. And that includes Jewish Americans, but also African Americans, who have so often had to deal with their own challenges, but with whom you have stood shoulder to shoulder. <p>African Americans and Jewish Americans marched together at Selma and Montgomery, with rabbis carrying the Torah as they walked. They boarded buses for freedom rides together. They bled together. They gave their lives together: Jewish Americans like Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner alongside African American, James Chaney. <p>Because of their sacrifice, because of the struggle of generations in both our countries, we can come together tonight, in freedom and in security. So if I can paraphrase the Psalm: they turned our mourning into dancing; they changed our sack cloths into robes of joy. <p>And this evening, I'd like to close with the words of two leaders who brought us some of this joy. Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel was born in Poland and lost his mother and sister to the Nazis. He came to America. He raised his voice for social justice. He marched with Martin Luther King. And he spoke of the State of Israel in words that could well describe the struggle for equality in America. \\"Our very existence is a witness that man must live toward redemption,\\" he said, and \\"that history is not always made by man alone.\\" <p>Rabbi Joachim Prinz was born in Germany, expelled by the Nazis, and found refuge in America, and he built support for the new State of Israel. And on that August day in 1963, he joined Dr. King at the March on Washington. And this is what Rabbi Prinz said to the crowd: <p>\\"In the realm of the spirit, our fathers taught us thousands of years ago that when God created man, he created him as everybody's neighbor. Neighbor is not a geographic concept. It is a moral concept. It means our collective responsibility for the preservation of man's dignity and integrity.\\" <p>President Peres, Prime Minister Netanyahu, friends: Our very existence, our presence here tonight, is a testament that all things are possible, even those things that, in moments of darkness and doubt, may seem elusive. The stories of our peoples teach us to never stop searching for the things&mdash;the justice and the peace&mdash;that make us whole. And so as we go forward together with confidence, we'll know that, while our countries may be separated by a great ocean, in the realm of the spirit, we will always be neighbors and friends. <p>I very humbly accept this award, understanding that I'm accepting it on behalf of the American people, who are joined together with you. <p>May God bless you, and may He watch over our two great nations. Thank you very much.\" "
"52" "\"\\"Unto them I will give my house and within my walls a memorial and a name, an everlasting name that shall not be cut off.\\" <p>President Peres, Prime Minister Netanyahu, Chairman Shalev, Rabbi Lau: Thank you for sharing this house, this memorial, with me today. Thank you to the people of Israel for preserving the names of the millions taken from us, of blessed memory, names that shall never be forgotten. <p>This is my second visit to this living memorial. Since then, I've walked among the barbed wire and guard towers of Buchenwald. Rabbi Lau told me of his time there, and we reminisced about our good friend, Elie Wiesel, and the memories that he shared with me. I've stood in the old Warsaw ghetto, with survivors who would not go quietly. But nothing equals the wrenching power of this sacred place, where the totality of the Shoah<i> </i>is told. We could come here a thousand times, and each time our hearts would break. <p>For here we see the depravity to which man can sink, the barbarism that unfolds when we begin to see our fellow human beings as somehow less than us, less worthy of dignity and of life. We see how evil can, for a moment in time, triumph when good people do nothing and how silence abetted a crime unique in human history. <p>Here we see their faces, and we hear their voices. We look upon the objects of their lives: the art that they created, the prayer books that they carried. We see that even as they had hate etched into their arms, they were not numbers. They were men and women and children&mdash;so many children&mdash;sent to their deaths because of who they were, how they prayed, or who they loved. <p>And yet here, alongside man's capacity for evil, we also are reminded of man's capacity for good: the rescuers, the \\"righteous among nations\\" who refused to be bystanders. And in their noble acts of courage, we see how this place&mdash;this accounting of horror&mdash;is in the end a source of hope. <p>For here we learn that we are never powerless. In our lives we always have choices: to succumb to our worst instincts or to summon the better angels of our nature; to be indifferent to suffering wherever it may be, whoever it may be visited upon, or to display empathy that is at the core of our humanity. We have the choice to acquiesce to evil or make real our solemn vow \\"never again.\\" We have the choice to ignore what happens to others or to act on behalf of others and to continually examine in ourselves whatever dark places there may be that might lead to such actions or inactions. This is our obligation: not simply to bear witness, but to act. <p>For us, in our time, this means confronting bigotry and hatred in all of its forms, racism, especially anti-Semitism. None of that has a place in the civilized world: not in the classrooms of children, not in the corridors of power. And let us never forget the link between the two. For our sons and daughters are not born to hate, they are taught to hate. So let us fill their young hearts with the same understanding and compassion that we hope others have for them. <p>Here we hope. Because after you walk through these halls, after you pass through the darkness, there is light: a glorious view of the Jerusalem Forest, with the sun shining over the historic homeland of the Jewish people; a fulfillment of the prophecy, \\"you shall live again . . . upon your own soil.\\" Here, on your ancient land, let it be said for all the world to hear: The State of Israel does not exist because of the Holocaust. But with the survival of a strong Jewish State of Israel, such a Holocaust will never happen again. <p>Here we pray that we all can be better, that we can all grow, like the sapling near the Children's Memorial, a sapling from a chestnut tree that Anne Frank could see from her window. The last time she described it in her diary, she wrote: \\"Our chestnut tree is in full bloom. It's covered with leaves and is even more beautiful than last year.\\" That's a reminder of who we can be. But we have to work for it. We have to work for it here in Israel. We have to work for it in America. We have to work for it around the world: to tend the light and the brightness as opposed to our worst instincts. <p>So may God bless the memory of the millions, may their souls be bound up in the bond of eternal life, and may each spring bring a full bloom even more beautiful than the last.\" "
"53" "\"It has now been 3 months since the tragic events in Newtown, Connecticut: 3 months since we lost 20 innocent children and 6 dedicated adults who had so much left to give; 3 months since we, as Americans, began asking ourselves if we're really doing enough to protect our communities and keep our children safe. <p>For the families who lost a loved one on that terrible day, 3 months doesn't even begin to ease the pain they're feeling right now. It doesn't come close to mending the wounds that may never fully heal. <p>But as a nation, the last 3 months have changed us. They forced us to answer some difficult questions about what we can do&mdash;what we must do&mdash;to prevent the kinds of massacres we've seen in Newtown and Aurora and Oak Creek, as well as the everyday tragedies that happen far too often in big cities and small towns all across America. <p>Today, there's still genuine disagreement among well-meaning people about what steps we should take to reduce the epidemic of gun violence in this country. But you, the American people, have spoken. You've made it clear that it's time to do something. And over the last few weeks, Senators here in Washington have listened and taken some big steps forward. <p>Two weeks ago, the Senate advanced a bill that would make it harder for criminals and people with a severe mental illness from getting their hands on a gun, an idea supported by 9 out of 10 Americans, including a majority of gun owners. The Senate also made progress on a bill that would crack down on anyone who buys a gun as part of a scheme to funnel it to criminals, reducing violent crime and protecting our law enforcement officers. Finally, the Senate took steps to reinstate and strengthen a ban on the sale of military-style assault weapons, set a 10-round limit for magazines, and make our schools safer places for kids to learn and grow. <p>These ideas shouldn't be controversial. They're common sense. They're supported by a majority of the American people. And I urge the Senate and the House to give each of them a vote. <p>As I've said before, we may not be able to prevent every act of violence in this country. But together, we have an obligation to try. We have an obligation to do what we can. <p>Right now we have a real chance to reduce gun violence in America and prevent the very worst violence. We have a unique opportunity to reaffirm our tradition of responsible gun ownership and also do more to keep guns out of the hands of criminals or people with a severe mental illness. <p>We've made progress over the last 3 months, but we're not there yet. And in the weeks ahead, I hope Members of Congress will join me in finishing the job: for our communities and, most importantly, for our kids. Thanks.\" "
"54" "\"Thank you so much. Well, good morning, everybody. Secretary Napolitano, thank you for administering the oath and making it official. Director Mayorkas, distinguished guests, family and friends, it is a great pleasure to have you here at the White House. And it is an honor to be among the first to greet some of my fellow citizens of the United States. <p>Today, here in the people's house&mdash;a house designed by an Irish immigrant&mdash;we welcome 28 men and women, immigrants themselves, who from this day forward have earned the precious right to call this country home. <p>And I know this is an incredibly special moment for you and your families, but I have to say, it's a special moment for the rest of us as well. Because as we look out across this room, we're reminded that what makes somebody American isn't just their bloodlines, it's not just an accident of birth. It's a fidelity to our founding principles, a faith in the idea that anyone, anywhere, can write the next great chapter in this American story. <p>That's the promise of America. And today we know it's alive and well in each and every one of you. <p>At first glance, of course, it would be easy to define this group by their differences. They all hail from different corners of the world&mdash;from Nigeria to Nicaragua, from the Philippines to Peru. They arrived here in different ways. Some of you came here as children, carried by parents who wished for a life that they had never had. Others came as adults, leaving behind everything you knew to seek a new life. But what binds you together&mdash;what binds us all together&mdash;is something more meaningful than anything of that. A love for this country and all that it represents&mdash;that's what unites each and every one of you. <p>For Nikita Kirichenko&mdash;there's Nikita right here&mdash;that love runs so deep it led him to enlist in our military. Nikita came here at the age of 11 from Ukraine. His mother saw America as the one place on Earth where her son could do anything he wanted. And a few years ago, Nikita decided that he wanted to join the Air Force so that, in his words, \\"I could give back to a country that took me in and gave me a better life.\\" Thank you, Nikita. Today, we proudly salute him not just as a member of our military but also as a citizen of our country. <p>Today, we salute Elrina Brits. Where did Elrina go? There she is. Elrina was born in South Africa, came here as a child, grew up in Washington State. When Elrina decided to join the Navy, somebody told her that she wouldn't be able to cut it. But even though she wasn't yet American on paper, she had that American quality of being defiant when somebody says you can't do something. [<i>Laughter</i>] So she proved them wrong. She deployed twice to the Middle East, once to Haiti, showcasing another quintessentially American impulse, and that's helping others in need. And as a new citizen, Elrina hopes to serve her country in a new way -- as a police officer. So, congratulations, Elrina. <p>Elrina, Nikita, every member of the military with us have shown incredible patriotism; a willingness to risk their lives in defense of a nation that was not yet their own. And that's a remarkable act. And it made each of them one of us. It made each of them in some ways American even before it was official. Because that kind of service and sacrifice has defined our nation for more than two centuries. <p>In America, we look out for one another. We see citizenship not just as a collection of rights but also as a set of responsibilities. That's who we are. And that's what brought so many to our shores, including Kingsley Elebo. Kingsley came here at the age of 35 from Nigeria, pursued his master's in information technology. He's now pursuing his doctorate. He wants to become a professor so he can help America lead the world in high-tech industries of tomorrow. And what Kingsley said is, \\"What makes this country great is that if you're a citizen you're part of something bigger than yourself.\\" And he's right. And we're glad that, as of today, Kingsley is part of it too. <p>We're also glad to welcome Pertula George-Redd. Pertula arrived in America from St. Lucia at the age of 23, leaving behind her parents and seven siblings. She came here to study international development. She stayed, for over a decade now, to work at non-profits that teach our kids about sustainable foods and how to live a healthier life by eating well&mdash;which I know Michelle is very happy about. Today, she also has the gratitude of her new nation. So, thank you so much. <p>We are so proud of everybody here. In each of you, we see the true spirit of America. And we see a bit of ourselves, too, because most of our stories trace back to moments just like this one. To an ancestor who, just like the men and women here today, raised their right hand and recited that sacred oath. <p>And the point is that unless you are one of the first Americans, unless you are a Native American, you came from someplace else. That's why we've always defined ourselves as a nation of immigrants. And we've always been better off for it. The promise we see in those who come from all over the world is one of our greatest strengths. It's kept our workforce young. It keeps our businesses on the cutting edge. It's helped to build the greatest economic engine that the world has ever known. And you think about the drive and the determination that it took for each of these 28 men and women to reach this moment. Imagine how far they'll go from here, the kind of difference that they'll be making on behalf of this country. <p>Immigration makes us a stronger. It keeps us vibrant. It keeps us hungry. It keeps us prosperous. It is part of what makes this such a dynamic country. And if we want to keep attracting the best and the brightest that the world has to offer, then we need to do a better job of welcoming them. We've known for years that our immigration system is broken, that we're not doing enough to harness the talent and ingenuity of all those who want to work hard and find a place here in America. And after avoiding the problem for years, the time has come to fix it once and for all. The time has come for a comprehensive, sensible immigration reform. <p>Now, a couple months ago in Nevada, and then last month again in my State of the Union address, I talked about how Republicans and Democrats were ready to tackle this problem together. And the good news is that since then, we've seen some real action in Congress. There are bipartisan groups in both the House and the Senate working to tackle this challenge, and I applaud them for that. We are making progress, but we've got to finish the job, because this issue is not new. <p>Everyone pretty much knows what's broken. Everybody knows how to fix it. We've all proposed solutions and we've got a lot of white papers and studies. And we've just got, at this point, to work up the political courage to do what's required to be done. So I expect a bill to be put forward. I expect the debate to begin next month. I want to sign that bill into law as soon as possible. <p>We know that real reform means continuing to strengthen our border security and holding employers accountable. We know that real reform means providing a responsible pathway to earned citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants who are currently living in the shadows&mdash;a pathway that includes passing a background check and paying taxes and a penalty, and learning English and then, going to the back of the line behind everyone else who is trying to come here legally. <p>We know that real reform requires modernizing the legal immigration system so that our citizens don't have to wait years before their loved ones are able to join them in America, and so that we're attracting the highly skilled entrepreneurs and engineers that are going to help create good paying jobs and grow our economy. <p>So let's get this done, and let's do it in a way that keeps faith with our history and our values. And no other country on Earth welcomes as many new arrivals as us. And as long as the promise of America endures, as long as we continue to stand tall as a beacon of hope and opportunity, then the world's hardest workers, the hungriest entrepreneurs, the men and women who are willing to make enormous sacrifices to get a better life&mdash;not just for themselves but for their children and their grandchildren, they're going to keep on coming. <p>And like the millions who came before&mdash;and like the 28 Americans who are here today&mdash;they will bring with them new hopes and new dreams, new ideas and new optimism about our future. That will make us stronger. That's how we'll make sure that our best days are ahead of us and not behind us. <p>So I want to thank each and every one of you for allowing me the opportunity to share in this incredible moment. One of the best things I get to do as President of the United States is to address all of you as fellow citizens. God bless you and God bless the United States of America. <p>And we now have one last piece of business to conclude the ceremony. I'd like to ask one of our newest citizen, Julian de la Valle, from Colombia, to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance. <p>Julian. <p>[<i>At the point, Mr. de la Valle led the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Congratulations. Congratulations all of you. Thank you. <p>And now, enjoy the White House, all right? [<i>Laughter</i>] Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"55" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! Welcome to the White House. And welcome back to the back-to-back MLS champion, the LA Galaxy. I was telling these guys, they're starting to get a little comfortable around here, because they just keep on coming back. But this time, they brought some company: the Stanley Cup champion, LA Kings. <p>Now, it is great to have both teams here, not just because they share a hometown. I'm a little resentful, coming from Chicago, that L.A. seems to be getting all these championships. But they don't just share a hometown, they also share a pretty good comeback story. <p>When it comes to the Galaxy, a team with Landon Donovan on it is rarely the underdog. But when the Galaxy was here last year, their chances of repeating as champions didn't look all that good. The injury bug plagued the team. It seemed like it might be a rebuilding year. But right after that visit, they turned things around. And you can call it a coincidence, but I just want to point out that right after they visited with me, the Galaxy built the best record in the league. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>In the MLS Cup Final, the Galaxy trailed at halftime, and it stayed that way until Omar Gonzalez, who is with the National Team today, scored the equalizer in the 60th minute. A few minutes after that, Landon did what he does best and scored the go-ahead goal. And pretty soon, they were up 3 to 1. And then midfielder Juninho was probably dancing the samba&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;the MLS Cup belonged to LA for the second-straight year, and that was the fourth in Galaxy history. <p>Now, the Kings' story is a little bit different. These guys were not defending champions. In fact, before last year, LA had never won the Stanley Cup. And after switching head coaches midseason&mdash;a coach, I should add, who got good training from the Chicago Blackhawks&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;squeaking into the playoffs as a number-eight seed, it looked like the streak of not winning was going to continue. No eight seed had ever won a championship in any of our professional sports. <p>But something happened during the playoffs: Timing is everything. And as center Jarret Stoll says, \\"We all came together at the right time, and we all peaked at the right time.\\" With playoff MVP Jonathan Quick playing lights out in goal, these guys just kept winning game after game after game. And eventually, the rest of the league started to take notice. <p>Captain Dustin Brown put it best before the final game. He said, \\"I don't know what 45 years of energy sounds like, but if we play our game, maybe we'll find out.\\" And that night at the STAPLES Center, they found out. And America found out that Southern California actually has some pretty intense hockey fans. <p>So I'm going to be a good sport: These guys pointed out that they beat my Blackhawks last night. I will also say that, given this season, how rare it is to beat the Blackhawks, I want to congratulate them for that as well. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We also found out that both these teams are full of some pretty stand-up players and coaches. They're out in the community year round. They're changing lives, they're making a difference. As Coach Arena of the Galaxy says: \\"The soccer is very much secondary. If we can have an impact on the lives of young kids, we want to be a part of that.\\" <p>And that's something we all appreciate, especially those of us who are parents. And we are thrilled that you guys are sticking around to host a \\"Let's Move!\\" question-and-answer session with kids from all across the country. <p>So I want to give a hearty congratulations to both the Kings and the Galaxy one more time for bringing two championships to L.A. and for doing so much for your fans back in California. <p>And we also know that there are a couple of Galaxy players who couldn't be here because of World Cup qualifying, so I want to wish Team USA the very best of luck as they take on Mexico tonight. I hope both these teams have a great rest of the season. <p>So everybody give them a big round of applause. Congratulations. Congratulations. <p>All right, we got some&mdash;are we going to do the jerseys at the podium? All right, so Landon, what do we got here? <p><i>LA Galaxy Forward Landon Donovan</i>. We have a ball for you, and then we've got a&mdash;&mdash; <p>[<i>At this point, the President tossed the soccer ball upward, bounced it off his forehead, and caught it.</i>] <p><i>Mr. Donovan. </i>That was pretty good. [<i>Laughter</i>] And then, we've got a jersey for you. <p><i>The President.</i> I hope you guys caught that. That doesn't happen very often. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Mr. Donovan.</i> And a jersey. <p><i>The President.</i> That is a nice-looking jersey. All right, let's&mdash;thank you. <p>So am I going to stand over here? Okay. And what do we got here? <p><i>LA Kings Right Wing Dustin Brown.</i> Just a jersey here. <p><i>The President.</i> That's a good-looking jersey. Forty-four, it's a lucky number. All right, thank you.\" "
"56" "\"<i>The President.</i> Okay, Joe. You got the floor. <p>[<i>At this point, Vice President Joe Biden administered the oath of office to Ms. Pierson.</i>] <p><i>Vice President Biden.</i> Congratulations. <p><i>The President.</i> Great job. <p><i>Ms. Pierson</i>. Thank you very much, Mr. President. <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you so much. Well, listen, I have to say that Julia's reputation within the Service is extraordinary. She's come up through the ranks. She's done just about every job there is to do at the Secret Service. <p>Obviously, she's breaking the mold in terms of Directors of the agencies, and I think that people are all extraordinarily proud of her. And we have the greatest confidence in the wonderful task that lies ahead and very confident that she is going to do a great job. So we just want to say congratulations. <p>As Joe Biden pointed out, this person now probably has more control over our lives than anyone else&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;except for our spouses. And I couldn't be placing our lives in better hands than Julia's. <p><i>Vice President Biden.</i> And my agents are excited that we picked her. <p><i>The President.</i> Absolutely. You're going to do a great job. <p><i>Q. </i>How did you make your decision? <p><i>The President.</i> She has extraordinary qualifications, and I think a lot of people who have worked with Julia know how dedicated, how professional, how committed she is, and, I think, are absolutely certain that she's going to thrive in this job. All right? <p>Thank you, guys. <p><i>NCAA Basketball Tournament </i><p><i>Q. </i>How are you feeling about your bracket, sir? <p><i>The President.</i> Busted. [<i>Laughter</i>] I think my women's bracket is doing much better than my men's bracket.\" "
"57" "\"Thank you, everybody. Thank you, Katerina, for sharing your story. Reema was lucky to have you as a teacher, and all of us are fortunate to have you here today. And I'm glad we had a chance to remember her. <p>Katerina, as you just heard, lost one of her most promising students in Virginia Tech, the shootings there that took place 6 years ago. And she and dozens of other moms and dads, all victims of gun violence, have come here today from across the country, united not only in grief and loss, but also in resolve, and in courage, and in a deep determination to do whatever they can, as parents and as citizens to protect other kids and spare other families from the awful pain that they have endured. <p>As any of the families and friends who are here today can tell you, the grief doesn't ever go away. That loss, that pain sticks with you. It lingers on in places like Blacksburg and Tucson and Aurora. That anguish is still fresh in Newtown. It's been barely 100 days since 20 innocent children and 6 brave educators were taken from us by gun violence, including Grace McDonnell and Lauren Rousseau and Jesse Lewis, whose families are here today. <p>That agony burns deep in the families of thousands&mdash;thousands&mdash;of Americans who have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun over these last 100 days, including Hadiya Pendleton, who was killed on her way to school less than 2 months ago and whose mom is also here today. Everything they lived for and hoped for, taken away in an instant. We have moms on this stage whose children were killed as recently as 35 days ago. <p>I don't think any of us who are parents can hear their stories and not think about our own daughters and our own sons and our own grandchildren. We all feel that it is our first impulse as parents to do everything we can to protect our children from harm, to make any sacrifice to keep them safe, to do what we have to do to give them a future where they can grow up and learn and explore and become the amazing people they're destined to be. <p>That's why, in January, Joe Biden, leading a task force, came up with, and I put forward, a series of commonsense proposals to reduce the epidemic of gun violence and keep our kids safe. In my State of the Union Address, I called on Congress to give these proposals a vote. And in just a couple of weeks, they will. <p>Earlier this month, the Senate advanced some of the most important reforms designed to reduce gun violence. All of them are consistent with the Second Amendment. None of them will infringe on the rights of responsible gun owners. What they will do is keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people who put others at risk. And this is our best chance in more than a decade to take commonsense steps that will save lives. <p>As I said when I visited Newtown just over 3 months ago, if there is a step we can take that will save just one child, just one parent, just another town from experiencing the same grief that some of the moms and dads who are here have endured, then we should be doing it. We have an obligation to try. <p>Now, in the coming weeks, Members of Congress will vote on whether we should require universal background checks for anyone who wants to buy a gun so that criminals or people with severe mental illnesses can't get their hands on one. They'll vote on tough new penalties for anyone who buys guns only to turn around and sell them to criminals. They'll vote on a measure that would keep weapons of war and high-capacity ammunition magazines that facilitate these mass killings off our streets. They'll get to vote on legislation that would help schools become safer and help people struggling with mental health problems to get the treatment that they need. <p>None of these ideas should be controversial. Why wouldn't we want to make it more difficult for a dangerous person to get his or her hand on a gun? Why wouldn't we want to close the loophole that allows as many as 40 percent of all gun purchases to take place without a background check? Why wouldn't we do that? <p>And if you ask most Americans outside of Washington&mdash;including many gun owners&mdash;some of these ideas, they don't consider them controversial. Right now 90 percent of Americans&mdash;90 percent&mdash;support background checks that will keep criminals and people who have been found to be a danger to themselves or others from buying a gun. More than 80 percent of Republicans agree. More than 80 percent of gun owners agree. Think about that. How often do 90 percent of Americans agree on anything? [<i>Laughter</i>] It never happens. <p>Many other reforms are supported by clear majorities of Americans. And I ask every American to find out where your Member of Congress stands on these ideas. If they're not part of that 90 percent who agree that we should make it harder for a criminal or somebody with a severe mental illness to buy a gun, then you should ask them, why not? Why are you part of the 10 percent? <p>There's absolutely no reason why we can't get this done. But the reason we're talking about it here today is because it's not done until it's done. And there are some powerful voices on the other side that are interested in running out the clock or changing the subject or drowning out the majority of the American people to prevent any of these reforms from happening at all. They're doing everything they can to make all our progress collapse under the weight of fear and frustration. Or their assumption is that people will just forget about it. <p>I read an article in the news just the other day wondering is Washington&mdash;has Washington missed its opportunity, because as time goes on after Newtown, somehow, people start moving on and forgetting. Let me tell you, the people here, they don't forget. Grace's dad is not forgetting. Hadiya's mom hasn't forgotten. The notion that 2 months or 3 months after something as horrific as what happened in Newtown happens and we've moved on to other things, that's not who we are. That's not who we are. <p>Now, I want to make sure every American is listening today. Less than 100 days ago that happened, and the entire country was shocked. And the entire country pledged we would do something about it and that this time would be different. Shame on us if we've forgotten. I haven't forgotten those kids. Shame on us if we've forgotten. <p>If there's one thing I've said consistently since I first ran for this office: Nothing is more powerful than millions of voices calling for change. And that's why it's so important that all these moms and dads are here today. But that's also why it's important that we've got grassroots groups out there that got started and are out there mobilizing and organizing and keeping up the fight. That's what it's going to take to make this country safer. It's going to take moms and dads, and hunters and sportsmen and clergy and local officials, like the mayors who are here today, standing up and saying, this time really is different: that we're not just going to sit back and wait until the next Newtown or the next Blacksburg or the next innocent, beautiful child is gunned down in a playground in Chicago or Philadelphia or Los Angeles before we summon the will to act. <p>Right now Members of Congress are back home in their districts, and many of them are holding events where they can hear from their constituents. So I want everybody who is listening to make yourself heard right now. <p>If you think that checking someone's criminal record before he can check out a gun show is common sense, you've got to make yourself heard. If you're a responsible, law-abiding gun owner who wants to keep irresponsible, law-breaking individuals from abusing the right to bear arms by inflicting harm on a massive scale, speak up. We need your voices in this debate. If you're a mom like Katerina who wants to make this country safer, a stronger place for our children to learn and grow up, get together with other moms, like the ones here today, and raise your voices and make yourselves unmistakably heard. <p>We need everybody to remember how we felt 100 days ago and make sure that what we said at that time wasn't just a bunch of platitudes, that we meant it. <p>The desire to make a difference is what brought Corey Thornblad here today. Corey grew up in Oklahoma, where her dad sold firearms at gun shows. And today, she's a mom and a teacher. And Corey said that after Newtown, she cried for days: for the students who could have been her students; for the parents she could have known; for the teachers like her who go to work every single day and love their kids and want them to succeed. And Corey says: \\"My heart was broken. And I decided now was the time to act, to march, the time to petition, the time to make phone calls, because tears were no longer enough.\\" And that's my attitude. <p>Tears aren't enough. Expressions of sympathy aren't enough. Speeches aren't enough. We've cried enough. We've known enough heartbreak. What we're proposing is not radical, it's not taking away anybody's gun rights. It's something that, if we are serious, we will do. <p>Now is the time to turn that heartbreak into something real. It won't solve every problem. There will still be gun deaths. There will still be tragedies. There will still be violence. There will still be evil. But we can make a difference if not just the activists here on this stage, but the general public&mdash;including responsible gun owners&mdash;say, you know what, we can do better than this. We can do better to make sure that fewer parents have to endure the pain of losing a child to an act of violence. <p>That's what this is about. And enough people like Katerina and Corey and the rest of the parents who are here today get involved, and if enough Members of Congress take a stand for cooperation and common sense and lead and don't get squishy because time has passed and maybe it's not on the news every single day, if that's who we are, if that's our character, that we're willing to follow through on commitments that we say are important&mdash;commitments to each other and to our kids&mdash;then I'm confident we can make this country a safer place for all of them. <p>So thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"58" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Miami! It is good to be back. You know, I've been waiting for spring. I realize I just had to come down to Miami. [<i>Laughter</i>] It is wonderful to be here. <p>We've got some outstanding Representatives in Congress from this area. Joe Garcia is in the house. Frederica Wilson is in the house. And we've got Debbie Wasserman Schultz here. I want to thank the Mayor of Miami-Dade County, Carlos Gimenez. And of course, it's good to see all of you. And I want to thank the gentlemen who just gave me a amazing tour of the PortMiami Tunnel. <p><i>Audience member</i>. Yay! <p><i>The President.</i> What are you yelling about? Hey, sweetie. <p><i>Audience member.</i> She came just to see you! <p><i>The President.</i> Okay, well, hello. [<i>Laughter</i>] She's going to be a politician, because I could hear her without a mike from far away. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, before we get started, I've got to get into a sticky subject right off the bat. I know you guys aren't happy with my Chicago Bulls. <p><i>Audience members</i>. Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> But I just want you to know the Heat are going to be just fine. They're going to be okay. They are playing basketball the right way. The Hurricanes&mdash;they had a great season&mdash;no, no, they deserve a big round of applause. Tonight you've got Florida and Florida Gulf Coast going at it. One of them will go to the Elite Eight. So let's face it: Florida is the center of basketball right now. <p>But I'm not here to talk about hoops. I'm here to talk about one of the plans that I put forward in my State of the Union Address: a plan to put people to work rebuilding America. <p>I've come to PortMiami today because there are few more important things we can do to create jobs right now and strengthen our economy over the long haul than rebuilding the infrastructure that powers our businesses and our economy: our roads, our bridges, our schools, and our ports just like this one. <p>As President, my top priority is to make sure we are doing everything we can to reignite the true engine of our economic growth, and that is a rising, thriving middle class. A growing economy that creates good, middle class jobs. That's got to be our true north. That's what has to guide our efforts every single day. And to do that, we should be asking ourselves three questions every single day. Number one, how do we make America a magnet for good jobs? Number two, how do we equip our workers with the skills they need to do the jobs? Number three, how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living? <p>When it comes to good jobs, no workers were hammered harder by the recession than construction workers. Fortunately, the unemployment rate for construction has been cut nearly in half over the past 3 years, partly because the housing market is starting to bounce back. But construction still has the highest unemployment rate of any industry. Breaking ground on more projects like this tunnel that I just saw means more good construction jobs that can't be outsourced. They have to be done right here in America. And they end up giving people good pay and good opportunities to raise their families. <p>Projects like this create a lot of other good jobs too. You ask any CEO where would they rather locate their business and hire new workers. Are you going to set up shop in a country that's got raggedy roads, runways that are potholed; backed up supply chains? Or are you going to seek out high-speed rail, Internet, high-tech schools, new state-of-the-art power grids, new bridges, new tunnels, new ports that help you ship products made in America to the rest of the world as fast as possible? That's what people are looking for. That's what CEOs are looking for. <p>When you ask companies who brought jobs back to America in the last few years, they'll say, if we upgrade our infrastructure, we'll bring even more. So what are we waiting for? There's work to be done, there are workers who are ready to do it. Let's prove to the world there's no better place to do business than right here in the United States of America, and let's get started rebuilding America. <p>Now, over the last 4 years, we've done some good work. Construction crews have built or improved more than 350,000 miles of road. That's enough to circle the globe 14 times. We've upgraded more than 6,000 miles of rail, enough to go coast-to-coast and back. We've repaired or replaced more than 20,000 bridges. We've helped get tens of thousands of construction workers back on the job. <p>Because of these efforts, when the American Society of Engineers [American Society of Civil Engineers; White House correction.] put out their 2013 report card on our national infrastructure, they gave it the best overall grade in 12 years. That's the good news. The bad news is we went from a D to a D+. We still have all kinds of deferred maintenance. We still have too many ports that aren't equipped for today's world commerce. We've still got too many rail lines that are too slow and clogged up. We've still got too many roads that are in disrepair, too many bridges that aren't safe. <p>We don't have to accept that for America. We can do better. We can build better. And in a time of tight budgets, we've got to do it in a way that makes sure taxpayer dollars are spent wisely. <p>Now what these outstanding folks here in Miami have been doing is a good example of how my plan would work. Port of Miami is a busy place. Hundreds of cargo containers pass through every day. Nearly one in five cruise ship passengers in North America sets sail from this port. All that commerce helps support a whole lot of high-paying jobs not just in Miami-Dade, but throughout the region. <p>But it also, let's face it, creates some congestion. Right now 16,000 cars and trucks travel to and from PortMiami every day, and they're stuck going through downtown. And those traffic jams are bad for business. Whether you're a small-business owner in South Beach or a manufacturer in Atlanta trying to get your goods overseas, that congestion wastes time and money. <p>Now some smart folks decided we could solve this problem by digging under the bay, linking the port directly to the highway. State, county, and local governments got together and agreed to jointly fund PortMiami Tunnel. Everybody had some skin in the game. They did something else; they partnered with a group of private sector companies to finance the design and construction of the project. They made it clear that the payments to these companies would be linked to their performance so if there were big cost overruns, the private companies would have to eat those extra costs. Because of those efforts, construction workers are on the job digging this tunnel, doing great jobs, getting good pay, boosting the economy, strengthening it for the long run. The port is in better shape, which means it's going to be able to get all the containers that are coming in from all around the world, matched up with the improvements that are being done on the Panama Canal, which means we're not going to be losing jobs to other countries. <p>We can do this not just here in Miami-Dade, but we can do this all across the country. So today, I'm expanding on a proposal I made in the State of the Union. I'm calling it a Partnership to Rebuild America. It's a partnership with the private sector that creates jobs upgrading what our businesses need most: modern ports to move our goods, modern pipelines to withstand a storm; modern schools worthy of our children. <p>And my plan does three things. First, we'll set up an independent fund that will attract private investment to build projects like this one and make sure companies share in the risk and returns. Instead of picking projects based on pork barrel politics, we'll pick them based on how much good they'll actually do for the economy, how much the projects make sense. And we'll better finance projects that involve more than one mode of transportation or more than one town or State, with less redtape to gum up the works. So all of this will make the process more efficient. It will help us break ground on some of the projects that our cities and States need most, and they can do it faster and better. <p>Second, we're going to fund more projects at less cost, by establishing a new infrastructure initiative called America Fast Forward bonds. It's going to give mayors and Governors more flexibility and power to attract private investment for public projects. <p>Number three, we'll strengthen a loan program that in recent years, has helped Governors and mayors leverage four times the money Washington put into it and that means we're helping construction workers get on the job quicker, repaying taxpayers their hard-earned money faster. That's the kind of approach we used to help PortMiami Tunnel get off the ground&mdash;or I guess underground. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>That's the Partnership to Rebuild America. That's how we'll create good jobs, doing the work America needs done. That's how we'll encourage more businesses to start here and grow here and hire workers here. <p>And by the way, this should not be a partisan idea. I know in Washington, people just like to argue. I guess it gets them on TV. But the fact is you've got the Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO agreeing to better infrastructure, knowing that it will help both businesses and workers. So if you're got the Chamber and the unions agreeing, then the politicians should be able to agree, too. Building better roads and bridges and schools, that's not a partisan idea. And in fact, that's where you can get mayors and Governors from both parties to find some common ground. <p>I know that Members of Congress are happy to welcome projects like this in their districts. I know because I've seen them at the ribbon-cuttings. [<i>Laughter</i>] They'll all say how, no, we don't want to do it. And then they're all writing me letters saying, we really need this port. Cut somebody else's port out. That's what they'll say. Cut somebody else's road. Cut somebody else's&mdash;well, no, we're all in this together. So if you think it's good for your district, then it's probably good for other districts too. <p>We can't afford Washington politics to stand in the way of America's progress. So I've put forward some ideas to get the private sector involved to protect taxpayer dollars. But ultimately, Congress has to fund these projects. And by the way, the three Members of Congress who are here, they all believe in this, they all support it. It will put people back to work and it will grow our economy in the process. <p>So, Miami-Dade, my main message is: Let's get this done. Let's rebuild this country we love. Let's make sure we're staying on the cutting edge. Let's make sure we've always got the best ports. Let's make sure we've got the best airports. Let's make sure we've got the best rail lines. Let's make sure we've got the best roads. Let's make sure we've got the best schools. <p>We're going to push on this issue each and every day, and make sure we get the middle class going again. We're going to fix our economy. We're going to fix our immigration system. We are going to make sure that our young people are getting a great education. We're going to prevent them from being victims of gun violence. We are going to make sure that everybody in this country has a fair shot and is doing their fair share so that when we pass on this country to the next generation and the generation after that, we'll be able to once again say that here in the United States of America, it doesn't matter what you look like or where you come from, if you work hard, you can make it. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"59" "\"Hi, everybody. For millions of Americans, this is a special and sacred time of year. <p>This week, Jewish families gathered around the Seder table, commemorating the Exodus from Egypt and the triumph of faith over oppression. And this weekend, Michelle, Malia, Sasha, and I will join Christians around the world to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the hopeful promise of Easter. <p>In the midst of all of our busy and noisy lives, these holy days afford us the precious opportunity to slow down and spend some quiet moments in prayer and reflection. As Christians, my family and I remember the incredible sacrifice Jesus made for each and every one of us, how He took on the sins of the world, and extended the gift of salvation. And we recommit ourselves to following His example here on Earth: to loving our Lord and Savior, to loving our neighbors, and to seeing everyone, especially \\"the least of these,\\" as a child of God. <p>Of course, those values are at the heart not just of the Christian faith, but of all faiths. From Judaism to Islam, Hinduism to Sikhism, there echoes a powerful call to serve our brothers and sisters, to keep in our hearts a deep and abiding compassion for all, and to treat others as we wish to be treated ourselves. <p>That's the common humanity that binds us together. And as Americans, we're united by something else too: faith in the ideals that lie at the heart of our founding and the belief that, as part of something bigger than ourselves, we have a shared responsibility to look out for our fellow citizens. <p>So this weekend, I hope we're all able to take a moment and pause and reflect, to embrace our loved ones, to give thanks for our blessings, to rededicate ourselves to interests larger than our own. And to all the Christian families who are celebrating the resurrection, Michelle and I wish you a blessed and joyful Easter. <p>God bless you, and may God continue to bless the United States of America.\" "
"60" "\"<i>The President.</i> Miss Jessica Sanchez, everybody! Give her a big round of applause. Kid President&mdash;give Kid President a big round of applause. The Easter Bunny is here. Give Easter Bunny a big round of applause. <p>It is wonderful to see all of you. And I just want to say welcome. You guys brought the great weather. It was a little shaky this morning, but all of you did a great job sending a message upstairs, and now we've got beautiful weather. <p>And I now want to introduce the star of the Obama family, my wife, the First Lady, Michelle Obama. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Kid President, Robbie Novak. Isn't he wonderful? Robbie, we're so proud to have you here. You have been so inspiring. I can't imagine that there's anyone who hasn't seen your video, right? You make us all want to work hard and be better. That's right. So you're going to spend a little time in the Oval Office just fixing things up for this President, aren't you? All right, well, it's good to have you here. <p>And it's great to have everyone here this morning. We are so excited. The Easter egg roll is the biggest event that we have here on the South Lawn of the White House each year. Today we're going to have more than 30,000 people who will pass through this yard in celebration of nutrition and health and activity. And we could not do this if it were not for all of our wonderful volunteers, our staff, all of the terrific performers and athletes who have taken time out of their lives and their busy days to make this important. So we need to give all of them a round of applause for all their hard work. Yes, indeed! <p>So today we want you to have a great time. We want you to run around. We want you to go over and see the White House Garden. We want you to learn about making tasty, healthy food. We're going to come down and do some Easter egg roll. We're going to read some stories. But overall, we want you guys to have a good time and keep moving and be healthy. And, kids, eat your vegetables, okay? <p>All right, you all, take care. We'll see you down there. Bye-bye. Thank you.\" "
"61" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you so much. Thank you, everybody. Please have a seat. Well, first of all, let me thank Dr. Collins not just for the introduction, but for his incredible leadership at NIH. Those of you who know Francis also know that he's quite a gifted singer and musician. So I was asking whether he was going to be willing to sing the introduction&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and he declined. <p>But his leadership has been extraordinary. And I'm glad I've been promoted Scientist in Chief. [<i>Laughter</i>] Given my grades in physics, I'm not sure it's deserving, but I hold science in proper esteem, so maybe that gives me a little credit. <p>Today I've invited some of the smartest people in the country, some of the most imaginative and effective researchers in the country&mdash;some very smart people&mdash;to talk about the challenge that I issued in my State of the Union Address: to grow our economy, to create new jobs, to reignite a rising, thriving middle class by investing in one of our core strengths, and that's American innovation. <p>Ideas are what power our economy. It's what sets us apart. It's what America has been all about. We have been a nation of dreamers and risk takers, people who see what nobody else sees, sooner than anybody else sees it. We do innovation better than anybody else, and that makes our economy stronger. When we invest in the best ideas before anybody else does, our businesses and our workers can make the best products and deliver the best services before anybody else. <p>And because of that incredible dynamism, we don't just attract the best scientists or the best entrepreneurs, we also continually invest in their success. We support labs and universities to help them learn and explore. And we fund grants to help them turn a dream into a reality. And we have a patent system to protect their inventions. And we offer loans to help them turn those inventions into successful businesses. <p>And the investments don't always pay off. But when they do, they change our lives in ways that we could never have imagined. Computer chips and GPS technology, the Internet&mdash;all these things grew out of Government investments in basic research. And sometimes, in fact, some of the best products and services spin off completely from unintended research that nobody expected to have certain applications. Businesses then use that technology to create countless new jobs. <p>So the founders of Google got their early support from the National Science Foundation. The Apollo project that put a man on the Moon also gave us, eventually, CAT scans. And every dollar we spent to map the human genome has returned $140 to our economy&mdash;$1 of investment, $140 in return. Dr. Collins helped lead that genome effort, and that's why we thought it was appropriate to have him here to announce the next great American project, and that's what we're calling the BRAIN Initiative. <p>As humans, we can identify galaxies light years away, we can study particles smaller than an atom. But we still haven't unlocked the mystery of the three pounds of matter that sits between our ears. [<i>Laughter</i>] But today, scientists possess the capability to study individual neurons and figure out the main functions of certain areas of the brain. But a human brain contains almost 100 billion neurons making trillions of connections. So Dr. Collins says it's like listening to the strings section and trying to figure out what the whole orchestra sounds like. So as a result, we're still unable to cure diseases like Alzheimer's or autism or fully reverse the effects of a stroke. And the most powerful computer in the world isn't nearly as intuitive as the one we're born with. <p>So there is this enormous mystery waiting to be unlocked, and the BRAIN Initiative will change that by giving scientists the tools they need to get a dynamic picture of the brain in action and better understand how we think and how we learn and how we remember. And that knowledge could be&mdash;will be&mdash;transformative. <p>In the budget I will send to Congress next week, I will propose a significant investment by the National Institutes of Health, DARPA, and the National Science Foundation to help get this project off the ground. I'm directing my bioethics commission to make sure all of the research is being done in a responsible way. And we're also partnering with the private sector, including leading companies and foundations and research institutions, to tap the Nation's brightest minds to help us reach our goal. <p>And of course, none of this will be easy. If it was, we would already know everything there was about how the brain works, and presumably my life would be simpler here. [<i>Laughter</i>] It would&mdash;could explain all kinds of things that go on in Washington. [<i>Laughter</i>] We could prescribe something. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So it won't be easy. But think about what we could do once we do crack this code. Imagine if no family had to feel helpless watching a loved one disappear behind the mask of Parkinson's or struggle in the grip of epilepsy. Imagine if we could reverse traumatic brain injury or PTSD for our veterans who are coming home. Imagine if someone with a prosthetic limb can now play the piano or throw a baseball as well as anybody else because the wiring from the brain to that prosthetic is direct and triggered by what's already happening in the patient's mind. What if computers could respond to our thoughts or our language barriers could come tumbling down. Or if millions of Americans were suddenly finding new jobs in these fields&mdash;jobs we haven't even dreamt up yet&mdash;because we chose to invest in this project. <p>That's the future we're imagining. That's what we're hoping for. That's why the BRAIN Initiative is so absolutely important. And that's why it's so important that we think about basic research generally as a driver of growth and that we replace the across-the-board budget cuts that are threatening to set us back before we even get started. A few weeks ago, the directors of some of our national laboratories said that the sequester&mdash;these arbitrary, across-the-board cuts that have gone into place&mdash;are so severe, so poorly designed, that they will hold back a generation of young scientists. <p>When our leading thinkers wonder if it still makes sense to encourage young people to get involved in science in the first place because they're not sure whether the research funding and the grants will be there to cultivate an entire new generation of scientists, that's something we should worry about. We can't afford to miss these opportunities while the rest of the world races ahead. We have to seize them. I don't want the next job-creating discoveries to happen in China or India or Germany, I want them to happen right here, in the United States of America. <p>And that's part of what this BRAIN Initiative is about. That's why we're pursuing other grand challenges like making solar energy as cheap as coal or making electric vehicles as affordable as the ones that run on gas. They're ambitious goals, but they're achievable. And we're encouraging companies and research universities and other organizations to get involved and help us make progress. <p>We have a chance to improve the lives of not just millions, but billions of people on this planet through the research that's done in this BRAIN Initiative alone. But it's going to require a serious effort, a sustained effort. And it's going to require us as a country to embody and embrace that spirit of discovery that is what made America America. <p>The year before I was born, an American company came out with one of the earliest minicomputers. It was a revolutionary machine, didn't require its own air conditioning system. That was a big deal. It took only one person to operate, but each computer was 8 feet tall, weighed 1,200 pounds, and cost more than $100,000. And today, most of the people in this room, including the person whose cell phone just rang&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;have a far more powerful computer in their pocket. Computers have become so small, so universal, so ubiquitous, most of us can't imagine life without them; certainly, my kids can't. <p>And as a consequence, millions of Americans work in fields that didn't exist before their parents were born. Watson&mdash;the computer that won \\"Jeopardy!\\"&mdash;is now being used in hospitals across the country to diagnose diseases like cancer. That's how much progress has been made in my lifetime and in many of yours. That's how fast we can move when we make the investments. <p>But we can't predict what that next big thing will be. We don't know what life will be like 20 years from now or 50 years or 100 years down the road. What we do know is if we keep investing in the most prominent, promising solutions to our toughest problems, then things will get better. <p>I don't want our children or grandchildren to look back on this day and wish we had done more to keep America at the cutting edge. I want them to look back and be proud that we took some risks, that we seized this opportunity. That's what the American story is about. That's who we are. That's why this BRAIN Initiative is so important. And if we keep taking bold steps like the one we're talking about to learn about the brain, then I'm confident America will continue to lead the world in the next frontiers of human understanding. And all of you are going to help us get there. <p>So I'm very excited about this project. Francis, let's get to work. God bless you and God bless the United States of America. Thank you.\" "
"62" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. Well, first of all, let me thank Ann and Gordon for once again extending such gracious hospitality to all of us. I was reminded that I was first here in 2008, when I was running the first time, and I had much less gray hair. [<i>Laughter</i>] But they were kind to me then and have been kind to me since, and I appreciate very much their friendship and support. <p>I want to acknowledge Steve Israel, who is here and has an often thankless, extraordinarily difficult, but critically important job, and he's done so with good humor and boundless energy. And so please give Congressman Steve Israel a big round of applause. <p>And of course, I'm here because your neighbor told me I needed to be here. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I am here because there are very few people in public office who I am more fond of and respectful than the person who just introduced me, Nancy Pelosi. She is thoughtful, she's visionary, she's as tough as nails. [<i>Laughter</i>] She is practical. She never lets ideology cloud her judgment. She's constantly motivated by how do we create a country that is more just, more fair, more dynamic. She knows why she's in public life. It's connected to her values: the values that she grew up with, the values that she's raised her kids and now spoils her grandkids with. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I'm just so proud to call her a friend. <p>And I am here because I won my last election. But I'm here because my job is not simply to occupy the Oval Office. My job is to make sure we move the country forward, and I think we can best do that if Nancy Pelosi is Speaker of the House once again. <p>Nancy used a word that I've spent a lot of time thinking about these days. And that's the word \\"citizenship.\\" I talked about it at the Inauguration speech. I talked about it at the State of the Union speech. I actually talked about it at the convention, my acceptance speech. And the reason I care about the word so much is because there are times in today's busy world, the media chatter, where there's a government over here somewhere, and then there's people and ordinary life and the private sector, and all that stuff is over there. And somehow, the notion is that these two things are separate. <p>And some of the folks who most adamantly insist that government is something alien and distant are the same folks who claim the mantle of the Founders and believe that their views best represent the original intentions of those who fought for and formed this country. <p>And yet, when I read the Declaration of Independence, when I read the Constitution, when I look at all the great documents and laws that have been passed that built this country up, what I see is this central idea that citizenship means we are the government&mdash;the government of and by and for the people&mdash;which means we have responsibilities that extend beyond voting or even writing a check. <p>It speaks to rights, but it also speaks to responsibilities and obligations. It suggests that we are responsible for ourselves and our families and our neighborhoods and our cities and our farmlands and our neighbors and our Nation and future generations. And so we don't just think about us, we think about \\"we the people.\\" That's the idea that motivated me to get into public service in the first place. That's what, I think, has always been at the heart of America. <p>And the reason that we've been able to make significant progress over the last 4 years and couple months is because a lot of you have believed it too. That's how I got elected in 2008. That's how Nancy Pelosi became Speaker in 2006. That's the reason that we were able to yank an economy on the verge of depression and get it back on track to growth and job creation. That's the reason that we were able to pass a health care law that is already helping millions of people and will help millions more when it is fully implemented next year. <p>That's the reason we've been able to put people back to work building roads and bridges and water systems and new park trails all across this country. That's the reason that we were able to double fuel efficiency standards on cars, begin the process of reducing carbons and making our economy more energy efficient, and doubling the amount of clean energy that we're producing through wind and solar and other renewables. <p>It's the reason that we've been able slowly to nurse the housing market back to health. That is the reason that we've been able to keep this country safe while still being true to our values and principles of rule of law. <p>That is the reason why we've been able to help millions of kids all across this country go to college who couldn't otherwise afford it. We've started to reform schools at the K-12 level. <p>We were able to do all this because you believed in citizenship. And the reason I ran for another term was because I think we've got more work to do. And the reason that Nancy wants to be Speaker again is because she thinks we have more work to do. I assure you that she does not like being away from her grandkids. [<i>Laughter</i>] She could be doing a lot of other stuff. Steve makes enormous sacrifices. He's got to travel all across the country raising money constantly and recruiting candidates. He'd love to be home. But we think we've got more work to do. <p>Now, this year, we have a window. Just completed one election. We would like to see some governing done in Washington before the next election starts. [<i>Laughter</i>] And so we've got this opportunity that we need to seize to initiate serious gun safety legislation, reduce gun violence, to make sure that we finally get a comprehensive immigration reform done, because we are a nation of laws, but we are also a nation of immigrants, and those two things are not incompatible. <p>We have more work to do to make sure that we stabilize our finances in a way that still allows us to make investments in critical infrastructure and basic research. Somebody mentioned to me, they heard my speech about the new BRAIN Initiative that we've put forward, just an entire sweeping horizon of possibilities when it comes to curing Alzheimer's and curing Parkinson's and so many diseases, but also just allowing us to do things that we couldn't even imagine a year ago, 2 years ago. Now we're on the threshold of cracking a code that could open up endless possibilities. <p>Now, in order to do that, we've got to be able to pass laws. There are some things I can do administratively, a lot of stuff that we can do administratively, but a lot of stuff we've got to do legislatively. Right now we're constrained by what we get done. And I have said publicly, and I will say it to this room once again, that I believe that Republicans love their kids and their country as much as we do and there are a whole bunch of folks out there who I believe actually want to cooperate with us, but feel constrained right now because of their own politics. <p>I'm looking and probing for every crack and possible opportunity to join in a bipartisan fashion to solve these problems, because I think most of the problems out there are ones that, at least historically, have garnered support from Democrats and Republicans, and that's&mdash;there is nothing inherently Democratic about building roads or funding research or looking out for the environment. It used to be a great bipartisan set of ideas. <p>And so my hope is, is that we can get some governing done this year, and I know that Nancy feels the same way. By the way, she's already worked with her caucus to deliver votes on things that aren't necessarily politically advantageous, but are the right thing to do. She did it as Speaker, and she's done it as Democratic Leader in the House. So we want to get this&mdash;we just want to get stuff done. <p>And I won't say&mdash;I won't speak for Nancy here. I will speak for myself. I would love nothing better than an effective, loyal opposition that is willing to meet us halfway and move the country forward, because that's what the American people are looking for. The economy is growing, but there is still a lot of folks out there who are struggling: still way too many people who are unemployed; people who haven't seen a raise in a decade; people whose homes are still underwater; people who when they see four-dollar-a-gallon gas know that that is money that's coming straight out of their pockets or their retirement funds and is going to be very hard to make up. And they're hoping that we can do some governing. And that's what I intend to do this year and the year after that and the year after that. <p>But I would be dishonest if I didn't say that it would be a whole lot easier to govern if I had Nancy Pelosi as Speaker. [<i>Laughter</i>] Because here are the stakes: I actually think we've got a great chance of getting immigration reform done. I think we have a good chance of getting serious gun safety legislation done. But if we're going to move forward on some of the other things I talked about in the State of the Union&mdash;making sure that we've got early childhood education for every child in America so that they can&mdash;[<i>inaudible</i>]. <p>If we're going to deal with the $2 trillion of deferred maintenance we've got in terms of infrastructure&mdash;not just roads and bridges, but a smart grid that can connect up clean energy to our cities and make sure that we continue to reduce not only existing loads of renewable energy, but also discovering those breakthroughs that are going to make all the difference down the future&mdash;then I'm going to need some more help in Congress. <p>If we're going to deal with climate change in a serious way, then we've got to have folks in Congress&mdash;even when it's not politically convenient&mdash;to talk about it and advocate for it and break out of this notion that somehow there's a contradiction between us being good stewards of the environment and us growing this economy. They are not a contradiction. We can grow this economy fast and faster if we are seizing the opportunities of the future and not just looking at the energy sources of the past. We're going to need some help. <p>I'm going to need some help if we are going to continue to make progress in assuring that every young person in this country has a chance to go to college and that they can afford it. I'm going to need some help if we're going to make sure that simple stuff&mdash;what should be simple&mdash;that everybody in America right now can refinance their homes. We could put $3,000 a year into the pockets of every single American just by passing a law in Congress that, by the way, Mitt Romney's key economic adviser, chief economic adviser says was a good idea. For some reason, we still can't get it through the Congress&mdash;3,000 bucks. It's like free money for families who right now are struggling. Think about what they could do with it and what that will do in terms of boosting our growth. I need some help. <p>And my hope is, is that we're going to see more and more Republicans who say, you know what, I didn't come here just to fight the President or demonize Nancy Pelosi, I came here to get some stuff done. And they will be greeted with great enthusiasm by me and, I think, by Nancy if we could get some more stuff done right now. But realistically, I could get a whole lot more done if Nancy Pelosi is Speaker of the House. <p>So let me just close by saying this. And I know that Nancy's people will have a chance to answer some more specific questions about their game plan, all the great candidates they've recruited, the significant financial burden that will have to be bent in order to help elect these candidates. <p>But let me close by saying this, go back to where I started this notion of citizenship. People ask me, does it feel different now in your second term than it did in your first? It does. Look, I would hope, I'm better at my job now than I was when I first came in. I've got some nicks, bruises to prove that I've been to this rodeo before. Hopefully, I'm making better decisions, and our team is better organized, and we know what works and what doesn't, what some of the pitfalls are. <p>But the main difference really is a sense of perspective and realization that nothing worthwhile happens in 6 months or a year. It happens over decades. It happens over generations, that the story of America has been us steadily, through fits and starts, expanding opportunity, creating a more perfect Union, seizing the promise of the future, fighting off some of our own worst impulses. And that any one of us, our job is not to do it by ourselves or get it all done in one year or one term or even necessarily in our lifetimes, but our job is to make sure that we're pressing and pushing so that the whole country, over time, is moving in the right direction. <p>We did a screening of the Jackie&mdash;there's a new movie about Jackie Robinson called \\"42,\\" which I usually don't plug movies, but I strongly recommend people take their kids and their grandkids to see this. A lot of people don't necessarily remember the story of Jackie Robinson, or if they, it's sort of vague. His widow, Rachel Robinson was there. She's 90 years old and gorgeous. And in the theater at the White House, I thanked her. I thanked the people who made the film, just for reminding me in very visceral terms that in her lifetime, she saw her husband being the first African American to play in Major League Baseball, and now she's sitting there with me in the White House. That's a long time, 70 years. On the other hand, that's a blink of an eye in terms of human history. And that required Branch Rickey, it required Jackie Robinson, and then it required&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> Chandler. The commissioner, Happy Chandler. <p><i>The President. &mdash;</i>&mdash;and it just&mdash;it required a succession of people making tough choices, but the right choice. And then slowly, things changed. A culture transformed itself. <p>I was just in another house here in&mdash;very close by. A wonderful young woman, singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile was performing. And she was with her wife. Just got married, I guess, the day that I announced that I supported same-sex marriage. And she's a young woman, and I'm assuming she's thinking about all the people who were fighting the good fight not just in Stonewall, but well before that. <p>And so, generation after generation, we just plug away, and sometimes, we make progress, and sometimes, it feels like we're not making progress. We just stay at it and stay at it. And then suddenly, there's a breakthrough, and the entire culture shifts. <p>And that's what citizenship means. That's why it's so important, because it's not going to happen all at once. And all of us have to carry the burden of moving things forward. <p>So I hope that when you hear from Nancy and Steve, I hope that all of you understand this is not just a one-off, this is not just checking this off the list. You've got to stay with them. And it'll be frustrating, it'll be slow, and there will be times where you lose hope, and there will be times where you won't be mad at Nancy, but there will certainly be times where you're mad at me. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But if you stay with it, if you and your neighbors and your friends and your children and your grandchildren, if they maintain that sense that this is our government, not somebody else's and we can change it, then I've got great optimism for the future of this country and for the future of citizens in America. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"63" "\"Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Well, first of all, I want to thank Tom and Kat for opening up this spectacular home. They were bragging about the view&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but Secret Service wasn't going to let me look at the view. But I'm now in my second term, so I can&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;so I called an audible, and I went out there, and it is spectacular. And they were all apologetic. They said, well, you can't see the bridge. [<i>Laughter</i>] I said, it's okay, I can see the Pacific Ocean; that's pretty good. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I was perfectly satisfied with the view, and I could not be more grateful and thankful to them for hosting us here tonight. So give them a big round of applause. <p>I want to thank Brandi Carlile for singing the&mdash;there she is. Now, I just&mdash;the reason I know Brandi is because the White House Photographer, Pete Souza, was a fan of Brandi's before the rest of the world knew Brandi and followed her around everywhere. He didn't stalk her, he was just&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;he was a fan. And so Pete Souza gets credit, before Jimmy Fallon or anybody else, for Brandi Carlile being discovered, at least by me. [<i>Laughter</i>] But we're so grateful for her participating here tonight. <p>The main reason we're here is actually not me. The main reason we're here is because we have got a fearless leader who happens to be your neighbor, who day in, day out is fighting the good fight on every single issue that matters in terms of making this a more equitable, more prosperous, more generous, more competitive nation. And she has been an extraordinary friend of mine, but more importantly, she's a friend to working families all across the country each and every day. I could not be prouder of her, and I expect that she is going to be once again the Speaker of the House&mdash;Nancy Pelosi. Love Nancy. <p>And Nancy wouldn't be&mdash;I think would be the first to say that she could not do what she does if it weren't for her extraordinary Members. Right now her chief rebounder, assist person, handyman&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;the guy who is making this enormous effort work is Steve Israel. So we want to thank Congressman Steve Israel. And we've got three other Members here today. Mike Honda&mdash;where's Mike? There he is in the back. Jared Huffman. Jared is right there. And Eric Swalwell. There he is. <p>All right, now, first of all, Tom used that analogy, I think, 2 days after I went two for twenty at&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;at the Easter egg roll, guarded by a number of 6-year-olds. [<i>Laughter</i>] So clearly, I have not been playing enough basketball for anybody to want to use that analogy. But what I think is absolutely true is that the way I have always thought about politics, I know the way Nancy thinks about politics, is that we are a team. And when I say we, I'm not simply referring to the people in Washington. <p>If you noticed, during my Inauguration Address and my State of the Union, I talked about citizenship; I talked about what it means to be a citizen. And the notion of citizenship is not simply a matter of voting, it's not simply a matter of writing a check to a candidate who you like. The notion of citizenship is that all of us have obligations to this Nation, to our fellow citizens, and to future generations, and that each and every day, we are tested and asked to participate in ways large and small to push that boulder up the hill a little bit and to make sure that when our time here has passed, we can say, America is stronger, it's more prosperous, and opportunity is available to every single American. <p>That's not just my job, it's not just Nancy's job, it's your job as well. And the fact that all of you are here is an indicator that you take this notion of citizenship seriously. And because you do, Nancy and I, and Steve and others, we've had an opportunity over these last 4 years and a couple of months to make some extraordinary changes in this country. <p>We were able to yank an economy that was on the verge of a depression out of depression. And although we're not all the way back, the economy has stabilized, our financial markets have stabilized, housing is beginning to come back, and families are starting to feel a little more hopeful about their prospects for the future. <p>Because of you, because of our team, we have been able to assure that people who already have health insurance have better health insurance: that they've got preventive care; they've got contraceptive care; that insurance companies can't drop them for no good reason; that young people can stay on their parent's plan until they're 26. And by next year, we'll know that 35 million people, most of whom work, are never again going to have to say to themselves that because of a preexisting condition or simply a lack of money, that they end up bankrupt or end up in an emergency room when they or their family members get sick. That happened because of all of you. <p>Because of you, we were able to make sure that serving your country didn't depend on who you loved, and as a consequence of some of those changes, we're now starting to see a extraordinary transformation in our culture that assures that the LGBT community has full and equal citizenship in this country. That happened because of you. <p>Because of you, roads have been built that needed repair, and people were put back to work. Because of you, research has happened that is looking to cure everything from Alzheimer's to Parkinson's to juvenile diabetes. Because of you, we're actually seeing genuine improvement in our schools, and States all across the country&mdash;including very red States&mdash;have embarked on a reform agenda that makes certain that our kids can compete in this new global economy. <p>Because of you, millions of young people have health insurance&mdash;they have health insurance, but are also able to afford college and couldn't afford it before. And because of you, despite a very aggressive agenda on the other side to block action, we've been able to double fuel efficiency standards on cars. We've been able to take mercury out of our air. We have been able to reduce carbon emissions in this country and have made not only this a healthier place to live, but have also begun to address in a serious way one of the biggest challenges of our time, and that is the challenge of climate change. That all happened because of you. <p>But here is the thing: We've got a lot more work to do. That's why I ran for a second term. The plane is nice&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but the truth is, is that being in the bubble drives me crazy. So if I didn't think I was actually going to get something done, I wouldn't have run. <p>Nancy has gorgeous grandchildren. And if it weren't for the fact that we have more work to do, I'm sure that she wouldn't be going after the Speakership again. The reason we do so, and the reason you're here, is because we know we can do so much more to make this country what it can be. <p>Now, over the next couple of months, we've got a couple of issues: gun control. I just came from Denver, where the issue of gun violence is something that has haunted families for way too long, and it is possible for us to create commonsense gun safety measures that respect the traditions of gun ownership in this country and hunters and sportsmen, but also make sure that we don't have another 20 children in a classroom gunned down by a semiautomatic weapon, by a fully automatic weapon in that case, sadly. <p>Immigration reform is something that I believe that we can get done over the next couple of months. It's interesting how clarifying to the mind Democrats getting 70 percent of the Latino vote was in suggesting that maybe we needed to get&mdash;finally fix a broken immigration system and making sure that we're both a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. <p>But even if we're able to get those two things done&mdash;and I'm hopeful that we do over the next couple of months&mdash;we're going to have some big challenges. We still have to rebuild this country. We've got about $2 trillion worth of deferred maintenance. We could be putting back to work Americans all across this country not just rebuilding roads and bridges, but building state-of-the-art schools and a smart grid that would make sure that we're wasting less energy and link cities that are using energy with wind farms in the Dakotas and in the plains of Colorado. <p>We've got still more work to do to make college more affordable. We're going to have a lot more work to do to make sure that hard work pays off, which is why passing a minimum wage increase is so important, because there are a lot of families out there, even who have jobs, who are having a tough time each and every day. <p>And something that I know is near and dear to Tom and Kat's hearts and to Nancy's, we've got more work to do in terms of dealing with climate change and making sure that we've got an economy that is energy efficient, that is productive, that is cutting edge, and thinks about not just the energy sources of the past, but also the energy promise of the future. <p>And the thing that I'm going to have to try to work to persuade the American people a little more convincingly on is this notion that there's a contradiction between our economy and our environment is just a false choice, that if we invest now, we will create jobs, we will create entire new industries. Other countries will be looking to catch up; they will be looking to import what we do. We will set the standard, and everybody else will have to adapt. <p>But&mdash;and I mentioned this to Tom and Kat and a few folks right before I came out here&mdash;the politics of this are tough. Because if you haven't seen a raise in a decade; if your house is still $25,000, $30,000 underwater; if you're just happy that you've still got that factor job that is powered by cheap energy; if every time you go to fill up your old car because you can't afford to buy a new one and you certainly can't afford to buy a Prius, you're spending 40 bucks that you don't have, which means that you may not be able to save for retirement&mdash;you may be concerned about the temperature of the planet, but it's probably not rising to your number-one concern. And if people think, well, that's shortsighted, that's what happens when you're struggling to get by. You're thinking about what's right in front of you, which is how do I fill up my gas tank and how do I feed my family. <p>And so part of what we're going to have to do is to marry a genuine, passionate concern about middle class families and everybody who is trying to get into the middle class to show them that we're working just as hard for them as we are for our environmental agenda, and that we can bridge these things in a way that advances the causes of both. And that's going to take some work. <p>But the most important thing that it's going to take is people in Washington who are willing to speak truth to power, are willing to take some risks politically, are willing to get a little bit out ahead of the curve&mdash;not two miles ahead of the curve, but just a little bit ahead of it. And that's why your presence here is so important. <p>Look, my intention here is to try to get as much done with the Republican Party over the next 2 years as I can, because we can't have perpetual campaigns. And so I mean what I say: I am looking to find areas of common ground with Republicans every single day. I want to make sure that we're working together to stabilize our finances. And I think actually that we can come up with a fiscal deal that instead of lurching from crisis to crisis every 3 months, we lay the groundwork for long-term growth, controlling our deficits, controlling our debt, but also making sure we can invest in our future. I want to get an immigration deal done. I want to find some commonsense gun safety legislation that we can get done. And I do believe that there are well-meaning Republicans out there who care about their kids just as passionately as we do. <p>Despite all the rhetoric on television, I actually believe that Americans have a lot more in common than our political rhetoric would give us credit for. But having said all that, I know Nancy Pelosi. I've seen her courage. I know that she is willing to do the right thing, even when it's not politically popular. And I want her once again as a fully empowered partner for us to be able to move our agenda forward. <p>And so I'm going to expect that you guys are fighting for issues, helping to move public opinion, engaging in organizing and engaging in advocacy and public policy work, all the stuff that&mdash;and I'm looking around this room, it's full of do-gooders here&mdash;all the stuff you do. But I also want to make sure that you are paying attention to what can we do to support the prospect of Nancy Pelosi being Speaker once again. <p>If we do that, then I'm confident that not only can we deliver on this profound issue of climate change, not only can we make sure that clean energy is the norm here in America, but I also think that we can give America that sense of confidence and forward movement that's always been our hallmark that characterizes who we are. To do that, I'm going to need you, and Nancy is going to need you. <p>And so I hope that this is not the end of your involvement. I hope it is the beginning. If, in fact, all the energy that's represented in this room is fully deployed, then I feel pretty good about Malia and Sasha, I feel pretty good about these young people right here. They're smarter than we are. If we hand off the kind of America that we should be handing off to them, I promise you they will take it to ever greater heights. <p>All right, thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"64" "\"Everybody, please have a seat. Thank you. Well, it is wonderful to be back in Colorado. It is wonderful to be back in Denver. I want to thank Chief White for that introduction. You've got some outstanding elected officials who are here today, and I want to acknowledge them. First of all, a wonderful Governor, John Hickenlooper is here. He's here somewhere. I know, because I just talked to him. [<i>Laughter</i>] There he is. Next to him, an outstanding Lieutenant Governor, Joe Garcia. One of the finest young Senators in the country, Michael Bennet is here. Terrific Members of the House of Representatives: Ed Perlmutter and Diana DeGette. And your own mayor, Michael Hancock, is here. <p>I want to say thank you to the Denver Police for having me here, more importantly, for the outstanding work that all of you do each and every day to serve your communities and protect your citizens. <p>Before I came out here, I had a chance to sit down with some local law enforcement, Attorney General Holder, and some of the leaders I just mentioned, the wonderful mayor of Aurora who's here, and sportsmen, parents, loved ones of the victims of the shootings in Columbine and Aurora. And we talked about what we can do to protect more of our citizens from gun violence. <p>And from the beginning of this effort, we've wanted law enforcement front and center in shaping this discussion and the reforms that emerge from it, because law enforcement lives this every day. Law enforcement are the first to see the terrible consequences of any kind of violence, certainly gun violence: lives lost, families broken, communities that are changed forever. They're very often in the line of fire. The law enforcement knows what works and what doesn't, and so we wanted that experience and that advice. <p>And it was also important for us to hear from mayors like Steve Hogan, because he's been on the frontlines having to deal with these issues, under incredibly sad circumstances. And I've come to Denver today in particular because Colorado is proving a model of what's possible. <p>It's now been just over 100 days since the murder of 20 innocent children and 6 brave educators in Newtown, Connecticut, an event that shocked this country and, I think, galvanized parents all across the country to say, we've got to do something more to protect our kids. But consider this: Over those 100 days or so, more than 100 times as many Americans have fallen victim to gun violence. More than 2,000 of our fellow citizens, struck down, often because they were just going about their daily round. They weren't doing anything special. Just doing what folks do every day: shopping, going to school. Every day that we wait to do something about it, even more of our fellow citizens are stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun. <p>Now, the good news is, Colorado has already chosen to do something about it. Look, this is a State that has suffered the tragedy of two of the worst mass shootings in our history: 14 years ago this month in Columbine and just last year in Aurora. But this is also a State that treasures its Second Amendment rights, the State of proud hunters and sportsmen. And by the way, the Governor wanted me to remind everybody that there is outstanding elk hunting here in Colorado. [<i>Laughter</i>] There's a strong tradition of gun ownership that's handed down from generation to generation, and it's part of the fabric of people's lives. And they treat gun ownership with reverence and respect. <p>And so I'm here because I believe there doesn't have to be a conflict in reconciling these realities. There doesn't have to be a conflict between protecting our citizens and protecting our Second Amendment rights. I've got stacks of letters in my office from proud gun owners, whether they're for sport or protection or collection, who tell me how deeply they cherish their rights, don't want them infringed upon, but they still want us to do something to stop the epidemic of gun violence. And I appreciate every one of those letters. And I've learned from them. <p>And I think that Colorado has shown that practical progress is possible thanks to the leadership of wonderful Governor Hickenlooper and some of the State legislators who are here today. When I was talking to Steve, he mentioned that Aurora is very much a purple city. It's got a majority Republican city council; a majority of the State legislators are Democrat. But they came together understanding that out of this tragedy, there had to be something that made sense. And so we've seen enacted tougher background checks that won't infringe on the rights of responsible gun owners, but will help keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. <p>Now, in January, just a few weeks after Newtown, I put forward a series of commonsense proposals along the same lines as what's passed here in Colorado to reduce gun violence and keep our kids safe. In my State of the Union Address, I urged Congress to give these proposals a vote. And by the way, before we even asked for a vote, I had already signed numerous Executive orders doing what we could administratively to make sure that guns don't fall into the hands of the wrong people. <p>But what I said then is still true: If we're really going to tackle this problem seriously, then we've got to get Congress to take the next step. And as soon as next week, they will be voting. As soon as next week, every Senator will get to vote on whether or not we should require background checks for anyone who wants to purchase a gun. <p>Now, some say, well, we already have background checks. And they're right. Over the past 20 years, those background checks have kept more than 2 million dangerous people from buying a gun. But the loopholes that currently exist in the law have allowed way too many criminals and folks who shouldn't be getting guns, it's allowed them to avoid background checks entirely. That makes it harder for law enforcement to do its job. It's not safe. It's not smart. And by the way, it's not fair to responsible gun owners who are playing by the rules. <p>Now, understand, nobody is talking about creating an entirely new system. We are simply talking about plugging holes, sealing a porous system that isn't working as well as it should. If you want to buy a gun, whether it's from a licensed dealer or a private seller, you should at least have to pass a background check to show you're not a criminal or someone legally prohibited from buying one. And that's just common sense. <p>During our roundtable discussion, Governor Hickenlooper, I know, was in the midst of this passionate debate about the legislation here in Colorado, and some people said, well, background checks aren't going to stop everybody. And the Governor was the first one to acknowledge, yes, they won't stop everybody, but as he pointed out, statistically, there are a whole bunch of folks who have been stopped. <p>As a consequence of background checks, law enforcement has been able to stop people who had been convicted of murder from getting a gun, people who are under restraining orders for having committed violent domestic abuse from getting a gun. In a couple of cases&mdash;the Governor mentioned to me&mdash;law enforcement has actually been able to arrest people who came to pick up their gun&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;because they were criminals, wanted. <p>So this does work. And by the way, if you're selling a gun, wouldn't you want to know who you're selling it to? Wouldn't you want to know? Wouldn't you want in your conscience to know that the person you're selling to isn't going to commit a crime? <p>So these enhanced background checks won't stop all gun crimes, but they will certainly help prevent some. This is common sense. And by the way, most gun owners&mdash;more than 80 percent&mdash;agree this makes sense. More than 70 percent of NRA members agree. Ninety percent of the American people agree. So there's no reason we can't do this unless politics is getting in the way. There's no reason we can't do this. <p>As soon as next week, every Senator will get a chance to vote on a proposal to help strengthen school safety and help people struggling with mental health problems get the treatment that they need. <p>As soon as next week, every Senator will get to vote on whether or not we should crack down on folks who buy guns as part of a scheme to arm criminals. That would keep more guns off the streets and out of the hands of people who are intent on doing harm. And it would make life a whole lot easier and safer for the people behind me, police officers. <p>Every Senator will get a say on whether or not we should keep weapons of war and high-capacity ammunition magazines that facilitate mass killings off our streets. The type of assault rifle used in Aurora, for example, when paired with a high-capacity magazine, has one purpose: to pump out as many bullets as possible, as fast as possible. It's what allowed that gunman to shoot 70 people and kill 12 in a matter of a few minutes. I don't believe that weapons designed for theaters of war have a place in movie theaters. Most Americans agree with that. <p>Most of these ideas are not controversial. Right now 90 percent of Americans&mdash;90 percent&mdash;support background checks that will keep criminals and people who have been found to be a danger to themselves or others from buying a gun. More than 80 percent of Republicans agree. Most gun owners agree. Think about it: How often do 90 percent of Americans agree on anything? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And yet there are already some Senators back in Washington floating the idea that they might use obscure procedural stunts to prevent or delay any of these votes on reform. Think about that. They're not just saying they'll vote no on the proposal that most Americans support. They're saying they'll do everything they can to avoid even allowing a vote on a proposal that the overwhelming majority of the American people support. They're saying your opinion doesn't matter. <p>Now, we knew from the beginning that change wouldn't be easy. And we knew that there would be powerful voices that would do everything they could to run out the clock, change the subject, ignore the majority of the American people. We knew they'd try to make any progress collapse under the weight of fear and frustration, or maybe people would just stop paying attention. <p>The only way this time will be different is if the American people demand that this time it must be different, that this time we must do something to protect our communities and our kids. We need parents, we need teachers, we need police officers, we need pastors, we need hunters and sportsmen&mdash;Americans of every background&mdash;to say, we've suffered too much pain and care too much about our children to allow this continue. We're not going to just wait for the next Newtown or the next Aurora before we act. And I genuinely believe that's what the overwhelming majority of Americans&mdash;I don't care what party they belong to&mdash;that's what they want. They just want to see some progress. <p>It was interesting, during the conversation, a number of people had talked about the trust issue. Part of the reason it's so hard to get this done is because both sides of the debate sometimes don't listen to each other. The people who take absolute positions on these issues, on both sides, sometimes aren't willing to concede even an inch of ground. <p>And so one of the questions we talked about was, how do you build trust? How do you rebuild some trust? And I told the story about two conversations I had. The first conversation was when Michelle came back from doing some campaigning out in rural Iowa. And we were sitting at dinner, and she had been to a big county, a lot of driving out there, a lot of farmland. And she said, you know, if I was living out in a farm in Iowa, I'd probably want a gun too. If somebody just drives up into your driveway, and you're not home, you don't know who these people are, and you don't know how long it's going to take for the sheriffs to respond. I can see why you'd want some guns for protection. That's one conversation. <p>I had another conversation just a couple of months ago with a mom from Chicago&mdash;actually, Evanston, Illinois&mdash;whose son had been killed in a random shooting. And she said, you know, I hate it when people tell me that my son was shot because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He was in the right place. He was on his way to school. He wasn't in the wrong place. He was exactly where he was supposed to be. <p>Now, both those things are true. And sometimes, we're so divided between rural and urban, and folks whose hunting is part of their lives and folks whose only experience with guns is street crime. And the two sides just talk past one another. And more than anything, what I want to just emphasize is, there are good people on both sides of this thing, but we have to be able to put ourselves in the other person's shoes. If you're a hunter, if you're a sportsman, if you have a gun in your house for protection, you've got to understand what it feels like for that mom whose son was randomly shot. <p>And if you live in an urban area and you're worried about street crime, you've got to understand what it might be like if you grew out on a ranch and your dad had been taking you hunting all your life. And we had a couple of sportsmen in our conversation today, and I thought one of them said something very important. He said, all my experiences with guns have been positive, but I realize that for others, all their experiences about guns have been negative. Well, that's a start, right? If we start listening to each other, then we should be able to get something done that's constructive. We should be able to get that done. <p>Now, one last thing I'm going to mention is that during this conversation&mdash;I hope you don't mind me quoting you, Joe&mdash;Joe Garcia, I thought, also made an important point, and that is that the opponents of some of these &mdash;commonsense laws have ginned up fears among responsible gun owners that have nothing to do with what's being proposed, nothing to do with the facts, but feeds into this suspicion about government. <p>You hear some of these quotes: I need a gun to protect myself from the government. We can't do background checks because the government is going to come take my guns away. <p>Well, the government is us. These officials are elected by you. They are elected by you. I am elected by you. I am constrained, as they are constrained, by a system that our Founders put in place. It's a government of and by and for the people. <p>And so, surely, we can have a debate that's not based on the notion somehow that your elected representatives are trying to do something to you other than potentially prevent another group of families from grieving the way the families of Aurora or Newtown or Columbine have grieved. So we've got to get past some of the rhetoric that gets perpetuated that breaks down trust and is so over the top that it just shuts down all discussion. And it's important for all of us when we hear that kind of talk to say, hold on a second. If there are any folks who are out there right now who are gun owners, and you've been hearing that somehow somebody is taking away your guns, get the facts. &mdash;We're not proposing a gun registration system, we're proposing background checks for criminals. <p>Don't just listen to what some advocates or folks who have an interest in this thing are saying. Look at the actual legislation. That's what happened here in Colorado. And hopefully, if we know the facts and we're listening to each other, then we can actually move forward. <p>And that's what Members of Congress need to hear from you. Right now Members of Congress are home in their districts. Many of them are holding events where they can hear from their constituents. So I'm asking anyone out there who is listening today, find out where your Member of Congress stands on these issues. If they're not part of the 90 percent of Americans who agree on background checks, then ask them why not. Why wouldn't you want to make it more difficult for a dangerous criminal to get his or her hands on a gun? Why wouldn't you want to close the loophole that allows too many criminals to buy a gun without even the simplest of background checks? Why on Earth wouldn't you want to make it easier rather than harder for law enforcement to do their job? <p>I know that some of the officers here today know what it's like to look into the eyes of a parent or a grandparent, a brother or a sister, or a spouse who has just lost a loved one to an act of violence. Some of those families, by the way, are here today. And as police officers, you know as well as anybody, there is no magic solution to prevent every bad thing from happening in the world. You still suit up, you put on your badge, put yourself at risk every single day. Every single day, you go to work, and you try to do the best you can to protect the people you're sworn to protect and serve. Well, how can the rest of us as citizens do anything less? <p>If there is just one step we can take to prevent more Americans from knowing the pain that some of the families who are here have known, don't we have an obligation to try? Don't we have an obligation to try? If these reforms keep one person from murdering dozens of innocent children or worshippers or moviegoers in a span of minutes, isn't it worth fighting for? I believe it is. That's why I'm going to keep on working. I'm going to keep on giving it my best efforts. But I'm going to need your help. <p>This is not easy. And I'll be blunt: A lot of Members of Congress, this is tough for them. Because those who are opposed to any form of legislation affecting guns, they're very well organized; they're very well financed. But it can be done if enough voices are heard. <p>So I want to thank all the police officers who are here for giving their best efforts every single day. I want to thank Governor Hickenlooper for his outstanding leadership. I want to thank all the families who are here for your courage in being willing to take out of this tragedy something positive. I want to thank the people of Colorado for coming together in sensible ways. Let's see if we can get the whole country to do so. <p>Thank you, Denver. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\" "
"65" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! It is good to be back in California. <p><i>Audience members.</i> It's good to have you! [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. Somebody said&mdash;somebody told me, they were in the photo line, they said, we're glad you could join our State. [<i>Laughter</i>] They made it sound like a health club or something. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I appreciate that you allowed me to join&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;because it is obviously a spectacular place, and we've got so many good friends here, and some of you I see out there worked tirelessly dating back to when people could not pronounce my name. [<i>Laughter</i>] And so I'm grateful to all of you. <p>First of all, though, I want to give a special acknowledgement to John and Marcia for the incredible job they've done and their great hospitality. Thank you so much. And I must say that if you had a cute baby competition, their granddaughter would have to be an entry. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I got to say, I might have to pick her, because she is adorable and did not drool on my suit when I grabbed her. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I'm grateful. I'm grateful to her for that. <p>We've got some elected officials who are doing incredible work, great friends. First of all, somebody who works tirelessly on behalf of California every day, but also works on behalf of working people and makes sure that we've got a more inclusive America, a good friend of mine, somebody who you guys should be very proud of, Congressman Mike Honda is here. Where is Mike? He is around here somewhere. There he is. Yes, I mean, he's not like a real tall guy, but he's a great guy. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Second of all, you have to be careful to, first of all, say she is brilliant and she is dedicated and she is tough, and she is exactly what you'd want in anybody who is administering the law, and making sure that everybody is getting a fair shake. She also happens to be by far the best looking attorney general in the country; Kamala Harris is here. It's true. Come on. [<i>Laughter</i>] And she is a great friend and has just been a great supporter for many, many years. <p>And finally, somebody who is not yet probably as well known on the national scene, but is certainly well known in all of us who worked on my campaign this last time out. He did incredible work, could not have been more effective, and has now taken on what can sometimes be a thankless job of being the DNC finance chair, Henry Mu&ntilde;oz is here. Can everybody please give Henry Mu&ntilde;oz a big round of applause. <p>So my election is over and you thought you wouldn't have to see me again at these fundraisers. [<i>Laughter</i>] And a close friend of mine, Abner Mikva, who was White House Counsel&mdash;he was a longtime Congressman from the Chicago area&mdash;he used to say that being friends with a politician is like perpetually having a child in college. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's like every few months you have to write this check, and you're thinking when is it going to be over. With elected officials, it's never over. <p>But the reason I'm here is not for me. The reason I'm here is because the country still needs you. We have, as John indicated, done some work that I'm very, very proud of over the last 4 years. We took an economy that was about to go into a great depression, and we were able to yank it out and put us back on a path towards growth and putting people back to work. We were able to make sure that in the process we rebuilt roads and bridges and a smarter infrastructure all across the country and invested in clean energy and made sure that schools got the kinds of Internet connections that they needed and invested in basic science and research&mdash;all of which will pay dividends for years and years to come. <p>We said that in a country as wealthy as ours, nobody should go bankrupt just because they got sick. And already, millions of people are benefiting from the Affordable Care Act. And by next year, we will know that millions of people all across the country who previously did not have health insurance will have it, including folks with preexisting conditions, which will make everybody a little bit more secure. <p>We expanded access to college by expanding our student loan programs. We are in the process of reforming our schools to make sure that every child gets a fair shot in life. We ended \\"don't ask, don't tell,\\" laying the groundwork to make sure that this was a country where you were treated fairly and equally no matter who you love. <p>We expanded national service. We doubled fuel efficiency on cars. We doubled the production of wind and solar energy. We made sure that the Violence Against Women Act was resigned and that it provided even greater protection for women all across this country. We ended one war, as promised. We're in the process of ending another, and at the same time have been able to keep the American people safe. <p>And so I'm very proud of the work that we've done. But we've got a lot more work to do. We all know that. This country is the greatest nation on Earth, but it can be even greater. And my main message here today is that America's greatness will not result simply from who you elect to office, it's going to depend on you, as citizens, and how badly you want it. <p>During the State of the Union speech, as well as my Inauguration speech, I talked about citizenship. And this is a word that I spend a lot of time thinking about these days, partly because my background, my orientation, I came into politics believing that politics works best when people are involved. I've never believed that more than I do now, in my second term as President, that the idea of citizenship is not just that you vote, it's not just that you write a check where you can to support a candidate. It's this notion, fundamental to who we are, that we have responsibilities to ourselves and our families, but we also have obligations to our neighborhood, our community, our cities, our States, and ultimately, the Nation and the next generation. <p>And the only way that this country moves forward is when we, the people, collectively, make it our business to meet the challenges of our time. And we know what those challenges are. And we know we've got to do better. <p>Now, in the next couple of months, we've got the opportunity to make some very significant changes. Number one, I believe that we can get comprehensive immigration reform passed and that is going to mean that America can continue to be a nation of laws, but also a nation of immigrants, and attract the best and the brightest from all around the world. And if we push hard and we stay focused, we've got the opportunity to get this done over the next couple of months. <p>I believe that we have a chance to, after 30 years, frankly, of doing almost nothing, to reduce gun violence in our society. And it's going to be hard, it's going to be tough, but I think we've got a chance to get some stuff done on that. <p>Now, one of the things that I want to be very clear on is that this year, next year, and for the next 4 years that I'm in office, I am always going to be seeking, wherever I can, bipartisan solutions. And I intend to continue to reach out to Republicans because I genuinely believe that the politics that you see in Washington isn't representative of America; that most people actually have common sense, and most folks think cooperation and occasional compromise is part of life. And I also think that we have to govern, not simply politick. <p>And so, whether it's on immigration reform or the budget or any of these issues, I will continue to do everything I can to reach out to my friends on the other side of the aisle. And look, I believe that they love their kids and this country just as much as we do, and although we may have some very fundamental disagreements about how to get there, I don't think we've got a disagreement about what we need to be as a nation. <p>Having said that, though, there are still some really big arguments that we're having in Washington, and I believe that Democrats represent those values that will best advance the interests of middle class families and everybody who is willing to work hard to get into the middle class; that will grow this economy in a broad-based way, and that will lay the foundation for prosperity for generations to come. <p>And you believe that too. That's why you're here. In order for us to do that, you're going to have to stay involved. Think about some of the things I spoke about during the State of the Union Address: making sure that every child in America has outstanding, high quality, early childhood education. We know that there's nothing more important to a child's success than those early years. And if we do that right, not only are we going to see better performance in our schools, we're going to see better performance in our economy. And we can do it. We can afford to do it. <p>But in order for us to make that happen, we're going to have to have an active, motivated, Democratic national party. People here in this area care deeply about issues of energy and climate change. And I think that the science is indisputable, and this is an obligation we owe to future generations. And as I said, we've already done a lot to reduce our carbon footprint and to make our economy more energy efficient. But if we're going to do more, then we've got to make sure that we're active and involved and helping to educate our friends and our neighbors and our coworkers about why this is important and why there's no contradiction between a sound environment and strong economic growth; that, in fact, if we do this right, the energy sources of the future, the clean energy sources of the future can be an engine for economic growth for decades and decades to come. <p>When it comes to our economy, making sure that we're investing in basic research and science. This is the epicenter of innovation in this nation. Some of you saw, a couple of days ago, I announced a new BRAIN Initiative that will allow us to crack the code and map what this incredible gray matter between our ears, one of the greatest mysteries there is, what's causing things like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and to not just provide cures but also to help generate entire new industries that can put people to work in this region and around the country. <p>In order for us to make sure that we're investing sufficiently in basic science and research, you're going to have to be involved. You have to push. You can't just wait for it to happen, because there are going to be competing interests and folks who want to spend those resources in a different way. <p>When it comes to our budget, I actually think that we can stabilize our finances, reduce our debt, reduce our deficit in a prudent, balanced way. But we've got the other side insisting that somehow we can cut our way to prosperity. I disagree with that. I will take that case to the American people. But for me to be successful in resolving that argument in a way that allows us to keep growing and keep investing, I'm going to need your help. <p>Making sure that we're providing ladders of opportunity in communities all across the country that have been left behind&mdash;and in some cases, have been behind for decades&mdash;so that we're not just investing in education, but also making sure that we're providing transportation assistance and tax credits so that impoverished communities can be part of this global economy. That will make us all stronger. I can't do that unless I have your help. <p>And for us to continue to make progress so that this is a society that is more just and more equal and more inclusive, we've made remarkable progress over these last few years, but that's not because of what started in Washington, it's because of what happened in communities all across the country. <p>I was mentioning to people I had a chance to see an early screening of this new movie called \\"42\\"; it's about Jackie Robinson. And I look around the room&mdash;young people&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;kind of vaguely know, yes, Jackie Robinson&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;first African American baseball player. His widow was there, Rachel Robinson, who's gorgeous and 90, but looks better than I do&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and could not be more gracious. <p>And to sit there in a movie theater watching what happened in her lifetime and to know that because of the decisions and courage of Jackie Robison and Branch Rickey and all the other path-breakers, that we now have a country that is fairer and better, for it is a reminder of how change happens in this country. It doesn't happen all at once. It doesn't happen in one fell swoop. It doesn't happen because a President gives a speech. It happens because a whole bunch of people out there, day in and day out, are making choices and decisions about whether we're going to be fair or less fair, whether we're going to be generous or less generous, whether we are going to be inclusive or less inclusive. And that changing of our hearts and our minds ultimately translates itself into politics, but it begins with citizens. It begins with you. <p>And if the Democratic Party stands for anything, then it has to stand for that basic proposition that not only do we want an economy where if you work hard, you can make it if you try&mdash;no matter where you come from, what you look like, who you love&mdash;but also that the way to get there is by giving everybody a voice and making sure everybody is involved and everybody is included. If we stand for anything as Democrats, that's got to be what we stand for. <p>And so the DNC is an important part of that overall process. And the fact that you are here, the fact that John and Marcia were willing to open up their home like this gives me confidence that, in fact, we will be able to sustain these efforts. And it has to be sustained beyond elections. You can't just wait until a Presidential election to do this. It's all those days in between that are going to determine whether or not we bring about the changes that we so desperately believe in. <p>So to all of you, I want to say thank you. But understand this is just a beginning, it's not an end. You are going to be called on to do more work. You are going to be called on to get more engaged and more involved. And if you ever have any doubts as to why you're doing it, then you have to look at John and Marcia's grandbaby or that young man who's falling asleep because I've been talking too long. [<i>Laughter</i>] And you will remember that ultimately, the only thing that matters is whether or not we're leaving behind a country that's a little bit better than the one we founded for them. That's why we do what we do. That's why I do what I do, for Malia and Sasha, and all the Malias and Sashas out there, I want to make sure we're doing right by them. <p>All right, thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.\" "
"66" "\"Thank you so much. Well, it is wonderful to see all of you. This is an intimate group. What I want to do is mostly have a conversation. But first of all, obviously, I want to thank Liz and Mark for their incredible hospitality. We couldn't be more appreciative. And I want to thank all of you for being here today. <p>A lot of you&mdash;in fact, almost everybody here I've known&mdash;have supported me. Some of you were involved in my first campaign when nobody could pronounce my name. [<i>Laughter</i>] And you stuck with me through thick and thin, and I just want to say how much I appreciate all of you for taking the time. <p>Some people have been asking me, \\"Well, what's different about the second term?\\" And I say, well, for one thing, I'm not raising money for myself, and that's good. [<i>Laughter</i>] For another thing, the girls are getting old enough now where they don't want to spend time with us on the weekends. [<i>Laughter</i>] They have sleepovers and parties and sports and all that stuff. I don't know if you guys are doing the same thing to your parents, but it's starting to happen. <p>But I think the most important thing is that when you don't have another race to run, all you're really thinking about it is how do I leave a legacy, not simply for the next President, but for the next generation that makes America stronger: that helps assure our children can compete with an ever-changing world; that we are solving what I think is one of the core challenges we face as a generation; and that is making sure that we have a strong, growing middle class and ladders of opportunity for everybody who is willing to work to get into that middle class; that we continue to be innovative; that we address some of our core environmental challenges, particularly climate change, to make sure that the planet we leave behind is one that our children can thrive in. <p>So you end up taking the long view on things. And you also feel a great urgency because you know you don't have a lot of time. And so the main message I want to deliver here today is that I could not be prouder of the track record that we've put together over the last 4 years and 2 months, whether it was saving an economy from a great depression; doubling fuel efficiency standards on cars; expanding access to college for the millions of young people; making sure that nobody in this country has to go bankrupt because they get sick; reupping the law preventing violence against women; making sure that we have the \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" policy, which I think has laid the groundwork for further progress when it comes to LGBT rights. <p>On so many issues, we've made progress. But we've got so much more work to do. And I laid out what that vision might look like during both the Inauguration speech and in the State of the Union. I want to make sure that we've got the best education system in the world and that starts young. And so we've given all the research that we have. Expanding our investment in childhood education can make all the difference in the world and will pay enormous dividends for a very, very long time. <p>I want to make sure that we're rebuilding this country, our infrastructure. We've got $2 trillion in deferred maintenance. We could be putting people back to work right now, and not only improving our current economic growth, but laying the foundation for economic growth for many years to come. Many of you are aware that I am a big proponent of investments in science and research, and obviously, this entire region has thrived precisely because it has been the epicenter of innovation. And that requires us putting money into research in biomedicine, in nanoscience. Our recent initiative around the brain and being able to map that and crack the code potentially not only can help us cure things like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, but can generate entire new industries and put people back to work and be the next great challenge for the American economy. <p>And I believe that we've got to get a handle on our energy policy so that we are growing and we are productive, but we are not simply investing in the energy sources of the past, we're also investing in the energy sources of the future. We've doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars, but we've also had a chance to double our production in solar and wind and biofuels. We can continue to make progress on that front. We can continue to make sure that electric cars and other new technologies for transportation are built here in the United States of America and not someplace else. <p>We can make sure that our buildings, our schools, our hospitals are more efficient. If we were able to achieve the same efficiencies that Japan already has achieved using existing technologies, we'd cut our power utilization by 15, 20 percent, which would have enormous ramifications in bringing down our carbon footprint. <p>And we can do all this without spending massive amounts of money. The truth is, is that our fiscal situation has improved significantly since I first came into office, but we still have a long way to go. The way for us to do it intelligently is the kind of balanced approach I've talked about in the past: making sure that everybody is doing their fair share; making sure that those of us in this room and, frankly, in this whole town probably&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;recognizes the incredible blessings that we've been given and make sure that we're willing to invest back in the next generation and also making sure that our money is wisely spent. <p>We still waste money in all kinds of things that don't work, and we have the capacity to shift those dollars into things that do work and that will grow our economy. And we can reduce our deficit, stabilize our debt, and do so without sacrificing the kinds of investments that are going to be required to grow. <p>Now, the last point I'll make is just politics. Our policies, the ones that we prevented&mdash;or the ones that we've presented, traditionally, would be considered pretty bipartisan. There's nothing particularly Democratic about road building or basic science or environmental protection. Teddy Roosevelt started the conservation movement. Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican President, was pretty big on building infrastructure and investing in things like science and research. <p>Unfortunately, we continue to still have some of that gridlock in Washington. Part of it is fed by changes in information and communications that amplify conflict and extremes as opposed to trying to bring people together. I know it's a great source of frustration for the American people. I assure you it's a source of frustration for me as well. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But what I believed when I was running for this office back in 2007, 2008, what I believed when I was running for a second term is what I still believe now, and that is, this country is not as divided as our politics would suggest. And the only way we break through this gridlock is when people's voices are heard and people are engaged and involved. I am very optimistic that we get immigration reform done in the next few months. And the reason I'm optimistic is because people spoke out through the ballot box, and that's breaking gridlock. <p>It's going to be tougher to get better gun legislation to reduce gun violence through the Senate and the House that so many of us, I think, want to see, particularly after the tragedy in Newtown. But I still think it can get done if people are activated and involved. <p>And so on every front, on every issue that all of you care about, making sure that we can provide good information to the American people, engage them, inform them, make sure that they are embracing a form of citizenship that goes beyond just voting, but involves understanding what's at stake and talking to their neighbors, talking to their coworkers, talking to their friends, writing to their Members of Congress, getting organized, getting mobilized&mdash;all that ends up being really the critical ingredient and the constant dynamic change and improvement that has characterized this country for so long. <p>And your involvement with the DNC helps us do that. It will help us register voters. It will help us make sure that they understand what's at stake in all of these issues. It's hugely important. It's not always glamorous. It's not always sexy. But it's really what ends up driving our ability to make policy and to deliver for the young people who are here today. <p>So again, I want to thank Liz and Mark for making this spectacular home available to us. And I want to thank all of you for not only what you've done in the past on my behalf, but more importantly, what you're continuing to do on behalf of this country as a whole. <p>Thank you so much. I appreciate it.\" "
"67" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat. Thank you. <p>Well, good morning, everybody. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Good morning. <p><i>The President.</i> Welcome, once again, to the White House. It is always wonderful to see so many friends from all across the country. I want to thank you for joining us today. I want to thank everybody for their prayers, but most importantly, I want to thank everybody for their good works through your ministries. It's making a difference in communities all across this Nation, and we could not be more proud to often have a chance to work with you. <p>To all the pastors in the house, I hope you've enjoyed some well-deserved rest after a very busy Holy Week. I see some chuckles, so maybe not. [<i>Laughter</i>] Here at the White House, I'm pleased to say that we survived yet another Easter egg roll. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, if you've been to this breakfast before, you know that I always try to avoid preaching in front of people who do it for a living. That's sound advice. So this morning, I'm just going to leave the sermon to others and offer maybe a few remarks as we mark this&mdash;the end of this Easter season. <p>In these sacred days, those of us as Christians remember the tremendous sacrifice Jesus made for each of us, how, in all His humility and His grace, He took on the sins of the world and extended the gift of salvation. And we recommit ourselves to following His example, to loving the Lord our God with all our hearts and all our souls and with all our minds, and to loving our neighbors as ourselves. <p>That's the eternal spirit of Easter. And this year, I had&mdash;I think was particularly special for me because right before Easter, I had a chance to feel that spirit during my trip to the Holy Land. And I think so many of you here know there are few experiences more powerful or more humbling than visiting that sacred earth. <p>It brings Scripture to life. It brings us closer to Christ. It reminds us that our Savior, who suffered and died was resurrected, both fully God and also a man: a human being who lived and walked and felt joy and sorrow just like us. <p>And so for Christians to walk where He walked and see what He saw are blessed moments. And while I had been to Jerusalem before, where Jesus healed the sick and cured the blind and embraced the least of these, I also had a chance to go to the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. And those of you who have been there know that entering the church is a remarkable experience, although it is a useful instruction to see how managing different sections of the church and different clergy&mdash;it feels familiar. [<i>Laughter</i>] Let's just put it that way. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And as I approached the Altar of the Nativity, as I neared the 14-pointed Silver Star that marks the spot where Christ was born, the Patriarch of Jerusalem welcomed me to, in his words, \\"the place where heaven and Earth met.\\" <p>And there, I had a chance to pray and reflect on Christ's birth and His life, His sacrifice, His Resurrection. I thought about all the faithful pilgrims, who for 2,000 years have done the same thing: giving thanks for the fact that, as the Book of Romans tells us, \\"just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.\\" <p>I thought of the poor and the sick who seek comfort and the marginalized and the forsaken who seek solace and the grateful who merely seek to offer thanks for the simple blessings of this life and the awesome glory of the next. I thought of all who would travel to this place for centuries to come and the lives they might know. <p>And I was reminded that while our time on Earth is fleeting, He is eternal. His life, His lessons live on in our hearts and, most importantly, in our actions. When we tend to the sick, when we console those in pain, when we sacrifice for those in need, wherever and whenever we are there to give comfort and to guide and to love, then Christ is with us. <p>So this morning, let us pray that we're worthy of His many blessings, that this Nation is worthy of His many blessings. Let us promise to keep in our hearts, in our souls, in our minds, on this day and on every day, the life and lessons of Christ, our Lord. <p>And with that, I'd like to ask Father Larry Snyder to deliver our opening prayer.\" "
"68" "\"Hi, everybody. Our top priority as a nation and my top priority as President, must be doing everything we can to reignite the engine of America's growth: a rising, thriving middle class. That's our north star. That must drive every decision that we make. <p>Now, yesterday we learned that our businesses created 95,000 new jobs last month. That's about 500,000 new jobs this year and nearly 6.5 million new jobs over the past 3 years. <p>But we've got more to do to get the economy growing faster so that everybody who wants a job can find one. And that means we need fewer self-inflicted wounds from Washington, like the across-the-board spending cuts that are already hurting many communities, cuts that economists predict will cost our economy hundreds of thousands of jobs this year. <p>If we want to keep rebuilding this economy on a stronger, sturdier foundation for growth&mdash;growth that creates good, middle class jobs&mdash;we have to make smarter choices. <p>This week, I'll send a budget to Congress that will help do just that, a fiscally responsible blueprint for middle class jobs and growth. <p>For years, an argument in Washington has raged between reducing our deficits at all costs and making the investments we need to grow the economy. My budget puts that argument to rest. Because we don't have to choose between these goals, we can do both. After all, as we saw in the 1990s, nothing reduces deficits faster than a growing economy. <p>My budget will reduce our deficits not with aimless, reckless spending cuts that hurt students and seniors and middle class families, but through the balanced approach that the American people prefer and the investments that a growing economy demands. <p>Now, the truth is, our deficits are already shrinking. That's a fact. I've already signed more than $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction into law, and my budget will reduce our deficits by nearly $2 trillion more, without harming the recovery. That surpasses the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that many economists believe will stabilize our finances. <p>We'll make the tough reforms required to strengthen Medicare for the future, without undermining the rock-solid guarantee at its core. And we'll enact commonsense tax reform that includes closing wasteful tax loopholes for the wealthy and well connected, loopholes like the ones that can allow a billionaire to pay a lower tax rate than his or her secretary. <p>This is the compromise I offered the Speaker of the House at the end of last year. While it's not my ideal plan to further reduce the deficit, it's a compromise I'm willing to accept in order to move beyond a cycle of short-term, crisis-driven decisionmaking and so that we can focus on growing our economy and our middle class for the long run. It includes ideas many Republicans have said they could accept as well. It's a way we can make progress together. <p>But deficit reduction cannot come at the cost of economic growth or middle class security. And it doesn't have to. My budget will make critical investments to grow the economy, create jobs, and strengthen the middle class. <p>As I said in my State of the Union Address, every day, we should ask ourselves three questions: How do we make America a magnet for good jobs? How do we give our workers the skills they need to do those jobs? And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living? <p>To make America a magnet for good jobs, we'll invest in high-tech manufacturing and homegrown American energy, put people to work building new roads and bridges and schools and cut redtape to help businesses grow. <p>To give workers the skills they need to do those jobs, we'll invest in education that begins in the earliest years and job training that better equips workers to compete in the 21st-century economy. <p>To make sure hard work is rewarded, we'll build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class and focus on revitalizing some of our communities hardest hit by recession and job loss. <p>All of these investments will help grow the economy and create jobs. None of them will add to the deficit. And I will lay out these priorities in greater detail in the days ahead. <p>It's a budget that doesn't spend beyond our means. And it's a budget that doesn't make harsh and unnecessary cuts that only serve to slow our economy. We'll keep our promise to an aging generation by shoring up Medicare. And we'll keep our promise to the next generation by investing in the fundamentals that have always made America strong: manufacturing, innovation, energy, and education. <p>Because that's what it'll take to make sure America remains strong in the years ahead and to leave behind something better for our kids. <p>Thanks so much. Have a great weekend.\" "
"69" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Connecticut. Thank you. Well, thank you so much, everybody. Let me begin by thanking Nicole and Ian for your brave words. I want to thank them and all the Newtown families who have come here today, including your first selectman, Pat Llodra. Nobody could be more eloquent than Nicole and the other families on this issue. And we are so grateful for their courage and willingness to share their stories again and again, understanding that nothing is going to be more important in making sure the Congress moves forward this week than hearing from them. <p>I want to thank all the educators from Sandy Hook Elementary who have come here as well, the survivors&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience members.</i> We love you, Obama! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. I do&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;the survivors who still mourn and grieve, but are still going to work every day to love and raise those precious children in their care as fiercely as ever. <p>I want to thank Governor Malloy for his leadership. Very proud of him. I want to thank the University of Hartford for hosting us this afternoon. Thank you, Hawks. And I want to thank the people of Connecticut for everything you've done to honor the memories of the victims, because you're part of their family as well. <p>One of your recent alumni, Rachel D'Avino, was a behavioral therapist at Sandy Hook. Two alumni of your performing arts school, Jimmy Greene and Nelba Marquez-Greene, lost their daughter Ana, an incredible, vibrant young girl, who looked up to them and learned from them and inherited their talents by singing before she could talk. <p>So every family in this State was shaken by the tragedy of that morning. Every family in this country was shaken. We hugged our kids more tightly. We asked what could we do, as a society, to help prevent a tragedy like that from happening again. <p>And as a society, we decided that we have to change. We must. [<i>Applause</i>] We must change. <p>I noticed that Nicole and others refer to that day as 12/14. For these families, it was a day that changed everything. And I know many of you in Newtown wondered if the rest of us would live up to the promise we made in those dark days; if we'd change too; or if, once the television trucks left, once the candles flickered out, once the teddy bears were carefully gathered up together, that the country would somehow move on to other things. <p>Over the weekend, I heard Francine Wheeler, who lost her son Ben that day, say that the 4 months since the tragedy might feel like a brief moment for some, but for her, it feels like it's been years since she saw Ben. And she's determined not to let what happened that day just fade away. \\"We're not going anywhere,\\" she said. \\"We are here. We are going to be here.\\" And I know that she speaks for everybody in Newtown, everybody who was impacted. <p>And, Newtown, we want you to know that we're here with you. We will not walk away from the promises we've made. We are as determined as ever to do what must be done. In fact, I'm here to ask you to help me show that we can get it done. We're not forgetting. <p>We can't forget. Your families still grieve in ways most of us can't comprehend. But so many of you have used that grief to make a difference, not just to honor your own children, but to protect the lives of all of our children. So many of you have mobilized and organized and petitioned your elected officials \\"with love and logic,\\" as Nicole put it, as citizens determined to right something gone wrong. <p>And last week, here in Connecticut, your elected leaders responded. The Connecticut legislature, led by many of the legislators here today, passed new measures to protect more of our children and our communities from gun violence. And Governor Malloy signed that legislation into law. <p>So I want to be clear: You, the families of Newtown, people across Connecticut, you helped make that happen. Your voices, your determination made that happen. Obviously, the elected leaders did an extraordinary job moving it forward, but it couldn't have happened if they weren't hearing from people in their respective districts, people all across the State. That's the power of your voice. <p>And by the way, Connecticut is not alone. In the past few months, New York, Colorado, Maryland have all passed new, commonsense gun safety reforms as well. <p>These are all States that share an awful familiarity with gun violence, whether it's the horror of mass killings or street crime that's too common in too many neighborhoods. All of these States also share a strong tradition of hunting and sport shooting and gun ownership. It's been a part of the fabric of people's lives for generations. And every single one of those States&mdash;including here in Connecticut&mdash;decided that, yes, we can protect more of our citizens from gun violence while still protecting our Second Amendment rights. Those two things don't contradict each other. We can pass commonsense laws that protect our kids and protect our rights. <p>So Connecticut has shown the way. And now is the time for Congress to do the same. [<i>Applause</i>] Now is the time for Congress to do the same. This week is the time for Congress to do the same. <p>Now, back in January, just a few months after the tragedy in Newtown, I announced a series of executive actions to reduce gun violence and keep our kids safe. And I put forward commonsense proposals&mdash;much like those that passed here in Connecticut&mdash;for Congress to consider. And you'll remember in my State of the Union Address, I urged Congress to give those proposals a vote. And that moment is now. <p>As soon as this week, Congress will begin debating these commonsense proposals to reduce gun violence. Your Senators, Dick Blumenthal and Chris Murphy&mdash;they're here&mdash;your Representatives, John Larson, Rosa DeLauro, Elizabeth Esty, Jim Himes, Joe Courtney, they are all pushing to pass this legislation. But much of Congress is going to only act if they hear from you, the American people. So here's what we have to do. <p><i>Audience member.</i> I love you, Mr. President. <p><i>The President.</i> I appreciate that. [<i>Laughter</i>] Here's what we've got to do. We have to tell Congress it's time to require a background check for anyone who wants to buy a gun so that people who are dangerous to themselves and others cannot get their hands on a gun. Let's make that happen. <p>We have to tell Congress it's time to crack down on gun trafficking so that folks will think twice before buying a gun as part of a scheme to arm someone who won't pass a background check. Let's get that done. <p>We have to tell Congress it's time to restore the ban on military-style assault weapons and a 10-round limit for magazines to make it harder for a gunman to fire 154 bullets into his victims in less than 5 minutes. Let's put that to a vote. <p>We have to tell Congress it's time to strengthen school safety and help people struggling with mental health problems get the treatment they need before it's too late. Let's do that for our kids and for our communities. <p>Now, I know that some of these proposals inspire more debate than others, but each of them has the support of the majority of the American people. All of them are common sense. All of them deserve a vote. [<i>Applause</i>] All of them deserve a vote. <p>Consider background checks. Over the past 20 years, background checks have kept more than 2 million dangerous people from getting their hands on a gun. A group of police officers in Colorado told me last week that, thanks to background checks, they've been able to stop convicted murderers, folks under restraining orders for committing violent domestic abuse from buying a gun. In some cases, they've actually arrested the person as they were coming to purchase the gun. <p>So we know that background checks can work. But the problem is, loopholes in the current law let so many people avoid background checks altogether. That's not safe. It doesn't make sense. If you're a law-abiding citizen and you go through a background check to buy a gun, wouldn't you expect other people to play by the same rules? <p>If you're a law-abiding gun seller, wouldn't you want to know you're not selling your gun to someone who's likely to commit a crime? Shouldn't we make it harder, not easier for somebody who is convicted of domestic abuse to get his hands on a gun? <p>It turns out 90 percent of Americans think so. Ninety percent of Americans support universal background checks. Think about that. How often do 90 percent of Americans agree on anything? [<i>Laughter</i>] And yet 90 percent agree on this: Republicans, Democrats, folks who own guns, folks who don't own guns, 80 percent of Republicans, more than 80 percent of gun owners, more than 70 percent of NRA households. It is common sense. <p>And yet there is only one thing that can stand in the way of change that just about everybody agrees on, and that's politics in Washington. You would think that with those numbers, Congress would rush to make this happen. That's what you would think. If our democracy is working the way it's supposed to and 90 percent of the American people agree on something, in the wake of a tragedy, you'd think this would not be a heavy lift. <p>And yet some folks back in Washington are already floating the idea that they may use political stunts to prevent votes on any of these reforms. Think about that. They're not just saying they'll vote no on ideas that almost all Americans support, they're saying they'll do everything they can to even prevent any votes on these provisions. They're saying your opinion doesn't matter. And that's not right. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> That is not right. <p><i>Audience members.</i> We want a vote! <p><i>The President.</i> We need a vote. <p><i>Audience members.</i> We want a vote! We want a vote! We want a vote! <p><i>The President.</i> We need a vote. <p><i>Audience members.</i> We want a vote! We want a vote! We want a vote! <p><i>The President.</i> Now, I've also heard some in the Washington press suggest that what happens to gun violence legislation in Congress this week will either be a political victory or defeat for me. Connecticut, this is not about me. This is not about politics. This is about doing the right thing for all the families who are here that have been torn apart by gun violence. It's about them and all the families going forward, so we can prevent this from happening again. That's what it's about. It's about the law enforcement officials putting their lives at risk. That's what this is about. This is not about politics. This is not about politics. <p>This is about these families and families all across the country who are saying let's make it a little harder for our kids to get gunned down. <p>When I said in my State of the Union Address that these proposals deserve a vote&mdash;that families of Newtown and Aurora and Tucson and a former Member of Congress, Gabby Giffords, that they all deserved a vote&mdash;virtually every Member of that Chamber stood up and applauded. And now they're going to start denying your families a vote when the cameras are off and when the lobbyists have worked what they do? You deserve better than that. You deserve a vote. <p>Now, look, we knew from the beginning of this debate that change would not be easy. We knew that there would be powerful interests that are very good at confusing the subject, that are good at amplifying conflict and extremes, that are good at drowning out rational debate, good at ginning up irrational fears, all of which stands in the way of progress. <p>But if our history teaches us anything, then it's up to us&mdash;the people&mdash;to stand up to those who say we can't or we won't, stand up for the change that we need. And I believe that that's what the American people are looking for. <p>When I first ran for this office, I said that I did not believe the country was as divided as our politics would suggest, and I still believe that. I know sometimes, when you watch cable news or talk radio or you browse the Internet, you'd think, man, everybody just hates each other, everybody is just at each other's throats. But that's not how most Americans think about these issues. There are good people on both sides of every issue. <p>So if we're going to move forward, we can't just talk past one another. We've got to listen to one another. That's what Governor Malloy and all these legislative leaders did. That's why they were able to pass bipartisan legislation. All right? <p>I've got stacks of letters from gun owners who want me to know that they care passionately about their right to bear arms, don't want them infringed upon, and I appreciate every one of those letters. I've learned from them. But a lot of those letters, what they've also said is&mdash;they're not just gun owners, they're also parents or police officers or veterans, and they agree that we can't stand by and keep letting these tragedies happen, that with our rights come some responsibilities and obligations to our communities and ourselves and most of all to our children. We can't just think about \\"us,\\" we've got to think about \\"we the people.\\" <p>I was in Colorado. I told a story about Michelle. She came back from a trip to rural Iowa; we were out there campaigning. Sometimes it would be miles between farms, let alone towns. And she said, you know, coming back, I can understand why somebody would want a gun for protection. If somebody drove up into the driveway and, Barack, you weren't home, the sheriff lived miles away, I might want that security. So she can understand what it might be like in terms of somebody wanting that kind of security. <p>On the other hand, I also talked to a hunter last week who said, \\"All my experiences with guns have been positive, but I also realize that for others, all their experiences with guns have been negative.\\" <p>And when he said that, I thought about the mom I met from suburban Chicago whose son was killed in a random shooting. And this mom told me: \\"I hate it when people tell me that my son was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He was on his way to school. He was exactly where he was supposed to be. He was in the right place at the right time, and he still got shot.\\" <p>The kids at Sandy Hook were where they were supposed to be. So were those moviegoers in Aurora. So were those worshippers in Oak Creek. So was Gabby Giffords. She was at a supermarket, listening to the concerns of her constituents. They were exactly where they were supposed to be. They were also exercising their rights: to assemble peaceably, to worship freely and safely. They were exercising the rights of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. So, surely, we can reconcile those two things. Surely, America doesn't have to be divided between rural and urban and Democrat and Republican when it comes to something like this. <p>If you're an American who wants to do something to prevent more families from knowing the immeasurable anguish that these families here have known, then we have to act. Now is the time to get engaged. Now is the time to get involved. Now is the time to push back on fear and frustration and misinformation. Now is the time for everybody to make their voices heard from every State house to the corridors of Congress. <p>And I'm asking everyone listening today, find out where your Member of Congress stands on this. If they're not part of the 90 percent of Americans who agree on background checks, then ask them, why not? Why wouldn't you want to make it easier for law enforcement to do their job? Why wouldn't you want to make it harder for a dangerous person to get his or her hands on a gun? What's more important to you, our children or an A-grade from the gun lobby? <p>I've heard Nicole talk about what her life has been like since Dylan was taken from her in December. And one thing she said struck me. She said: \\"Every night, I beg for him to come to me in my dreams so that I can see him again. And during the day, I just focus on what I need to do to honor him and make change.\\" Now, if Nicole can summon the courage to do that, how can the rest of us do any less? [<i>Applause</i>] How can we do any less? <p>If there is even one thing we can do to protect our kids, don't we have an obligation to try? If there is even one step we can take to keep somebody from murdering dozens of innocents in the span of minutes, shouldn't we be taking that step? If there is just one thing we can do to keep one father from having to bury his child, isn't that worth fighting for? <p>I've got to tell you, the&mdash;I've had tough days in the Presidency&mdash;I've said this before: The day Newtown happened was the toughest day of my Presidency. But I've got to tell you, if we don't respond to this, that will be a tough day for me too. Because we've got to expect more from ourselves, and we've got to expect more from Congress. We've got to believe that every once in a while, we set politics aside, and we just do what's right. We've got to believe that. <p>And if you believe that, I'm asking you to stand up. If you believe in the right to bear arms, like I do, but think we should prevent an irresponsible few from inflicting harm, stand up. [<i>Applause</i>] Stand up. <p>If you believe that the families of Newtown and Aurora and Tucson and Virginia Tech and the thousands of Americans who have been gunned down in the last 4 months deserve a vote, we all have to stand up. <p>If you want the people you send to Washington to have just an iota of the courage that the educators at Sandy Hook showed when danger arrived on their doorstep, then we're all going to have to stand up. <p>And if we do, if we come together and raise our voices together and demand this change together, I'm convinced cooperation and common sense will prevail. We will find sensible, intelligent ways to make this country stronger and safer for our children. <p>So let's do the right thing. Let's do right by our kids. Let's do right by these families. Let's get this done. Connecticut, thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"70" "\"Everybody, please have a seat. And give it up for our musical director, Booker T. and the Memphis Soul all-stars. I just want everybody to know that it is now my second term, so rather than \\"Hail to the Chief,\\" we're going with that from here on out. [<i>Laughter</i>] Little change in tradition. <p>Now, before we get started, I am going to exercise some Presidential prerogative to say a few words about two very special people who are here tonight. This will humiliate them, but I'm going to go ahead and do it anyway. Jess Wright and Kenny Thompson both work on my staff, crucial members of my team since way back in Iowa in 2007. <p>Over the weekend, Kenny popped the question, and Jess said yes. So I want to congratulate&mdash;publicly&mdash;Kenny Thompson, Jess Wright. Beautiful couple. We love them. They are wonderful. They've been loyal, shown such great friendship to me, and I'm so glad that they have gone ahead and taken the plunge. <p>By the way, guys, Justin Timberlake just got married to this lovely young lady right here, Jessica Biel. So Justin can probably offer you a few pointers. And, Justin, they are looking for a wedding singer. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm just saying. <p>Tonight I am speaking not just as a President, but as one of America's best known Al Green impersonators. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I have a new appreciation for what Al once said about the Memphis soul sound that he helped create: \\"We don't even know ourselves how that music has endured for so long and how that came out of us.\\" <p>All I know is I've been looking forward to tonight because, let's face it, who does not love this music? These songs get us on the dance floor. Even the Governor of Tennessee said he's going to dance tonight. [<i>Laughter</i>] They get stuck in our heads. We go back over them again and again. And they've played an important part in our history. <p>In the sixties and seventies, Memphis knew its share of division and discord and injustice. But in that turbulent time, the sound of Hi and Duke and Sun and Stax records tried to bridge those divides, to create a little harmony with harmony. The great Memphis musician Don Nix went to an all-White school, and he described what it was like. He said: \\"If you could imagine, nobody's ever heard R&B music before. White kids had never heard it. And you can imagine what that did to us.\\" <p>So he and others kept playing music that everybody could get in to. They created a whole new sound, and as they did, they broke down barriers. On McLemore Avenue, in the heart of a segregated city, Stax Records was integrated from the studio musicians all the way to upper management. Booker T. Jones and Steve Cropper, who are both here tonight, helped form one of the city's first integrated bands. They weren't allowed to go to school together. They weren't always allowed to travel or eat together. But no one could stop them from playing music together. <p>And that was the spirit of their music&mdash;the sound of \\"Soulsville, U.S.A.\\"&mdash;a music that, at its core, is about the pain of being alone, the power of human connection, and the importance of treating each other right. After all, this is the music that asked us to 'try a little tenderness'. It's the music that put \\"Mr. Big Stuff \\" in his place. [<i>Laughter</i>] And it's the music that challenged us to accept new ways of thinking with four timeless words: \\"Can you dig it?\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So it's really no surprise that Memphis soul swept the Nation, and it has stood the test of time. Tonight we bring it to the White House. <p>We've got folks here who were there at the beginning, legends like Mavis Staples, Charlie Musselwhite, William Bell, and Eddie Floyd. We've got artists like Cyndi Lauper and Ben Harper and Queen Latifah, who still turn to Memphis for inspiration. We've got Justin Timberlake, a proud son of Memphis who's never forgotten his roots, and the Alabama Shakes, who are bringing the Muscle Shoals sound to a new generation. <p>So to all of you, even more than for the music you've created, I want to say a special thank you for the difference that you've made in our lives. More than half a century after Soulsville, U.S.A., first opened its doors, you still bring us together. You still remind us how much we have in common. You still help us imagine a better place. And you promise, through your beautiful music, that you can take us there. <p>So tonight we're going to start things off with two extraordinary artists who span the generations. One's a Memphis legend who's been around just about forever, the other an \\"American Idol\\" who's turning 21 today. In the heyday of soul music, no band had more hits than the group known simply as Sam and Dave. Here to perform his classic \\"Soul Man\\" along with Joshua Ledet, please welcome the great Sam Moore.\" "
"71" "\"Good morning, everybody. Please, please have a seat. Well, as President, my top priority is to do everything I can to reignite what I consider to be the true engine of the American economy: a rising, thriving middle class. That's what I think about every day. That's the driving force behind every decision that I make. <p>And over the past 3 years, our businesses have created nearly 6.5 million new jobs. But we know we can help them create more. Corporate profits are at an all-time high. But we have to get wages and incomes rising as well. Our deficits are falling at the fastest pace in years. But we can do more to bring them down in a balanced and responsible way. <p>The point is, our economy is poised for progress, as long as Washington doesn't get in the way. Frankly, the American people deserve better than what we've been seeing: a shortsighted, crisis-driven decisionmaking, like the reckless, across-the-board spending cuts that are already hurting a lot of communities out there, cuts that economists predict will cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs during the course of this year. <p>If we want to keep rebuilding our economy on a stronger, more stable foundation, then we've got to get smarter about our priorities as a nation. And that's what the budget I'm sending to Congress today represents: a fiscally responsible blueprint for middle class jobs and growth. <p>For years, the debate in this town has raged between reducing our deficits at all costs and making the investments necessary to grow our economy. And this budget answers that argument, because we can do both. We can grow our economy and shrink our deficits. In fact, as we saw in the 1990s, nothing shrinks deficits faster than a growing economy. That's been my goal since I took office. And that should be our goal going forward. <p>At a time when too many Americans are still looking for work, my budget begins by making targeted investments in areas that will create jobs right now and prime our economy to keep generating good jobs down the road. As I said in my State of the Union Address, we should ask ourselves three questions every day: How do we make America a magnet for new jobs? How do we give our workers the skills they need to do those jobs? And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living? <p>To make America a magnet for good jobs, this budget invests in new manufacturing hubs to help turn regions left behind by globalization into global centers of high-tech jobs. We'll spark new American innovation and industry with cutting-edge research, like the initiative I announced to map the human brain and cure disease. We'll continue our march towards energy independence and address the threat of climate change. And our Rebuild America Partnership will attract private investment to put construction workers back on the job rebuilding our roads, our bridges, and our schools, in turn attracting even more new business to communities across the country. <p>To help workers earn the skills they need to fill those jobs, we'll work with States to make high-quality preschool available to every child in America. And we're going to pay for it by raising taxes on tobacco products that harm our young people. It's the right thing to do. <p>We'll reform our high schools and job training programs to equip more Americans with the skills they need to compete in the 21st-century economy. And we'll help more middle class families afford the rising cost of college. <p>To make sure hard work is rewarded, we'll build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class for anybody who is willing to work hard to climb them. So we'll partner with 20 of our communities hit hardest by the recession to help them improve housing and education and business investment. And we should make the minimum wage a wage you can live on, because no one who works full time should have to raise his or her family in poverty. <p>My budget also replaces the foolish, across-the-board spending cuts that are already hurting our economy. And I have to point out that many of the same Members of Congress who supported deep cuts are now the ones complaining about them the loudest as they hit their own communities. Of course, the people I feel for are the people who are directly feeling the pain of these cuts, the people who can least afford it. They're hurting military communities that have already sacrificed enough. They're hurting middle class families. There are children who have had to enter a lottery to determine which of them get to stay in their Head Start program with their friends. There are seniors who depend on programs like Meals on Wheels so they can live independently, but who are seeing their services cut. <p>That's what this so-called sequester means. Some people may not have been impacted, but there are a lot of folks who are being increasingly impacted all across this country. And that's why my budget replaces these cuts with smarter ones, making long-term reforms, eliminating actual waste and programs we don't need anymore. <p>So building new roads and bridges, educating our children from the youngest age, helping more families afford college, making sure that hard work pays&mdash;these are things that should not be partisan. They should not be controversial. We need to make them happen. My budget makes these investments to grow our economy and create jobs, and it does so without adding a dime to our deficits. <p>Now, on the topic of deficits, despite all the noise in Washington, here's a clear and unassailable fact: Our deficits are already falling. Over the past 2 years, I've signed legislation that will reduce our deficits by more than $2.5 trillion, more than two-thirds of it through spending cuts and the rest through asking the wealthiest Americans to begin paying their fair share. <p>That doesn't mean we don't have more work to do. But here's how we finish the job. My budget will reduce our deficits by nearly another $2 trillion so that all told we will have surpassed the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that independent economists believe we need to stabilize our finances. But it does so in a balanced and responsible way, a way that most Americans prefer. <p>Both parties, for example, agree that the rising cost of caring for an aging generation is the single biggest driver of our long-term deficits. And the truth is, for those like me who deeply believe in our social insurance programs, think it's one of the core things that our Government needs to do, if we want to keep Medicare working as well as it has, if we want to preserve the ironclad guarantee that Medicare represents, then we're going to have to make some changes. But they don't have to be drastic ones. And instead of making drastic ones later, what we should be doing is making some manageable ones now. <p>The reforms I'm proposing will strengthen Medicare for future generations without undermining that ironclad guarantee that Medicare represents. We'll reduce our Government's Medicare bills by finding new ways to reduce the cost of health care, not by shifting the costs to seniors or the poor or families with disabilities. They are reforms that keep the promise we've made to our seniors: basic security that is rock solid and dependable and there for you when you need it. That's what my budget represents. <p>My budget does also contain the compromise I offered Speaker Boehner at the end of last year, including reforms championed by Republican leaders in Congress. And I don't believe that all these ideas are optimal, but I'm willing to accept them as part of a compromise, if&mdash;and only if&mdash;they contain protections for the most vulnerable Americans. <p>But if we're serious about deficit reduction, then these reforms have to go hand in hand with reforming our Tax Code to make it more simple and more fair so that the wealthiest individuals and biggest corporations cannot keep taking advantage of loopholes and deductions that most Americans don't get. That's the bottom line. <p>If you're serious about deficit reduction, then there's no excuse to keep these loopholes open. They don't serve an economic purpose. They don't grow our economy. They don't put people back to work. All they do is to allow folks, who are already well off and well connected, game the system. If anyone thinks I'll finish the job of deficit reduction on the backs of middle class families or through spending cuts alone that actually hurt our economy short-term, they should think again. <p>When it comes to deficit reduction, I've already met Republicans more than halfway. So in the coming days and weeks, I hope that Republicans will come forward and demonstrate that they're really as serious about the deficits and debt as they claim to be. <p>So growing our economy, creating jobs, shrinking our deficits, keeping our promise to the generation that made us great, but also investing in the next generation, the next generation that will make us even greater. These are not conflicting goals. We can do them in concert. That's what my budget does. That's why I'm so grateful for the great work that Jeff Zients and his team have done in shaping this budget. The numbers work. There's not a lot of smoke and mirrors in here. <p>And if we can come together, have a serious, reasoned debate&mdash;not driven by politics&mdash;and come together around common sense and compromise, then I'm confident we'll move this country forward and leave behind something better for our children. That's our task. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"72" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. Please have a seat. On behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the White House. Thank you, Chaplain. <p>This year, we mark the 60th anniversary of the end of the Korean war, a time when thousands of our prisoners of war finally came home after years of starvation and hardship and, in some cases, torture. And among the homecomings, one stood out. <p>A group of our POWs emerged carrying a large wooden crucifix, nearly 4 feet tall. They had spent months on it, secretly collecting firewood, carving it&mdash;the cross and the body&mdash;using radio wire for a crown of thorns. It was a tribute to their friend, their chaplain, their fellow prisoner, who had touched their souls and saved their lives: Father Emil Kapaun. <p>This is an amazing story. Father Kapaun has been called a shepherd in combat boots. His fellow soldiers who felt his grace and his mercy called him a saint, a blessing from God. Today we bestow another title on him&mdash;recipient of our Nation's highest military decoration&mdash;the Medal of Honor. After more than six decades of working to make this medal a reality, I know one of Father Kapaun's comrades spoke for a lot of folks here when he said, \\"It's about time.\\" <p>Father, as they called him, was just 35 years old when he died in that hellish prison camp. His parents and his only sibling, his brother, are no longer with us. But we are extremely proud to welcome members of the Kapaun family&mdash;his nephews, his niece, their children&mdash;two of whom currently serve in this country's National Guard. And we are very proud of them. <p>We're also joined by Members of the Kansas congressional delegation, leaders from across our armed forces, and representatives from the Catholic Church, which recognizes Father Kapaun as a \\"Servant of God.\\" And we are truly humbled to be joined by men who served alongside him: veterans and former POWs from the Korean War. Thank you. <p>Now, obviously, I never met Father Kapaun. But I have a sense of the man he was, because in his story, I see reflections of my own grandparents and their values, the people who helped to raise me. Emil and my grandfather were both born in Kansas about the same time, both were raised in small towns outside of Wichita. They were part of that greatest generation: surviving the Depression, joining the Army, serving in World War II. And they embodied those heartland values of honesty and hard work, decency and humility: quiet heroes determined to do their part. <p>For Father Kapaun, this meant becoming an Army chaplain: serving God and country. After the Communist invasion of South Korea, he was among the first American troops that hit the beaches and pushed their way north through hard mountains and bitter cold. In his understated, Midwestern way, he wrote home, saying, \\"This outdoor life is quite a thing\\"&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and \\"I'd prefer to live in a house once in a while.\\" But he had hope, saying, \\"It looks like the war will end soon.\\" <p>That's when Chinese forces entered the war with a massive surprise attack, perhaps 20,000 soldiers pouring down on a few thousand Americans. In the chaos, dodging bullets and explosions, Father Kapaun raced between foxholes, out past the front lines, and into no-man's land, dragging the wounded to safety. <p>When his commanders ordered an evacuation, he chose to stay, gathering the injured, tending to their wounds. When the enemy broke through and the combat was hand to hand, he carried on, comforting the injured and the dying, offering some measure of peace as they left this Earth. <p>When enemy forces bore down, it seemed like the end: that these wounded Americans, more than a dozen of them, would be gunned down. But Father Kapaun spotted a wounded Chinese officer. He pleaded with this Chinese officer and convinced him to call out to his fellow Chinese. The shooting stopped, and they negotiated a safe surrender, saving those American lives. <p>Then, as Father Kapaun was being led away, he saw another American: wounded, unable to walk, laying in a ditch, defenseless. An enemy soldier was standing over him, rifle aimed at his head, ready to shoot. And Father Kapaun marched over and pushed the enemy soldier aside. And then as the soldier watched, stunned, Father Kapaun carried that wounded American away. <p>This is the valor we honor today: an American soldier who didn't fire a gun, but who wielded the mightiest weapon of all, a love for his brothers so pure that he was willing to die so that they might live. And yet the incredible story of Father Kapaun does not end there. <p>He carried that injured American for miles, as their captors forced them on a death march. When Father Kapaun grew tired, he'd help the wounded soldier hop on one leg. When other prisoners stumbled, he picked them up. When they wanted to quit&mdash;knowing that stragglers would be shot&mdash;he begged them to keep walking. <p>In the camps that winter, deep in a valley, men could freeze to death in their sleep. Father Kapaun offered them his own clothes. They starved on tiny rations of millet and corn and birdseed. He somehow snuck past the guards, foraged in nearby fields, and returned with rice and potatoes. In desperation, some men hoarded food. He convinced them to share. Their bodies were ravaged by dysentery. He grabbed some rocks, pounded metal into pots and boiled clean water. They lived in filth. He washed their clothes, and he cleansed their wounds. <p>The guards ridiculed his devotion to his Savior and the Almighty. They took his clothes and made him stand in the freezing cold for hours. Yet he never lost his faith. If anything, it only grew stronger. At night, he slipped into huts to lead prisoners in prayer, saying the rosary, administering the sacraments, offering three simple words: \\"God bless you.\\" One of them later said that with his very presence, he could just for a moment turn a mud hut into a cathedral. <p>That spring, he went further; he held an Easter service. I just met with the Kapaun family. They showed me something extraordinary: the actual stole, the purple vestment, that Father Kapaun wore when he celebrated Mass inside that prison camp. <p>As the Sun rose that Easter Sunday, he put on that purple stole and led dozens of prisoners to the ruins of an old church in the camp. And he read from a prayer missal that they had kept hidden. He held up a small crucifix that he had made from sticks. And as the guards watched, Father Kapaun and all those prisoners&mdash;mens of different faith, perhaps some men of no faith&mdash;sang the Lord's Prayer and \\"America the Beautiful.\\" They sang so loud that other prisoners across the camp not only heard them, they joined in too, filling that valley with song and with prayer. <p>That faith&mdash;that they might be delivered from evil, that they could make it home&mdash;was perhaps the greatest gift to those men: that even amidst such hardship and despair, there could be hope; amid their misery in the temporal, they could see those truths that are eternal; that even in such hell, there could be a touch of the divine. Looking back, one of them said that that is what \\"kept a lot of us alive.\\" <p>Yet, for Father Kapaun, the horrific conditions took their toll. Thin, frail, he began to limp, with a blood clot in his leg. And then came dysentery, then pneumonia. That's when the guards saw their chance to finally rid themselves of this priest and the hope he inspired. They came for him. And over the protests and tears of the men who loved him, the guards sent him to a death house&mdash;a hellhole with no food or water&mdash;to be left to die. <p>And yet, even then, his faith held firm. \\"I'm going to where I've always wanted to go,\\" he told his brothers. \\"And when I get up there, I'll say a prayer for all of you.\\" And then, as was taken away, he did something remarkable; he blessed the guards. \\"Forgive them,\\" he said, \\"for they know not what they do.\\" Two days later, in that house of death, Father Kapaun breathed his last breath. His body was taken away, his grave unmarked, his remains unrecovered to this day. <p>The war and the awful captivity would drag on for another 2 years, but these men held on, steeled by the memory and moral example of the man they called Father. And on their first day of freedom, in his honor, they carried that beautiful wooden crucifix with them. <p>Some of these men are here today, including Herb Miller, the soldier that Father Kapaun saved in that ditch and then carried all those miles. Many are now in their eighties, but make no mistake, they are among the strongest men that America has ever produced. And I would ask all of our courageous POWs from the Korean war to stand if they're able and accept the gratitude of a grateful nation. <p>I'm told that in their darkest hours in the camp in that valley, these men turned to a Psalm. As we prepare for the presentation of the Medal of Honor to Father Kapaun's nephew, Ray, I want to leave you with the words of that Psalm, which sustained these men all those years ago: <p>Even though I walk in the valley of the shadow of death, <p>I will fear no evil, for you are with me; <p>Your rod and your staff, they comfort me. <p>You prepare a table for me in the presence of my enemies. <p>You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. <p>Surely, your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life. <p>And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. <p>Ray, would you please join me on stage for the reading of the citation? <p>[<i>At this point, Lt. Cmdr. Tiffany Hill, USN, Navy Aide to the President, read the citation. The President then presented the medal, assisted by Lt. Col. Owen G. Ray, USA, Army Aide to the President. Following the presentation, Maj. Gen. Donald L. Rutherford, USA, Army Chief of Chaplains, said a prayer.</i>] <p>Well, I can't imagine a better example for all of us&mdash;whether in uniform or not in uniform&mdash;a better example to follow. Father Kapaun's life, I think, is a testimony to the human spirit, the power of faith, and reminds us of the good that we can do each and every day regardless of the most difficult of circumstances. We can always be an instrument of his will. <p>So I hope all of you have enjoyed this ceremony. I certainly have been extremely touched by it. To the Kapaun family, God bless you. To all our veterans, we're so proud of you. <p>And my understanding is, is that the White House has pretty decent food&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;so I hope all of you enjoy the reception. Thank you very much.\" "
"73" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody. Hello. Please, everybody have a seat. Well, good afternoon. Welcome to the White House. <p>I want to start by recognizing Coach Ken Niumatalolo, my fellow Hawaiian, for being here once again. Where is he? There he is right here. [<i>Laughter</i>] Hard to miss him. Give him a big round of applause. I also want to recognize Vice Admiral Mike Miller, the Superintendent of the Naval Academy, for his outstanding service to our country and for keeping all of you guys in line. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, it is my pleasure to welcome the Navy Midshipmen back to the White House to receive the Commander in Chief's Trophy again. They have now won 19 of their last 21 games against the other service academies, making this their 8th trip here in 10 years. And so Michelle and I were thinking about just leaving the key under the rug. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>This season, you finished 8 and 5, earned your 9th bowl appearance in the last 10 years. But perhaps most importantly, after a 2-year break, you achieved that very first goal you set at the start of every season: You beat Air Force, you beat Army, and lugged this 170-pound trophy back to Annapolis. <p>Against Air Force, you lost your quarterback to an injury in the middle of the game. You trailed by eight points in the fourth quarter. But freshman quarterback Keenan Reynolds took over and led you back in overtime. That's when an unlikely hero, offensive lineman Jake Zuzek, gave you a&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Team members</i>. Zu! <p><i>The President.</i> Zu! <p>&mdash;&mdash;gave you a 28-21 win when he recovered a fumbled snap in the end zone for his first-ever touchdown. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm not sure Coach called the fumblerooski, but I bet that Jake will take it anyway. <p>That set up a winner-take-all game with Army to end the season. Down three entering the fourth quarter, Keenan again led the comeback, driving the team down the field for 80 yards and the winning score, and showing why he was only the third Navy freshman ever to start at quarterback. The win gave the Midshipmen their 11th straight victory over Army, which is a series record. <p>But at Navy, obviously, it's not just about the wins. It's about how you win. This year, your team motto was INAM<i>,</i> which is short for \\"It's Not About Me.\\" And that ethic of teamwork and discipline and unselfishness was led by your captains, Bo Snelson and Brye French, and it ran through your entire season. <p>All season long you kept your priorities in line, your mission in focus. Your work in the classroom helped keep the Naval Academy's graduation rate in the top 10 of the NCAA for the eighth straight year, including linebacker Keegan Wetzel, a first-team Academic All-American with a 3.89 GPA in system engineering. So give Keegan a big round of applause. I like that. <p>And when you faced adversity, you pulled together. Over Thanksgiving break, freshman Rafi Montalvo<i> </i>was in a serious car accident, and doctors pulled him into a coma. And even though the Army game was next on the schedule, Coach was one of his first visitors at the hospital down in Florida. And then pretty soon, his teammates started showing up. When it came time to take the field against your biggest rival, you all put \\"Rafi\\" stickers on your helmets and gave him the game ball after your victory. <p>So, gentlemen, that's why I have no greater honor than serving as your Commander in Chief. You're there for each other, and you are there for our country. In just a few weeks when I visit you all for commencement&mdash;and I always have to get ready, because Midshipmen, they got strong handshakes, some of them give me chest bumps, I've got to just make sure I don't tip over&mdash;18 of you will be commissioned as ensigns in the Navy and 10 more as second lieutenants in the Marine Corps. <p>And in the years to come, you will all follow their footsteps. You'll be leading your peers in some of the most complex, dangerous missions on the planet. You'll be teaching them to pull together, to keep their mission in focus, to always remember that \\"It's not about me.\\" And together, your victories will not simply be about football trophies&mdash;as impressive as that trophy is&mdash;but it will be about our security and our values and protecting our freedom. <p>So I want you to know that I could not be prouder to have each of you representing this great country of ours. Americans all across the country feel the very same way. And every single day, we will stand behind you and support you and do the very best that we can in our own lives to reflect the courage and the honor and the character of the men and women of the United States Naval Academy. So God bless you. <p>And with that, let's&mdash;I understand I've got a little something waiting for me. All right, that's the official Navy helmet, fitted for me. [<i>Laughter</i>] Pretty sharp. <p><i>Audience member. </i>Put it on. <p><i>The President.</i> All right. [<i>Laughter</i>] Here's a general rule: You don't put stuff on your head if you're President. [<i>Laughter</i>] So yes, that's Politics 101. [<i>Laughter</i>] You never look good wearing something on your head. Are we going to&mdash;we're going to have the coach up here. Come on. <p>Coach, great to see you again.\" "
"74" "\"Hi. As you've probably noticed, I'm not the President. I'm just a citizen. And as a citizen, I'm here at the White House today because I want to make a difference and I hope you will join me.<P>My name is Francine Wheeler. My husband David is with me. We live in Sandy Hook, Connecticut.<P>David and I have two sons. Our older son Nate, soon to be 10 years old, is a fourth grader at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Our younger son, Ben, age six, was murdered in his first-grade classroom on December 14th, exactly 4 months ago this weekend.<P>David and I lost our beloved son, but Nate lost his best friend. On what turned out to be the last morning of his life, Ben told me, quite out of the blue, \\" I still want to be an architect, Mama, but I also want to be a paleontologist, because that's what Nate is going to be and I want to do everything Nate does.\\"<P>Ben's love of fun and his excitement at the wonders of life were unmatched His boundless energy kept him running across the soccer field long after the game was over. He couldn't wait to get to school every morning. He sang with perfect pitch and had just played at his third piano recital. Irrepressibly bright and spirited, Ben experienced life at full tilt.<P>Until that morning. 20 of our children, and 6 of our educators – gone. Out of the blue.<P>I've heard people say that the tidal wave of anguish our country felt on 12/14 has receded. But not for us. To us, it feels as if it happened just yesterday. And in the four months since we lost our loved ones, thousands of other Americans have died at the end of a gun. Thousands of other families across the United States are also drowning in our grief.<P>Please help us do something before our tragedy becomes your tragedy.<P>Sometimes, I close my eyes and all I can remember is that awful day waiting at the Sandy Hook Volunteer Firehouse for the boy who would never come home – the same firehouse that was home to Ben's Tiger Scout Den 6. But other times, I feel Ben's presence filling me with courage for what I have to do – for him and all the others taken from us so violently and too soon.<P>We have to convince the Senate to come together and pass commonsense gun responsibility reforms that will make our communities safer and prevent more tragedies like the one we never thought would happen to us.<P>When I packed for Washington on Monday, it looked like the Senate might not act at all. Then, after the President spoke in Hartford, and a dozen of us met with Senators to share our stories, more than two-thirds of the Senate voted to move forward.<P>But that's only the start. They haven't yet passed any bills that will help keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. And a lot of people are fighting to make sure they never do.<P>Now is the time to act. Please join us. You can talk to your Senator, too. Or visit WhiteHouse.gov to find out how you can join the President and get involved.<P>Help this be the moment when real change begins. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.\" "
"75" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. Earlier today I was briefed by my homeland security team on the events in Boston. We're continuing to monitor and respond to the situation as it unfolds. And I've directed the full resources of the Federal Government to help State and local authorities protect our people, increase security around the United States as necessary, and investigate what happened. <p>The American people will say a prayer for Boston tonight, and Michelle and I send our deepest thoughts and prayers to the families of the victims in the wake of this senseless loss. <p>We don't yet have all the answers. But we do know that multiple people have been wounded, some gravely, in explosions at the Boston Marathon. <p>I've spoken to FBI Director Mueller and Secretary of Homeland Security Napolitano, and they're mobilizing the appropriate resources to investigate and to respond. <p>I've updated leaders of Congress in both parties, and we reaffirmed that on days like this, there are no Republicans or Democrats; we are Americans, united in concern for our fellow citizens. <p>I've also spoken with Governor Patrick and Mayor Menino and made it clear that they have every single Federal resource necessary to care for the victims and counsel the families. And above all, I made clear to them that all Americans stand with the people of Boston. <p>Boston police, firefighters, and first responders, as well as the National Guard, responded heroically and continue to do so as we speak. It's a reminder that so many Americans serve and sacrifice on our behalf every single day, without regard to their own safety, in dangerous and difficult circumstances. And we salute all those who assisted in responding so quickly and professionally to this tragedy. <p>We still do not know who did this or why. And people shouldn't jump to conclusions before we have all the facts. But make no mistake, we will get to the bottom of this. And we will find out who did this; we'll find out why they did this. Any responsible individuals, any responsible groups will feel the full weight of justice. <p>Today is a holiday in Massachusetts, Patriots' Day. It's a day that celebrates the free and fiercely independent spirit that this great American city of Boston has reflected from the earliest days of our Nation. And it's a day that draws the world to Boston's streets in a spirit of friendly competition. Boston is a tough and resilient town. So are its people. I'm supremely confident that Bostonians will pull together, take care of each other, and move forward as one proud city. And as they do, the American people will be with them every single step of the way. <p>You should anticipate that as we get more information, our teams will provide you briefings. We're still in the investigation stage at this point. But I just want to reiterate, we will find out who did this, and we will hold them accountable. <p>Thank you very much.\" "
"76" "\"<i>The President.</i> Roll Tide! <p><i>Audience members. </i>Roll Tide!<i> </i><p><i>The President. </i>Everybody, have a seat. Have a seat here. It is a great pleasure to welcome the Alabama Crimson Tide to the White House again. I want to congratulate them on winning their 15th national championship and their third in 4 years. They are starting to learn their way around the White House. [<i>Laughter</i>] I was thinking about just having some cots for them here, they're here so often, except we couldn't find any that were big enough. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, before I begin, I want to extend sympathies to the family of Mal Moore, who passed away last month, after a career that spanned six decades as a player, a coach, and athletic director at Alabama. Mal did more than just about anybody to make this program what it is today. Our prayers go out to all the members of the Alabama community who knew him and loved him. <p>Now, last year obviously also had a lot of bright spots for the Crimson Tide. From the beginning of spring practice, the best teams in the country had one goal, and that was to try to at least be as good, if not better, than Alabama. But the Tide kept on rising to the occasion, and they never let up. <p>Back in January, with the whole country watching, this team lined up against the number-one ranked, undefeated Fighting Irish of Notre Dame and dominated from the first possession. At halftime it was 28 to 0. That's when I stopped watching. [<i>Laughter</i>] When the clock ran out, it was 42 to 14. And they left no doubt who was the best team in the country. And after the game, the Notre Dame athletic director said: \\"They're not just better than us. They're better than everyone.\\" <p>And that was no accident. A few days after winning the title last year, Coach Saban was already back to work. And even after losing some pretty big names in the draft last year, he and his terrific coaching team made sure that they did not lose a step. <p>A.J. McCarron showed the kind of poise that very few 22-year-olds possess, passing for more than 2,900 yards and 30 touchdowns on the season. I hear he's coming back for 1 more year, because apparently the rest of the SEC defenses haven't suffered enough. [<i>Laughter</i>] So he's going to subject them to a little more pain. <p>Then there were the seniors, who finished their 4 years with a combined record of 49 and 5, which I think is pretty good. Barrett Jones ended his career as one of the most decorated football players in Alabama history, even playing in the national championship game with torn ligaments in his foot. After the game, he said, \\"It was painful, but you couldn't have pulled me off the field with a tractor.\\" And I don't think he was joking. I think that's true. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>This title also belongs to everyone who helped these young men get to where they are today: family and friends, high school coaches and loved ones, trainers, staff, grocers. [<i>Laughter</i>] These guys eat a lot. It belongs to every student who came to every game, all the fans who yelled \\"roll Tide\\" at kickoff and cheered on the Million Dollar Band. <p>In Miami, on the night the Tide won the championship, one Notre Dame fan apparently asked if \\"roll Tide\\" is a noun or a verb, to which another fan dressed head to toe in crimson replied, \\"It's a way of life.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And that way of life has created legends like Bear Bryant and Joe Namath. It's also a legacy carried on by this team and generations of fans who will fill Bryant-Denny Stadium to the rafters on Saturday afternoons. <p>So obviously everybody here has a lot to be proud of. I want to congratulate Alabama one more time on a great season. I want to wish the players luck who will be taking part in the NFL draft next year. And since I'll be around for 4 more football seasons, I expect I just might see these guys again before I leave. <p>So roll Tide! Thank you. <p>Coach. <p><i>Head Coach Nicholas L. Saban.</i> Mr. President, we certainly appreciate what you do for our country. It's certainly special for you to take the time to honor out team, which we're very proud of their accomplishments relative to all of our fans, all of our supporters, all of our coaches and players. And this is really a special occasion and something you never really get used to. So we really appreciate it. <p>And we do have something that we want to present you with today. <p>[<i>At this point, the President was presented with a jersey.</i>] <p>And I might say, we're kind of keeping inventory of what we've been giving you, and now you have a full uniform. You're an official member of the team. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I will have a meeting later with you to decide how much playing time you're going to get. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> I think we should keep me on the bench. [<i>Laughter</i>]\" "
"77" "\"Good morning, everybody. I've just been briefed by my national security team, including FBI Director Mueller, Attorney General Holder, Secretary Napolitano, and my Counterterrorism and Homeland Security Adviser Lisa Monaco, on the attacks in Boston. We continue to mobilize and deploy all appropriate law enforcement resources to protect our citizens and to investigate and to respond to this attack. <p>Obviously, our first thoughts this morning are with the victims, their families, and the city of Boston. We know that two explosions gravely wounded dozens of Americans and took the lives of others, including a 8-year-old boy. <p>This was a heinous and cowardly act. And given what we now know about what took place, the FBI is investigating it as an act of terrorism. Any time bombs are used to target innocent civilians, it is an act of terror. What we don't yet know, however, is who carried out this attack, or why, whether it was planned and executed by a terrorist organization, foreign or domestic, or was the act of a malevolent individual. That's what we don't yet know. And clearly, we're at the beginning of our investigation. <p>It will take time to follow every lead and determine what happened. But we will find out. We will find whoever harmed our citizens, and we will bring them to justice. <p>We also know this: The American people refuse to be terrorized. Because what the world saw yesterday in the aftermath of the explosions were stories of heroism and kindness and generosity and love: exhausted runners who kept running to the nearest hospital to give blood and those who stayed to tend to the wounded, some tearing off their own clothes to make tourniquets; the first responders who ran into the chaos to save lives; the men and women who are still treating the wounded at some of the best hospitals in the world and the medical students who hurried to help, saying, \\"When we heard, we all came in\\"; the priests who opened their churches and ministered to the hurt and the fearful; and the good people of Boston who opened their homes to the victims of this attack and those shaken by it. <p>So if you want to know who we are, what America is, how we respond to evil, that's it: selflessly, compassionately unafraid. <p>In the coming days, we will pursue every effort to get to the bottom of what happened. And we will continue to remain vigilant. I've directed my administration to take appropriate security measures to protect the American people. And this is a good time for all of us to remember that we all have a part to play in alerting authorities: If you see something suspicious, speak up. <p>I have extraordinary confidence in the men and women of the FBI, the Boston Police Department, and the other agencies that responded so heroically and effectively in the aftermath of yesterday's events. I'm very grateful for the leadership of Governor Patrick and Mayor Menino. And I know that even as we protect our people and aggressively pursue this investigation, the people of Boston will continue to respond in the same proud and heroic way that they have thus far, and their fellow Americans will be right there with them. <p>Thank you very much. And you can expect further briefings from our law enforcement officials as the day goes on. When we have more details, they will be disclosed. What I've indicated to you is what we know now. We know it was bombs that were set off. We know that obviously they did some severe damage. We do not know who did them. We do not know whether this was an act of an organization or an individual or individuals. We don't have a sense of motive yet. So everything else at this point is speculation. But as we receive more information, as the FBI has more information, as our counterterrorism teams have more information, we will make sure to keep you and the American people posted. All right? <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"78" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Well, welcome to the White House. Thank you, Ric, for your introduction and for your leadership at the VA. And I want to thank all of you for coming out today. <p>This is actually good, a little overcast, to keep you guys not too hot. This is one of my favorite events of the year. <p><i>Audience member.</i> I love you, Mr. President! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We obviously meet at a time when our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Boston. Our hearts are with the families of the victims. And now we send our support and encouragement to people who never expected that they'd need it: the wounded civilians who are just beginning what will be, I'm sure for some of them, a long road to recovery. <p>It's a road that the remarkable warriors and athletes here know all too well. And as a consequence, they're going to serve for all of the families as well as all Americans a continued inspiration. <p>We do this every spring, and as all of you know, it started in a bar, where a lot of good ideas start. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Did you say \\"whoo!\\"? <p>Chris Carney and some of his buddies, who are here today, were talking about what they could do to support our wounded warriors, and Chris came up with the idea of biking coast-to-coast to raise money and awareness. <p>Now, even he has admitted in hindsight, \\"It may have been the beer muscles talking.\\" But he followed through, and he started in Long Island, he ended in San Diego. Along the way, he inspired people all across the country. And since then, more than a thousand wounded warriors have joined soldier rides across America. This is the fourth time I've had the chance to welcome these rides here at the White House. And as always, we've got Army. We've got Navy. We've got Air Force. And we've got some marines in the house. <p>Together, with your outstanding families, you represent what's best in America. When we needed patriots to defend our freedom, you have answered the call. You've risked everything for our country and for each other. And you've made sacrifices most of us can barely imagine. <p>So thanks to your courage and your resolve, we've been able to end one war; we're beginning to wind down another. But for all of you, as is true for all of our wounded warriors, coming home doesn't mean that the fight is over. In some ways, it's just begun. <p>You think about folks like Sergeant Sean Karpf. I first met Sean last June at Walter Reed; he had just lost his left leg to an IED in Afghanistan, he knew that there was a long road ahead of him. But today Sean is here, he's ready to ride. He's trained to compete in swimming and track at the Wounded Warrior Games. He's lined up an internship in the physical therapy section at Walter Reed, where he's going to help fellow wounded warriors make the same journey that he did. <p>Then there's Staff Sergeant Erick Millette. During two tours in Iraq, Erick survived 17 IED attacks. They left him with the kinds of injuries that you can't always see: head trauma, brain injury, PTSD. Erick's military career was cut short, but he's taken on a new mission, and that's sharing his story with audiences across the country. <p>So he spread the message that it's okay to talk about these unseen wounds of war. It's okay to seek out help and to seek out support. Erick says that the Wounded Warrior Project literally saved his life, and now through his work, he's helping save even more lives. So, Erick, thank you so much. And obviously, to Sean and everybody who is participating, we could not be prouder of you. <p>I also want to thank folks like Captain Mary McGriff, First Lieutenant Jason Church for returning for another soldier ride as peer mentors for first-time riders. That's a big part of what the soldier rides are about: not just what you can do for yourself, but what you can do as a team. As one rider put it: \\"It's just like in the military. You ride for the warrior next to you.\\" <p>So 9 years ago, Chris Carney told a reporter that the most daunting part of that first ride was being alone. He said he had only played team sports in the past, that he wasn't used to a solo effort. But what Chris and others discovered is that when it comes to supporting our returning heroes, there's no such thing as going it alone. We do this as a team. We get each other's backs. <p>Those who have served under our proud flag never lose that sense of service to one another or to country, and we saw that on Monday. When that first explosion went off, National Guardsmen, servicemembers, veterans in the area all did what warriors do: They ran into harm's way to protect their fellow Americans. They applied tourniquets. They went to hospitals; they donated blood. Doctors used experience they acquired in part overseas to help save lives here at home. <p>That's the strong stuff that our warriors are made out of, and that's why we're so proud and so grateful to the men and women and veterans of our armed forces. And that's why, as Commander in Chief, I'll keep doing everything in my power to make sure we serve you as well as you've served us. And that means making sure you get the care and the benefits you need. It means making sure you don't have to fight for a job when you get home. It means recognizing our military families and giving them the support that they deserve. And right now it means saying a big thank you to all of our riders. <p>So I'm asking every American out there and everyone who is along the route to get out and show their support, wave a flag. Cheer for these outstanding men and women. <p>Good luck over the next 3 days. Have fun out there. And know that you've got a country and a Commander in Chief who appreciates you, who's proud of you and who will always have your back. <p>So thank you. God bless you. God bless America. And let's get this thing going. You can see that they're ready to go. <p>[<i>At this point, the President was given an air horn by a member of his staff.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> And this is my favorite part, using this little horn here. Are you ready? <p><i>Audience member.</i> Oh yeah. <p><i>The President. </i>You guys, everybody ready here? <p><i>Audience members. </i>Yes! <p><i>The President. </i>All right. So you guys all ready? <p><i>Audience member. </i>Ready. <p><i>The President. </i>You sure? <p><i>Audience member. </i>Positive! <p><i>The President. </i>All right I just want to make sure. All right. So I'm going to say \\"on your mark, get set,\\" and then I'm going to blow the horn. All right? On your mark. Get set. <p>[<i>The President blew the horn, and the ride began.</i>]\" "
"79" "\"A few months ago, in response to too many tragedies, including the shootings of a United States Congresswoman, Gabby Giffords, who's here today, and the murder of 20 innocent schoolchildren and their teachers, this country took up the cause of protecting more of our people from gun violence. <p>Families that know unspeakable grief summoned the courage to petition their elected leaders, not just to honor the memory of their children, but to protect the lives of all of our children. A few minutes ago, a minority in the United States Senate decided it wasn't worth it. They blocked commonsense gun reforms even while these families looked on from the Senate gallery. <p>By now, it's well known that 90 percent of the American people support universal background checks that make it harder for a dangerous person to buy a gun. We're talking about convicted felons, people convicted of domestic violence, people with a severe mental illness. Ninety percent of Americans support that idea. Most Americans think that's already the law. <p>And a few minutes ago, 90 percent of Democrats in the Senate voted for that idea. But it's not going to happen, because 90 percent of Republicans in the Senate just voted against that idea. A majority of Senators voted yes to protecting more of our citizens with smarter background checks. But by this continuing distortion of Senate rules, a minority was able to block it from moving forward. <p>Now, I'm going to speak plainly and honestly about what's happened here, because the American people are trying to figure out: How can something have 90 percent support and yet not happen? We had a Democrat and a Republican&mdash;both gun owners, both fierce defenders of our Second Amendment, with A grades from the NRA&mdash;come together and work together to write a commonsense compromise on background checks. And I want to thank Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey for their courage in doing that. That was not easy given their traditional strong support for Second Amendment rights. <p>As they said, nobody could honestly claim that the package they put together infringed on our Second Amendment rights. All it did was extend the same background check rules that already apply to guns purchased from a dealer to guns purchased at gun shows or over the Internet. So 60 percent of guns are already purchased through a background check system; this would have covered a lot of the guns that are currently outside that system. <p>Their legislation showed respect for gun owners, and it showed respect for the victims of gun violence. And Gabby Giffords, by the way, is both; she's a gun owner and a victim of gun violence. She is a Westerner and a moderate. And she supports these background checks. <p>In fact, even the NRA used to support expanded background checks. The current leader of the NRA used to support these background checks. So while this compromise didn't contain everything I wanted or everything that these families wanted, it did represent progress. It represented moderation and common sense. That's why 90 percent of the American people supported it. <p>But instead of supporting this compromise, the gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill. They claimed that it would create some sort of big brother gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite. This legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text. But that didn't matter. <p>And unfortunately, this pattern of spreading untruths about this legislation served a purpose, because those lies upset an intense minority of gun owners, and that in turn intimidated a lot of Senators. And I talked to several of these Senators over the past few weeks, and they're all good people. I know all of them were shocked by tragedies like Newtown. And I also understand that they come from States that are strongly pro-gun. And I have consistently said that there are regional differences when it comes to guns and that both sides have to listen to each other. <p>But the fact is most of these Senators could not offer any good reason why we wouldn't want to make it harder for criminals and those with severe mental illnesses to buy a gun. There were no coherent arguments as to why we wouldn't do this. It came down to politics: the worry that that vocal minority of gun owners would come after them in future elections. They worried that the gun lobby would spend a lot of money and paint them as anti-Second Amendment. <p>And obviously, a lot of Republicans had that fear, but Democrats had that fear too. And so they caved to the pressure, and they started looking for an excuse&mdash;any excuse&mdash;to vote no. <p>One common argument I heard was that this legislation wouldn't prevent all future massacres. And that's true. As I said from the start, no single piece of legislation can stop every act of violence and evil. We learned that tragically just 2 days ago. But if action by Congress could have saved one person, one child, a few hundred, a few thousand, if it could have prevented those people from losing their lives to gun violence in the future while preserving our Second Amendment rights, we had an obligation to try. And this legislation met that test. And too many Senators failed theirs. <p>I've heard some say that blocking this step would be a victory. And my question is, a victory for who? A victory for what? All that happened today was the preservation of the loophole that lets dangerous criminals buy guns without a background check. That didn't make our kids safer. Victory for not doing something that 90 percent of Americans, 80 percent of Republicans, the vast majority of your constituents wanted to get done? It begs the question, who are we here to represent? <p>I've heard folks say that having the families of victims lobby for this legislation was somehow misplaced. \\"A prop,\\" somebody called them. \\"Emotional blackmail,\\" some outlets said. Are they serious? Do we really think that thousands of families whose lives have been shattered by gun violence don't have a right to weigh in on this issue? Do we think their emotions, their loss is not relevant to this debate? So all in all, this was a pretty shameful day for Washington. <p>But this effort is not over. I want to make it clear to the American people: We can still bring about meaningful changes that reduce gun violence, so long as the American people don't give up on it. Even without Congress, my administration will keep doing everything it can to protect more of our communities. We're going to address the barriers that prevent States from participating in the existing background check system. We're going to give law enforcement more information about lost and stolen guns so it can do its job. We're going to help to put in place emergency plans to protect our children in their schools. <p>But we can do more if Congress gets its act together. And if this Congress refuses to listen to the American people and pass commonsense gun legislation, then the real impact is going to have to come from the voters. <p>To all the people who supported this legislation&mdash;law enforcement and responsible gun owners, Democrats and Republicans, urban moms, rural hunters, whoever you are&mdash;you need to let your Representatives in Congress know that you are disappointed and that if they don't act this time, you will remember come election time. <p>To the wide majority of NRA households who supported this legislation, you need to let your leadership and lobbyists in Washington know they didn't represent your views on this one. <p>The point is, those who care deeply about preventing more and more gun violence will have to be as passionate and as organized and as vocal as those who blocked these commonsense steps to help keep our kids safe. Ultimately, you outnumber those who argued the other way. But they're better organized. They're better financed. They've been at it longer. And they make sure to stay focused on this one issue during election time. And that's the reason why you can have something that 90 percent of Americans support and you can't get it through the Senate or the House of Representatives. <p>So to change Washington, you, the American people, are going to have to sustain some passion about this. And when necessary, you've got to send the right people to Washington. And that requires strength, and it requires persistence. <p>And that's the one thing that these families should have inspired in all of us. I still don't know how they have been able to muster up the strength to do what they've doing over the last several weeks, last several months. <p>And I see this as just round one. When Newtown happened, I met with these families and I spoke to the community, and I said, something must be different right now. We're going to have to change. That's what the whole country said. Everybody talked about how we were going to change something to make sure this didn't happen again, just like everybody talked about how we needed to do something after Aurora. Everybody talked about, we needed to change something after Tucson. <p>And I'm assuming that the emotions that we've all felt since Newtown, the emotions that we've all felt since Tucson and Aurora and Chicago&mdash;the pain we share with these families and families all across the country who've lost a loved one to gun violence&mdash;I'm assuming that's not a temporary thing. I'm assuming our expressions of grief and our commitment to do something different&mdash;to prevent these things from happening&mdash;are not empty words. <p>I believe we're going to be able to get this done. Sooner or later, we are going to get this right. The memories of these children demand it. And so do the American people. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"80" "\"Thank you, everybody. Well, listen, we just had a wonderful interfaith service, and I want to thank Governor Patrick for helping to organize that. I want to thank both the Governor and your extraordinary mayor, Tom Menino, for the incredible leadership and cool under pressure, the organization, the mobilization, and the courage that they have shown, reflective of this great city and reflective of this great Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <p>Now, I'm not going to speak long. I just&mdash;he started calling me Reverend Obama, so I know&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I know I was&mdash;I don't want to go on any longer than I need to. The main message, in addition to just giving&mdash;having a chance to shake some hands and give some hugs, is just to say how proud the whole country is of you, how grateful we are that in the face of chaos and to tragedy, all of you displayed the very best of the American spirit. <p>You displayed grit. You displayed compassion. You displayed civic duty. You displayed courage. And when we see that kind of spirit, there's something about that that's infectious. It makes us all want to be better people. You've inspired the entire country. You've inspired the world. And for that, you should be profoundly proud. <p>But as Deval and I were talking as we were driving in from the airport, the key is that we hang on to a little bit of that, because it's right there under the surface every day. And it expresses itself obviously in the Marathon. It expresses itself in Patriot's Day. It expresses itself in all the small interactions, the gestures of kindness and generosity and tolerance and compassion that make up the fabric of our lives. And we don't always pay attention to it, and we don't always celebrate it, and it's certainly not usually on a television screen; it's not always reported on. But that's who we are. <p>And if there's anything that was a theme in that interfaith service, it's that out of these ashes, to out of the blood that's spilled and the injuries borne, out of that, we get a chance to see and highlight and appreciate that spirit. And we've got to sustain it, because in all of our lives at some point, there are going to be some troubles, and there's evil in the world, and there's hardship. But if that spirit is evident and manifest, and that's what we're teaching our kids and that's what we're embodying in our own lives, then who can stop us? Who can touch us? <p>So thank you, everybody. I'm proud of you. I'm proud of Boston. And I just said, I'm looking forward to the 118th Boston Marathon. God bless you.\" "
"81" "\"Thank you. Please. Hello, Boston. <p>Scripture tells us to \\"run with endurance the race that is set before us.\\" Run with endurance the race that is set before us. <p>On Monday morning, the Sun rose over Boston. The sunlight glistened off the Statehouse dome. In the Common and the Public Garden, spring was in bloom. On this Patriot's Day, like so many before, fans jumped onto the \\"T\\" to see the Sox at Fenway. In Hopkinton, runners laced up their shoes and set out on a 26.2-mile test of dedication and grit and the human spirit. And across this city, hundreds of thousands of Bostonians lined the streets: to hand the runners cups of water and to cheer them on. <p>It was a beautiful day to be in Boston, a day that explains why a poet once wrote that this town is not just a capital, not just a place. Boston, he said, \\"is the perfect state of grace.\\" <p>And then, in an instant, the day's beauty was shattered. A celebration became a tragedy. And so we come together to pray and mourn and measure our loss. But we also come together today to reclaim that state of grace: to reaffirm that the spirit of this city is undaunted and the spirit of this country shall remain undimmed. <p>To Governor Patrick; Mayor Menino; Cardinal O'Malley and all the faith leaders who are here; Governors Romney, Swift, Weld, and Dukakis; Members of Congress; and most of all, the people of Boston and the families who've lost a piece of your heart: We thank you for your leadership. We thank you for your courage. We thank you for your grace. <p>I'm here today on behalf of the American people with a simple message: Every one of us has been touched by this attack on your beloved city. Every one of us stands with you. <p>Because, after all, it's our beloved city too. Boston may be your hometown, but we claim it too. It's one of America's iconic cities. It's one of the world's great cities. And one of the reasons the world knows Boston so well is that Boston opens its heart to the world. <p>Over successive generations, you've welcomed again and again new arrivals to our shores, immigrants who constantly reinvigorated this city and this Commonwealth and our Nation. Every fall, you welcome students from all across America and all across the globe, and every spring you graduate them back into the world, a Boston diaspora that excels in every field of human endeavor. Year after year, you welcome the greatest talents in the arts and science, research; you welcome them to your concert halls and your hospitals and your laboratories to exchange ideas and insights that draw this world together. <p>And every third Monday in April, you welcome people from all around the world to the \\"Hub\\" for friendship and fellowship and healthy competition: a gathering of men and women of every race and every religion, every shape and every size; a multitude represented by all those flags that flew over the finish line. <p>So whether folks come here to Boston for just a day or they stay here for years, they leave with a piece of this town tucked firmly into their hearts. So Boston is your hometown, but we claim it a little bit too. <p>I know this because there's a piece of Boston in me. You welcomed me as a young law student across the river, welcomed Michelle too. You welcomed me during a convention when I was still a State senator and very few people could pronounce my name right. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Like you, Michelle and I have walked these streets. Like you, we know these neighborhoods. And like you, in this moment of grief, we join you in saying, \\"Boston, you're my home.\\" For millions of us, what happened on Monday is personal. It's personal. <p>Today our prayers are with the Campbell family of Medford. They're here today. Their daughter Krystle was always smiling. Those who knew her said that with her red hair and her freckles and her ever-eager willingness to speak her mind, she was beautiful, sometimes she could be a little noisy, and everybody loved her for it. She would have turned 30 next month. As her mother said through her tears, \\"This doesn't make any sense.\\" <p>Our prayers are with the Lu family of China, who sent their daughter Lingzi to BU so that she could experience all this city has to offer. She was a 23-year-old student, far from home. And in the heartache of her family and friends on both sides of a great ocean, we're reminded of the humanity that we all share. <p>Our prayers are with the Richard family of Dorchester: to Denise and their young daughter Jane as they fight to recover. And our hearts are broken for 8-year-old Martin, with his big smile and bright eyes. His last hours were as perfect as an 8-year-old boy could hope for: with his family, eating ice cream at a sporting event. And we're left with two enduring images of this little boy, forever smiling for his beloved Bruins and forever expressing a wish he made on a blue poster board: \\"No more hurting people. Peace.\\" No more hurting people. Peace. <p>Our prayers are with the injured, so many wounded, some gravely. From their beds, some are surely watching us gather here today. And if you are, know this: As you begin this long journey of recovery, your city is with you. Your Commonwealth is with you. Your country is with you. We will all be with you as you learn to stand and walk and, yes, run again. Of that I have no doubt. You will run again. [<i>Applause</i>] You will run again. <p>Because that's what the people of Boston are made of. Your resolve is the greatest rebuke to whoever committed this heinous act. If they sought to intimidate us, to terrorize us, to shake us from those values that Deval described, the values that make us who we are, as Americans, well, it should be pretty clear by now that they picked the wrong city to do it. Not here in Boston. [<i>Applause</i>] Not here in Boston. <p>You've shown us, Boston, that in the face of evil, Americans will lift up what's good. In the face of cruelty, we will choose compassion. In the face of those who would visit death upon innocents, we will choose to save and to comfort and to heal. We'll choose friendship. We'll choose love. <p>The Scripture teaches us, \\"God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.\\" And that's the spirit you've displayed in recent days. <p>When doctors and nurses, police and firefighters, and EMTs and guardsmen run towards explosions to treat the wounded, that's discipline. <p>When exhausted runners, including our troops and veterans, who never expected to see such carnage on the streets back home, become first responders themselves, tending to the injured, that's real power. <p>When Bostonians carry victims in their arms, deliver water and blankets, line up to give blood, open their homes to total strangers, give them rides back to reunite with their families, that's love. <p>That's the message we send to those who carried this out and anyone who would do harm to our people. Yes, we will find you. And yes, you will face justice. We will find you. We will hold you accountable. But more than that, our fidelity to our way of life&mdash;for a free and open society&mdash;will only grow stronger. For God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but one of power and love and self-discipline. <p>Like Bill Iffrig, 78 years old, the runner in the orange tank top who we all saw get knocked down by the blast, we may be momentarily knocked off our feet, but we'll pick ourselves up. We'll keep going. We will finish the race. In the words of Dick Hoyt, who's pushed his disabled son Rick in 31 Boston Marathons, \\"We can't let something like this stop us.\\" This doesn't stop us. <p>And that's what you've taught us, Boston. That's what you've reminded us: to push on, to persevere, to not grow weary, to not get faint. Even when it hurts, even when our heart aches, we summon the strength that maybe we didn't even know we had, and we carry on. We finish the race. [<i>Applause</i>] We finish the race. <p>And we do that because of who we are. And we do that because we know that somewhere around the bend, a stranger has a cup of water. Around the bend, somebody is there to boost our spirits. On that toughest mile, just when we think that we've hit a wall, someone will be there to cheer us on and pick us up if we fall. We know that. <p>And that's what the perpetrators of such senseless violence&mdash;these small, stunted individuals who would destroy instead of build and think somehow that makes them important&mdash;that's what they don't understand. Our faith in each other, our love for each other, our love for country, our common creed that cuts across whatever superficial differences there may be&mdash;that is our power. That's our strength. <p>That's why a bomb can't beat us. That's why we don't hunker down. That's why we don't cower in fear. We carry on. We race. We strive. We build, and we work, and we love. And we raise our kids to do the same. And we come together to celebrate life and to walk our cities, and to cheer for our teams. When the Sox and Celtics and Patriots or Bruins are champions again&mdash;to the chagrin of New York and Chicago fans&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;the crowds will gather and watch a parade go down Boylston Street. <p>And this time next year, on the third Monday in April, the world will return to this great American city to run harder than ever and to cheer even louder, for the 118th Boston Marathon. Bet on it. <p>Tomorrow the Sun will rise over Boston. Tomorrow the Sun will rise over this country that we love: this special place, this state of grace. <p>Scripture tells us to \\"run with endurance the race that is set before us.\\" As we do, may God hold close those who've been taken from us too soon. May He comfort their families. And may He continue to watch over these United States of America.\" "
"82" "\"Good evening, everybody. Tonight our Nation is in debt to the people of Boston and the people of Massachusetts. After a vicious attack on their city, Bostonians responded with resolve and determination. They did their part as citizens and partners in this investigation. <p>Boston police and State police and local police across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts responded with professionalism and bravery over 5 long days. And tonight, because of their determined efforts, we've closed an important chapter in this tragedy. <p>I've been briefed earlier this evening by FBI Director Mueller. After the attacks on Monday, I directed the full resources of the Federal Government to be made available to help State and local authorities in the investigation and to increase security as needed. And over the past week, close coordination among Federal, State, and local officials&mdash;sharing information, moving swiftly to track down leads&mdash;has been critical to this effort. <p>They all worked as they should, as a team. And we are extremely grateful for that. We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to all our outstanding law enforcement professionals. These men and women get up every day, they put on that uniform, they risk their lives to keep us safe, and as this week showed, they don't always know what to expect. So our thoughts are with those who were wounded in pursuit of the suspects, and we pray for their full recovery. <p>We also send our prayers to the Collier family who grieve the loss of their son and brother, Sean. \\"He was born to be a police officer,\\" said his chief at MIT. He was just 26 years old. And as his family has said, he died bravely in the line of duty and doing what he committed his life to doing: serving and protecting others. So we're grateful to him. <p>Obviously, tonight there are still many unanswered questions. Among them, why did young men who grew up and studied here, as part of our communities and our country, resort to such violence? How did they plan and carry out these attacks? And did they receive any help? The families of those killed so senselessly deserve answers. The wounded&mdash;some of whom now have to learn how to stand and walk and live again&mdash;deserve answers. <p>And so I've instructed the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security and our intelligence community to continue to deploy all the necessary resources to support the investigation, to collect intelligence, and to protect our citizens. We will determine what happened. We will investigate any associations that these terrorists may have had. And we'll continue to do whatever we have to do to keep our people safe. <p>One thing we do know is that whatever hateful agenda drove young these men to such heinous acts will not&mdash;cannot&mdash;prevail. Whatever they thought they could ultimately achieve, they've already failed. They failed because the people of Boston refuse to be intimidated. They failed because, as Americans, we refuse to be terrorized. They failed because we will not waver from the character and the compassion and the values that define us as a country. Nor will we break the bonds that hold us together as Americans. <p>That American spirit includes staying true to the unity and diversity that makes us strong, like no other nation in the world. In this age of instant reporting and tweets and blogs, there's a temptation to latch on to any bit of information, sometimes to jump to conclusions. But when a tragedy like this happens, with public safety at risk and the stakes so high, it's important that we do this right. That's why we have investigations. That's why we relentlessly gather the facts. That's why we have courts. And that's why we take care not to rush to judgment, not about the motivations of these individuals, certainly not about entire groups of people. <p>After all, one of the things that makes America the greatest nation on Earth&mdash;but also one of the things that makes Boston such a great city&mdash;is that we welcome people from all around the world: people of every faith, every ethnicity, from every corner of the globe. So as we continue to learn more about why and how this tragedy happened, let's make sure that we sustain that spirit. <p>Tonight we think of all the wounded, still struggling to recover. Certainly, we think of Krystle Campbell. We think of Lingzi Lu. We think of little Martin Richard. Their lives reflected all the diversity and beauty of our country, and they were sharing the great American experience together. <p><i>Explosion at the West Fertilizer Company Plant in West, Texas </i><p>Finally, let me say that even as so much attention has been focused on the tragic events in Boston, understandably, we've also seen a tight-knit community in Texas devastated by a terrible explosion. And I want them to know that they are not forgotten. Our thoughts, our prayers are with the people of West, Texas, where so many good people lost their lives, some lost their homes, many are injured, many are still missing. <p>I've talked to Governor Perry and Mayor Muska, and I've pledged that the people of West will have the resources that they need to recover and rebuild. And I want everybody in Texas to know that we will follow through with those commitments. <p>All in all, this has been a tough week. But we've seen the character of our country once more. And as President, I'm confident that we have the courage and the resilience and the spirit to overcome these challenges and to go forward, as one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"83" "\"On Monday, an act of terror wounded dozens and killed three innocent people at the Boston Marathon. But in the days since, the world has witnessed one sure and steadfast truth: Americans refuse to be terrorized. <p>Ultimately, that's what we'll remember from this week. That's what will remain: the stories of heroism and kindness, resolve and resilience, generosity and love. The brave first responders&mdash;police officers and firefighters, EMTs, and National Guard&mdash;who ran toward danger to help their fellow citizens. The race volunteers, spectators, and exhausted runners who rushed to help, including troops and veterans who never expected to see such scenes on the streets of America. <p>The determined doctors and nurses at some of the world's best hospitals, who have toiled day and night to save so many lives. The big-hearted people of Boston&mdash;residents, priests, shopkeepers&mdash;who carried victims in their arms, delivered water and blankets, lined up to give blood, opened their homes up to total strangers. <p>And the heroic Federal agents and police officers who worked together throughout the week, often at great risk to themselves, to keep our communities safe. As a country, we are eternally grateful for the profound sacrifices they make in the line of duty, sometimes making the ultimate sacrifice to defend the people they've sworn to protect. <p>If anyone wants to know who we are, what America is, how we respond to evil and terror, that's it: selflessly, compassionately, and unafraid. <p>Through the days that would test even the sturdiest of souls, Boston's spirit remains undaunted. America's spirit remains undimmed. Our faith in each other, our love for this country, our common creed that cuts across whatever superficial differences we may have, that's what makes us strong. That's why we endure. <p>In the days to come, we will remain vigilant as a nation. And I have no doubt the city of Boston and its surrounding communities will continue to respond in the same proud and heroic way that they have thus far, and their fellow Americans will be right there with them every step of the way. May God bless the people of Boston and the United States of America.\" "
"84" "\"Thank you, everybody. Please have a seat. Have a seat. Well, good afternoon, everybody. And welcome to the White House science fair, one of my favorite events during the course of the year. <p>And I just had a chance to see some of the outstanding exhibits that have been put forward by some of these amazing young people. And let me just start by saying, in my official capacity as President: This stuff is really cool. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I want to thank these incredible young people for explaining to me what the heck is going on. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Every one of you is enormously talented, obviously, but there's also a community of people who helped all these young people succeed: dedicated teachers who believed in them and challenged them to do even more; all of them have loving parents and mentors and family. So I want to not only give the young people a big round of applause, but all the parents and teachers and principals and everybody who was involved, give yourselves a big round of applause as well. <p>Of course, primarily, we're here to celebrate these young scientists and visionaries who dream and create and innovate, who ask the question, why not? Why not try something better, something that's faster, something that helps more people? And that drive, that refusal to give up, that focus on the future is part of what makes America great. And all of you are participants in this long line of inventors and creators that have made this the most dynamic economy and the most dynamic country on Earth. <p>And that's one of the things that I've been focused on as President, is how do we create an all-hands-on-deck approach to science, technology, engineering, and math. And I'm happy to have so many key members of my science team who are here today, including my Chief Science Adviser, John Holdren, who is here. There's John. NIH Director Francis Collins. There's Francis right there, the tall guy. We've got Acting Director of the National Science Foundation Cora Marrett, who is here. There's Cora. And we've got real-life astronaut and NASA Administrator Charles Bolden. Where's Charlie? There he is, right there. <p>So we need to make this a priority: to train an army of new teachers in these subject areas and to make sure that all of us as a country are lifting up these subjects for the respect that they deserve. And one of the things I'm concerned about is that, as a culture, we're great consumers of technology, but we're not always properly respecting the people who are in the labs and behind the scenes creating the stuff that we now take for granted. And we've got to give the millions of Americans who work in science and technology not only the kind of respect they deserve, but also new ways to engage young people. <p>So today I'm proud to announce a new AmeriCorps program that are going to&mdash;&mdash; <p>[<i>At this point, an audience member applauded.</i>] <p>That's our Community Service Director, so&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;she is a little bit biased, but I like that in her. She's got that kind of get-up-and-go. A new AmeriCorps program that's going to connect more professional scientists and engineers to young students who might follow in their footsteps. <p>And other people are stepping up too. Some of America's biggest tech companies are encouraging their workers to mentor young students. You've got media organizations that are working with athletes, like outstanding wide receiver Victor Cruz from the New York Giants, who's here to highlight how critical math and science are to sports. And by the way, since Victor is here, I don't know, did you see the exhibit about the whole cooling shoulder pads and helmet that these young guys did? And they had a whole slogan that said you can succeed in athletics and science. They were very impressive. Had the little Gatorade coming in so you&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;you didn't even have to, like, reach for your Gatorade; you could just&mdash;it would automatically transmit itself into your helmet. [<i>Laughter</i>] It could work. <p>We've got nonprofits that are helping to organize 1,000 summer learning events this year. They all realize how important science, technology, engineering, and math are to the future. So we are doing this together. <p>And after all, the science fair projects of today could become the products and businesses of tomorrow. Three students&mdash;Evan Jackson, Alec Jackson, Caleb Robinson&mdash;those are the folks that I talked about. They're from Flippen Elementary School. Keep in mind, they're in third, fourth grade, and they've already got this idea for cool pads so that Victor doesn't get overheated when he's out on the field. But think about that. If you're inventing stuff in the third grade, what are you going to do by the time you get to college? [<i>Laughter</i>] And we just had the University of Alabama's national championship football team here last week, and I know they're interested in this idea because it gets really hot down in Alabama. <p>A lot of these students are working on the next generation of medical research. So listen to this story. When pancreatic cancer took the life of Jack Andraka's close family friend, it inspired Jack to look for new ways to improve detection. So Jack requested space from research labs to pursue his work nearly 200 times. Two hundred times he asked; 200 times he was turned down. Finally, with the help of some folks at John Hopkins, he got the research facilities that he needed, developed a pancreatic cancer test that is faster, cheaper, and more sensitive than the test that came before it, which is not bad for a guy who is just barely old enough to drive. So where's Jack? There he is. Jack, stand up, because that's pretty spectacular stuff. That's great work. I don't know what you guys were doing when you were juniors in high school. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's what Jack's doing. [<i>Laughter</i>] Better than I was doing, I promise you. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, today is not just the third White House science fair, it's also the 43d Earth Day. So I want to give a special shout-out to all of the young people who participated who focused their attention on how to harness cleaner forms of energy and how to create more energy efficiency. So we've got young people like Caleb Meyer. Where's Caleb? Caleb's way back there. Stand up, Caleb, so we can see you. Caleb built a wind turbine that's small and fast enough to be installed on your roof or in your front yard. <p>We've got Jon Kubricki and Bridget Zarych, who, together with their classmates, designed an inexpensive press that can recycle garbage like banana peels into briquettes as an alternative to using wood for fuel. They're in eighth grade. I don't know what you were doing in eighth grade. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's what they're doing, which could potentially help to reduce carbon emissions, save trees and deforestation, and reduce the amount of smoke inhalation that has an impact on people. <p>We've got Sara Volz, who is breeding new types of algae. Where's Sara? There's Sara. Sara is breeding new types of algae. She stores this in a lab in her bedroom. [<i>Laughter</i>] So, Sara, you have very supportive parents. [<i>Laughter</i>] One reporter asked her, \\"Exactly what is growing under your bed that's going to save the planet?\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] And Sara's answer was algae that can produce more oil for cheaper biofuels. So by the way, Jon Kubricki and Bridget Zarych, I didn't have them stand up. I want to acknowledge them. I saw them. Maybe they're still cleaning their hands off from&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. But there they are. There they are. <p>So I've got to say, young people like these, every one of them have these kinds of incredible innovations. Some of them are already fully operational. Some of them are getting fine tuned. But young people like these have to make you hopeful about the future of our country. And it's also a reminder for us, the adults, we've got to do our part. We've got to do everything we can to make sure that we are giving these young people opportunity to pursue their studies and discover new ways of doing things. And we've got to make sure that we're also leaving behind a world that is safer and cleaner and healthier than the one we find&mdash;found it. That's our obligation. <p>And that's why, over the last 4 years, we've made historic investments in the clean energy future that we need. And today, we import less oil than we have in 20 years. Thanks to new fuel economy standards, by the middle of the next decade, cars will go twice as far on a gallon of gas. We've doubled the amount of renewable energy that we're generating from sources like wind and solar, and by the way, creating tens of thousands of good, American jobs in the process. We're emitting less carbon pollution into the environment than we have in nearly 20 years. <p>But we understand this is not enough. We've got to do better. And that's why we've got to pursue an all-of-the-above energy strategy that includes investing in more biofuels and more fuel-efficient vehicles and more solar power and more wind power and more people going back to work building cars and homes and businesses that are more energy efficient than the ones that we've got right now. <p>That's why I've proposed new job-creating investments in science and innovation. And all these young people, as young as they are, they're all going to be going to college, and a lot of them are going to want to continue to pursue their research and to pursue their dreams. And if there is not the research grant pipeline in place, many of them will not have the resources to invent and discover the things that will make us healthier and make us more energy efficient and improve the quality of our lives. <p>So this is not the time to gut investments that keep our businesses on the cutting edge, that keep our economy humming, that improve the quality of our lives. This is the time to reach a level of research and development that we haven't seen since the height of the space race. That's what we should be doing. That's what we should be focused on. <p>And that should not be a partisan idea. America has always been about discovery and invention and engineering and science and evidence. That's who we are. That's in our DNA. That's how this country became the greatest economic power in the history of the world. That's how we were able to provide so many contributions to people all around the world with our scientific and medical and technological discoveries. <p>And that's what these young people are&mdash;here are all about. And if extraordinary young people like all of you can use your talents to shape the future for our families and our communities and our countries, we've got a responsibility to make sure that they've got the tools to do it. <p>So I want to thank all the science fair winners, not only for the work that you guys are doing, but also the example that you're setting for your peers and also for your adults, the adults that are in your lives. We could not be prouder of you. And I want you to keep up your incredible work. <p>And part of the reason that we're doing this here, we celebrate our great football players like Victor, and we celebrate outstanding musicians, and that's all appropriate. But we've got to make sure that we're also celebrating every single day in our schools, in our classrooms, and in our country the outstanding contributions that scientists and engineers and mathematicians and engineers are providing to us every single day. And we want you to know that you've got a whole country behind you as you pursue your dreams. And your success is going to be our success as well. So way to go. <p>Thank you. Appreciate it, everybody. Thank you very much.\" "
"85" "\"<i>The President.</i> Well, hello, everybody. Please have a seat. I am thrilled to welcome our State and National Teachers of the Year to the White House this afternoon. <p>Now, if&mdash;people who know me know I've just got a soft spot for teachers, partly&mdash;my sister is a teacher, my mom was a teacher for a while. And if there's one thing we can't say enough to our Nation's educators, it is \\"thank you.\\" So today we've got a chance to do that: to show our extraordinary appreciation for the difference that they make in the lives of our children and the lives of our Nation. <p>Now, before we get started, I've got to recognize another outstanding educator, our Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, who is as passionate about the future of our kids as anybody that I know. And I'd like to acknowledge and applaud the three outstanding principals of the year who are joining us because we know that unless we've got outstanding leadership in our schools, it's very hard for even great teachers to do their job. And so please give them a big round of applause as well. <p>Now, these educators behind me come from all over the country. They represent cities and towns of every shape and size, all types of schools. But the one thing that binds them together is that they are absolutely devoted to nurturing the next generation. They're role models who show our kids how to work hard to reach their potential. They encourage our children's passion. They inspire our children's imaginations. <p>And this year's National Teacher of the Year, Jeff Charbonneau, is from Zillah, Washington. Did I say that right, Jeff? <p><i>Jeff Charbonneau</i>. Charbonneau, so yes. <p><i>The President.</i> Charbonneau. <p><i>Mr. Charbonneau</i>. Charbonneau from Zillah. <p><i>The President.</i> From Zillah. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's why he's a good teacher. [<i>Laughter</i>] As Jeff put it, a teacher's \\"greatest accomplishments are revealed each time a student realizes that he or she has an unlimited potential.\\" And I'll bet any&mdash;everybody here can remember a moment like that, when a teacher helped them find that spark that allowed them to get to where they are today, a teacher who saw something in us that maybe at the time we didn't see in ourselves. <p>Twelve years ago, when Jeff decided to return to his hometown to teach, Zillah High School had no engineering curriculum. The science curriculum was lagging. Kids had to go off campus for technology classes, and the computer resources were frankly pretty poor. <p>But Jeff was determined to turn that around. He wanted to convince kids that something like quantum mechanics wasn't something to run away from, but something to dive into. And he said, \\"It's my job to convince them that they are smart enough, that they can do anything.\\" <p>And now, with Jeff's leadership at his high school, science enrollment is way up. Kids are graduating at college-level science&mdash;with college-level science credits. The school expects to have to hire more teachers now to meet the demand. <p>This kind of transformation is exactly why I've proposed preparing an additional 100,000 math and science teachers across the country over the next decade. And excellent teachers like Jeff could make up part of a master teachers corps, a network of outstanding educators who serve as leaders and mentors for their colleagues in these particular subject areas. <p>But it's not just classroom teaching that distinguishes Jeff. He reinvigorated the school's yearbook. He started an outdoors club. He brought his passion to the drama program. He's even helping out other schools. And because of Jeff, hundreds of thousands&mdash;or hundreds of students all over the State are now participating in high-skills robotics competitions and gaining valuable engineering experience, all in the name of creating what Jeff calls \\"paradise.\\" That's what school is for him, that's what he wants it to be for his students, in their classrooms, but also in their activities and the greater community. <p>And basically, there's nothing that Jeff will not try to give his students the best education in every respect. And by the way, I think it's important for us to acknowledge Jeff's wife and children and mom and dad and brother, all presumably have to put up with him constantly doing all this stuff. [<i>Laughter</i>] And we appreciate them for the great support that they've given him. <p>Now, what's true for Jeff is true for every educator standing behind me. They understand that their job is more than teaching subjects like reading or chemistry. They're not just filling blackboards with numbers and diagrams. In classrooms across America, they're teaching things like character and compassion and resilience and imagination. They're filling young minds with virtues and values and teaching our kids how to cooperate and overcome obstacles. So today we honor the dedicated professionals that help guide that critical development. <p>Any parent knows it's hard to drop your son off or your daughter off at school that first time. In the instant that car door slams or the school bus door shuts, there is a little flutter that goes on. I like quoting somebody who said that being a parent is like having your heart outside your body wandering around. [<i>Laughter</i>] But these teachers, they're the ones that we trust with our kids. They're people who love our kids. <p>A few months ago, we saw the true depths of a teacher's commitment when six educators were killed trying to protect the children they embraced as their own. There was the teacher who locked her first-grade students in a bathroom and whispered, \\"I love you,\\" because, in her words, \\"I wanted that to be the last thing they heard, and not gunfire.\\" The special-education teacher who was found cradling a student in her arms, trying to protect him from the evil that ultimately took them both. <p>In those moments, those brave teachers showed the world what they do is more than just educate kids. They embrace them, and they nurture them, and they love them. And we know that the men and women behind me do the same. <p>These folks did not go into teaching for money. [<i>Laughter</i>] They certainly didn't go into it because of the light hours and the easy work. They walk into the classroom every single day because they love doing what they do, because they're passionate about helping our children realize the best versions of themselves so that our country can become the best version of itself. <p>And I just want to say to all of them, I hope that in some small measure, this award keeps them going. Because I never want our teachers to feel discouraged at a time of budget cuts, at a time when all too often problems in the schools are laid at the feet of teachers; where we expect them to do so much, and sometimes they get so little in return. <p>I want you guys to know that the country appreciates you. The kids appreciate you. Parents appreciate you. What you do matters. It's critical to our success as a country, but most importantly, it's critical to those kids themselves. I cannot think of something more important than reaching that child who, maybe, came in uninspired, and suddenly, you've inspired them. <p>And by the way, I want to mention, I often talk about STEM and math and science; I really do think it's critically important. We've fallen behind on a lot of those subjects. But I don't want to neglect our English teachers and our arts teachers, our music teachers, our history teachers, our social science teachers, because, yes, we want folks inventing things and we need more engineers and scientists and probably fewer lawyers. I can say that as a lawyer. [<i>Laughter</i>] But part of what you're also teaching young people is qualities like compassion and being able to put yourself in somebody else's shoes. And that's what makes our society worth living in as well. <p>So bottom line is, thank you. And the least the rest&mdash;the least that the rest of us can do is to give all of these folks the respect that they've earned, the gratitude we owe them. Teaching is a profession and it should be treated like one. And that means we're going to have to recruit and prepare and reward our next generation of great educators more effectively. Secretary Duncan's been working with folks around the country on a new blueprint for teaching in the 21st century, listening to some of these outstanding teachers and educators and principals so that we can figure out what best practices are out there. <p>Educators like Jeff and everyone up here today, they represent the very best of America: committed professionals who give themselves fully to the growth and development of our kids. And with them at the front of the classroom and leading our schools, I am absolutely confident that our children are going to be prepared to meet the tests of our time and the tests of the future. <p>So we're grateful to all of you. Thanks for helping our kids dream big, hope deeply, and realize a brighter future. So with that, I would now like to present Jeff with his apple. And I want to&mdash;but don't bite into it&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and invite him to say a few words. Give Jeff a big round of applause.\" "
"86" "\"Thank you so much. Well, let me begin by thanking Naomi and Larry for opening up this extraordinary home to all of us. It is wonderful to see them again. And they've been such longtime supporters. They were there back in the day when many of you could not pronounce my name. [<i>Laughter</i>] But they've just been great friends and are active on so many fronts. Obviously, Larry is labor, and Naomi is management&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;as is true in our household as well. [<i>Laughter</i>] But we really appreciate them and their very impressive sons. <p>I also want to acknowledge Henry Munoz who's here and is just doing an outstanding job as our finance chair of the DNC. Where's Henry? There he is. Thank you, Henry. And I understand that the former mayor of this great city, Ron Kirk, is still around. So, everybody, give a big round of applause to Ron. <p>Obviously, this has been a tough couple of weeks for the country. I have spent time in Boston and have been inspired by the incredible resilience of that city in the wake of such a horrific tragedy, had a chance to visit with some of the victims of the explosion and talk to the families of some of the folks who were lost. And then tomorrow I'll be attending a memorial service for the tragedy that took place in West, Texas, and have a chance to visit with some of those families. <p>And there's no words that are satisfactory when you're confronting these kinds of losses. And families cope, they do their best, but obviously, their lives are transformed by this. And so I don't want to pretend that somehow you can put a positive gloss on those kinds of events. On the other hand, what is remarkable is the strength and the courage and the fellowship that you see in people when they're confronted with these kinds of challenges. And in Boston, what you saw was not just the character of an extraordinary American city, but it was also the character of a nation. <p>There is something about tough times that brings out the best in us, and all the petty differences and the divisions of race and class and religion and political persuasion all seem to fade away. And I remember, as I was driving from the airport to the memorial service in Boston, I was with Deval Patrick&mdash;outstanding Governor of Massachusetts and a great friend, who handled the whole situation as well as anybody could&mdash;and we agreed that wouldn't it be something if we could just somehow capture and sustain that spirit beyond tragedy. <p>That's kind of a cliche. We talk about this a lot. We talked about this after 9/11; we talk about it after a natural disaster like Sandy. We're all struck by how we come to each other's aid and these huge waves of empathy come forward and people are willing to do anything for strangers because they understand there but for the grace of God go I. And they also understand that there's something fundamental that binds us together as Americans and that we love this country and this country is simply a collection of incredible people: our fellow citizens. <p>And that idea of citizenship, the idea that we don't just have obligations to ourselves&mdash;we do; we have obligations obviously to our families and our immediate circles. But we have also an obligation to something larger than ourselves; that our orbit of concern extends to a child somewhere in a border town in Texas who is struggling to get a decent education. And it extends to a senior citizen somewhere in Maine that is trying to figure out how they can get enough heating oil to get through a winter and have enough to eat at the same time. And it extends to the young immigrant who just came here and is trying to find their way in California. And it applies to a single mom in New York who is going back and has gotten her education and is looking for some decent daycare. That all of us have a stake in their success, and all of us have a stake in a country that expresses this incredible quality of compassion and concern and fellow feeling not just in our churches or our synagogues or our mosques or our temples, not just in our workplaces or our neighborhoods or our Little League, but also expresses itself through our government. <p>And the reason, I think, all of you are here is because you believe that too. And the Democratic Party at its best tries to give expression to that. The Democratic Party doesn't always get it right, and this is not a feeling that is unique to Democrats. I'm really looking forward to attending the Bush Library opening tomorrow, and one of the things I will insist upon is that whatever our political differences, President Bush loves this country and loves its people and shared that same concern and was concerned about all people in America, not just some, not just those who voted Republican. I think that's true about him, and I think that's true about most of us. <p>But what's also true is that policy matters. How we express that best part of ourselves is a matter of significant debate, and it's a matter of votes, and it's a matter of legislation and budgets and how we're allocating resources and how we're prioritizing what we think is important. And although I couldn't be prouder of the work that we've done over the last 4 years, we all know we've got a lot more work to do on that front. <p>Middle class families all across America are struggling to get by. And things have stabilized since the crisis in 2008, but for a lot of folks, they're still just barely keeping their heads above water. There are millions of kids across this country who are still poorly educated or malnourished or don't have any place to go outside of school. And for them, college is just a distant dream. They can't even imagine the prospect of actually creating a life for themselves that's similar to what they see on television or maybe just walking down the streets of Dallas. It's like looking through a pane of glass. <p>We have made enormous strides when it comes to broadening equality in this country. And I could not be prouder of the work that we've done under my administration to make sure that we have a strong civil rights division, that we ended \\"don't ask, don't tell,\\" that we're championing the rights of the LGBT community, that we're making sure that women are getting paid the same as men for the work that they do. But we all know that in all kinds of interactions, large and small, there are people out there who aren't getting a fair shot, still aren't getting a fair deal, still aren't being treated the way we would want ourselves to be treated. And government has something to say about that. <p>We have enormous challenges like climate change that are easy to ignore in the short term, and yet I think most of us here want to make sure that the next generation is bequeathed the same incredible bounty, this amazing land of ours, that we inherited from our parents and our grandparents. <p>So we've got a lot of work to do. And unfortunately, right now Washington is not&mdash;how do I put this charitably? [<i>Laughter</i>] It's not as functional as it should be. It could do better. And when you think about the work that we've been able to do over the last 4, 4&frac12; years, some of it, happily, has been bipartisan. There have been times where we've been able to tackle issues together. And particularly when it comes to national security and keeping America safe, I think that there's been some convergence among Democrats and Republicans that we have to act wisely overseas and we've got to make sure that we're supporting our troops when they come home and we've got to take every step that we can to guard against terrorist acts, but we've also got to do so consistent with our Constitution and rule of law. <p>But when it comes to domestic policy, when it comes to budgets, when it comes to action that is translating into real change for people day to day, the fact of the matter is, is that when Democrats were in charge of the House, we were able to make sure that 30 million people get health care and that people who have health care have the kinds of protections they need from insurance company abuse and are getting the kind of preventive care that's going to drive our health care costs down over the long term. <p>The fact of the matter is, is that when Democrats were in charge we were able to rein in some of the excesses of Wall Street in a way that assures long-term stability in the financial system and makes it a lot less likely that we end up seeing the kinds of taxpayer bailouts that not only weren't fair, but aren't good for our economy. The fact is, is that when Democrats were in charge, that's when we were able to make sure that we got \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" ended. And so who's setting the agenda and who's running the show in Congress makes a difference. <p>And I'm going to spend the next year and a half doing everything I can to try to bring the parties together around some basic, smart, commonsense agendas that in past years haven't even been particularly partisan: making sure that we're balancing our budget or making sure that we're bringing down our deficits and managing our budgets in a way that doesn't just load up the entire burden on seniors or students or the poor, but asks a little bit from everybody. <p>And making sure that we can still invest in things like early childhood education and making sure that we're investing in research and science so that we can continue to maintain our cutting edge internationally, rebuilding our infrastructure so that we continue to have the best infrastructure in the world&mdash;these are not things that, in the past at least, have been Democrat and Republican. <p>I come from the \\"Land of Lincoln,\\" and it turns out that was the first Republican President's agenda as well. He wanted to build railroads and locks and dams, and he started the National Foundation for Science and started land-grant colleges because he understood that we have a free market and the genius of America is unleashing the capacities of our people. But he also understood that there's a role for Government to play to make sure that everybody is getting a fair shot, to make sure that there are ladders of opportunity, to make sure that everybody can realize their full potential. <p>So these aren't Democratic ideas, these are American ideas. Unfortunately, they've gotten caught up in some partisan politics. And we're going to do everything we can over the next year and a half to break through that. <p>So occasionally, I may make some of you angry because I am going to reach out to Republicans. I'm going to keep on doing it. Even if some of you guys think I'm a sap, I will keep on doing it&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;because I think that's what the country needs. But what I also believe in is that when Democrats have the opportunity to set the agenda, then we don't have a country where just a few are doing really, really well; we've got a country where potentially everybody has a chance to do well if they're willing to work hard and if they're willing to take responsibility. <p>That's what we're fighting for. That's why you're here. And I hope that all of you recognize that despite the fact that I've got a lot of gray hair and I don't look exactly like I did the first time I came to Dallas as a potential Senate candidate, the same passion and the same values that motivated me then are the values that motivate me now and that we win elections to give us the possibility of actually getting stuff done on behalf of the American people. We don't win elections just to have a party on Inauguration day, and we don't win elections just so we've got a title on our door, and we don't win elections just because it's sport. We win elections so that we have the possibility of delivering for the American people. And delivering means sustained work after the election. <p>So I can't do that by myself. I can only do it with you. And as Larry helpfully reminded me, I understand that Texas is a so-called red State, but you've got 10 million Democrats here in Texas. And beyond the fact that there are a whole lot of Democrats in Texas, there are a whole lot of people here in Texas who need us and who need us to fight for them. And I don't know about you, but I intend to fight for them as long as I have the honor of holding this office and probably a little bit after that as well. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"87" "\"Thank you. Please be seated. To President Bush and Mrs. Bush; to President Clinton and now former Secretary Clinton; to President George H.W. Bush and Mrs. Bush; to President and Mrs. Carter; to current and former world leaders and all the distinguished guests here today: Michelle and I are honored to be with you to mark this historic occasion. <p>This is a Texas-sized party. And that's worthy of what we're here to do today: honor the life and legacy of the 43d President of the United States, George W. Bush. <p>When all the living former Presidents are together, it's also a special day for our democracy. We've been called \\"the world's most exclusive club,\\" and we do have a pretty nice clubhouse. But the truth is, our club is more like a support group. The last time we all got together was just before I took office. And I needed that. Because as each of these leaders will tell you, no matter how much you may think you're ready to assume the office of the Presidency, it's impossible to truly understand the nature of the job until it's yours, until you're sitting at that desk. <p>And that's why every President gains a greater appreciation for all those who served before him, for the leaders from both parties who have taken on the momentous challenges and felt the enormous weight of a nation on their shoulders. And for me, that appreciation very much extends to President Bush. <p>The first thing I found in that desk the day I took office was a letter from George and one that demonstrated his compassion and generosity. For he knew that I would come to learn what he had learned: that being President, above all, is a humbling job. There are moments where you make mistakes. There are times where you wish you could turn back the clock. And what I know is true about President Bush, and I hope my successor will say about me, is that we love this country and we do our best. <p>Now, in the past, President Bush has said it's impossible to pass judgment on his Presidency while he's still alive. So maybe this is a little bit premature. But even now there are certain things that we know for certain. <p>We know about the son who was raised by two strong, loving parents in Midland, famously inheriting, as he says, \\"my daddy's eyes and my mother's mouth.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] The young boy who once came home after a trip to a museum and proudly presented his horrified mother with a small dinosaur tailbone he had smuggled home in his pocket. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'll bet that went over great with Barbara. <p>We know about the young man who met the love of his life at a dinner party, ditching his plans to go to bed early and instead talking with the brilliant and charming Laura Welch late into the night. <p>We know about the father who raised two remarkable, caring, beautiful daughters, even after they tried to discourage him from running for President, saying, \\"Dad, you're not as cool as you think you are.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Mr. President, I can relate. [<i>Laughter</i>] And now we see President Bush the grandfather, just beginning to spoil his brand-new granddaughter. <p>So we know President Bush the man. And what President Clinton said is absolutely true: To know the man is to like the man, because he's comfortable in his own skin. He knows who he is. He doesn't put on any pretenses. He takes his job seriously, but he doesn't take himself too seriously. He is a good man. <p>But we also know something about George Bush the leader. As we walk through this library, obviously, we're reminded of the incredible strength and resolve that came through that bullhorn as he stood amid the rubble and the ruins of Ground Zero, promising to deliver justice to those who had sought to destroy our way of life. <p>We remember the compassion that he showed by leading the global fight against HIV/AIDS and malaria, helping to save millions of lives, and reminding people in some of the poorest corners of the globe that America cares and that we're here to help. <p>We remember his commitment to reaching across the aisle to unlikely allies like Ted Kennedy, because he believed that we had to reform our schools in ways that help every child learn, not just some; that we have to repair a broken immigration system; and that this progress is only possible when we do it together. <p>Seven years ago, President Bush restarted an important conversation by speaking with the American people about our history as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. And even though comprehensive immigration reform has taken a little longer than any of us expected, I am hopeful that this year, with the help of Speaker Boehner and some of the Senators and Members of Congress who are here today, that we bring it home for our families and our economy and our security and for this incredible country that we love. And if we do that, it will be in large part thanks to the hard work of President George W. Bush. <p>And finally, a President bears no greater decision and no more solemn burden than serving as Commander in Chief of the greatest military that the world has ever known. As President Bush himself has said, \\"America must and will keep its word to the men and women who have given us so much.\\" So even as we Americans may at times disagree on matters of foreign policy, we share a profound respect and reverence for the men and women of our military and their families. And we are united in our determination to comfort the families of the fallen and to care for those who wear the uniform of the United States. <p>On the flight back from Russia, after negotiating with Nikita Khrushchev at the height of the Cold War, President Kennedy's secretary found a small slip of paper on which the President had written a favorite saying: \\"I know there is a God. And I see a storm coming. If he has a place for me, I believe I am ready.\\" <p>No one can be completely ready for this office. But America needs leaders who are willing to face the storm head on, even as they pray for God's strength and wisdom so that they can do what they believe is right. And that's what the leaders with whom I share this stage have all done. That's what President George W. Bush chose to do. That's why I'm honored to be part of today's celebration. <p>Mr. President, for your service, for your courage, for your sense of humor, and most of all, for your love of country, thank you very much. From all the citizens of the United States of America, God bless you. And God bless these United States.\" "
"88" "\"Please. Thank you, Senator Cornyn, Governor Perry, President Starr, gathered dignitaries, the community of Baylor and Waco, most of all, the family and the friends and neighbors of West, Texas. <p>I cannot match the power of the voices you just heard on that video. And no words adequately describe the courage that was displayed on that deadly night. What I can do is offer the love and support and prayers of the Nation. <p>The Book of Psalms tells us: \\"For you, O God, have tested us; you have tried us. We went through fire and through water; yet you have brought us out to a place of abundance.\\" We went through fire and through water; yet you have brought us out to a place of abundance. <p>For this State, for our country, these have been trying and difficult days. We gather here in Texas to mourn brave men who went through fire and all those who have been taken from us. We remain mindful of our fellow Americans in flooded States to the north who endure the high waters. We pray for those in Boston who have been tested and the wounded whose greatest tests still lie ahead. <p>But know this: While the eyes of the world may have been fixed on places far away, our hearts have also been here, in your time of tribulation. And even amidst such sorrow and so much pain, we recognize God's abundance. We give thanks for the courage and the compassion and the incredible grace of the people of West. <p>We're grateful for Mayor Muska and Mayor Duncan and all those who have shown such leadership during this tragedy. And to the families and neighbors grappling with unbearable loss, we are here to say, you are not alone, you are not forgotten. We may not all live here in Texas, but we're neighbors too. We're Americans too, and we stand with you, and we do not forget. And we'll be there even after the cameras leave and after the attention turns elsewhere. Your country will remain ever ready to help you recover and rebuild and reclaim your community. <p>Now, until last week, I think it's fair to say that few outside this State had ever heard of West. And I suspect that's the way most people in West like it. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, it is true that weary travelers&mdash;and now the wider world&mdash;know they can rely on the Czech Stop for a brief respite in the middle of a long stretch of highway. I want to say, by the way, all the Presidents&mdash;former Presidents in Dallas send their thoughts and prayers, and George W. and Laura Bush spoke longingly about the kolaches&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and the even better company, as they've driven through West. And what they understood, and what all of you understand, is what makes West special is not the attention coming from far-flung places. What makes West special, what puts it on the map is what makes it familiar: the people who live there, neighbors you can count on, places that haven't changed, things that are solid and true and lasting. <p>Most of the people in West know everybody in West. Many of you are probably descended from some of those first settlers: hardy immigrants who crossed an ocean and kept on going. So for you, there's no such thing as a stranger. When someone is in need, you reach out to them, and you support them; you do what it takes to help them carry on. <p>That's what happened last Wednesday, when a fire alarm sounded across a quiet Texas evening. As we've heard, the call went out to volunteers&mdash;not professionals&mdash;people who just love to serve. People who want to help their neighbors. A call went out to farmers and car salesmen and welders and funeral home directors, the city secretary, and the mayor. It went out to folks who are tough enough and selfless enough to put in a full day's work and then be ready for more. <p>And together, you answered the call. You dropped your schoolwork, left your families, jumped in firetrucks and rushed to the flames. And when you got to the scene, you forgot fear, and you fought that blaze as hard as you could, knowing the danger, buying time so others could escape. And then, about 20 minutes after the first alarm, the Earth shook, and the sky went dark, and West changed forever. <p>Today our prayers are with the families of all who we've lost: the proud sons and daughters of West whose memories will live on in our hearts, parents who loved their kids, and leaders who served their communities. They were young and old, from different backgrounds and different walks of life. A few were just going about their business. But an awful lot ran towards the scene of disaster trying to help. One was described as the kind of guy whose phone was always ringing with folks in need of help, help he always provided. That's just who these folks were. <p>Our thoughts are with those who face a long road: the wounded, the heartbroken, families who lost their homes and possessions in an instant. They're going to need their friends in West, but they're also going to need their friends in Texas and their friends all across this country. They'll still need you to answer that call. They will still need those things that are lasting and true. For as Scripture teaches us, \\"a friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.\\" <p>To the people of West, just as we've seen the love you share in better times, as friends and brothers and sisters, these hard days have shown your ability to stand tall in times of unimaginable adversity. <p>You saw it in leaders like Mayor Muska, who lost close friends. And you saw it in the hospital staff who spent the night treating people that they knew, toiling through their tears as they did what had to be done. We saw it in the folks who helped evacuate an entire nursing home, including one man who drove an elderly resident to safety and then came back to do it again, twice. We saw it in the people so generous that when the Red Cross set up a shelter for folks who couldn't go back to their homes, not that many people showed up, because most had already been offered a place to stay with their friends and family and neighbors. <p>Complete strangers drove from hundreds of miles to donate supplies. Firefighters from surrounding communities manned the stations so surviving volunteers could recover from their wounds. Right here at Baylor, students stood in line for hours to give blood. And a nearby school district opened its doors to the students who can't go back to their classrooms, putting welcome signs on lockers and in the hallways. <p>So that's the thing about this tragedy. This small town's family is bigger now. It extends beyond the boundaries of West. And in the days ahead, this love and support will be more important than ever, because there will be moments of doubt and pain and the temptation to wonder how this community will ever fully recover. Families who have lost such remarkable men of the sort that we saw in that video, there are going to be times where they simply don't understand how this could have happened. <p>But today I see in the people of West, in your eyes, that what makes West special isn't going to go away. And instead of changing who you are, this tragedy has simply revealed who you've always been. <p>It's the courage of Deborah Sulak, who works as a cashier just around the corner from the fire station. She said: \\"It's going to be tough for the families. But we're going to rebound because we're fighters.\\" And that courage will bring West back. <p>It's the love of Carla Ruiz, who used to live in West, but now lives in Austin. And last week, she drove all the way back. \\"I had to be here,\\" she said. \\"You have to be here for family.\\" That love will keep West going. <p>It's the faith of someone like Pastor John Crowder that will sustain the good people of West for as long as it takes. His church was damaged in the explosion. So on Sunday, the congregation assembled outside. \\"What happened Wednesday was awful,\\" he told them, \\"but God is bigger than all of this.\\" God is bigger than all of this, and He is here with you in West. He is bigger than all of this, and He is here with you. <p>Going forward, it's not just your town that needs your courage and your love and your faith. America does too. We need towns where if you don't know what your kids are up to, then chances are your neighbors do too, and they'll tell on those kids in a second. [<i>Laughter</i>] America needs towns that holds fundraisers to help folks pay the medical bills and then take the time to drop off a home-cooked meal, because they know a family is under stress. America needs communities where there's always somebody to call if your car gets stuck or your house gets flooded. We need people who so love their neighbors as themselves that they're willing to lay down their lives for them. <p>America needs towns like West. That's what makes this country great, is towns like West. \\"For you, O God, have tested us; you have tried us. We went through fire and through water; yet you have brought us out to a place of abundance.\\" <p>You have been tested, West. You have been tried. You have gone through fire. But you are and always will be surrounded by an abundance of love. You saw it in the voices on those videos. You see it in the firefighters and first responders who are here. All across America, people are praying for you and thinking of you. And when they see the faces of those families, they understand that these are not strangers, these are neighbors. And that's why we know that we will get through this. <p>God bless West. May God grant His peace on those that we've lost, His comfort on their families. May He continue to bless this great State of Texas, and may He continue to bless these United States of America.\" "
"89" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! Thank you. Thank you! All right, everybody, have a seat. Have a seat. You're making me blush. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member.</i> I love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. Thank you. <p>Cecile, thank you for the warm introduction, and thank you for the outstanding leadership that you've shown over the years. You just do a great, great job. I want to thank all of you for the remarkable work that you're doing day in, day out in providing quality health care to women all across America. You are somebody that women&mdash;young women, old women, women in between&mdash;count on for so many important services. And we are truly grateful to you. <p>I'm sorry that I could not be at the party yesterday. I understand it was a little wild. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's what I heard. But as all of you know, obviously, we've gone through a pretty tough week and a half, and I was down in Texas, letting know&mdash;letting the people of West, Texas, know that we all love them and care about them in their time of grieving. <p>But obviously, this is a special national conference because it's been nearly a hundred years since the first health clinic of what later would become Planned Parenthood opened its doors to women in Brooklyn. And for nearly a century now, one core principle has guided everything all of you do: that women should be allowed to make their own decisions about their own health. It's a simple principle. <p>So what I see in this audience, extraordinary doctors and nurses and advocates and staff who work tirelessly to keep the doors at health centers all across the country going, then I'm reminded of those very early efforts and all the strides that we've made in subsequent decades. And I also think about the millions of mothers and daughters and wives and sisters, friends and neighbors, who walk through those doors every year. <p>And somewhere, there's a woman who just received a new lease on life because of a screening that you provided that helped catch her cancer in time. Somewhere, there's a woman who's breathing easier today because of the support and counseling she got at her local Planned Parenthood health clinic. Somewhere, there's a young woman starting a career who, because of you, is able to decide for herself when she wants to start a family. <p>One in five women in this country has turned to Planned Parenthood for health care&mdash;one in five. And for many, Planned Parenthood is their primary source of health care, not just for contraceptive care, but for lifesaving preventive care, like cancer screenings and health counseling. <p>So when politicians try to turnedPlanned Parenthood into a punching bag, they're not just talking about you, they're talking about the millions of women who you serve. And when they talk about cutting off your funding, let's be clear: They're talking about telling many of those women, you're on your own. They're talking about shutting those women out at a time when they may need it most, shutting off communities that need more health care options for women, not less. <p>So the fact is, after decades of progress, there's still those who want to turn back the clock to policies more suited to the 1950s than the 21st century. And they've been involved in an orchestrated and historic effort to roll back basic rights when it comes to women's health. <p>Forty-two States have introduced laws that would ban or severely limit access to a woman's right to choose; laws that would make it harder for women to get the contraceptive care that they need; laws that would cut off access to cancer screenings and end educational programs that help prevent teen pregnancy. <p>In North Dakota, they just passed a law that outlaws your right to choose, starting as early as 6 weeks, even if a woman's raped. A woman may not even know that she's pregnant at 6 weeks. In Mississippi, a ballot initiative was put forward that could not only have outlawed your right to choose, but could have had all sorts of other far-reaching consequences, like cutting off fertility treatments, making certain forms of contraception a crime. <p>That's absurd. It's wrong. It's an assault on women's rights. And that's why when the people of Mississippi were given a chance to vote on that initiative, they turned it down. And Mississippi is a conservative State. [<i>Applause</i>] Mississippi is a conservative State, but they wanted to make clear there's nothing conservative about the government injecting itself into decisions best made between a woman and her doctor. And folks are trying to do this all across the country. <p>When you read about some of these laws, you want to check the calendar; you want to make sure you're still living in 2013. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Forty years after the Supreme Court affirmed a woman's constitutional right to privacy, including the right to choose, we shouldn't have to remind people that when it comes to a woman's health, no politician should get to decide what's best for you. No insurer should get to decide what kind of care that you get. The only person who should get to make decisions about your health is you. That's why we fought so hard to make health care reform a reality. <p>That principle is at the heart of the Affordable Care Act. Because of the ACA, most insurance plans are now covering the cost of contraceptive care so that a working mom doesn't have to put off the care she needs just so she can pay her bills on time. Because of the Affordable Care Act, 47 million women have new access to preventive care like mammograms and cancer screenings with no copay, no deductible, no out-of-pocket costs, so they don't have to put off a mammogram just because money is tight. Because of the Affordable Care Act, young people under the age of 26 can now stay on their parent's health care plan. And insurance companies soon will no longer be able to deny you coverage based on preexisting conditions like breast cancer or charge you more just because you are a woman. Those days are ending. [<i>Applause</i>] Those days are ending. <p>Now, I know how hard you worked to help us pass health care reform. You and your supporters got out there: You organized, you mobilized, you made your voices heard. It made all the difference. But here's the thing: If Americans don't know how to access the new benefits and protections that they're going to receive as we implement this law, then health care reform won't make much of a difference in their lives. <p>So I'm here to also ask for your help, because we need to get the word out. We need you to tell your patients, your friends, your neighbors, your family members what the health care law means for them. Make sure they know that if they don't have health insurance, they'll be able to sign up for quality, affordable health insurance starting this fall in an online marketplace where private insurers will compete for their business. Make sure that they know that there are plans out there right now that cover the cost of contraception and preventive care free of charge. <p>We've got to spread the word, particularly among women, particularly among young women, who are the ones who are most likely to benefit from these laws. We need all the women who come through your doors telling their children, their husbands, and their folks in their neighborhoods about their health care options. We need all college students who come through your doors to call up their friends and post on Facebook talking about the protections and benefits that are kicking in. <p>And you are all in a unique position to deliver that message because the women you serve know you and they trust you. And the reason for that is that you haven't let them down before. <p>I know it's not always easy. As Cecile describes, Planned Parenthood is the only organization that she's ever been at where there are opponents who, in her words, \\"literally get up every day trying to figure out how to keep us from doing our work.\\" Now, if she had worked in the administration&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;she'd be more familiar with this phenomenon. [<i>Laughter</i>] But when it comes to your patients, you never let them down, no matter what. <p>And that's because you never forget who this is all about. This is about a woman from Chicago named goCourtney who has a disease that can leave women infertile. So in college, she turned to Planned Parenthood for access to affordable contraceptive care to keep her healthy. You didn't just help her plan for a family, you made sure she could start one. And today, she's got two beautiful kids. That's what Planned Parenthood is about. <p>This is about a woman in Washington State named Joyce who for years could only afford health care at her local Planned Parenthood clinic. And heeding your advice, she never missed her annual exam. During one of them, your doctors helped catch an aggressive form of cervical cancer early enough to save her life. Today, she's been cancer free for 25 years. <p>So every day, in every State, in every center that Planned Parenthood operates, there are stories like those: lives you've saved, women you've empowered, families that you've strengthened. That's why, no matter how great the challenge, no matter how fierce the opposition, if there's one thing the past few years have shown, it's that Planned Parenthood is not going anywhere. It's not going anywhere today. It's not going anywhere tomorrow. <p>As long as we've got to fight to make sure women have access to quality, affordable health care, and as long as we've got to fight to protect a woman's right to make her own choices about her own health, I want you to know that you've also got a President who's going to be right there with you fighting every step of the way. <p>Thank you, Planned Parenthood. God bless you. God bless America. Thank you.\" "
"90" "\"<i>White House Correspondents' Association President Ed Henry</i>. And without further ado, I'd like to introduce the President of the United States. <p>[<i>At this point \\"Hail to the Chief\\" began to play. The music then changed to \\"All I Do Is Win\\" by rap artist DJ Khaled.</i>] <p><i>The President. </i>Thank you. Thank you, everybody. [<i>Laughter</i>] How do you like my new entrance music? Rush Limbaugh warned you about this. Second term, baby. [<i>Laughter</i>] We're changing things around here a little bit. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Actually, my advisers were a little worried about the new rap entrance music. [<i>Laughter</i>] They are a little more traditional. They suggested that I should start with some jokes at my own expense, just take myself down a peg. I was like, guys, after 4&frac12; years, how many pegs are there left? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to thank the White House correspondents. Ed, you're doing an outstanding job. We are grateful for&mdash;the great work you've done. To all the dignitaries who are here, everybody on the dais&mdash;I especially want to say thank you to Ray Odierno, who does outstanding service on behalf of our country, and all our men and women in uniform every single day. <p>And of course, our extraordinary First Lady, Michelle Obama. Everybody loves Michelle. [<i>Laughter</i>] She's on the cover of Vogue, high poll numbers. But don't worry, I recently got my own magazine cover. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>An image of a magazine titled \\"Senior Leisure\\" with a photo of the President and Vice President Biden playing golf was shown.</i>] <p>Now, look, I get it. These days, I look in the mirror and I have to admit, I'm not the strapping young Muslim socialist that I used to be. [<i>Laughter</i>] Time passes. You get a little gray. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And yet, even after all this time, I still make rookie mistakes. Like, I'm out in California, we're at a fundraiser, we're having a nice time. I happen to mention that Kamala Harris is the best looking attorney general in the country. [<i>Laughter</i>] As you might imagine, I got trouble when I got back home. [<i>Laughter</i>] Who knew Eric Holder was so sensitive? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And then there's the Easter egg roll, which is supposed to be just a nice, fun event with the kids. I go out on the basketball court, took 22 shots, made 2 of them. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's right: 2 hits, 20 misses. The executives at NBC asked, \\"What's your secret?\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So yes, maybe I have lost a step. But some things are beyond my control. For example, this whole controversy about Jay-Z going to Cuba, it's unbelievable. I've got 99 problems, and now Jay-Z is one. [Laughter] That's another rap reference, Bill. [<i>Laughter</i>] I wanted to let you know. <p>Of course, everybody has got plenty of advice. Maureen Dowd said I could solve all my problems if I were just more like Michael Douglas in \\"The American President.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] And I know Michael is here tonight. Michael, what's your secret, man? [<i>Laughter</i>] Could it be that you were an actor in an Aaron Sorkin liberal fantasy? [<i>Laughter</i>] Might that have something to do with it? I don't know. Check in with me. Maybe it's something else. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Anyway, I recognize that this job can take a toll on you. I understand, second term, you need a burst of new energy, try some new things. And my team and I talked about it. We were willing to try anything. So we borrowed one of Michelle's tricks. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>Several images of the President with a bangs hairstyle were shown</i>.] <p>I thought this looked pretty good, but no bounce. [<i>Laughter</i>] Anyway&mdash;&mdash; <p>I want to give a shout-out to our headliner, Conan O'Brien. I was just talking to Ed, and I understand that when the Correspondents' Association was considering Conan for this gig, they were faced with that age-old dilemma: Do you offer it to him now or wait for 5 years and then give it to Jimmy Fallon? [<i>Laughter</i>] That was a little harsh. [<i>Laughter</i>] I love Conan. <p>And of course, the White House press corps is here. I know CNN has taken some knocks lately, but the fact is, I admire their commitment to cover all sides of a story, just in case one of them happens to be accurate. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Some of my former advisers have switched over to the dark side. For example, David Axelrod now works for MSNBC, which is a nice change of pace since MSNBC used to work for David Axelrod. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>The History Channel is not here. I guess they were embarrassed about the whole Obama-is-a-devil thing. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>An image of Satan, played by actor Mohamen Mehdi Ouazanni, from the History Channel's miniseries \\"The Bible\\" was shown.</i>] <p>Of course, that never kept FOX News from showing up. [<i>Laughter</i>] They actually thought the comparison was not fair&mdash;to Satan. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But the problem is, is that the media landscape is changing so rapidly. You can't keep up with it. I mean, I remember when BuzzFeed was just something I did in college around 2:00 a.m. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's true. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Recently, though, I found a new favorite source for political news: These guys are great. I think everybody here should check it out; they tell it like it is. It's called whitehouse.gov. [<i>Laughter</i>] I cannot get enough of it. <p>The fact is, I really do respect the press. I recognize that the press and I have different jobs to do. My job is to be President; your job is to keep me humble. Frankly, I think I'm doing my job better. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But part of the problem is everybody is so cynical. I mean, we're constantly feeding cynicism, suspicion, conspiracies. You remember a few months ago, my administration put out a photograph of me going skeet shooting at Camp David? You remember that? And quite a number of people insisted that this had been Photoshopped. <p>[<i>An image of the President skeet shooting was shown.</i>] <p>But tonight I have something to confess: You were right. Guys, can we show them the actual photo? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>An image of the President skeet shooting, with a bald eagle perched on his shoulder, kneeling on the roof of a racecar driven by Vice President Biden in a barren, rocky landscape with a rainbow, lightning, and a large full moon in the in sky, and a giant kitten shooting laser beams out of its eyes at a monster truck in the background was shown.</i>] <p>We were just trying to tone it down a little bit. [<i>Laughter</i>] That was an awesome day. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>There are other new players in the media landscape as well, like super PACs. Did you know that Sheldon Adelson spent $100 million of his own money last year on negative ads? You've got to really dislike me&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;to spend that kind of money. I mean, that's Oprah money. [<i>Laughter</i>] You could buy an island and call it \\"Nobama\\" for that kind of money. [<i>Laughter</i>] Sheldon would have been better off offering me $100 million to drop out of the race. [<i>Laughter</i>] I probably wouldn't have taken it, but I'd have thought about it. [<i>Laughter</i>] Michelle would have taken it. [<i>Laughter</i>] You think I'm joking? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I know Republicans are still sorting out what happened in 2012, but one thing they all agree on is they need to do a better job reaching out to minorities. And look, call me self-centered, but I can think of one minority they could start with. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>The President raised his hand.]</i> <p>Hello? Think of me as a trial run, you know? [<i>Laughter</i>] See how it goes. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>If they won't come to me, I will come to them. Recently, I had dinner&mdash;it's been well publicized&mdash;I had dinner with a number of the Republican Senators. And I'll admit it wasn't easy. I proposed a toast; it died in committee. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Of course, even after I've done all this, some folks still don't think I spend enough time with Congress. Why don't you get a drink with Mitch they ask. Really? [<i>Laughter</i>] Why don't you get a drink with Mitch McConnell? [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm sorry. I get frustrated sometimes. <p>I am not giving up. In fact, I'm taking my charm offensive on the road: a Texas barbeque with Ted Cruz, a Kentucky bluegrass concert with Rand Paul, and a book-burning with Michele Bachmann. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>My charm offensive has helped me learn some interesting things about what's going on in Congress: it turns out, absolutely nothing. [<i>Laughter</i>] But the point of my charm offensive is simple: We need to make progress on some important issues. Take the sequester. Republicans fell in love with this thing, and now they can't stop talking about how much they hate it. It's like we're trapped in a Taylor Swift album. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>One Senator who has reached across the aisle recently is Marco Rubio, but I don't know about 2016. I mean, the guy has not even finished a single term in the Senate and he thinks he's ready to be President. [<i>Laughter</i>] Kids these days. <p>I, on the other hand, have run my last campaign. On Thursday, as Ed mentioned, I went to the opening of the Bush Presidential Library in Dallas. It was a wonderful event, and that inspired me to get started on my own legacy, which will actually begin by building another edifice right next to the Bush Library. Can we show that, please? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I'm also hard at work on plans for the Obama Library. And some have suggested that we put it in my birthplace, but I'd rather keep it in the United States. [<i>Laughter</i>] Did anybody not see that joke coming? [<i>Laughter</i>] Show of hands. Only Gallup? Maybe Dick Morris? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, speaking of Presidents and their legacies, I want to acknowledge a wonderful friend, Steven Spielberg, and Daniel Day-Lewis, who are here tonight. We had a screening of their most recent film, \\"Lincoln,\\" which was an extraordinary film. I am a little nervous, though, about Steven's next project. I saw a behind-the-scenes look on HBO. Well, let's just check it out. Roll the tape. <p>[<i>A video was shown.</i>] <p>It's a remarkable transformation. Do I really sound like that, though, honey? [<i>Laughter</i>] Wow. <p>Groucho Marx once said&mdash;and, Senator Cruz, that's Groucho Marx, not Karl. That's the other guy. [<i>Laughter</i>] Groucho Marx once told an audience, \\"Before I speak, I have something important to say.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] And along those same lines, I want to close on a more serious note. <p>Obviously, there has been no shortage of news to cover over these past few weeks. And these have been some very hard days for too many of our citizens. Even as we gather here tonight, our thoughts are not far from the people of Boston and the people of West, Texas. There are families in the Midwest who are coping with some terrible floods. So we've had some difficult days. <p>But even when the days seemed darkest, we have seen humanity shine at its brightest. We've seen first responders and National Guardsmen who have dashed into danger, law enforcement officers who lived their oath to serve and to protect, and everyday Americans who are opening their homes and their hearts to perfect strangers. <p>And we also saw journalists at their best, especially those who took the time to wade upstream through the torrent of digital rumors to chase down leads and verify facts and painstakingly put the pieces together to inform and to educate and to tell stories that demanded to be told. <p>If anyone wonders, for example, whether newspapers are a thing of the past, all you needed to do was to pick up or log on to papers like the Boston Globe. When their communities and the wider world needed them most, they were there making sense of events that might at first blush seem beyond our comprehension. And that's what great journalism is, and that's what great journalists do. And that's why, for example, Pete Williams's new nickname around the NBC newsroom is \\"Big Papi.\\" <p>And in these past few weeks, as I've gotten a chance to meet many of the first responders and the police officers and volunteers who raced to help when hardship hits, I was reminded, as I'm always reminded when I meet our men and women in uniform&mdash;whether they're in war theater or here back home or at Walter Reed in Bethesda&mdash;I'm reminded that all these folks, they don't do it to be honored, they don't do it to be celebrated. They do it because they love their families and they love their neighborhoods and they love their country. <p>And so these men and women should inspire all of us in this room to live up to those same standards, to be worthy of their trust, to do our jobs with the same fidelity and the same integrity and the same sense of purpose and the same love of country. Because if we're only focused on profits or ratings or polls, then we're contributing to the cynicism that so many people feel right now. <p>And so those of us in this room tonight, we are incredibly lucky. And the fact is, we can do better, all of us. Those of us in public office, those of us in the press, those who produce entertainment for our kids, those with power, those with influence&mdash;all of us, including myself&mdash;we can strive to value those things that I suspect led most of us to do the work that we do in the first place, because we believed in something that was true and we believed in service and the idea that we can have a lasting, positive impact on the lives of the people around us. <p>And that's our obligation. That's a task we should gladly embrace on behalf of all of those folks who are counting on us, on behalf of this country that's given us so much. <p>So thank you all, to the White House correspondents for the great work you do. God bless you all. May God bless the United States of America.\" "
"91" "\"Hi, everybody. Our top priority as a nation must be growing the economy, creating good jobs, and rebuilding opportunity for the middle class. <p>But 2 months ago, Congress allowed a series of automatic budget cuts to fall across the Federal Government that would do the opposite. In Washington speak, these cuts were called the sequester. It was a bad idea then. And as the country saw this week, it's a bad idea now. <p>Because of these reckless cuts, there are parents whose kids just got kicked out of Head Start programs who right now are scrambling for a solution. There are seniors who depend on programs like Meals on Wheels to live independently looking for help. There are military communities&mdash;families that have obviously already sacrificed enough&mdash;coping under new strains. All because of these cuts. <p>This week, the sequester hurt travelers, who were stuck for hours in airports and on planes and rightly frustrated by it. And maybe because they fly home each weekend, the Members of Congress who insisted on these cuts finally realized that they actually apply to them too. <p>Republicans claimed victory when the sequester first took effect, and now they've decided it was a bad idea all along. Well, first, they should look at their own budget. If the cuts they proposed were applied across the board, the FAA would suffer cuts three times deeper. <p>So Congress passed a temporary fix, a Band-Aid. But these cuts are scheduled to keep falling across other parts of the Government that provide vital services for the American people. And we can't just keep putting Band-Aids on every cut. It's not a responsible way to govern. There is only one way to truly fix the sequester: by replacing it before it causes further damage. <p>A couple of weeks ago, I put forward a budget that replaces the next several years of these dumb cuts with smarter cuts, reforms our Tax Code to close wasteful special interest loopholes, and invests in things like education, research, and manufacturing that will create new jobs right now. <p>So I hope Members of Congress will find the same sense of urgency and bipartisan cooperation to help the families still in the crosshairs of these cuts. Members of Congress may not feel the pain felt by kids kicked off Head Start or the 750,000 Americans projected to lose their jobs because of these cuts or the long-term unemployed who will be further hurt by them. But that pain is real. <p>The American people worked too hard, for too long, rebuilding from one economic crisis just to see your elected officials keep causing more. Our economy is growing. And our deficits are shrinking. We're creating jobs on a consistent basis. But we need to do more to help middle class families get ahead, and give more folks a chance to earn their way into the middle class. We can do that, if we work together. That's what you expect. And that's what I'm going to keep on working on every single day to help deliver. Thanks so much.\" "
"92" "\"Thank you so much. Please, everybody have a seat. <p>Well, it's good to be back. Good morning, everybody, and thank you, Dr. Cicerone, for the kind introduction and the great work that you do. The good doctor was reminding me that the first time I came here, he&mdash;apparently joking, I warned him and John Holdren not to age too much in their jobs. And it turns out, I'm the guy who's aged. [<i>Laughter</i>] They look great. <p>But as always, it's an honor to join our Nation's preeminent scholars, including my own science adviser, John Holdren, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the National Academy of Sciences. And since I did not do well enough in chemistry or physics to impress you much on those topics, let me instead tell a story. <p>One hundred and fifty years ago, the Nation, as all of you know, was in the midst of the Civil War, and the Union had recently suffered a devastating defeat at Fredericksburg. The road ahead seemed long and uncertain. Confederate advances in weapons technology cast a dark shadow on the Union. <p>The previous spring, in the waters outside of Hampton Roads, the ironclad Confederate battleship <i>Virginia</i> had sunk two wooden Union ships and advanced on a third, and this endangered the Union blockade of Virginia and threatened Union forces along the Potomac River. And then, overnight, the USS<i> Monitor</i>, an ironclad herself, arrived and fought the <i>Virginia</i> to a draw in the world's first battle between ironsided ships. <p>There was no victor, but the era of ironclad warfare had begun. And it brought unexpected challenges for President Lincoln and his Navy as they expanded this fleet in early 1863, because aboard their new ironside battleships, sailors found that the iron siding made the ships' compasses unpredictable, so it skewed navigation and they were bumping into things and going the wrong way. [<i>Laughter</i>] So the basic physics of magnetism undermined the usefulness of the ironclad vessels, even as the Confederates were stocking up on them. <p>And that's where your predecessors came in. Because in March of 1983&mdash;1863, rather&mdash;President Lincoln and Congress established the National Academy of Sciences as an independent and nonprofit institution charged with the mission to provide the Government with the scientific advice that it needed. And this was advice that was particularly useful in the thick of battle. <p>The National Academy soon counted the Nation's top scientists as members. They quickly got to work. By the next year, they were inspecting the Union's ironclads and installing an array of bar magnets around the compasses to correct their navigation. So right off the bat, you guys were really useful. [<i>Laughter</i>] In fact, it's fair to say we might not be here had you not&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;certainly, I would not be here. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, political leaders have long recognized the connection between technology and warfare throughout our human history. Sadly, this is an element of the human condition. We take our wars very seriously, and we're always looking for new ways to engage in a war. But President Lincoln founded the Academy with a mandate that went far beyond the science and technology of war. Even as the Nation was at war with itself, President Lincoln had the wisdom to look forward, and he recognized that finding a way to harness the highest caliber scientific advice for the Government would serve a whole range of long-term goals for the Nation. <p>It was the same foresight that led him to establish land-grant colleges and finish the transcontinental railroad: the idea that the essence of America is this hunger to innovate, this restlessness, this quest for the next big thing. And although much of this innovation would be generated by the powers of our free market, the investments and the convening power of the Federal Government could accelerate discovery in a way that would continually push the Nation forward. <p>That's our inheritance, and now the task falls to us. We, too, face significant challenges, obviously not of the magnitude that President Lincoln faced, but we've got severe economic and security and environmental challenges. And what we know from our past is that the investments we make today are bound to pay off many times over in the years to come. <p>So we will continue to pursue advances in science and engineering, in infrastructure and innovation, in education and environmental protection, especially science-based initiatives to help us minimize and adapt to global threats like climate change. <p>And I'm confident we'll meet that task because we've got you&mdash;brilliant and committed scientists&mdash;to help us guide the way. And part of what's made the Academy so effective is that all the scientists elected to your elite ranks are volunteers, which is fortunate because we have no money anyway. [<i>Laughter</i>] For 150 years, you've strived to answer big questions, solve tough problems, not for yourselves, but for the benefit of the Nation. And that legacy has endured from the Academy's founding days. And when you look at our history, you've stepped up at the times of enormous need and, in some cases, great peril. <p>When Woodrow Wilson needed help understanding the science of military preparedness, he asked the Academy's eminent scientists to lay it out for him. When George W. Bush, more recently, wanted to study the long-term health effects of traumatic brain injuries suffered by soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, he set your scholars to the task. Today, my administration relies on your expertise to answer critical questions like: How do we set our basic priorities for research? How can we get the most out of the nanotechnology revolution? What are the underlying causes of gun violence? <p>And more important than any single study or report, the members of this institution embody what is so necessary for us to continue our scientific advance and to maintain our cutting edge, and that's restless curiosity and boundless hope, but also a fidelity to facts and truth and a willingness to follow where the evidence leads. <p>Now, I'd like to acknowledge the other organizations that have been obviously very important in this whole process&mdash;the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, the Institute of Medicine&mdash;all who've contributed similar leadership in maintaining the tradition, upholding the highest standard of science. <p>And by the way, we do have colleagues in Congress who believe in science and believe in evidence. One of them is here, Congressman Rush Holt. We're very grateful to him for his outstanding work. And I want to thank many of the members of my administration, as well as PCAST, my&mdash;I always forget what exactly it stands for, but&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;it's my smart science people, who have contributed enormously to the work that we're doing on a whole range of issues, from energy to manufacturing&mdash;advanced manufacturing, have really been extraordinary. I want to thank the members of my administration who are here as well, who all are invested in making sure that we keep American science the best in the world. <p>Now, the good news is America remains a world leader in patents and scientific discovery. Our university system is the crown jewel of our economy as well as our civilization. And that's what's allowing us to continually replenish our stock of people who are willing to dream big dreams and reach higher than anybody else. <p>And what I want to communicate to all of you is, is that as long as I'm President, we're going to continue to be committed to investing in the promising ideas that are generated from you and your institutions, because they lead to innovative products, they help boost our economy, but also because that's who we are. I'm committed to it because that's what makes us special and ultimately what makes life worth living. <p>And that's why we're pursuing \\"Grand Challenges\\" like making solar energy as cheap as coal and building electric vehicles as affordable as the ones that run on gas. And earlier this month, I unveiled the BRAIN Initiative, which will give scientists the tools that they need to get a dynamic picture of the brain in action and better understand how we think and learn and remember. <p>Today, all around the country, scientists like you are developing therapies to regenerate damaged organs, creating new devices to enable brain-controlled prosthetic limbs, and sending sophisticated robots into space to search for signs of past life on Mars. That sense of wonder and that sense of discovery, it has practical application, but it also nurtures what I believe is best in us. <p>And right now we're on the brink of amazing breakthroughs that have the chance, the potential, to change life for the better, which is why we can't afford to gut these investments in science and technology. Unfortunately, that's what we're facing right now. Because of the across-the-board cuts that Congress put in place&mdash;the sequester, as it's known in Washingtonspeak&mdash;it's hitting our scientific research. Instead of racing ahead on the next cutting-edge discovery, our scientists are left wondering if they'll get to start any new projects&mdash;any new research projects at all over the next few years, which means that we could lose a year, 2 years of scientific research as a practical matter because of misguided priorities here in this town. <p>With the pace of technological innovation today, we can't afford to stand still for a year or 2 years or 3 years. We've got to seize every opportunity we have to stay ahead. And we can't let other countries win the race for ideas and technology of the future. And I say that, by the way, not out of just any nationalistic pride&mdash;although, obviously, that's part of it&mdash;but it's also because nobody does it better than we do when it's adequately funded, when it's adequately supported. And what we produce here ends up having benefits worldwide. We should be reaching for a level of private and public research and development investment that we haven't seen since the height of the space race. That's my goal. <p>And it's not just resources. I mean, one of the things that I've tried to do over these last 4 years&mdash;and will continue to do over the next 4 years&mdash;is to make sure that we are promoting the integrity of our scientific process; that not just in the physical and life sciences, but also in fields like psychology and anthropology and economics and political science&mdash;all of which are sciences because scholars develop and test hypotheses and subject them to peer review&mdash;but in all the sciences, we've got to make sure that we are supporting the idea that they're not subject to politics, that they're not skewed by an agenda; that, as I said before, we make sure that we go where the evidence leads us. And that's why we've got to keep investing in these sciences. <p>And what's true of all sciences is that in order for us to maintain our edge, we've got to protect our rigorous peer review system and ensure that we only fund proposals that promise the biggest bang for taxpayer dollars. And I will keep working to make sure that our scientific research does not fall victim to political maneuvers or agendas that in some ways would impact on the integrity of the scientific process. That's what's going to maintain our standards of scientific excellence for years to come. <p>That's why, by the way, one of the things that I've focused on as President is an all-hands-on-deck approach to the sciences, as well as technology and engineering and math. And that's why we're spending a lot of time focused on the next generation. With the help of John Holdren and everybody who's working with my administration, we want to make sure that we are exciting young people around math and science and technology and computer science. We don't want our kids just to be consumers of the amazing things that science generates, we want them to be producers as well. And we want to make sure that those who historically have not participated in the sciences as robustly&mdash;girls, members of minority groups here in this country&mdash;that they are encouraged as well. <p>We've got to make sure that we're training great calculus and biology teachers and encouraging students to keep up with their physics and chemistry classes. That includes Malia and Sasha. [<i>Laughter</i>] It means teaching proper research methods and encouraging young people to challenge accepted knowledge. It means expanding and maintaining critical investments in biomedical research and helping innovators turn their discoveries into new businesses and products. And it means maintaining that spirit of discovery. <p>Last week, I got a chance to do one of my favorite things as President, and that is, we started these White House Science Fairs. And these kids are remarkable. I mean, I know you guys were smart when you were their age, but&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I might give them the edge. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, you had young people who were converting algae into sustainable biofuels. That was one of my favorites because the young lady had&mdash;she kept the algae under her bed; she had, like, a whole lab, which meant that she had really supportive parents. [<i>Laughter</i>] I pictured it bubbling out and starting to creep into the hallways. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>You had young people who were purifying water with bicycle power-generated batteries. You had young people who had already devised faster and cheaper tests for cancer. These are 15-, 16-year-olds. <p>They were all dreaming to grow up and be just like you, maybe with a little less gray hair&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but they shared your passion. They shared that excitement. And what was interesting was, not only did they share that sense of wonder and discovery, but they also shared this fundamental optimism that if you figured this stuff out, people's lives would be better; that there were no inherent barriers to us solving the big problems that we face as long as we were diligent and focused and observant and curious. <p>And we've got to make sure that we're supporting that next generation of dreamers and risk takers, because if we are, things will be good. They leave me with extraordinary optimism. They leave me hopeful. They leave&mdash;they put a smile on my face. And I am absolutely convinced that if this Academy and the successors who become members of this Academy are there at the center and the heart of our public debate, that we'll be able to continue to use the innovation that powers our economy and improves our health, protects our environment and security, that makes us the envy of the world. <p>So I want to thank you on behalf of the American people. And I want to make sure that you know that you've got a strong supporter in the White House. <p>God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you.\" "
"93" "\"Thank you. Please, everybody, have a seat. David, thank you so much for your introduction and sharing your story, but most importantly, thanks for your extraordinary service to our Nation. We are very, very proud of you. <p>Thank you to our partners in crime&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;the outstanding Joe Biden and the even more outstanding Jill Biden. [<i>Laughter</i>] We are grateful for their leadership, their commitment on a whole range of issues. But I'm particularly grateful for the passion that Jill, you've shown when it comes to our military families, because you know what it's like when a loved one is deployed. And that passion comes through with everything you do. So we're very, very proud of you. <p>I also want to recognize the members of my Cabinet and Joint Chiefs and some of our top brass who are here. We appreciate all the great work that they're doing. And your presence reflects our commitment to this cause across the entire Government. <p>And now I've got a simple task this morning, and that is to introduce the graceful, brilliant, inspiring love of my life&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;First Lady Michelle Obama. Joe and I are just warmup acts today, which in our families means, it's just another Tuesday. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's how it generally goes. <p>But of all the honors and privileges of serving as President, the opportunity to meet incredible people like David is among the things that I cherish the most. David, being here today is representative of a 9/11 generation: men and women who volunteered to put the uniform on even though they understood it was wartime, knowing full well they could be sent into harm's way. <p>And for more than a decade, they have answered every call, executing some of the most dangerous missions on the planet, operating some of the most cutting edge, complex technologies known to man, leading their peers in moments where their decisions can determine life or death. And, as we saw during the attacks in Boston, as guardsmen and as veterans were racing towards danger, they put that courage and experience and skills that they've earned serving in our military to use every single day. George Washington once said, \\"When we assumed the soldier, we did not lay aside the citizen.\\" <p>Our troops and our military families who serve right alongside them keep us strong and they keep us safe. And as Commander in Chief, I've pledged that just as they've left their homes and families to take care of us, we've got to make sure we're taking care of them when they come home. That's our sacred obligation: to make sure that they get the care and the benefits and opportunities that they deserve. And that includes economic opportunity: good jobs worthy of their incredible talents. <p>And as David indicated, unfortunately, when they hit the job market, employers don't always recognize the high-quality, high-tech skills our newest veterans have gained in their military. They don't understand the leadership that they've shown under extraordinary circumstances. So, too often, just when these men and women are looking to move forward in the next chapter of their lives, they're stuck in neutral, scraping together odd jobs just to pay the bills. <p>Now, our economy is growing. It's creating jobs on a consistent basis. Although I just had a press conference, we could be doing even better if we'd get a little more cooperation down the street. But for post-9/11 veterans, employment continues to lag behind the national average, and that's especially true for our youngest veterans. And this does not make any sense. <p>If you can save a life on the battlefield, then you sure as heck can save one in an ambulance in a state-of-the-art hospital. If you can oversee a convoy of equipment and track millions of dollars of assets, then you can run a company's supply chain or you can balance its books. If you can lead a platoon in a war zone, then I think you can lead a team in a conference center. <p>There are lots of extremely talented young people who are more than qualified for the jobs that businesses are looking to fill. We've got the end of the Iraq war. The war in Afghanistan is drawing to a close. More than 1 million servicemembers are going to be transitioning back to civilian life in the coming years. So we've got to do everything we can to make sure they have every opportunity to succeed. <p>That's why, a year and a half ago, I signed new tax credits for companies that hire unemployed veterans and wounded warriors. And since then, the number of veterans hired through tax credits like these has more than doubled. And my budget's proposed extending these tax credits permanently. Congress needs to get that done. <p>We're working to help our troops earn the credentials they need for jobs in manufacturing and medicine and transportation. We strengthened the post-9/11 GI bill, helping nearly 1 million veterans and military family members get a college education. And for the first time in 20 years, we've overhauled the military's Transition Assistance Program to help our newest veterans compete for those private sector jobs. Our online Veterans Jobs Bank now has more than 2.5 million searchable job postings. With our Veterans Gold Card, our veterans receive 6 months of personalized career counseling. At my direction, the Federal Government has hired nearly 250,000 veterans. <p>So we've made progress, but we know the Government alone can't put every veteran and military spouse to work. So about a year and a half ago, I went down to the Navy Yard and issued a challenge to America's businesses: Hire or train 100,000 veterans and military spouses by the end of 2013. And I am proud to say that these companies stepped up. And some of those companies are represented here today. <p>In just a year, businesses had already hired 125,000 veterans or military spouses. They committed to hiring 250,000 more. Today we're announcing a major milestone in this effort, thanks in large part to the leadership of so many companies that are represented here today. And we could not be more grateful for the commitments of these companies. <p>Now, they're doing it partly because it's good business sense, because they're getting great employees. But they're also doing it because they're patriots. They're also doing it because they really care about this country and they understand that they don't succeed unless they've got an incredible military that's doing this. <p>Hiring our veterans and military spouses is not just the patriotic thing to do, it's the smart thing to do. They're looking for highly skilled workers. Highly skilled veterans and military spouses are looking for jobs, let's connect them up. It's good for families, it's good for businesses, it's good for our country. <p>And that's why Joining Forces is so important. It's a way for us to both honor and serve the men and women who have served us so well, but also to move the country forward. That's why we've all got to step up and do our parts: government, business, schools, hospitals, community groups, houses of worship, neighbors, and obviously, our military and our VA. We've had to up our game, and we're not there yet, but we continually try to strive to improve to make sure we're doing the right thing. And just as service and sacrifice defines our military families, serving our military families has to define who we are as Americans. <p>Now, none of this could have happened had it not been for the extraordinary work that Michelle and Jill have engaged in over the last 2 years. And that's a call that we're renewing here today. I've got to tell you, I'm proud of my wife all the time. I could not be prouder of the work that she and Jill have done in this effort. They have put their heart and their soul into it, they care about it deeply. They identify so deeply with these military families because they understand the sacrifices that they're making. <p>So with that, let me introduce a woman who I've seen live out that message every day as a wife and a mother, a tireless champion of military families, love her dearly, my wife, First Lady Michelle Obama. <p>[<i>At this point, First Lady Michelle Obama made remarks</i>.]\" "
"94" "\"<i>Hola! Buenos dias!</i> Please, please, everybody, have a seat. It is wonderful to be back in Mexico, <i>lindo y querido</i>. I bring with me the greetings and friendship of the people of the United States, including tens of millions of proud Mexican Americans. <p>Now, this is my fourth visit to Mexico as President. This is my second visit to this museum. And each time that I come, I've been inspired by your culture and by the beauty of this land, and most of all, by the Mexican people. You've been so kind and gracious to me. You've welcomed my wife Michelle here to <i>el DF.</i> You've welcomed our daughter Malia and her classmates to Oaxaca. And as a proud father, I have to say that Malia's Spanish is getting very good. It helps that she's smarter than I am. <p>And it's an honor to be back in Mexico City, one of the world's great cities. <i>Es un placer estar entre amigos.</i> <p>And it's fitting that we gather at this great museum, which celebrates Mexico's ancient civilizations and their achievements in arts and architecture, in medicine and mathematics. In modern times, Mexico's blend of cultures and traditions found its expression in the murals of Rivera and the paintings of Frida and the poetry of Sor Juana and the essays of Octavio Paz. And Paz once spoke words that capture the spirit of our gathering here today, in this place that celebrates your past, but which this morning is filled with so many young people who will shape Mexico's future. Octavio Paz said: \\"Modernity is not outside us, it is within us. It is today and the most ancient antiquity; it is tomorrow and the beginning of the world; it is a thousand years old and yet newborn.\\" <p>And that's why I wanted this opportunity to speak with all of you today, because you live at the intersection of history that Octavio Paz was referring to. The young people of Mexico, you honor your heritage, thousands of years old, but you're also part of something new, a nation that's in the process of remaking itself. And as our modern world changes around us, it's the spirit of young people&mdash;your optimism and your idealism and your willingness to discard old habits that are no longer working&mdash;that will drive the world forward. <p>You see the difference between the world as it is and the world as it could to be, between old attitudes that stifle progress and the new thinking that allows us to connect and collaborate across cultures. And by the way, that includes how we think about the relationship between Mexico and the United States. <p>Despite all the bonds and the values that we share, despite all the people who claim heritage on both sides, our attitudes sometimes are trapped in old stereotypes. Some Americans only see the Mexico that is depicted in sensational headlines of violence and border crossings. And let's admit it, some Mexicans think that America disrespects Mexico or thinks that America is trying to impose itself on Mexican sovereignty or just wants to wall ourselves off. And in both countries, such distortions create misunderstandings that make it harder for us to move forward together. So I've come to Mexico because I think it's time for us to put the old mindsets aside. It's time to recognize new realities, including the impressive progress of today's Mexico. <p>It is true that there are Mexicans all across this country who are making courageous sacrifices for the security of your country, that in the countryside and in the neighborhoods not far from here, there are those who are still struggling to give their children a better life. But what's also clear is that a new Mexico is emerging. <p>I see it in the deepening of Mexico's democracy: citizens who are standing up and saying that violence and impunity is not acceptable; a courageous press that's working to hold leaders accountable; a robust civil society, including brave defenders of human rights who demand dignity and rule of law. You have political parties that are competing vigorously, but also transferring power peacefully and forging compromise. And that's all a sign of the extraordinary progress that's taken place here in Mexico. <p>And even though we know the work of perfecting democracy is never finished&mdash;that's true in America, that's true here in Mexico&mdash;you go forward knowing the truth that Benito Juarez once spoke: \\"Democracy is the destiny of humanity.\\" And we are seeing that here in Mexico. [<i>Applause</i>] We're seeing that here in Mexico. <p>We're also seeing a Mexico that's creating new prosperity: trading with the world; becoming a manufacturing powerhouse, from Tijuana to Monterrey to Guadalajara and across the central highlands; a global leader in automobiles and appliances and electronics, but also a center of high-tech innovation, producing the software and the hardware of our digital age. One man in Quer&eacute;taro spoke for an increasing number of Mexicans: \\"There's no reason to go abroad in search of a better life. There are good opportunities here.\\" That's what he said, and you are an example of that. <p>And in fact, I see a Mexico that's lifted millions of people from poverty. Because of the sacrifices of generations, a majority of Mexicans now call themselves middle class, with a quality of life that your parents and grandparents could only dream of. This includes, by the way, opportunities for women, who are proving that when you give women a chance, they will shape our destiny just as well as men, if not better. <p>And I also see in Mexico's youth an empowered generation because of technology. I think I see some of you tweeting right now&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;what's happening. [<i>Laughter</i>] And whether it's harnessing social media to preserve indigenous languages or speaking up for the future that you want, you're making it clear that you want your voice heard. <p>And because of all the dynamic progress that's taking place here in Mexico, Mexico is also taking its rightful place in the world, on the world stage. Mexico is standing up for democracy not just here in Mexico, but throughout the hemisphere. Mexico is sharing expertise with neighbors across the Americas. When they face earthquakes or threats to their citizens or go to the polls to cast their votes, Mexico is there, helping its neighbors. Mexico has joined the ranks of the world's largest economies. It became the first Latin American nation to host the G-20. <p>And just as Mexico is being transformed, so are the ties between our two countries. As President, I've been guided by a basic proposition: In this relationship, there's no senior partner or junior partner, we are two equal partners, two sovereign nations. We must work together in mutual interest and mutual respect. And if we do that, both Mexico and the United States will prosper. <p>And just as I worked with President Calder&oacute;n, I've reaffirmed with President Pe&ntilde;a Nieto that the great partnership between our two countries will not simply continue, it's going to grow stronger and become broader. And in my time with President Pe&ntilde;a Nieto, I've come to see his deep commitment to Mexico and its future. And we share the belief that as leaders, our guiding mission is to improve the lives of our people. And so we agree that the relationship between our nations must be defined not by the threats that we face, but by the prosperity and the opportunity that we can create together. <p>Now, as equal partners, both our nations must recognize our mutual responsibilities. So here in Mexico, you've embarked on an ambitious reform agenda to make your economy more competitive and your institutions more accountable to you, the Mexican people. And as you pursue these reforms, I want you to know that you have strong support in the United States. Because we believe&mdash;I believe&mdash;that people all around the world deserve the best from their government. And whether you're looking for basic services or trying to start a new business, we share your belief that you should be able to make it through your day without paying a bribe. And when talented Mexicans like you imagine your future, you should have every opportunity to succeed right here in the country you love. <p>And in the United States, we recognize our responsibilities. We understand that much of the root cause of violence that's been happening here in Mexico, for which many so Mexicans have suffered, is the demand for illegal drugs in the United States. And so we've got to continue to make progress on that front. <p>I've been asked, and I honestly do not believe that legalizing drugs is the answer. But I do believe that a comprehensive approach&mdash;not just law enforcement, but education and prevention and treatment&mdash;that's what we have to do. And we're going to stay at it, because the lives of our children and the future of our nations depend on it. <p>And we also recognize that most of the guns used to commit violence here in Mexico come from the United States. I think many of you know that in America, our Constitution guarantees our individual right to bear arms, and as President, I swore an oath to uphold that right, and I always will. But at the same time, as I've said in the United States, I will continue to do everything in my power to pass commonsense reforms that keep guns out of the hands of criminals and dangerous people. That can save lives here in Mexico and back home in the United States. It's the right thing to do. So we'll keep increasing the pressure on gun traffickers who bring illegal guns into Mexico. We'll keep putting these criminals where they belong: behind bars. <p>So we recognize we've got work to do on security issues, but we also recognize our responsibility, as a nation that believes that all people are created equal: We believe it's our responsibility to make sure that we treat one another with dignity and respect. And this includes recognizing how the United States has been strengthened by the extraordinary contributions of immigrants from Mexico and by Americans of Mexican heritage. <p>Now, Mexican Americans enrich our communities, including my hometown of Chicago, where you can walk through neighborhoods like Pilsen, Little Village&mdash;<i>La Villita</i>&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;dotted with murals of Mexican patriots. You can stop at a <i>fonda</i>, you can hear some mariachi, you&mdash;where we are inspired by the deep faith of our both our peoples at churches like Our Lady of Guadalupe. [<i>Applause</i>] And we've got a Chicagoan in here somewhere. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And we're so grateful to Mexican Americans in every segment of our society: for teaching our children and running our companies and serving with honor in our military and making breakthroughs in science and standing up for social justice. Now, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., told Cesar Chavez once, we are \\"brothers in the fight for equality.\\" And in fact, without the strong support of Latinos, including so many Mexican Americans, I would not be standing today as President of the United States. That's the truth. <p>And so given that is America's heritage, given that we share a border with Mexico, given ties that run back generations, it is critical that the United States recognize the need to reform our immigration system, because we are a nation of laws, but we're also a nation of immigrants. Like every nation, we have a responsibility to ensure that our laws are upheld. But we also know that as a nation of immigrants, the immigration system we have in the United States right now doesn't reflect our values. It separates families when we should be reuniting them. It's led to millions of people to live in the shadows. It deprives us of the talents of so many young people, even though we know that immigrants have always been the engine of our economy, starting some of our greatest companies and pioneering new industries. <p>That's one of the reasons I acted to lift the shadow of deportation from what we call the dreamers, young people brought to the United States as children. And that's why I'm working with our Congress to pass commonsense immigration reform this year&mdash;I'm convinced we can get it done&mdash;reform that continues to strengthen border security and strengthen legal immigration so citizens don't have to wait years to bring their families to the United States; reform that holds everyone accountable so immigrants get on the right side of the law and so immigrants are not exploited and abused; and most of all, reform that gives millions of undocumented individuals a pathway to earn their citizenship. And I'm optimistic that after years of trying, we are going to get it done this year. I'm absolutely convinced of it. <p>And obviously, we're going to have to work with the Mexican Government to make sure that we've got a well-regulated border. But I also want to work with the Mexican Government because I believe that the long-term solution to the challenge of illegal immigration is a growing and prosperous Mexico that creates more jobs and opportunities for young people here. <p>I agree with the Mexican student who said, \\"I feel like we can reach the same level as anyone in the world.\\" That's absolutely true. And so I firmly believe, <i>juntos, podemos lograr m&aacute;s</i>&mdash;together, we can achieve more. So with the remainder of my time today, I want to focus on five areas where we can do more. <p>Number one, let's do more to expand trade and commerce that creates good jobs for our people. We already buy more of your exports than any country in the world. We sell more of our exports to Mexico than we do to Brazil, Russia, India, and China combined. Mexican companies are investing more in the United States, and we're the largest foreign investor in Mexico, because we believe in Mexico and want to be a partner in your success. <p>So guided by the new economic dialogue that President Pe&ntilde;a Nieto and I announced yesterday, let's do more to unlock the true potential of our relationship. Let's keep investing in our roads and our bridges and our border crossings so we can trade faster and cheaper. Let's help our smaller businesses, which employ most of our workers, access new markets and new capital, the big markets right across the border. Let's empower our young entrepreneurs as they create startup companies that can transform how we live. And let's realize the Trans-Pacific Partnership this year so our two nations can compete and win in the fast-growing markets of the Asia-Pacific. If the United States and Mexico are working together, we can sell a whole lot of things on the other side of the Pacific Ocean where the fastest growing economies are taking off right now. So that's number one. <p>Number two, let's not just sell more things to each other, let's build more things together. So with many of our companies operating in both countries, parts are now being shipped back and forth across the border as they're assembled. So every day, U.S. and Mexican workers are building things together, whether it's crafts&mdash;whether it's cars or aircraft or computers or satellites. <p>And I think this is only the beginning. Given the skills of our workers, it makes even more sense for companies around the world to set up shop in the United States and set up shop in Mexico. And as Mexico reforms, we're going to be able to do more business together and sell more goods around the world. And the more that our companies collaborate, the more competitive they'll be. And the entire hemisphere will benefit because of those links and chains that have been created between our two countries. <p>Number three, as we secure our economic future, let's secure our energy future, including the clean energy that we need to combat climate change. Our nations are blessed with boundless natural beauty, from our coastlines and farmlands to your tropical forests. But climate change is happening. The science is undeniable. And so is the fact that our economies must become greener. <p>So in the United States, we've made historic commitments to clean and renewable energy like solar and wind power. And we've made a commitment to reduce the emission of harmful carbon pollution. And here in Mexico, you're a leader in cutting carbon emissions and helping developing countries do the same. So together, let's keep building new energy partnerships by harnessing all these new sources and, by the way, creating the good jobs that come with these new technologies. And let's keep investing in green buildings and technologies that make our entire economy more efficient, but also make our planet cleaner and safer for future generations. <p>Number four&mdash;and this is part of staying competitive&mdash;let's do more together in education so our young people have the knowledge and skills to succeed. Here in Mexico you've made important progress, with more children staying in school longer and record numbers of students like you getting a university education. Just imagine how much the students of our two countries could do together, how much we could learn from each other. <p>And that's why President Pe&ntilde;a Nieto and I announced a new partnership in higher education to encourage more collaboration between our universities and our university students. So we're going to focus on science and technology, on engineering and mathematics. And this is part of my broader initiative called 100,000 Strong in the Americas. We want 100,000 students from the United States studying in Latin America, including Mexico. And we want 100,000 Latin American students, including Mexican students, to come to study in the United States of America. Because when we study together and we learn together, we work together and we prosper together. That's what I believe. <p>And finally, to help spark prosperity in both out countries, let's truly invest in innovation and research and development together. Here in Mexico, you're now a global leader in graduating engineers and technicians. One of Mexico's leading scientists, Rafael Navarro-Gonz&aacute;lez, is helping analyze data from the rover that we've landed on Mars. <p>So together, let's remember that every dollar, every peso that we invest in research and development returns so much more to our economies in jobs and opportunity, new products, new services. And that's why I'm calling for us to forge new partnerships in aerospace and IT and nanotechnology and biotechnology and robotics. Let's answer the hope of a young woman, a student at the National Polytechnic Institute, who spoke for many in your generation, so eager to make your mark. She said, \\"Give us jobs as creators.\\" Give us jobs as creators. <p>Sometimes, young people are known as just consumers of goods, but we want young people creating the new products, the next big thing that will change how we live our lives. So that's the agenda that I want to pursue. <p>And I understand that there are those&mdash;both here in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America, but also back home in the United States&mdash;who are skeptical of progress, who maybe doubt the capacity for us to make the most of this moment. There are always cynics who say, \\"Aw, this is too hard,\\" the headwinds you face are too stiff. They say: \\"Mexico has been here before. We look like we're making progress, we're looking at a bright horizon, on the verge of great possibility, but then we get blown off course.\\" <p>And it's true that nothing is inevitable. Progress and success is never guaranteed. The future that you dream of, the Mexico you imagine, it must be built; it must be earned. Nobody else can do it for you. Only you can earn it. You are the future. As Nervo wrote in \\"La Raza de Bronce,\\" <i>tu eres el sue&ntilde;o</i>&mdash;you are the dream. <p>For just as it was patriots who answered the call when Father Hidalgo rang the church bell two centuries ago, you&mdash;your lives in a free Mexico&mdash;are the dream that they imagined. And now it falls to you to keep alive those virtues for which so many generations of Mexicans struggled. <p>You are the dream that can stand up for justice and human rights and human dignity, here at home and around the world. You're the creators and the builders and the climbers and the strivers who can deliver progress and prosperity that will lift up not just the Mexican people for generations to come, but the entire world. <p>You're the men and women who will push this nation upwards as Mexico assumes its rightful place, as you proudly sing, \\"in heaven your eternal destiny was written by the finger of God.\\" <p>You are the dream. This is your moment. And as you reach for the future, always remember that you have the greatest of partners, the greatest of friends, the nation that is rooting for your success more than anybody else, your neighbor, the United States of America. <p><i>Viva M&eacute;xico! Viva los Estados Unidos! Que Dios los bendiga!</i> Thank you very much.\" "
"95" "\"[<i>The President's remarks were joined in progress.</i>] <p><i>----------</i>during this visit. And I want to thank you for your thoughtful presentation about some of the agenda items that we need to address. <p>We last met as a group during the Summit of the Americas in 2009. And I was mentioning that at that time, I had less gray hair than you see today. I know that the United States is technically here in our observer status, and sometimes, that means that you observe, but don't speak, so I know that you're all indulging me by allowing to say a few words. But I am here, more than anything, to listen and hear the concerns that all of you have not only individually, but collectively as a region. <p>This is a region that has more than 40 million people. Every day they work to give their families and children a better life, and we're grateful for the strong bonds between the United States and the people who trace their origins to the countries that are represented at this table. <p>As governments, our job is to make sure that we're doing everything we can to provide security and opportunity and ladders for success and prosperity for our people: economic growth that creates jobs, security for people so that they can be safe in their own neighborhoods, and development that allows people to live in dignity. And so that's why we're here. <p>The agenda is a broad-based, socially inclusive agenda that ensures that our entire region and hemisphere are prospering. And in pursuit of that, I think some of the issues that President Chinchilla mentioned are going to be vital. <p>Number one, we need to think about investments in our infrastructure-----roads, bridges, border crossings, customs, electricity grids-----all of which can allow for more trade, more growth, more jobs. As I mentioned as we were walking in, this is a very competitive global environment. And it's important for us to recognize that if the hemisphere is working effectively together, all of us benefit. And if we're not, then we will lose in that competition to other regions. And we know that trade and investment flows to areas where there are strong public institutions, where there's accountability and transparency and effective governance. And I think one of the things that we need to talk about is how we can work together to help each other in those areas. <p>The second area that has been mentioned is energy. Costa Rica has shown great leadership in clean energy. And as somebody who believes in the challenges of climate change-----and I think that everybody in Central America has to be concerned about that given the history of natural disasters and the severe costs that take place here. We want to continue to pursue a whole range of energy strategies for the future: solar, wind, hydropower. It is true that the United States has been making great progress in oil and natural gas development due to new technologies. And I know that's something that's of interest to you, so that's an area that we can discuss. <p>But the bottom line is-----my concern is helping every country at this table reduce its energy costs, making its economy more efficient, because when you have high power costs, that's not only a tax on your citizens effectively, but it's also a situation that impedes growth over the long term. And so that's an area where we're very interested in helping. <p>Investing in people: In this knowledge-based economy, if we don't have the best workers in the world, the most highly skilled and trained workers in the world, then we're going to lose. And it's important to recognize that we need high-skilled labor throughout the hemisphere, because our economies have become more integrated. And if you look at that global value chain, we want to be not at the bottom, but we want to be nearer to the top because that means more prosperity for our people. So everything we can do to train our young people in math, science, technology, and everything we can do to pool our resources to help achieve those goals, I think, will end up benefiting everybody. <p>And by the way, I think it's very important, those countries that are succeeding are investing in the development of their young people, not just some young people, but women and girls, indigenous communities. It's important that we don't go onto the field with just half our team. We've got to make sure that the entire team is on the field. That's how we're going to succeed. <p>And then finally, the issue of citizen security, obviously, that's something that's important. During this trip I've tried to make the point that we are interested in cooperating with every country around issues of citizen security. We know what a major toll it's taken. We are obviously deeply concerned about narcotrafficking and the drug trade. <p>I was asked a question about this in a press conference that President Chinchilla and I were doing, and the questioner suggested, given all the violence that is taking place in Central America, how does America feel about that. And I had to remind people that we have violence in the United States. If you go to my hometown of Chicago, and you go to some neighborhoods, they're just as violence, if not more violent than some of the countries at this table, in part because of the pernicious influence of the drug trade. <p>And so-----but what I also believe is that we can't just have a law enforcement---only approach. We also have to have a prevention approach. We have to have an education approach. We have to think creatively, because obviously, some of the things that we're doing have worked, but some things haven't worked. We've got to think about institution building and capacity in our law enforcement and our judicial systems. Those are all going to be very important, and I know that the work that we've done together has made some progress, but I'm interested in learning more about other things that we can do. <p>So I've spoken long enough considering I'm an observer, but I just want to again say thank you to all of you for taking the time to come meet with me. I know that all of you are extraordinarily busy and have great demands on your time. So for you to come in is something that I'm very grateful for, and I'm looking forward to a good discussion.\" "
"96" "\"Hi, everybody. Today I'm speaking to you from the road, a trip to Mexico and Costa Rica. I'm here because Latin America represents an incredible opportunity for the United States, especially when it comes to my top priority as President, which is creating good, middle class jobs. <p>On Friday, we learned that our businesses created another 176,000 jobs last month. And that's 2.2 million new jobs over the past year and 6.8 million new jobs over the past 38 months. But as I've said before, I won't be satisfied until everyone who wants a job can find one. So I'm going to keep doing everything I can and go everywhere I need to go to help our businesses create jobs. <p>Now, one of the best ways to grow our economy is to sell more goods and services made in America to the rest of the world. And that includes our neighbors to the south. Right now over 40 percent of our exports go to the Americas. And those exports are growing faster than our trade with the rest of the world. And that's why I visited Latin America this week, to work with leaders to deepen our economic ties and expand trade between our nations. <p>In Mexico, I also talked about immigration reform because that's an important issue that affects both our countries. The truth is, right now our border with Mexico is more secure than it's been in years. We've put more boots on that border than at any time in our history, and illegal crossings are down by nearly 80 percent from their peak in 2000. But we've got more to do, not just to secure the border, but to fix an immigration system that is badly broken. <p>In recent weeks, we've seen a commonsense immigration reform bill introduced in the Senate. This bill is a compromise, which means that nobody got everything they wanted, including me. But it's largely consistent with the principles I've laid out from the beginning. <p>It would continue to strengthen security at our borders and hold employers more accountable if they knowingly hire undocumented workers. It would provide a pathway to earned citizenship for the 11 million individuals who are already living in this country illegally. And it would modernize our legal immigration system so that we're able to reunite families and attract the highly skilled entrepreneurs and engineers who will help create good paying jobs and grow our economy. <p>These are all commonsense steps that the majority of Americans support. So there's no reason that immigration reform can't become a reality this year. <p>In the meantime, I'll keep working with our neighbors on our common security and our common prosperity. Millions of Americans earn a living right now because of the trade between our nations. And after this week, I'm as confident as ever that we can build on our shared heritage and values to open more markets for American businesses and create more jobs for American workers. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"97" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. Hello, Buckeyes! O-H! <p><i>Audience members.</i> I-O! <p><i>The President.</i> O-H! <p><i>Audience members.</i> I-O! <p><i>The President.</i> O-H! <p><i>Audience members.</i> I-O! <p><i>The President.</i> Well, thank you so much. Everybody, please be seated. Thank you, Dr. Gee, for the wonderful introduction. I suspect the good president may have edited out some other words that were used to describe me. [<i>Laughter</i>] I appreciate that. But I'm going to let Michelle know of all the good comments. <p>To the Board of Trustees; Congresswoman Beatty, Mayor Coleman, and all of you who make up the Ohio State University for allowing me to join you: It is an incredible honor. <p>And most of all, congratulations, class of 2013. And of course, congratulations to all the parents and family and friends and faculty here in the Horseshoe. This is your day as well. I've been told to ask everybody, though, please be careful with the turf. Coach Meyer has big plans for this fall. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I very much appreciate the president's introduction. I will not be singing today. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience members.</i> Aww. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Aww. [<i>Laughter</i>]. It is true that I did speak at that certain university up north a few years ago. But to be fair, you did let President Ford speak here once, and he played football for Michigan. [<i>Laughter</i>] So everybody can get some redemption. <p>In my defense, this is my fifth visit to campus in the past year or so. One time, I stopped at Sloppy's to grab some lunch. Many of you&mdash;Sloopy's&mdash;I know. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's Sunday, and I'm coming off a foreign trip. [<i>Laughter</i>] Anyway, so I'm at Sloopy's, and many of you were still eating breakfast. At 11:30. [<i>Laughter</i>] On a Tuesday. [<i>Laughter</i>] So to the class of 2013, I will offer my first piece of advice: Enjoy it while you can. [<i>Laughter</i>] Soon, you will not get to wake up and have breakfast at 11:30 on Tuesday. [<i>Laughter</i>] And once you have children, it gets even earlier. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But, class of 2013, your path to this moment has wound you through years of breathtaking change. You were born as freedom forced its way through a wall in Berlin, tore down an Iron Curtain across Europe. You were educated in an era of instant information that put the world's accumulated knowledge at your fingertips. And you came of age as terror touched our shores and a historic recession spread across the Nation and a new generation signed up to go to war. <p>So you've been tested and you've been tempered by events that your parents and I never imagined we'd see when we sat where you sit. And yet, despite all this&mdash;or perhaps because of it&mdash;yours has become a generation possessed with that most American of ideas: that people who love their country can change it for the better. For all the turmoil, for all the times you've been let down or frustrated at the hands that you've been dealt, what I have seen&mdash;what we have witnessed from your generation&mdash;is that perennial, quintessentially American value of optimism, altruism, empathy, tolerance, a sense of community, a sense of service, all of which makes me optimistic for our future. <p>Consider that today, 50 ROTC cadets in your graduating class will become commissioned officers in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines. A hundred and thirty of your fellow graduates have already served: some in combat, some on multiple deployments. Of the 98 veterans earning bachelor's degrees today, 20 are graduating with honors, and at least one kept serving his fellow veterans when he came home by starting up a campus organization called Vets4Vets. And as your Commander in Chief, I could not be prouder of all of you. <p>Consider that graduates of this university serve their country through the Peace Corps and educate our children through established programs like Teach for America, startups like Blue Engine, often earning little pay for making the biggest impact. Some of you have already launched startup companies of your own. And I suspect that those of you who pursue more education or climb the corporate ladder or enter the arts or science or journalism, you will still choose a cause that you care about in your life and you will fight like heck to realize your vision. <p>There is a word for this, it's citizenship. And we don't always talk about this idea much these days&mdash;citizenship&mdash;let alone celebrate it. Sometimes, we see it as a virtue from another time, a distant past, one that's slipping from a society that celebrates individual ambition above all else, a society awash in instant technology that empowers us to leverage our skills and talents like never before, but just as easily allows us to retreat from the world. And the result is that we sometimes forget the larger bonds we share as one American family. <p>But it's still out there, all the time, every day, especially when we need it most. Just look at the past year. When a hurricane struck our mightiest city and a factory exploded in a small town in Texas, we saw citizenship. When bombs went off in Boston and when a malevolent spree of gunfire visited a movie theater, a temple, an Ohio high school, a first-grade classroom in Connecticut, we saw citizenship. In the aftermath of darkest tragedy, we have seen the American spirit at its brightest. <p>We've seen the petty divisions of color and class and creed replaced by a united urge to help each other. We've seen courage and compassion, a sense of civic duty, and a recognition, we are not a collection of strangers: We are bound to one another by a set of ideals and laws and commitments and a deep devotion to this country that we love. <p>And that's what citizenship is. It's at the heart of our founding, that as Americans, we are blessed with God-given talents and inalienable rights, but with those rights come responsibilities: to ourselves and to one another and to future generations. <p>Now, if we're being honest with ourselves, as you've studied and worked and served to become good citizens, the fact is that all too often, the institutions that give structure to our society have, at times, betrayed your trust. In the runup to the financial crisis, too many on Wall Street forgot that their obligations don't end with what's happening with their shares. In entertainment and in the media, ratings and shock value often trump news and storytelling. <p>In Washington&mdash;well, this is a joyous occasion, so let me put it charitably&mdash;I think it's fair to say our democracy isn't working as well as we know it can. It could do better. And so those of us fortunate enough to serve in these institutions owe it to you to do better every single day. <p>And I've been thinking a lot lately about how we can keep this idea of citizenship in its fullest sense alive at the national level, not just on election day, not just in times of tragedy, but all the days in between. And perhaps because I spend a lot of time in Washington, I'm obsessed with this issue, because that sense of citizenship is so sorely needed there. And I think of what your generation's traits&mdash;compassion and energy and a sense of selflessness&mdash;might mean for a democracy that must adapt more quickly to keep up with the speed of technological and demographic and wrenching economic change. <p>I think about how we might perpetuate this notion of citizenship in a way that another politician from my home State of Illinois, Adlai Stevenson, once described patriotism: not as \\"short, frenzied outbursts of emotion, but the tranquil and steady dedication of a lifetime.\\" That's what patriotism is. That's what citizenship is. <p>Now, I don't pretend to have all the answers. I'm not going to offer some grand theory on a beautiful day like this. You guys all have celebrating to do. I'm not going to get partisan, either, because that's not what citizenship is about. In fact, I'm asking the same thing of you that President Bush did when he spoke at this commencement in 2002. \\"America needs more than taxpayers, spectators, and occasional voters,\\" he said. \\"America needs full-time citizens.\\" And as graduates from a university&mdash;as a graduate from a university whose motto is, \\"Education for Citizenship,\\" I know all of you get that this is what you've signed up for. It's what your country expects of you. <p>So, briefly, I'll ask for two things from the class of 2013: to participate and to persevere. After all, your democracy does not function without your active participation. At a bare minimum that means voting: eagerly and often, not having somebody drag you to it at 11:30 when you're having breakfast. [<i>Laughter</i>] It means knowing who's been elected to make decisions on your behalf and what they believe in and whether or not they delivered on what they said they would. And if they don't represent you the way you want or conduct themselves the way you expect, if they put special interests above your own, you've got to let them know, that's not okay. And if they let you down often enough, there's a built-in day in November where you can really let them know, it's not okay. <p>But participation, your civic duty, is more than just voting. You don't have to run for office yourself, but I hope many of you do, at all levels, because our democracy needs you. And I promise you, it will give you a tough skin. I know a little bit about this. President Wilson once said, \\"If you want to make enemies, try to change something.&rdquo; <p>And that's precisely what the Founders left us: the power&mdash;each of us&mdash;to adapt to changing times. They left us the keys to a system of self-government, the tools to do big things and important things together that we could not possibly do alone: to stretch railroads and electricity and a highway system across a sprawling continent; to educate our people with a system of public schools and land-grant colleges, including the Ohio State University; to care for the sick and the vulnerable and provide a basic level of protection from falling into abject poverty in the wealthiest nation on Earth; to conquer fascism and disease; to visit the Moon and Mars; to gradually secure our God-given rights for all of our citizens, regardless of who they are or what they look like or who they love. <p>We, the people, chose to do these things together because we know this country cannot accomplish great things if we pursue nothing greater than our own individual ambition. <p>Unfortunately, you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate, sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems, some of these same voices also doing their best to gum up the works. They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner. You should reject these voices because what they suggest is that our brave and creative and unique experiment in self-rule is somehow just a sham with which we can't be trusted. <p>We have never been a people who place all of our faith in government to solve our problems; we shouldn't want to. But we don't think the government is the source of all our problems either. Because we understand that this democracy is ours. And as citizens, we understand that it's not about what America can do for us, it's about what can be done by us, together, through the hard and frustrating, but absolutely necessary work of self-government. And, class of 2013, you have to be involved in that process. <p>The Founders trusted us with this awesome authority. We should trust ourselves with it too. Because when we don't, when we turn away and get discouraged and cynical and abdicate that authority, we grant our silent consent to someone who will gladly claim it. That's how we end up with lobbyists who set the agenda and policies detached from what middle class families face every day, the well connected who publicly demand that Washington stay out of their business and then whisper in government's ear for special treatment that you don't get. <p>That's how a small minority of lawmakers get cover to defeat something the vast majority of their constituents want. That's how our political system gets consumed by small things when we are a people called to do great things like: rebuild a middle class and reverse the rise of inequality and repair the deteriorating climate that threatens everything we plan to leave for our kids and our grandkids. <p>Class of 2013, only you can ultimately break that cycle. Only you can make sure the democracy you inherit is as good as we know it can be. But it requires your dedicated and informed and engaged citizenship. And that citizenship is a harder, higher road to take, but it leads to a better place. It's how we built this country: together. <p>It's the question that President Kennedy posed to the Nation at his Inauguration. It's the dream that Dr. King invoked. It does not promise easy success or immediate progress, but it has led to success, and it has led to progress, and it has to continue with you. <p>Which brings me to the second thing I ask of all of you: I ask that you persevere. Whether you start a business or run for office or devote yourself to alleviating poverty or hunger, please remember that nothing worth doing happens overnight. A British inventor named Dyson went through more than 5,000 prototypes before getting that first really fancy vacuum cleaner just right. We remember Michael Jordan's six championships; we don't remember his nearly 15,000 missed shots. As for me, I lost my first race for Congress, and look at me now: I'm an honorary graduate of the Ohio State University. <p>The point is, if you are living your life to the fullest, you will fail, you will stumble, you will screw up, you will fall down. But it will make you stronger, and you'll get it right the next time or the time after that or the time after that. And that is not only true for your personal pursuits, but it's also true for the broader causes that you believe in as well. <p>So you can't give up your passion if things don't work right away. You can't lose heart or grow cynical if there are twists and turns on your journey. The cynics may be the loudest voices, but I promise you, they will accomplish the least. It's those folks who stay at it, those who do the long, hard, committed work of change that gradually push this country in the right direction and make the most lasting difference. <p>So whenever you feel that creeping cynicism, whenever you hear those voices saying you can't do it, you can't make a difference, whenever somebody tells you to set your sights lower, the trajectory of this great Nation should give you hope. What generations have done before you should give you hope, because it was young people just like you who marched and mobilized and stood up and sat in to secure women's rights and voting rights and workers' rights and gay rights, often at incredible odds, often at great danger, often over the course of years, sometimes over the tranquil and steady dedication of a lifetime. And they never got acknowledged for it, but they made a difference. <p>And even if their rights were already secured, there were those who fought to secure those same rights and opportunities for others. And that should give you some hope. <p>Where we're going should give you hope, because while things are still hard for a lot of people, you have every reason to believe that your future is bright. You're graduating into an economy and a job market that is steadily healing. The once-dying American auto industry is on pace for its strongest performance in 20 years, something that means everything to many communities in Ohio and across the Midwest. Huge strides in domestic energy, driven in part by research at universities like this one, have us on track to secure our own energy future. Incredible advances in information and technology, spurred largely by the risk takers of your generation, have the potential to change the way we do almost everything. <p>There is not another country on Earth that would not gladly change places with the United States of America, and that will be true for your generation just as it was true for previous generations. <p>So you've got a lot to look forward to, but if there's one certainty about the decade ahead, it's that things will be uncertain. Change will be a constant, just as it has been throughout our history. And yes, we still face many important challenges. Some will require technological breakthroughs or new policy insights. But more than anything, what we will need is political will: to harness the ingenuity of your generation and encourage and inspire the hard work of dedicated citizens; to repair the middle class; to give more families a fair shake; to reject a country in which only a lucky few prosper, because that's antithetical to our ideals and our democracy. All of this is going to happen if you are involved, because it takes dogged determination, the dogged determination of our citizens. <p>To educate more children at a younger age and to reform our high schools for a new time and to give more young people the chance to earn the kind of education that you did at the Ohio State University and to make it more affordable so that young people don't leave with a mountain of debt, that will take the care and concern of citizens like you. <p>To build better roads and airports and faster Internet and to advance the kinds of basic research and technology that's always kept America ahead of everybody else, that will take the grit and fortitude of citizens. <p>To confront the threat of climate change before it's too late, that requires the idealism and the initiative of citizens. <p>To protect more of our kids from the horrors of gun violence, that requires the unwavering passion, the untiring resolve of citizens. It will require you. <p>Fifty years ago, President Kennedy told the class of 1963 that \\"our problems are manmade&mdash;therefore, they can be solved by man. And man can be as big as he wants.\\" We're blessed to live in the greatest nation on Earth. But we can always be greater. We can always aspire to something more. That doesn't depend on who you elect to office. It depends on you as citizens, how big you want us to be, how badly you want to see these changes for the better. <p>And look at all that America has already accomplished. Look at how big we've been. I dare you, class of 2013, to do better. I dare you to dream bigger. <p>And from what I've seen of your generation, I'm confident that you will. And so I wish you courage and compassion and all the strength that you will need for that tranquil and steady dedication of a lifetime. <p>Thank you. God bless you, and God bless these United States of America.\" "
"98" "\"Hello, Texas. Well, howdy, Manor. Go Titans! Now, I hear that there's a rule that anyone who gives a presentation in front of the class has to dress up, so I made sure to wear a tie. [<i>Laughter</i>] I didn't want to lose points. <p>I want to thank Tevyn for the very generous introduction. Give Tevyn a big round of applause. I want to thank Principal Zipkes for his great work. I want to thank Dylan and Jahman for showing me around. Great job. <p>We've got a number of other luminaries here today. First of all, we've got Acting Secretaries of Commerce and Labor, Becky Blank and Seth Harris. There they are right there. Becky is going to be leaving us to become the president of the University of Wisconsin&mdash;Madison. So the&mdash;if you all are interested in cold weather, you can apply. [<i>Laughter</i>] You've got the hookup right here. And she's going to do a great job. <p>We've got Congressman Lloyd Doggett, who's here. We've got Mayor Jeff Turner, who's here. And it is Teacher Appreciation Week. So all the teachers, raise your hands. Everybody give them a big round of applause. We appreciate you. Teachers work hard every single day, and they don't do it for the money. They do it because of the love of learning and the love of their students. And so we could not be prouder of them, and we are grateful to all of them. And I want to thank all of you for a Texas-sized welcome. <p>Now, those of you who have seats, feel free to sit down. Those of you who don't, you're out of luck. [<i>Laughter</i>] So you got to keep standing. <p>The&mdash;so this is the first stop that I'm making on a tour of the Austin area today. And I chose Austin, partly because I just love Austin, but also because there are some terrific things going on in this area, in communities like Manor. And there are terrific things going on in communities all across the country that are good models for all of America to follow. <p>You might not know this, because if you listen to all the doom and gloom in Washington, in politics, and you're watching cable TV sometimes, you might get kind of thinking, nothing is going right. But the truth is, there's a lot of reasons for us to feel optimistic about where we're headed as a country, especially after all the tough times that we've been through over the last several years. And that should encourage us to roll up our sleeves and work even harder and work together to take on the challenges that are still holding back parts of our economy. <p>Now, in a little over 3 years, our businesses have now created more than 6.5 million new jobs. And while our unemployment rate is still too high, it's actually the lowest that it's been since 2008. But that's not good enough. Now we've got to create even more good, middle class jobs, and we've got to do it faster so that by the time you guys graduate from college the job market is strong. <p>Corporate profits have skyrocketed to alltime highs. But that's not good enough. We've got to make sure that middle class wages and incomes are also going up, because most families haven't seen their take-home pay rise for years now. Our housing market is healing, but that's not good enough. We still need to help a lot more families stay in their homes or refinance to take advantage of historically low interest rates. <p>Our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in years. But now we've got to budget in a smarter way so it doesn't hurt middle class families or prevent us from making the critical investments that we need for your future. <p>So a lot of sectors of our economy are doing better. The American auto industry is thriving. American energy is booming. American ingenuity in our tech sector continues to be the best in the world and has the potential to change almost everything that we do. And thanks to the grit and determination of the American people, we've cleared away the rubble of the worst economic crisis in our lifetimes. <p>So we're poised for progress. All across America, Americans are working harder and they're living up to their responsibilities, both to themselves and to one another and to their communities, every single day. Part of our challenge, though, is you've got to try to see the same kind of seriousness of purpose in your leaders. From Washington to Wall Street, all of us have to commit ourselves to doing better than we're doing now. <p>And all of us have to rally around the single greatest challenge that we face as a country right now, and that's reigniting the true engine of economic growth: a rising, thriving middle class, where if you work hard&mdash;no matter what you look like, where you come from&mdash;you can succeed. That's what we're fighting for. <p>Now, there are three things that we've got to focus on to create more jobs and opportunity for the middle class. First of all, we've got to make America a magnet for good jobs. Second, we've got to help people earn the education and develop the skills they need to do those jobs. And number three, we've got to make sure that people who are working hard are able to achieve a decent living. All right? That's what we've got to focus on. <p>And I've sent Congress proposals on a whole range of ideas that will help in these three areas: creating jobs, helping families stay in their homes, lifting wages, helping more young people get a good education and afford college. But some of them have been blocked in Congress for frankly political reasons. And I'm going to keep on trying. I'm a very&mdash;I'm an optimistic guy, so I'm just going to keep on talking to Members of Congress, because I believe that America does best when we work together. I believe that. <p>Every once in a while, I'm going to need your help to lean on your elected representatives and say, hey, let's do something about this; even if don't like it politically, if it's a good idea, let's go ahead and support it. So sometimes, I'm going to need constituents to pressure their Members of Congress to do the right thing. <p>But where I can, I'm just going to go ahead and take action on my own, including some executive actions that I'm taking today that I'm convinced will spur innovation and help businesses create more jobs, because we know what's possible when Americans&mdash;whether they're Republicans or Democrats or Independents&mdash;are working together and when parents and teachers and business owners and local leaders come together. <p>And that's what we're seeing here in Austin. We're seeing people working together, not because of politics, not because of some selfish reason, but because folks here understand that when we're all working together, everybody does better, everybody succeeds. <p>So over the last 3 years in the Austin area, businesses have created 85,000 new jobs. And companies like Apple and Visa are getting ready to open new offices. General Motors is already hiring at its new innovation center. According to one report, the tech sector now drives more than one-quarter of Austin's economy. And all of this has helped to make Austin one of the fastest growing cities in America. <p>So folks around here are doing something right, and I think the rest of the country can learn from what you're doing because I've always believed that the best ideas usually don't start in Washington, they trickle up to Washington. So I've come to listen and learn and highlight some of the good work that's being done. <p>This afternoon I'm going to go visit a local factory where workers are building the equipment that makes cutting-edge microchips. All those smartphones and iPads and&mdash;that you guys are using, a lot of this stuff is made there. I'm going to have lunch with some local families to talk about what they're facing, the challenges that they're facing, and figure out how we can make sure that people's hard work pays off. <p>But as you can see, my first stop was Manor New Tech. [<i>Applause</i>] That's my first stop. And the reason is because our economy can't succeed unless our young people have the skills that they need to succeed. And that's what's happening here, right at Manor New Tech. There's a reason why teachers and principals from all over the country are coming down to see what you're up to. Because every day, this school is proving that every child has the potential to learn the real-world skills they need to succeed in college and beyond. <p>And you all are doing it together. At Manor, a history teacher might get together with a math teacher and develop a project about the impact of castles on world history and the engineering behind building castles. Or a group of students might be in charge of putting together a multimedia presentation about the moral dilemmas in literature as applied to World War II. Internships help students get even more hands-on experience. And while most high school students in America give a handful of speeches by the time they graduate, a student at this school might give as many as 200. Now, that's a lot of speeches. I can relate. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And I just had a chance to see some of the incredible work that some of the young people here are doing: folks who used mathematical equations to build musical instruments, and tests on bungee jumping with rubber bands and weights, and robots that were being built, and all kinds of great stuff. And you're doing things a little differently around here than a lot of high schools, and it's working. [<i>Applause</i>] It's working. <p>And by the way, the majority of students at Manor don't come from wealth or privilege. Some folks here might have come from some pretty tough backgrounds. And yet the vast majority of students here stay in school, they graduate. Your test scores in most subjects have been higher than the State average. Almost every member of the recent graduating class went on to college, and about 60 percent of them were the first in their families to do so. You should be proud of that. <p>And you can see it when I was talking to some of your classmates on the projects they were working on. There were a couple of your classmates who were studying how earthworms regenerate when they're injured. I saw solar cars. Your championship regional \\"TEXplosion\\" robotics team competed in the world championships a couple of weeks ago. And this program has only been around for 5 years. <p>So this is an impressive group. And the teachers here, you can tell, are passionate about what they do and couldn't be more impressive, although, some of them look like they were in high school. [<i>Laughter</i>] There were a couple of them I met, I said, are you sure you're a teacher? [<i>Laughter</i>] No, not you. You look like you're&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I'm teasing. You really are a student. I know. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But it's important to remember that, every year, schools like Manor New Tech hold blind lotteries to determine who gets in, because there just aren't enough spots for all the students who want to go to a school like this one. There are too many kids in America who are not getting the same kinds of opportunities through no fault of their own, and we can do better than that. [<i>Applause</i>] We can do better than that. <p>Every young person in America deserves a world-class education. We've got an obligation to give it to them. And, by the way, that helps the whole economy. Every business in America, we want to draw from the world's highest skilled and most educated workforce. We can make that happen. But we're going to have to put our shoulder against the wheel and work a little harder than we're doing right now as a nation. <p>So number one, we've got to start educating our kids at the earliest possible age. And that means giving every child in America access to high-quality, public preschool, something that I'm pushing for. <p>Every dollar that we put into early childhood education can save $7 down the road because it boosts graduation rates, reduces things like teen pregnancy and violent crime, helps young people succeed not just in high school, but beyond. So let's make that happen. Let's make every child's early success a recipe for long-term success. We can do that. <p>We've also got to make sure that we help more students at more schools get the kinds of skills they're getting here at Manor Tech to compete in a high-tech economy. So that's why we're working to recruit and train 100,000 new teachers in science and technology, engineering and math; helping our most talented teachers serve as mentors for their colleagues so that they can help to push the great stuff that's going on here out to other schools throughout the State and throughout the country. <p>We've also got to start rethinking and redesigning America's high schools. That's part of what's happening here is, there's innovation going on that equip graduates for the demands of a high-tech economy. There's a lot of hands-on learning here. People aren't just sitting at a desk reading all the time. Reading is important. I'm a big reader. But part of what makes this place special is, is that there's all this integration of various subjects and actual projects and young people doing and not just sitting there listening, so we've got to reward schools like this one that focus on the fields of the future<i>&mdash;</i>schools that focus on the fields of the future, use technology effectively to help students learn, and are also developing partnerships with local colleges and businesses so that a diploma here leads directly to a good job. <p>And finally, we know that even with better high schools, if you want a good job and work your way into the middle class, most young people are going to need some higher education. Unfortunately, in recent years, college costs have skyrocketed, and that's left too many students and their families saddled with a mountain of debt. So we've worked to make college more affordable for millions of students already and families through tax credits and grants, more access to student loans that go farther than before. We've reformed the student loan process by putting students ahead of big banks, providing options to make it easier for young people to repay these loans. <p>But even if we do all that, if the price of higher education keeps going up, then eventually, there's not going to be enough money to help young people. So we've got to figure out how to reduce college costs. And that's why my administration has released what we're calling a college scorecard that gives parents and students the clear, concise information that you'll need to find a school that best fits your needs, but also gives you the best value. Gives you the best value. It's like a consumer report for colleges, because you don't want a lemon, and you don't want too much debt. <p>And going forward, colleges that don't do enough to keep costs down, I think, should get less taxpayer support. We want to support the schools that are doing a great job giving good value to students. That's what we want. And young people and families, you shouldn't have to subsidize skyrocketing costs if the colleges aren't trying hard enough to keep costs down and provide a high-quality education. <p>So I could not be prouder of what's happening here at Manor. That's why I wanted to come. Last month, students in a digital media class made a YouTube video describing why this school was so special. Some students talked about how they're looking forward to being the first in their family to go to college. Others talked about learning new skills, taking on more responsibility. And one sophomore summed it up nicely when she said: \\"This school is a lot more than just a school. It's a family. And it's filled with people that are going to care about you and are going to help you.\\" <p>Well, Manor, that's what every school should be. That's what our country should be: caring for each other, helping each another, being invested in each other's success. We're not just a collection of individuals, we're one American family. And if we follow Manor's example, if we give every child the chance to climb new ladders of opportunity, if we equip every American with the skills and education they need to succeed in the jobs of the future, if we make sure that hard work pays off and responsibility is rewarded, and if we fight to keep America a place where you can make it if you try, then you're not just going to be the ones who prosper, we'll all prosper. And together, we'll write the next great chapter in America's history. <p>So thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"99" "\"Hello, Austin! How you doing? Well, it is wonderful to see all of you here today. First of all, give Nicole an outstanding round of applause for the great job that she did. <p>It is wonderful to be here at Applied Materials. I want to thank Mike and everybody who helped out hosting us and a wonderful tour of the facility. It was incredible. Rick was showing me some of your clean rooms where you are building the equipment that makes the chips that is basically powering&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that's basically powering everything that you guys are taking pictures with right now. [<i>Laughter</i>] Smartphones, computers, iPads, laptops. And it is just remarkable to see. Every time I walk through these kinds of facilities, I'm thinking: now, this is just magic. I don't know how they do it. <p>Somebody was explaining to me that&mdash;I guess one of the wafers was being cleaned, and he said, this would be the equivalent&mdash;it was Alex who told me this; Alex is around here somewhere&mdash;the equivalent of, if you were mowing the South Lawn, but every blade of grass was exactly cut at the same height within a single human hair. That's how precise things are. That sounds pretty precise to me. And if that's, by the way, the precision that you operate on, if that's how you define a clean room, then Sasha and Malia are going to have to step up their game at home. [<i>Laughter</i>] Because it is not that clean. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to thank your Mayor, Lee Leffingwell, and&mdash;who's doing a great job. Lee is doing outstanding work every day and helping to bring the Austin community together. Congressman Lloyd Doggett is here. They've been great hosts. We actually have a special guest: The Mayor of San Antonio in the house, my friend Julian Castro is here. <p>Now, I've spent the day in Austin talking with folks about what we can do to reignite the true engine of America's economic growth: a thriving, rising middle class and a dynamic, cutting-edge economy. That's our priority. That should be Washington's top priority. And I see three things that we need to focus on to do it. <p>Number one, we've got to make America a magnet for good jobs. Number two, we've got to help people earn the skills they need to do those jobs. Number three, we've got to make sure people's hard work is rewarded so that they can make a decent living doing those jobs. <p>And if you watch the news sometimes, you may think that there's just doom and gloom out there. But the truth is, there's incredible stuff going on all across America and right here in Austin that I think can be good models for the rest of America to follow. <p>This morning I visited Manor New Tech High School where students are learning high-tech skills that companies like Applied are looking for right now. They are getting excited, working with math and science and technology and engineering. And it's a hands-on high school, where subjects are integrated and kids are building things and conducting experiments at very early ages. And it's sparking their imagination in ways that may lead them to start up the next Applied or come here and work at Applied. <p>And then I joined a few local families for lunch to talk about how we can make sure that hard work pays off with wages you can live on and raise a family, with health care that you can count on and the chance to put away some money for retirement. And we also had good barbecue&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;which is necessary for economic growth. [<i>Laughter</i>] Some good barbecue once in a while. And then I came to Applied Materials to talk about what we can do to make America a magnet for new jobs in manufacturing. <p>And after shedding jobs for a decade, our manufacturers have added now about 500,000 new manufacturing jobs over the past 3 years. [<i>Applause</i>] That's good news. Caterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan, and Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico. And after placing plants in other countries like China, Intel is opening its most advanced plant right here at home. This year, Apple started making Macs in America again. <p>So there are some good trend lines there, but we've got to do everything we can to strengthen that trend. We've got to do everything we can to help the kind of high-tech manufacturing that you're doing right here at Applied. And we want to make sure it takes root here in Austin and all across the country. And that means, first of all, creating more centers of high-tech manufacturing. <p>Last year, we launched our first manufacturing innovation institute in Youngstown, Ohio, to develop new technologies and equip workers with the skills required to master 3-D printing techniques. And in my State of the Union Address, I called on Congress to set up 15 more of these manufacturing hubs all across America, and I said that my administration was going to go ahead and move forward with three new hubs on our own, even without congressional action. <p>Well, today we're launching a competition for those hubs. We are looking for businesses and universities that are willing to partner together to help their region&mdash;help turn their region into global centers of high-tech jobs. Because we want the next revolution in manufacturing to be made in America. [<i>Applause</i>] We're going to do that. <p>The truth is, over the past couple decades, too many communities have been hit hard when plants closed down and jobs dried up. The economy obviously is changing all the time. Nobody knows that better than folks here at Applied. I was talking to somebody who's&mdash;after showing me the wafer and some chips, and then they showed me a smartphone, they pointed to the smartphone, and they said, 40 years ago, there'd be about $3 billion just trying to get this much computing power in this little thing, except it would fill up a whole room. <p>And so the economy is dynamic. Technology is constantly changing. That means we've got to adapt as well. And even as we're working to reverse the trend of communities that have been hard hit with old manufacturing leaving, we've got to propose partnerships with local leaders in manufacturing communities to help attract new investment in the infrastructure and the research that will attract new jobs and new businesses so that communities that have been knocked down can get back up and get back on their feet. <p>And we should help our workers get the training they need to compete for the industries of tomorrow. No job in America should go unfilled just because we don't have anybody with the right skills. And that's a priority. Now, some of your colleagues that I met, some of them have advanced degrees. Some of them came to apply basically right out of high school. But all of you, whether it was in some cases through a university education, in some cases the military, in some cases just on-the-job training, all of you have specialized skills that are exactly what we need to continue to grow our economy. But we've got a whole bunch of folks out there who don't have those skills, either because the education system failed them or because their skills have been rendered obsolete. <p>And that's why I want to rethink how our high school kids are prepared. I want to make sure that we're training 2 million Americans at our community colleges for skills that will lead directly to a job. We&mdash;and that's also why we've got to make sure that college is affordable and people aren't burdened by a mountain of debt so that they can continue to upgrade their skills as well. <p>Now, if we want to manufacture the best products, we've also got to invest in and cultivate the best ideas. All right? Innovation, ingenuity, that's the constant of the American economy. That's one of the constants of our character. It's what keeps America on the cutting edge. <p>And just before I came here, I visited the Capital Factory, which, as some of you know, is a place that helps startups take off. And everywhere you turn, somebody has got a new idea. They're all thinking big. They're taking risks. It's exciting. <p>There was a young woman who is in a wheelchair and physically disabled, but is just incredibly inspired to make sure that she's not in any way confined by that situation. And she's basically designed and is now manufacturing a car that people in wheelchairs can just drive their wheelchair right into the car and start driving. <p>And then you had a young man who had a 3-D camera&mdash;it was about this big&mdash;and basically from filming either a static image or in the round, can basically download that immediately and create a 3-D image and then use that for 3-D manufacturing&mdash;3-D printing and manufacturing. And what currently costs about $80,000, costs about $3,000&mdash;the technology that he's developed. So they're doing amazing stuff. <p>And one of the things we're doing to fuel more inventiveness like this&mdash;to fuel more private sector innovation and discovery&mdash;is to make the vast amounts of America's data open and easy to access for the first time in history. So talented entrepreneurs are doing some pretty amazing stuff with data that's already being collected by Government. <p>So over at the Capital Factory, I met with folks behind the startup called Stormpulse, which uses Government data on weather to help businesses anticipate disruptions in service. And then you've got a Virginia company called Opower, that's used Government data on trends in energy use to save its customers $200 million on their energy bills. There's an app called iTriage, founded by a pair of ER doctors that uses data from the Department of Health and Human Services to help users understand medical symptoms and find local doctors and health care providers. <p>And today I'm announcing that we're making even more Government data available and we're making it easier for people to find and to use. And that's going to help launch more startups. It's going to help launch more businesses. Some of them undoubtedly will be using this data powered by chips that essentially started right here at Applied Materials. It's going to help more entrepreneurs come up with products and services that we haven't even imagined yet. <p>This kind of innovation and ingenuity has the potential to transform the way we do almost everything. One-third of jobs in Austin are now supported by the tech sector. And we should do all that we can to encourage this kind of innovation economy all across America, in ways that produce new jobs and new opportunities for the middle class. <p>And we're poised for a time of progress if we're willing to seize it. Not even 5 years after the worst economic crisis in our lifetimes, our jobs market and our housing market are steadily healing. Our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in decades. The American auto industry has made a comeback; it's thriving. American energy is booming. But we've got to keep on moving forward, and we've got to make sure that Washington is not administering self-inflicted wounds when we're making progress. <p>So Mike and I were talking about the fact that if we can reform our tax system to eliminate some of these loopholes, potentially, we could lower some rates. That would make our businesses more competitive. <p>Basic research, you'll hear people talk about how government is not going to do anything for us. Well, we all understand that the private sector powers and drives our economy. On the other hand, most of the private sector right now has a lot of trouble financing basic research. And that basic research is the foundation for everything that's done at this company, and everything that's done for most of your customers. And we can't afford to fall behind when it comes to basic research. So there's some key things that we can do that shouldn't be ideological. They're not Democratic ideas or Republican ideas or Independent ideas, they're just good ideas that allow the government to help create the foundation, the platform, the environment in which companies like Applied Materials can thrive. And that's what we've got to constantly champion. <p>And when you're talking to your Members of Congress or you're talking to elected officials, you've got to remind them we don't want government to do everything for us, but it's got a role to play on infrastructure, basic research, making sure that we've got a fair&mdash;a tax system that's fair, making sure that we've got some basic stability in our budget so people aren't always guessing what's going to happen around the corner. <p>Think about how this company was built. Back in 1967, when Applied Materials was just getting off the ground, there were five employees. They worked out of this small industrial unit in California. And I suppose they had a clean room in there, but I don't know what it looked like. [<i>Laughter</i>] But what they lacked in size, they made up with ingenuity and imagination and risk-taking. And over the years, as you grew to become a leader in high-tech manufacturing, that ingenuity never faltered. Whether you've been with this company for decades&mdash;as I know some of you have&mdash;or just for a year, you're all focused on the future. Every day, you're pushing the limits of technology a little bit further. <p>And you're not alone, because somewhere over at the Capital Factory, there's an entrepreneur mapping out a new product on a whiteboard that may be the next big thing. Somewhere over at Manor New Tech High School, there's a kid scribbling down an idea for a new invention that one day may turn into an entirely new industry. That's America. <p>And when you look out across this room, what you also notice is there's talent drawn from every segment of our society. We don't care what you look like, where you come from, what your last name is. We just want to make sure we're all working together to create a better future for our kids. <p>That's America. We innovate. And we adapt. We move forward. That's what Austin is all about. That's what's going on in this city. And that's what I want to keep on promoting as your President of the United States of America. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"100" "\"Thank you so much, everybody, and welcome to the White House. I want to thank Carol for the wonderful introduction. <p>And let me just start off with a public service announcement to dads, partners, kids of America&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;Sunday is Mother's Day. [<i>Laughter</i>] You should not forget. [<i>Laughter</i>] You can't go wrong with flowers, a homemade card, giving some mom&mdash;giving mom some relief, some quiet time. That is appreciated. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So it's a day when we put moms first. And I still remember one time I said to Michelle&mdash;this is back when we had just gotten married, and I think Malia had just been born, and we were fussing around Mother's Day, and I said, but you know, how come we do so much stuff on Mother's Day? She says, because every other day is Man's Day. [<i>Laughter</i>] So this is, like, one day. And there was, as usual, profound insight in Michelle's remarks, because moms so often put themselves last. So often they put everything else before themselves. <p>And that's particularly true when it comes to things like health care. Moms take care of us. <p>[<i>At this point, a baby in the audience cried.</i>] <p>Yes, see? [<i>Laughter</i>] Case in point. Sick kids, aging parents, grumpy husbands. And I know there are lots of moms out there who often go without the care that they need or the checkups they know they should get, because they're worrying that copay that has to go to gas or groceries or the new soccer uniform instead. Or worse, they know the unfairness of being charged more for their health care just because they're a woman or the stress of trying to manage a family budget when health care costs are impinging on it or trying to insure a sick child only to be told no over and over again. <p>So we decided that needed to change. In a country as wealthy as this one, there was no reason why a family's security should be determined by the chance of an illness or an accident. We decided to do something about it. <p>Thanks to the women in this room and people all across the country, we worked really hard, and it's now been more than 3 years since Congress passed the Affordable Care Act and I signed it into law. It's been nearly a year since the Supreme Court upheld the law under the Constitution. And by the way, 6 months ago, the American people went to the polls and decided to keep going in this direction. So the law is here to stay. <p>And those of us who believe that every American deserves access to quality, affordable health care have an obligation to now make sure that full implementation moves forward the way it needs to. <p>Basically, there are two main things that the American people need to know about this law and what it means. First, if you're one of the nearly 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance&mdash;whether it's through your employer or Medicare or Medicaid&mdash;you don't have to do a thing. This law already provides you with a wide array of new benefits, tough new consumer protections, stronger cost control measures than existed before the law passed. And those things are already in place; you're benefiting from them, you just may not know it: making sure that insurers can't take advantage of you; making sure that your child can stay on your health insurance until they're 27 years old. So a lot of those provisions are already in place providing help and assistance to people all across the country. <p>Now, second, if you're one of the tens of millions who don't have health insurance, beginning this fall, you'll finally be able to compare and buy quality, affordable private plans that work for you. So that's what you need to know. If you've already got health insurance, this has just enhanced it. And if you don't, you're going to be able to get it. <p>For 3 years now, this law has provided real and tangible benefits to millions of Americans. Women, in particular, now have more control over their own care than ever before. And I'm pleased to be joined today by many women who wrote in to tell us what the Affordable Care Act means to them. <p>Carol Metcalf told us: \\"My oldest child is 22, recent college grad, a traumatic brain injury survivor, with a rare genetic lung disease. Without the Affordable Care Act, he would have been removed from our family health insurance policy this year. And his health is excellent, but the cost of maintenance is overwhelming. And given his history, he would be virtually uninsurable under the old set of rules. Instead of contemplating law school, all of his resources would have been channeled into somehow, somewhere, finding health insurance.\\" That's what Carol wrote. <p>So Carol and her son Justin are why the Affordable Care Act lets young people stay on their parent's plan until they turn 26. And today, as she put it, \\"now Justin's future is governed by what he wants to achieve, not what health insurance mandates.\\" And by the way, Justin is here, fine-looking young man right here. Sunday is Mother's Day. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Justin Metcalf</i>. Yes. <p><i>The President</i>. Just wanted to make sure you remembered that. <p>Alycia is the mother of Avey, who is a beautiful, sweet, 3-year-old girl who also happens to have leukemia. Imagine what that's like for a parent. While you're just figuring out how to take care of a baby, you've got to figure out how you're going to pay for expensive treatment that could save your baby's life. <p>Any parent knows that there is nothing we won't do to take care of our kids. And it's nice to have somebody getting your back. And that's why the Affordable Care Act made it illegal for bad actors in the insurance industry to discriminate against kids like Avey. And today, Avey is doing just great. She was here just a second ago. Where is she? There's Avey. Hey, sweetie! So Alycia wrote in, she said: \\"The health care law is about people like me. It's Alyciacare.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And because of Alyciacare&mdash;the Affordable Care Act&mdash;insurance companies can no longer impose lifetime limits on the amount of care you receive or drop your coverage if you get sick or discriminate against children with preexisting conditions. And women now have access to free preventive care like checkups and mammograms and cancer screenings so you can catch preventable illness on the front end. And that provision has already helped more than 70 million Americans with private insurance. That's already happening. A lot of people don't know it, but you've got those protections. <p>Because of the Affordable Care Act, young adults under the age of 26, as we talked about, are able to stay on their parent's health insurance plan, and that's already helping more than 6 million young adults. <p>Because of the Affordable Care Act, seniors on Medicare receive free checkups and preventive care with no copay or deductible and get a discount on their prescription drugs. That has already saved over 6 million seniors more than $700 each. That's already been happening. Seniors may not know that they've been getting $600 discounts, but it's there. <p>Because of the Affordable Care Act, insurers now have to justify double-digit rate increases publicly, for everybody to see. And most States have new authority&mdash;thanks to incentives under this law&mdash;to reject unjustifiable rate increases. Insurers are now required to spend at least 80 percent of the money you pay in premiums on actual health care, not on profits, not on overhead, but on you. And if they fail to meet that target, they actually have to reimburse you, either with a rebate or lower premiums. Millions of Americans discovered this last year. They opened an envelope from their insurance company that wasn't a bill, it was a check. That's already happened. A lot of people don't know it, but that's what's&mdash;that's what the Affordable Care Act is all about. <p>Beginning this week, as part of the law's price transparency tools, we made public the prices that different hospitals charge you for most common services so you can see if you're getting what you pay for. And soon, bad actors in the insurance industry will never again be able to discriminate you&mdash;discriminate against you just because you've gotten sick in the past. [<i>Applause</i>] They can't discriminate against you because you've got a preexisting condition. And by the way, they can't charge you more just for being a woman. Pregnancy will no longer be considered a preexisting condition. <p>And finally, beginning this fall, if you're one of the millions of Americans who don't have health insurance, you'll finally have the chance to buy quality, affordable care just like everybody else. <p>So here's how this is going to work. We're setting up a new online marketplace, where beginning October 1, you can go online or talk to organizations in every State that are going to have this set up, and you can then comparison shop an array of private health insurance plans. You can look at them side by side, just like you'd go online and compare cars. And because you'll now be part of a new pool of millions of other Americans&mdash;part of this exchange&mdash;insurance companies will actually want to compete for your business the same way they compete for the business of a big company with a lot of employees. <p>So once these marketplaces are up and running, no one can be turned away from private insurance plans. Period. If you're sick, you'll finally have the same chance to buy quality, affordable health care as everybody else. If you can't afford to buy private insurance, if it's still too expensive&mdash;even though you're getting much better prices through these exchanges than you would in the individual market, going out there by yourself, or if you work for just a small company that doesn't have a lot of leverage with insurance companies, you're going to have a better deal through these exchanges&mdash;but if you still can't afford it, then you're going to get help reducing your out-of-pocket premiums with the largest health care tax cut for working families and small businesses in our history. All right? <p>So what does all this mean? It means that if you lose your job or you change your job or you start that new business, you'll still be able to purchase quality, affordable health care that's yours, and you'll have the security and peace of mind that comes with it. If you're a young person expecting to try many different jobs and careers until you find one that suits you, you'll be able to buy insurance that goes with you, travels with you, that gives you the freedom to pursue whatever you want without the fear that illness or accident somehow derails your dreams. <p>So there's a lot that this law is already doing for Americans with insurance, and there is a lot more that is going to happen for folks who don't have insurance. But we've still got a lot of work to do in the coming months to make sure more Americans can buy affordable coverage. And with something as personal as health care, I realize there are people who are anxious, people who are nervous, making sure that we get this done right. <p>So I'm here to tell you, I am 110 percent committed to getting it done right. It's not an easy undertaking, but if it were easy, it would have already been done long time ago. Undoubtedly, there will be some mistakes and hiccups as the thing gets started up, but we're learning already from them. For example, when the prototype of the application to join the marketplace came in at 21 pages&mdash;the initial, first cut at it&mdash;we said, you know what, we can do better than that. It's now three pages long. Three pages. By the way, the industry standard is actually about 17 pages. So three pages is good. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's a lot shorter than the application you generally have to fill out now for private insurance. <p>But this is going to be a lot of work. And obviously, there is still a lot of political bickering over this law. The same folks who fought tooth and nail 4 years ago and tried to make political hay out of Obamacare, they're still telling tall tales about its impact. Some small businesses are being told their costs are going to go up, even though they're exempted from the law or they actually stand to benefit from it. And whenever insurance premiums go up, you're being told it's because of Obamacare, even though there's no evidence that that's the case. So right now there are a whole bunch of folks out there, their insurance company decided to jack up rates, and they're automatically assuming, well, somehow the law had something to do with it. No, that had to do with an insurance company&mdash;a decision the insurance company made. In some cases, employers may be shifting more costs onto employees because they think that will help their bottom line. Now, it's convenient to somehow say, well, it must be the new law. It's not the case. <p>So precisely because there're been so much misinformation, sometimes, people may not have a sense of what the law actually does. And that misinformation will continue, at least through the next election day. <p>But what all the people on this stage understand is this is too important for political games. Most moms and dads don't think about politics when their kid gets sick. They're thinking about doing whatever it takes to make sure that child is well. This is an issue of personal security. This is personal to Carol and Alycia and anybody who's ever known the injustice and anxiety of a broken health care system. That's what this is about. That's why we fought so hard to make this happen. And that's why we're determined to get it done right. <p>And we're going to need everybody out there to make sure&mdash;get the right information. Don't just read a blog&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;or some commentary from some pundit that has a political agenda. Make sure you know what the actual facts are, because you stand to benefit if you're not already benefiting from this thing. Don't let people confuse you. Don't let them run the okeydoke on you. [<i>Laughter</i>] Don't be bamboozled. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, there's one more person I want to mention here today, somebody who I've spoken of several times over the past few years. When I first received a letter from Natoma Canfield, she was a self-employed cancer survivor from Ohio; she'd always done the responsible thing by buying her own insurance on the private market, even though it was very expensive. <p>A few years ago, her insurance company charged her over $6,000 in premiums, paid for only $900 worth of care, told her they'd jack up her rates another 40 percent anyway, even though she'd been cancer-free for more than a decade. Despite her desire to keep her health insurance&mdash;despite her fears that she would get sick again&mdash;she finally just had to surrender her coverage, couldn't afford it, hung her fortunes on chance. And just a few weeks later, she fell ill and was diagnosed with leukemia, just days before health care reform became a reality. <p>And I kept Natoma's story with me as we fought to pass this law, and I hung her letter on one of my walls in the Oval Office. And while she couldn't be there the day I signed the Affordable Care Act into law, Natoma is here today. And because of this law&mdash;here's Natoma right here. Give her a big round of applause. Because of this law, there are millions of other Americans&mdash;moms and dads and daughters and sons&mdash;who no longer have to hang their fortunes on chance. <p>Because we are not going to inflict that hardship on the American people again. The United States of America does not sentence its people to suffering just because they don't make enough to buy insurance on the private market, just because their work doesn't provide health insurance, just because they fall sick or suffer an accident&mdash;that could happen to anybody. And regular access to a doctor or medicine or preventive care, that's not some earned privilege, it is a right. <p>So I understand the politics of this stuff sometimes, but there are times where I just want people to step back and say, are you really prepared to say that 30 million Americans out here shouldn't have health insurance? Are you really prepared to say that's not a worthy goal? Because of politics? <p>That's why we're going to keep fighting with everything we've got to secure that right, to make sure that every American gets the care that they need when they need it at a price that they can afford. That's what our families deserve. That's what the vast majority of Americans believe in. That's what we're going to make sure that we deliver. And we're going to do it with your help. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.\" "
"101" "\"Hi, everybody. Our top priority as a nation is reigniting the true engine of our economic growth: a rising, thriving middle class. And few things define what it is to be middle class in America more than owning your own cornerstone of the American Dream: a home. <p>Today, 7 years after the real estate bubble burst, triggering the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and costing millions of responsible Americans their jobs and their homes, our housing market is healing. Sales are up. Foreclosures are down. Construction is expanding. And thanks to rising home prices over the past year, 1.7 million more American families have been able to come up for air, because they're no longer underwater on their mortgages. <p>From the day I took office, I've made it a priority to help responsible homeowners and prevent the kind of recklessness that helped cause this crisis in the first place. <p>My housing plan has already helped more than 2 million people refinance their mortgages, and they're saving an average of $3,000 per year. <p>My new consumer watchdog agency is moving forward on protections like a simpler, shorter mortgage form that will help to keep hard-working families from getting ripped off. <p>But we've still got more work to do. We've got more responsible homeowners to help: folks who have never missed a mortgage payment, but aren't allowed to refinance; working families who have done everything right, but still owe more on their homes than they're worth. <p>Last week, I nominated a man named Mel Watt to take on these challenges as the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Mel's represented the people of North Carolina in Congress for 20 years, and in that time, he helped lead efforts to put in place rules of the road that protect consumers from dishonest mortgage lenders and give responsible Americans the chance to own their own home. He's the right person for the job, and that's why Congress should do its job and confirm him without delay. <p>And they shouldn't stop there. As I said before, more than 2 million Americans have already refinanced at today's low rates, but we can do a lot better than that. I've called on Congress to give every responsible homeowner the chance to refinance and, with it, the opportunity to save $3,000 a year. That's like a $3,000 tax cut. And if you're one of the millions of Americans who could take advantage of that, you should ask your representative in Congress why they won't act on it. <p>Our economy and our housing market are poised for progress, but we could do so much more if we work together. More good jobs. Greater security for middle class families. A sense that your hard work is rewarded. That's what I'm fighting for, and that's what I'm going to keep on fighting for as long as I hold this office. <p>Thank you, and have a great weekend.\" "
"102" "\"Thank you so much, everybody. Everybody, please have a seat. Well, good morning, and welcome to the White House for what's one of my favorite events all year. <p>I want to start by thanking Gil Kerlikowske, a former police officer: police chief in Seattle, police commissioner in Buffalo, police officer in St. Petersburg, Florida; now serves as the head of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. He is doing outstanding work every day, helping to make sure that our young people are safe and not exposed to some of the worst drugs out there. And so we very much want to give him a big round of applause. Thank you, Gil. We've got NAPO President Tom Nee right here next to me. Tom is doing an outstanding job every day. And of course, we've got our 2013 TOP COPS. Hey! <p>Now, as President, I get to meet and work with a lot of extraordinary law enforcement officers every single day, from men and women who protect me and my family&mdash;the folks in the Secret Service&mdash;to local police who help out on motorcades and events around the country. And I'm incredibly grateful that all these law enforcement officers are doing such outstanding work. <p>And then, just a few weeks ago, obviously, in Boston, our entire country saw once again the strong stuff that these men and women in uniform are made of: police officers, first responders who were running towards explosions, not knowing if there was something more on the way; law enforcement from different agencies and different parts of the country working together as one united team to identify suspects and bring them to justice; and in a moment that few of us will ever forget, the citizens of Watertown, Massachusetts, lining their streets to cheer on and high five and hug the officers as they headed home after a job well done. <p>We don't always get that opportunity to stand and applaud the men and women who keep us safe. But they're out there, hundreds of thousands of you, patrolling our streets every single day. And we know that when we need you most, you'll be ready to dash into danger, to protect our lives even if it means putting your lives on the line. That's what these folks are all about. That's what the men in standing&mdash;the men and women standing behind me have proven: their heart, their courage, their dedication. <p>And of course, as always, they're a humble group. They'll tell you they're not heroes. They'll say they were just doing their jobs. And today we honor them as TOP COPS because they're half right. It's true: They were just doing their jobs. From the moment they swore an office&mdash;swore an oath to serve with honor, from the first time they put on a uniform and pinned on a badge, they knew they might be called upon to do some really tough stuff. But I think that makes them more heroic, not less heroic, because they signed up for this. They volunteered and yet continued, day in, day out, to dedicate themselves. And when the moment came, they were ready to respond. <p>I already talked about one of this year's TOP COPS, Brian Murphy, in my State of the Union Address. When a gunman opened fire on a temple in Wisconsin and Brian was the first to arrive, he did not consider his own safety. He fought back until help arrived and ordered his fellow officers, who are here today, to protect the safety of the Americans worshiping inside, even though he was lying there, bleeding from 12 bullet wounds. When he was asked how he did it, he said, \\"That's just the way we're made.\\" <p>That's what you've got to do. That's what you've got to be made of to take down homicide suspects in Los Angeles or Vegas or shooters in Miami or Indiana or Chicago or Iowa, saving untold numbers of lives. That's what you've got to be made of to dodge live power lines during Hurricane Sandy to free your partner pinned down by a tree, all the while saying, I've got you, pal. <p>So yes, this is their job. But it's not just about the uniform that they wear. It's about who they are, what they're made of. When a gunman entered a restaurant in Pasadena, Texas, it was three off-duty cops who put themselves in harm's way so that others could escape. <p>Detective Ivan Marcano didn't care that he was off duty when he saw two muggers attacking a cab driver in the Bronx. He got out of his girlfriend's car to stop them and was shot point blank in the chest, a bullet inches from his heart. But his story doesn't end there. As his girlfriend was driving him to the hospital, I'm sure not very happy with him&mdash;where's Ivan? There he is. Yes. [<i>Laughter</i>] By total coincidence, they ran into the shooter's getaway car. <p>So what does Detective Marcano do? He jumps out of the car. He's getting&mdash;he's been shot&mdash;keeps pressure on his chest with his left hand, holding a service weapon with his right, runs after the suspects. Took one of them down, which led to the capture of the others. He wasn't on the clock when any of this happened. This was his date night. You know? It's unbelievable. [<i>Laughter</i>] Hey, by the way, did you invite your girlfriend down here? <p><i>New York Police Department Detective Ivan Marcano. </i>Yes. She's over there [<i>inaudible</i>]. <p><i>The President.</i> Where are you? Stand up. All right. She has got to get a big round of applause. She deserves a really nice dinner&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;after putting her through that. <p>The cab driver who Detective Marcano rescued put it simply. He said, I will be thankful to him for the rest of his life&mdash;or for the rest of my life. So today, to all our TOP COPS, let me say that our Nation shares that sense of gratitude. You embody America at its best and at its bravest. And you set an example, because if TOP COPS can risk their lives to do their jobs, the rest of us should just be able to summon some tiny fraction of courage and the same sense of responsibility. And certainly, that applies for those of us responsible for supporting law enforcement and first responders here in Washington. <p>Even during tough economic times, we've got to make sure they've got the resources that they need, whether that's supporting the COPS program or helping you hire new officers or preventing layoffs or giving you the most advanced crime-fighting tools and the mobile technology and critical data, all of which you need in this 21st century, when it comes to crime fighting. And we also need to take some commonsense steps that protect our rights, protect our children, protect officers in the line of duty by making it harder for dangerous criminals to get their hands on lethal weapons. <p>These officers represent the best of us, and they deserve the best from us. And that begins with being thankful to them not just today, but for the rest of their lives, and recognizing the sacrifices not only they make, but their parents and spouses and kids who watch their loved ones go off and serve every day knowing that there's real danger out there. So I'd ask all Americans, everybody who is watching all across the country, when you see a police officer, you meet an officer's family, let them know how much you appreciate it. It's the least we can do for the men and women who give us so much and help keep us safe. <p>All right. So with that in mind, let me give another huge thank you to our TOP COPS of 2003 [2013; White House correction.], our entire law enforcement community, all the families who are here. All the kids who are here, thanks for being patient and listening to me. [<i>Laughter</i>] And now what we want to do is get a picture. So I think we're going to strike this podium, and I'm going to line up. I think there's a spot left for us. Everybody, say cheese.\" "
"103" "\"Thank you, everybody. Well, first of all, I have to thank Harvey and Georgina for once again extending incredible hospitality to us. We are so grateful for their friendship and support, and for the amazing movies that they've made. And it is wonderful to see all of you. I see old friends, new friends, and people who, when I have time to watch movies or TV, I very much appreciate. So thank you for the great work that you guys do. <p>I'm going to spend most of this time in a conversation with everybody, so I'm not going to give a long speech at the front end. Over the last 3 weeks, month, the country has gone through some tough times. Obviously, we had the Boston bombing and the incredible tragedy that marred what is one of the greatest sporting events in the world and an iconic event here in America. We went out to West, Texas, to a tiny town that had been devastated by an explosion there. <p>And I remember, I was with Deval Patrick, a wonderful Governor&mdash;the Governor of Massachusetts&mdash;as we were driving to a memorial in Boston shortly after the attack. And we talked about that in the midst of tragedy, the incredible strength and courage and resolve of the American people just comes out and the neighborliness and the sense of willing to support strangers and neighbors and friends during tough times. And that same spirit, which I would later see when I visited West, Texas&mdash;you can't get two places more different than Boston and West, Texas. So it's a pretty good representative sampling of America. <p>And part of what Deval and I talked about was what do we need to do to make sure that that same spirit is reflected in our politics and our Government, because it's there every day for people to see. It doesn't matter whether people are Democrats or Republicans or Independents. If you go into schools, you go to Little League games, you talk to people at the workplace, everybody has the same sense that we live in the greatest country on Earth, that we've gone through some tough times, but we're resilient and we can overcome whatever challenges are thrown at us. And there's a desire to get outside of the constant squabbling and bickering and positioning and gamesmanship and get to the business of figuring out how do we make sure that the next generation does better than this generation. <p>And as I think about my second term, and people have asked me, what's different about your second term, well, other than me being grayer&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and my girls being taller, the main thing about a second term is, A, I don't have to run for office again, but, B, you also start just thinking about history, and you start thinking about&mdash;in longer sweeps of time, and you start saying to yourself that the 3&frac12; years that I've got is not a lot, and so I've got to make sure that I use everything I've got to make as much of a difference as I can. <p>And more than anything, what I will be striving for over the next 3&frac12; years is to see if that spirit that I saw in Boston and West, Texas, if we can institutionalize that, if we can create a framework where everybody is working together and moving this country forward. <p>Now, the good news is that if we do that, we've got the best cards of any country on Earth, and that's the truth. Look, there's no American politician, much less American President, who's not going to say that we're not the greatest country on Earth. So that's a cliche. On the other hand, objectively, when you look at where we are right now, we are poised for a 21st century that is as much the American century as the 20th century was. <p>We have recovered from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and yet the economy is growing: millions of jobs have been created; the stock market has hit record highs; the housing market has begun to recover. When you look at our companies, innovation, dynamism, inventiveness still take root here in the United States more than anyplace else on Earth. <p>When it comes to energy, not only have we been able to double our production of clean energy, but even in terms of traditional energy, we will probably be a net exporter of natural gas in somewhere between 5 and 10 years. And so the idea of the United States being energy independent&mdash;which seemed far fetched as recently as 10 years ago&mdash;now is actually a possibility. <p>When you travel around the world, people still look to the United States for leadership. I went down to Mexico and then Costa Rica, and I met with Central American leaders down there, and each and every one of them, including , DanielDaniel Ortega, who was at one of the meetings&mdash;and some of you are too young to remember, I guess, Daniel Ortega, and I'm not&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;all of them talked about how can we trade, how can we work more effectively together. And so the possibilities for us to shape a world that is more peaceful, more prosperous, more innovative, more environmentally conscious, more tolerant, more open, that opportunity exists, but there are just a few things that we're going to have to do to make sure that we realize those opportunities, that potential. <p>We've got to continue to revamp our education system so it's meeting the demands of the 21st century. We've got to rebuild our infrastructure so we don't have the worst airports in the world. We've got to make sure&mdash;and ports and roads and bridges and broadband lines. We've got to make sure that we continue to focus on putting people back to work, because jobs are not just a matter of income, they're a matter of dignity and stitching the fabric of a community together. <p>We've got to deal with climate change in an honest, realistic way. We're not going to reverse the trends overnight, but we have to start now for the sake of our kids, and in fact, the tools are available to us to make huge strides in the coming years if we make the smart investments. We've got to keep on investing in research and development. And we've got to get our fiscal house in order in a way that is sensible so that everybody is paying their fair share; everybody understands that we have to&mdash;if we want a first-class education system, for example, then we've got to pay for it. If we want first-class infrastructure, we've got to pay for it. But we also want a government that is lean and effective and efficient and not bloated. <p>And these are all things that we can accomplish. What's blocking us right now is sort of hyperpartisanship in Washington that, frankly, I was hoping to overcome in 2008. And in the midst of crisis, I think the other party reacted, rather than saying now is the time for us all to join together, decided to take a different path. <p>My thinking was after we beat them in 2012, well, that might break the fever&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and it's not quite broken yet. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I am persistent. And I am staying at it. And I genuinely believe that there are actually Republicans out there who would like to work with us, but they're fearful of their base, and they're concerned about what Rush Limbaugh might say about them. And as a consequence, we get the kind of gridlock that makes people cynical about government and inhibits our progress. <p>So the bottom line is this: Everybody is here to support the DNC, and I very much appreciate that. But I want everybody to understand that my intentions over the next 3&frac12; years are to govern, because I don't have another race left. If we've got folks on the other side who are prepared to cooperate, that is great, and we are ready to go. On the other hand, if there are folks who are more interested in winning elections than they are thinking about the next generation, then I want to make sure that there are consequences to that. <p>And what you all are here today to facilitate is our ability to make sure that the values and concerns that we all have for Dash and all the other babies that are out there&mdash;Steve has got a new one, and I'm starting to feel like the old man around here because mine are this tall and everybody else has these little babies. But I want to make sure that that generation is getting everything and more that we can give them. And that's going to require us to work hard. It's going to require persistence. There are going to be ups and downs in this whole process. <p>But one of the benefits of a second term is you start taking the long view. And what I know is, is that as long as we are pointing towards that true north, that eventually we'll get there. That's what this country has always done. That's what I expect will happen this time as well. <p>So with that, I'm going to stop and I'm just going to open it up for questions.\" "
"104" "\"Well, first of all, I want to make sure everybody has got their food&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;because I don't want to get in the way of dinner here, because it looks delicious. <p>I want to thank Alexandra and Sam for their wonderful hospitality. It is not easy opening up your house for an event with the President, between all the tables and then the Secret Service and this and that. But you guys have been great friends, and this means so much to us, so we are very, very grateful. Yes, absolutely. <p>I see a lot of friends and supporters in the room. So many of you were active during the course of the campaign. I could not be more grateful for it and more humbled. One person I do want to acknowledge&mdash;because not only was he active in the campaign, but he has now been volunteered to head up the DNC Finance Committee&mdash;Henry Mu&ntilde;oz is here from the great State of Texas. So I want to say thank you to Henry. <p>This is a pretty rambunctious group, so I want to use most of my time for questions and answers. But let me just make a few comments at the top. Obviously, this last month, America faced some enormous challenges. We had the Boston bombing, the explosion in West, Texas. And I was mentioning at an event before I came here, I was driving with Deval Patrick to the memorial service in Boston. And we remarked on how when tragedy strikes, when a crisis occurs, there's something about the American spirit: The resilience, strength, but most of all, that sense of community and neighborliness just shines through. <p>And even in our darkest hours, you can't help but come away incredibly optimistic about the country. Now, the question Deval and I asked ourselves is. how do we sustain that beyond moments of crisis and tragedy and how do we translate that into our politics and our institutions? Because obviously, that spirit isn't always in evidence in Washington. [<i>Laughter</i>] But having said that, one of the virtues of a second term is, it gives you some perspective. And I don't have another race to run. And what I've learned from my first term in office&mdash;and probably, what I've learned during the course of my life&mdash;is things that are worth doing don't happen right away. And it requires persistence and just the steady, constant application of hard work and tenacity and the ability to maintain a vision about where you want to go. <p>So here, domestically, our work is not yet done. And I am absolutely confident that if we stay with it, we are going to be able to get immigration reform done this year. We're going to be able to continue some of the incredible education work that's being done all around the country, and Randi has been an incredible partner in that process. We're going to be able to continue to work to make sure that we're rebuilding our infrastructure in our country, putting people back to work, helping the housing market continue to recover, putting people all across the country in a position where if they're willing to work hard, they can succeed and achieve their own American dreams. <p>So we've got a big agenda here at home, but we also have a big agenda internationally. Obviously, all of us are deeply concerned about what's happening in Syria. And my administration has worked with international partners to mobilize humanitarian aid, nonlethal assistance to the opposition, isolating Asad, and continuing to press for political transition that ends the slaughter and brings about an end to the Asad regime. <p>We also have a lot of unfinished business with respect to Afghanistan. Our troops are coming home, and we're transitioning out. But it's still a very dangerous place, and we have to make sure that the gains that have been made are sustained. And we've got to make sure that we're being vigilant when it comes to dealing with Al Qaida and other terrorist elements. <p>And then, something that so many people in this room are knowledgeable about, the peace process and reinvigorating a sense of hope and possibility for both Israelis and Palestinians. One of the highlights obviously of this early second term was the trip that I was able to take to Israel and to the Palestinian Authority and to the West Bank. And what made the trip so incredible was not only the capacity to see the incredible progress that Israel has made on so many fronts&mdash;we looked at science exhibitions and to see how the economy is transforming itself into a high-tech, entrepreneurial center and to have a chance to talk to young people who are doing so many incredible things. <p>But what was also encouraging was the sense that for all the difficulties, for all the setbacks, for all the false starts, deep down, there's still this incredible desire for peace. It exists in Israel; it exists among the Palestinians. And the question is, can we create a framework in which to actually finally deliver on that promise, particularly because the window of opportunity is growing smaller by the day? And in some ways, it's more difficult because of the incredible tumult that's taking place throughout the Middle East. <p>When change is happening so fast&mdash;and in some cases, so chaotically and sometimes violently&mdash;it makes people tend not to take risks. On the other hand, precisely because those changes are taking place all around the region, Israel's security and the prospect of Palestinian statehood all requires that those risks are taken and they're taken now. <p>And in order for us to achieve that, it's going to be important that John Kerry and my administration continue to work this thing very hard. But part of what's going to be required is also that those who are committed to peace here in this country continue to make their voices heard and continue to speak out. So many of you already have and are already making a difference, but I urge you to continue. And it's going to have to happen not just in interactions with the State Department or my administration, you're going to have to be vocal on Capitol Hill as well. <p>And if we sustain that, then&mdash;in fits and starts, it will be difficult, it will be tough, there will be times where it feels like we're going backwards instead of forwards&mdash;I believe that in the end, peace can be achieved. I am a big believer in a quote that I took from Dr. King, but I think describes my general perspective about both America and our future, but also our role in the world, and that is that, \\"The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.\\" It requires persistence, it requires tenacity, but in the end, I think that good overcomes evil and light overcomes darkness. And that's what we have to strive for every single day, and that's how I intend to spend the 3&frac12; years that I have remaining as President, and I couldn't have done that without the help of all of you. <p>So thank you very much.\" "
"105" "\"Thank you. Please, everybody, have a seat. <p>Well, first of all, thank you so much, Steve Israel, not only for the wonderful introduction, but I love the story of your grandparents. And so often we spend time thinking about how we got into this strange business&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but so often it traces back to the values that were passed on generation through generation. And to hear that story, I think, affirms not only why you're such an outstanding Congressman, but also the kind of man you are. And so we're thrilled to have you here and just the great job you're doing on behalf of the DCCC. So give Steve a big round of applause. <p>I want to say thank you to somebody who has been a great friend. If you are in a foxhole, this is the person you want with you: the soon-to-be-again Speaker of the House, Leader Nancy Pelosi. We love Nancy. <p>And one of my favorite Senators, just a guy who everybody who meets him says, that guy, he's just solid, sincere, hard-working, a wonderful family, and has really helped to transform politics in Colorado: Michael Bennet. Give Michael a big round of applause. <p>And of course, I want to acknowledge all the outstanding members of the New York delegation who are here. But I've got to give a special shout-out to somebody who is helping to engineer some of the most important legislative agendas&mdash;items that we've got in my second term&mdash;could not be prouder of him&mdash;Chuck Schumer. Give Chuck a big round of applause. <p>So over the last month, we've gone through some tough times in this country. Obviously, we saw the horrific bombing of the Boston Marathon. I had traveled down to a tiny town of West, Texas, to deal with the aftermath of a terrible explosion there that had such a devastating impact on the city. It's hard to find two communities more different than Boston, Massachusetts, and West, Texas, I assure you. And yet what was striking about that very difficult, challenging week was the consistency of spirit from Boston all the way to West, Texas. <p>And I remember being in a car with Deval Patrick, the outstanding mayor of&mdash;Governor of Massachusetts, and we were driving to a memorial service, and we were talking about the emergency response and how first responders who were actually running in the race all ran to the site of the explosion and how the hospitals and doctors responded magnificently to sort through who would go where to maximize their ability to care for the victims and the people who were driving runners to their homes, complete strangers, because of everything that had happened. And what Deval and I agreed on was that in times of tragedy, in the midst of just terrible pain, there's something about the American spirit that just rises up. <p>And it's not just resilience. There is a generosity and a sense of neighborliness and an insistence on doing the right thing and thinking about others. And Deval and I talked about how this is a constant in America, and it's not just during tragedies, not just during crises. You can see it out on a Little League field where parents are out there volunteering. You see it in churches and synagogues and mosques and temples all across the country. You see it in neighbors helping neighbors, and you see it in workplaces where workers are taking pride of great American products and services that they're creating, helping to build a Nation. <p>But the one thing Deval and I agreed on was that we're not seeing enough of it in our politics, and we're certainly not seeing enough of it in Washington. And one of the things that a second term affords you is a little bit of perspective, because I don't have to run again, as Michelle happily reminds me. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I've been through some tough battles over the last 4 years and then my time in the Senate before that. And you're able to project out a little bit into the future. <p>And precisely because of that spirit that was evident in West, Texas, and in Boston, I've probably never been more optimistic about America. Having gone through these extraordinary hardships&mdash;worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, the financial system on the verge of meltdown, dealing with two wars and all the losses associated with that and the enormous strains on our budget&mdash;we are now in the process of having cleared out the rubble. <p>And although we are nowhere near where we need to be, given everything that we've gone through, we have seen job growth for almost 3 consecutive years now. We have seen the economy growing. We have seen people's 401(k)s and investments on Wall Street restored. We've seen health care costs grow at a slower pace over the last 3 years than any time in the last 50 years. We are in the process of implementing and making sure that millions of people all across the country finally get affordable health care that they've never had before. <p>We have doubled the production of clean, renewable energy, and our traditional, national&mdash;natural gas and oil deposits have been tapped with new technology in ways that will probably lead us to be a net exporter of natural gas within the next 5 to 10 years. <p>And housing, which was probably the biggest drag on our economy, is steadily beginning to recover. And so across the board, there are all these signs of progress. And that's the American spirit at work. That's the American people&mdash;through grit and determination and a vision of possibility, just brick by brick, neighborhood by neighborhood, city by city, State by State&mdash;rebuilding. <p>And when I travel internationally&mdash;I took a trip down to Mexico and met with not only the new Mexican President, but also leaders of Central American countries. What was striking is that in a part of the world where in the past there had been times where there had been suspicions directed at the United States and what our motives were, there's an enormous hunger to engage in trade and commerce and cooperation to deal with these transnational drug networks and a genuine sense of the&mdash;not just the desire, but the need for American leadership, not a leadership that dictates, not a leadership that seeks simply to impose our will on others, but a leadership in which we are convening and collaborating and partnering, based on mutual interest and mutual respect. <p>And so the bottom line is, when I canvas the world, there is no nation that we would want to trade hands with. And there's no nation that secretly&mdash;they couldn't admit it&mdash;wouldn't mind having the hand that we're holding. And the only thing that's holding us back&mdash;the only thing that's holding us back&mdash;is a spirit in Washington that isn't reflective of the spirit of the American people, a spirit in Washington that's more interested in game-playing than getting things done, a spirit in Washington that is more concerned about the next election than the next generation. And that has to change. And that's why you're here tonight, because you know it has to change. <p>We've got more work to do. And I spelled out in my Inauguration and I spelled out in my State of the Union exactly what we need to do. We need to continue to build on the tremendous progress we've made in reforming our education system and make sure that every child in America is prepared before they start school with universal pre-K for every kid, which can make an enormous difference in achievement levels all across the country: modernize our high schools so they're adapted to the 21st century; make sure that our community colleges are linking up with businesses to prepare our young people for the jobs of tomorrow; make college more affordable. We know that we need to do that. There's no credible argument for not doing it. <p>We know we've got to rebuild our infrastructure. We've got $2 trillion worth of deferred maintenance. There was a list a few months back of the top airports in the world, not one out of the top 25 were in the United States of America. Not one. Imagine that. Roads, bridges, airports, ports, broadband lines, smart grids. <p>We know what we've got to do. And by the way, if we are rebuilding our infrastructure, we're putting people back to work right now. So it's strengthening our economy now and for the future. We know what we need to do. <p>We know that we have to control our energy future. And as promising as these new technologies are to tap into new sources of energy, we also know that climate change is real. And if we want to leave a world for our children and our grandchildren that is as beautiful as the one that we inherited, then we're going to have to double down on our investments in basic research and science around clean energy and discover not just the energy source of the past, but also the energy source of the future. We've got to win that race. We know that. We know that. <p>We know we've got to get immigration reform done, because we want America to attract the best and the brightest. We want the message of the Statue of Liberty to be resonating around the world, that flame to continue to shine as a beacon, not just for freedom, but also for people who are ambitious and have drive and who are unconstrained by the past, because they believe in the future. We know we've got to do that. <p>And we know that we've got to have a sensible budget, a budget that invests in education and invests in research and is true to our commitment to keeping our seniors out of poverty and is true to our investment in the infrastructure that's going to continue to make this a growing, dynamic economy. And we can do all that. We don't have to do anything radical. We know what the basic plan is. <p>And with just some modest steps, with the deficit already coming down quicker than at any time since World War II, at a faster pace, we know that if we just make a few smart decisions both on the revenue side and on the spending side&mdash;not through automatic, mindless spending cuts that are slashing our commitments to research and our investments in our kids, but through smart, targeted spending cuts and revenue&mdash;that we can stabilize our budget for decades to come, just open field running from there on out. America cannot be stopped if we make some smart decisions. <p>Internationally, as I said, people are looking for our leadership. But what they're not looking for is us simply seeing every problem as a military problem. They're looking for us to be proponents of peace and work on its behalf. <p>They are looking for us for us to show leadership in helping make sure that children around the world aren't dying of malnutrition and that they get a decent education and that people in extreme poverty making less than $2 a day, that they're put in a position in which they can succeed because they understand that if they succeed, then America will succeed as well. And they don't understand exactly sometimes what's holding us back. <p>So the promise of America is alive and well, and I could not be more optimistic. But that spirit that we saw in Boston, that spirit that we saw in West, Texas, we're going to have to unleash that. And the only way we unleash that is to make sure that Washington, our elected leadership, that they start reflecting that spirit as well. And I can tell you that the Democratic leaders in that room&mdash;in this room, they reflect that spirit, because I see them every single day. I know their values and I know what they care about, and I know what they're working for. <p>And truth be told, there are folks on the other side of the aisle who have that spirit as well. It's not a Democratic or a Republican spirit. It's not a partisan spirit. It's an American spirit. <p>But what is also true is that the dynamic on the other side of the aisle right now runs contrary to what we need in order to succeed, that they've got a different point of view right now, reinforced by some folks around the country that don't share our vision for America as a place where everybody gets a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share. <p>And now, I'm going to do everything I can over the next 3&frac12; years to continue to reach out to my Republican friends on the other side of the aisle, because I sure want to do some governing. I want to get some stuff done. I don't have a lot of time. I've got 3&frac12; years left, and it goes by like that. And if any of you doubt that 3&frac12; years goes by quick, try having some teenage or close-to-teenage girls. [<i>Laughter</i>] Because you look up, and you don't know what happened. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So I want to get moving. And any time that the other side is ready and willing and prepared to work on the things that Chuck Schumer has been working on, like immigration and making sure that we're reducing gun violence in this country; any time that somebody is willing to work on the kinds of things that Michael Bennet has been working on, like improving our education system and making sure that we've got world-class research; any time that somebody is willing to cooperate with Nancy Pelosi to make sure that our budget reflects our commitment to not just the folks at the very top, but a broad-based prosperity for all Americans; and that we're making sure that we're rebuilding our manufacturing base in this country&mdash;any time those folks want to get to work, we are ready to work. <p>But what I also say is that during those 2 years that Nancy Pelosi was Speaker, man, we got a lot of stuff done. And what I also know is that unless we had a Democratic Senate, we would not have ended \\"don't ask, don't tell.\\" Unless we had had a Democratic Senate, we would not have been able to make sure that everybody in this country is able to access affordable health care. What I know is, is that if we hadn't had a Democratic House and a Democratic Senate, college would be a lot less affordable for our young people. <p>We know that. So I want to be clear: I am President of all Americans, not just the leader of a party. And my top priority is to make sure that when I leave this office, I can honestly say that America is in a stronger position and a more secure position and a more promising position than it was before I took office. <p>But what I also know is, is that with leaders like Nancy Pelosi and Steve Israel and Michael Bennet and Chuck Schumer and all the New York delegation here, with them as partners, this country will take off like we haven't seen in a very long time. That's what you're investing in. You're investing in people who share your values and your vision for the future. <p>And that's why, even though I've run my last race, I'm going to be working as hard as I can to make sure that that their vision is one that is dominant on Capitol Hill. It's that spirit that we saw in West, Texas. It's the spirit we saw in Boston. It's the spirit that we see here in New York City. And as I was driving up and saw the new Freedom Tower rising, it reminded me of just what it is that we're fighting for. <p>So thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"106" "\"Thank you, everybody. Please have a seat. Thank you, Chuck, for that introduction and, more importantly, for your leadership as National President of the Fraternal Order of Police. I want to recognize the entire Order and all its leaders, including Jim Pasco, for everything that you do on behalf of the fine officers who walk the beat or answer the call and do the difficult work of keeping our communities safe all across the country. <p>I want to also acknowledge FOP Auxiliary President Linda Hennie for the good work that she and all her members do to support the families of police officers. We are very grateful to you. To Speaker Boehner, Leader Pelosi, Members of Congress, members of my administration who are here, to all the law enforcement officials who are, and most of all, to the survivor families: Scripture tells us, \\"None of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself.\\" None of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself. The brave officers we gather to remember today devoted themselves so fully to others&mdash;to serve and to protect others&mdash;that in the process they were willing to give their lives. <p>And so today let us not remember them just for how they died, but also for how they lived. <p>Officer Bruce St. Laurent of the Jupiter, Florida, police department was, according to a friend, \\"just what a cop should be: tough, compassionate, caring, and brave.\\" But to his community, he was more than a cop. He was a cancer survivor. He was a guest teacher at Jupiter High School who used the laws of traffic to help kids learn physics. He was an amateur snake charmer of sorts, eagerly taking panicked calls about snakes on the loose. And at Christmastime, he loved being Santa Claus for the kids in the local Head Start program. <p>I have the privilege of working with some of the Nation's finest law enforcement officers and professionals every day. And I'm perpetually mindful of the sacrifices they make for me and for my family and for other leaders and visiting dignitaries, but never more so than when I was told that Officer St. Laurent was struck and killed by another vehicle while driving his motorcycle as part of my motorcade. <p>Bruce was a loving husband to Brenda, a doting father to Larry and Albert and Lenny and Chartelle. And he will be missed so deeply by his family at home and by his family in the force. And the police officers who came from all over the country to attend Bruce's funeral, some bringing their motorcycles as far away as California, they're a testimony to how much he'll be missed. <p>Like Bruce, Deputy Sheriff Barbara Ann Pill of Brevard County Sheriff's Office in Florida was a force for good in her community, remembered as a behind-the-scenes hero by those who knew her. Because for Barbara, helping others was never a question. Before joining the force, she counseled abused children and helped families struggling with domestic abuse. That passion served her to&mdash;and led her to a career in law enforcement and inspired her two sons to follow. So when Barbara was shot while investigating a suspicious vehicle last spring, not only did her husband Steve lose his partner of more than 30 years, the town of Melbourne, and the Nation itself, lost one of its most dedicated citizens. <p>All of you in law enforcement, you devote your lives to serving and protecting your communities. Many of you have done it for your country as well. After serving two tours in Iraq as a marine, Bradley Michael Fox retired with honor and followed his dream to becoming a police officer. He had been with the Plymouth Township Police Department in Pennsylvania for 5 years when he was shot and killed pursuing a suspect last September. It was the day before his 35th birthday and 6 months before the birth of his son. <p>Nothing will replace the enthusiasm that he brought to his job or the tremendous pride he had in his family. But today, Brad's wife Lynsay and daughter Kadence and baby Brad Jr. having&mdash;have a living reminder of their fallen hero; that's Brad's K-9 partner, a trusty shepherd named Nick, who Lynsay adopted into the family when he retired from the force last fall. <p>Deputy Sheriff Scott Ward also defined service. He was a former officer in the Air Force, a deputy in the Baldwin County, Alabama, sheriff's office for 15 years, and finished a tour in Afghanistan last year as a reservist in the Coast Guard. <p>Last November, Deputy Sheriff Ward was shot and killed in the line of duty while trying to settle a domestic dispute. And he died as he lived: serving his community and his country. And the fact that his funeral procession stretched for miles demonstrated the thanks of a grateful nation to Scott's wife Andrea and his family. <p>At Scott's funeral, Baldwin Country Sheriff Huey Mack said: \\"Tomorrow we will continue to grieve Scott, but we will have to move on. That's what Scott would want us to do because our mission does not stop.\\" <p>That message, I think, rings true in every police department across the country. As difficult as times may be, as tough as the losses may be, your mission does not stop. You never let down your guard. And those of us who you protect should never let slide our gratitude either. We should not pause and remember to thank first responders and police officers only in the wake of tragedy. We should do it every day. And those of us who have the privilege to lead should all strive to support you better, whether it's making sure police departments and first responders have the resources they need to do their jobs or the reforms that are required to protect more of our officers and their families from the senseless epidemics of violence that all too often wrack our cities and haunt our neighborhoods. <p>Bobby Kennedy once said that the fight against crime \\"is a fight to preserve that quality of community which is at the root of our greatness.\\" <p>The 143 fallen officers we honor today put themselves on the front lines of that fight, to preserve that quality of community and to protect the roots of our greatness. They exemplified the very idea of citizenship: that with our God-given rights come responsibilities and obligations to ourselves and to others. They embodied that idea. That's the way they died. That's how we must remember them. And that's how we must live. <p>We can never repay our debt to these officers and their families, but we must do what we can, with all that we have, to live our lives in a way that pays tribute to their memory. That begins, but does not end, by gathering here, with heavy hearts, to carve their names in stone so that all will know them and that their legacy will endure. We are grateful to them, and we are grateful to you. <p>May God bless the memory of those we lost, and may God continue to bless the United States of America.\" "
"107" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. I just finished speaking with Secretary Lew and senior officials at the Treasury Department to discuss the investigation into IRS personnel who improperly screened conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status. And I look forward to taking some questions at tomorrow's press conference, but today I wanted to make sure to get out to all of you some information about what we're doing about this and where we go from here. <p>I've reviewed the Treasury Department watchdog's report, and the misconduct that it uncovered is inexcusable. It's inexcusable, and Americans are right to be angry about it, and I am angry about it. I will not tolerate this kind of behavior in any agency, but especially in the IRS, given the power that it has and the reach that it has into all of our lives. And as I said earlier, it should not matter what political stripe you're from; the fact of the matter is, is that the IRS has to operate with absolute integrity. The Government generally has to conduct itself in a way that is true to the public trust. That's especially true for the IRS. <p>So here's what we're going to do. First, we're going to hold the responsible parties accountable. Yesterday I directed Secretary Lew to follow up on the IG audit to see how this happened and who is responsible and to make sure that we understand all the facts. Today Secretary Lew took the first step by requesting and accepting the resignation of the Acting Commissioner of the IRS, because given the controversy surrounding this audit, it's important to institute new leadership that can help restore confidence going forward. <p>Second, we're going to put in place new safeguards to make sure this kind of behavior cannot happen again. And I've directed Secretary Lew to ensure the IRS begins implementing the IG's recommendations right away. <p>Third, we will work with Congress as it performs its oversight role. And our administration has to make sure that we are working hand in hand with Congress to get this thing fixed. Congress&mdash;Democrats and Republicans&mdash;owe it to the American people to treat that authority with the responsibility it deserves and in a way that doesn't smack of politics or partisan agendas. Because I think one thing that you've seen is, across the board, everybody believes what happened in&mdash;as reported in the IG's report is an outrage. The good news is, it's fixable, and it's in everyone's best interest to work together to fix it. <p>I'll do everything in my power to make sure nothing like this happens again: by holding the responsible parties accountable; by putting in place new checks and new safeguards; and going forward, by making sure that the law is applied as it should be: in a fair and impartial way. And we're going to have to make sure that the laws are clear so that we can have confidence that they are enforced in a fair and impartial way and that there's not too much ambiguity surrounding these laws. <p>So that's what I expect. That's what the American people deserve. And that's what we're going to do. <p>Thank you very much.\" "
"108" "\"Well, I appreciate all of you coming in just for a second. We have gathered here all the top people in not just our military, but our entire national security operation. And I want to start off by thanking all the people sitting around this table and in this room for the extraordinary service that they've rendered this country. <p>And I want to also remind everybody that we have folks active in theater right now&mdash;men and women in uniform&mdash;who are making heroic sacrifices on behalf of our security. And our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families, because they are dealing with a whole lot to make sure that we are safe. <p>We have focused this conversation, though, on something that is at the core of our effectiveness as a military. So I told all these people that one of the great honors of my life is serving as Commander in Chief to what I consider to be the best military in the history of the world. And I am in awe of the work that the vast majority of our men and women in uniform do. <p>But the reason we are so good is not because of the fancy equipment. It's not because of our incredible weapon systems and technology. It's because of our people. And the capacity for our men and women in uniform to work as a team, a disciplined unit looking out for each other in the most severe of circumstances, is premised, as Ray Odierno said, on trust. It comes down to, do people trust each other and do they understand that they're all part of a single system that has to operate under whatever circumstances effectively? <p>The issue of sexual assault in our Armed Forces undermines that trust. So not only is it a crime, not only is it shameful and disgraceful, but it also is going to make and has made the military less effective than it can be. And as such, it is dangerous to our national security. So this is not a sideshow. This is not, sort of, a second-order problem that we're experiencing. This is&mdash;goes to the heart and the core of who we are and how effective we're going to be. <p>Now, the good news is, I am absolutely confident that everybody in this room and our leadership, starting with Chuck Hagel and Marty Dempsey and the Joint Chiefs, as well as our top enlisted men and women, they care about this. And they're angry about it. And I heard directly from all of them that they're ashamed by some of what's happened. <p>But it's not fixed yet, and that's clear. So even though I think there's a level of concern and interest that is appropriate, we haven't actually been able to ensure that our men and women in uniform are not experiencing this and if they do experience it, that there's serious accountability. <p>So what I've done is I've asked Secretary of Defense Hagel and Marty Dempsey to help lead a process to continue to get at this. That starts with accountability, and that means at every level. And that includes accountability not just for enforcing the law, but also training our personnel effectively, putting our best people on this challenge. <p>I think Secretary of the Army McHugh made a very good point, which is, I'm not sure we've incentivized some of our top people to understand, this is as core to our mission as anything else. And we've got to reward them, not think of this as a sideline for anything else that they do, but incentivize ambitious folks in the ranks to make sure that they understand this is important. So that's part of accountability. <p>Empowering victims: We've got to create an environment in which victims feel that they're comfortable coming forward and they know people have their backs and that they will work through this process in a way that keeps the focus on justice and making right what's been wrong as opposed to, suddenly, they're on trial, it may weaken their position, it may compromise their ability to advance. That's going to be important. They've got to know that they should have no fear of retaliation, no fear of stigma, no damage to their careers, and certainly no protection for criminals. <p>Third thing is justice for the victims. When victims do come forward, they deserve justice. Perpetrators have to experience consequences. And I'm pleased that Secretary Hagel has proposed reforms that would restrict the ability of commanders to overturn convictions after trial. Those reforms have my full support. <p>There are a range of ideas that are being proposed on Capitol Hill, and I know that Chuck and Marty are both engaged with those Members of Congress. But what I've said to them is, I want to leave no stone unturned and I want us to explore every good idea that's out there in order to fix this problem. And I'm pleased to say that Secretary Hagel is not only consulting with Congress, but is also looking at militaries around the world&mdash;the Canadians or the Israelis or others&mdash;that may have designed systems that get at this to see if there are any lessons learned in terms of best practices. <p>And Vice President Biden, who has been a champion for issues&mdash;around issues of domestic violence for 20 years or more, he made an important point, which is, is that we've got to make sure that advocates and professionals who are in the civilian system and have been working on this problem for a long time, that we're listening to them as well; that we don't assume that the military has to completely recreate the wheel. And I think that's a very important point. <p>So I want to thank all the work that Congress is doing, especially our friends in the Senate. All of us here are committed to working with them. <p>The last point I'm going to make, and that is that there is no silver bullet to solving this problem. This is going to require a sustained effort over a long period of time. And that's why I'm very pleased to know that Secretary Hagel is going to be having weekly meetings on this. And I want us to make sure that we've got effective metrics and feedback loops so that we are continually evaluating how well we're doing. <p>One point that was made around the table is that a sign that we're actually getting at this problem may initially be increased reporting rather than less reporting. We may see more reporting of incidents, in part because even outside of our military, traditionally, these problems of sexual assault are vastly underreported. And so over the next several months and years, if I start seeing a&mdash;data that shows that in fact we are seeing more reports, that may actually indicate to me that people are becoming more confident about moving forward. <p>On the other hand, I would then want those trend lines to start going down because that indicates that we're also starting to fix the problem and we've highlighted it and people who are engaging in despicable behavior, they get fully punished for it. <p>So again, I want to emphasize: Everybody in this room has heard from me directly. They've heard from Secretary Hagel, and they've heard from Marty Dempsey. They all understand this is a priority and we will not stop until we've seen this scourge, from what is the greatest military in the world, eliminated. All right? <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"109" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Baltimore! Well, it is wonderful to see all of you. Give Duncan a big round of applause for the great introduction. I want to thank all of you for the warm welcome, the great hospitality. And I tell you what, I'm going to return the favor by hosting your Super Bowl Champion Baltimore Ravens at the White House this summer. So we'll have Ray Lewis in the China Room. What could go wrong? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to thank your CEO, Peter Bowe, and your plant manager, Robert Croom, and your entire team for showing me around this great facility. I was told that one of your customers once named a dredge after President Clinton, so I've got my fingers crossed. [<i>Laughter</i>] Never had a dredge named after me, so I'm looking after&mdash;looking forward to that. <p>I've come here today to talk about our single most important priority as a country right now. And that is reigniting the true engine of our economic growth, and that is a rising, thriving middle class. And as I said in my State of the Union Address this year, that's our north star. That's what we have to focus on. That's what has to guide all our efforts. <p>And we've got some great people who are championing middle class families every single day. First of all, your outstanding Governor&mdash;come on&mdash;Martin O'Malley. Your outstanding mayor, Madam Mayor. You've got some outstanding Members of Congress, led by your senior Senator, Barbara Mikulski. And your own leader in the House of Representatives, he is doing a great job every single day, and he loves this State: Steny Hoyer. <p>The&mdash;so we've got just some extraordinary folks here. Every&mdash;let me make sure I've&mdash;Elijah Cummings is here. But more importantly, Elijah's mom is here. And we are so proud of Elijah, but his mom apparently prays for me every day, so I'm very grateful for her as well. <p>And the&mdash;all of these, all of your Members of Congress, every single day, are working, fighting on behalf&mdash;on your behalf in terms of making sure that we're growing an economy that creates outstanding middle class jobs. That's the challenge that we should be rallying around every single day. And I know it can seem frustrating sometimes when it seems like Washington's priorities aren't the same as your priorities. I know it often seems like folks down there are more concerned with their jobs than with yours. Others may get distracted by chasing every fleeting issue that passes by. But the middle class will always be my number-one focus, period. Your jobs, your families, your communities, that's why I ran for President. That's what drives me every day as I step into the Oval Office. That's what I'm going to keep fighting for over the next 4 years. <p>And that's why I'm so proud to have these partners. The&mdash;John Sarbanes I saved for last, because Congressman Sarbanes, he himself is doing a great job, but when I first came in, his father was one of the people who I so admired in the Senate. He had served for a long time. And I remember just a conversation that we had. He probably doesn't remember it, but he&mdash;I asked him&mdash;I came and paid him a visit, and I asked him, what's your advice? He says: \\"Just keep in mind the people who sent you. Because here in Washington, sometimes people get distracted. But you're here to work on behalf of your constituencies. And if you stick to that, you're going to be just fine.\\" <p>And that's what's happening here in Maryland. Under Governor O'Malley's leadership, Maryland has won back almost 100 percent of the jobs that were claimed by the recession. So you might not know it if you were just watching the news and you're exposed to all these partisan battles and brinksmanship in Washington, but the truth is, there are a lot of reasons to be optimistic about where this country is headed, especially after all that we've been through over the past several years. And that's got to encourage us to roll up our sleeves and work together and take on the challenges that are still holding back the economy and holding down working families. <p>Now, the good news is, in a little over 3 years, businesses like this one have created more than 6.5 million new jobs. And while our unemployment rate is still too high, it's the lowest it's been since 2008. That's good news. But that's not enough because we've also got to create even more good, middle class jobs, and we've go to do it even faster. <p>Corporate profits have skyrocketed at an alltime high. Now we've got to make sure that middle class wages and incomes are going up too, because families all across America haven't seen their take-home pay rise for nearly a decade. That's the next phase. It's good that companies are profitable. I want you to be profitable. I want you to be taking a little more home in your paycheck. <p>Our housing market is healing. But that's not enough. Now we've got to help more families stay in their homes or refinance to take advantage of these historically low interest rates. <p>Our deficits are shrinking at the fastest rate in decades. That's the truth. That's worth applause, sure, because you wouldn't always know that listening to folks in Washington. But the fact is, our deficits are going down faster than they have gone down in decades. But we still have to create a budget that is smart and doesn't hurt middle class families or harm our critical investments into our future. <p>Barbara Mikulski is on the Appropriations Committee; she's fighting hard to make sure that this sequester that is slowing down growth&mdash;and we're starting to see growth slowing down because of furloughs and cuts in defense spending and a whole bunch of stuff that wasn't well thought through. We've got to make sure that we've got a budget that doesn't push our economy back down. We need a budget that pushes our economy back up. <p>The American auto industry is thriving. American energy is booming. American ingenuity in our tech sector has the potential to change the way we do almost everything. <p>And thanks to the grit and determination of the American people, we've been able to clear away the rubble of the crisis. We're now poised for progress, but our work is not done, and our focus cannot drift. We've got to stay focused on our economy and putting people back to work, and raising wages and bringing manufacturing back to the United States of America. That has to be what we're thinking about every single day. <p>Middle class has been taking a beating for more than a decade. You deserve folks in Washington who are willing to fight back on your behalf every single day. Because every single day, you and Americans like you all across the country are working hard and living up to your responsibilities. So you've got to have the same seriousness of purpose in your leaders. <p>Now, I see three areas where we need to focus if we're really going to keep the recovery going, but take it to new heights. Number one, we've got to make America a magnet for good jobs. Number two, we've got to make sure that workers are able to get the education and skills they need to do those jobs. Number three, we've got to make sure that, if and when you're working hard, that that leads to a decent living. <p>And that's why I wanted to come to Baltimore, because a lot of people here in Baltimore, they work hard. Baltimore has gone through tough times in the past, but Baltimore has come bouncing back. <p>I started a few hours ago at a pre-K program at Moravia Park Elementary School. There, kids are getting a head start learning skills they need to succeed in college and the workplace. And by the way, this is a center that was named after Steny's&mdash;Steny Hoyer's late wife Judy because she and Steny share my belief in the importance of giving every kid every chance as early as possible. <p>I got to help with one of the lessons; we were having to draw zoo animals. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I've got to say, my tiger was not very good. [<i>Laughter</i>] The kids were unimpressed. They kind of looked at it, they said, that doesn't look like a tiger. [<i>Laughter</i>] But they were amazing. <p>And later today I'm going to visit with a program that helps people who have gone through some tough circumstances, especially low-income dads, and this program is now helping them get the training and the guidance they need to find work and support a family. The&mdash;which is a priority because&mdash;and probably, some of these folks who I'm meeting, they didn't get that early childhood education that put them on the right track. And what we want to do is, first of all, make sure our kids are getting the training they need, but if they missed out early on, we still want to give them opportunity on the backend. <p>But obviously, the training of kids, giving them good education, training older workers, none of that is going to make a difference if we don't have great companies that are hiring. And that's why I wanted to come to Ellicott. <p>Ellicott Dredges, you guys are an example of what we can do to make America a magnet for good jobs. After all, you all know a thing or two about growing the economy; you've been doing it for more than a century. This company was founded in 1885. You've been right here on Bush Street since 1900. This company built dredging equipment that helped dig the Panama Canal. [<i>Applause</i>] That's impressive. <p>What that means is this company, right here in Baltimore, literally helped create our global economy, because that was one of the first connectors, right, that started to allow us to ship goods and cut the distances that integrated the world economy. <p>And yet, after all this time, this company still has a set of core values that's lasted for generations. Just like the folks who came before you, you've got that drive to make the best machines that money can buy, to sell products all over the world, to grow not just a business, but a community, and by doing that, you're growing our country. <p>And these values have seen you through an era of enormous change. Your leaders saw the potential in developing markets like China and India and Brazil and Bangladesh. So you ramped up your focus on airports&mdash;on exports&mdash;maybe on airports too&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but on exports. And the Federal Government has worked with you as a partner to sell dredging equipment right out of this shop all over the world. You maintained your quality. You built a sales force that travels everywhere, outhustling the competition in search of new business. <p>All that hard work has paid off. Today, this company, you have sold equipment to more than 100 different countries. You've made new investments here at home. You employ more than 200 people in Baltimore and Wisconsin and Kansas. And over the past few decades, during some of the tough times for our workers, you were able to keep building equipment stamped with those three proud words: Made in America. And you're selling it around the world. <p>As Steny Hoyer and some of these House Members like to say, that means you're making it in America. <p><i>Representative Steny H. Hoyer</i>. All right. <p><i>The President.</i> See, Steny gets excited. [<i>Laughter</i>] You're actually making stuff here in America, but it also means that we're all making it here in America when you do what you're doing. And this is a great example. <p>And the good news is, more and more companies are following your example. After shedding jobs for 10 years, our manufacturers have added more than 500,000 jobs over the past 3 years. Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico. Caterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan. After placing plants in other countries like China, Intel, which is making the chips in your smartphone and your iPad and your&mdash;all of these gizmos everybody is holding up right now&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;Intel is opening its most advanced plant right here at home, right here in America. <p>Washington should be helping these kinds of success stories take root all across the country. That's why we've boosted&mdash;my administration has boosted our efforts to help businesses export more of their goods and services. That's why we signed trade agreements that will protect American workers, but open up new markets and support tens of thousands of good-paying jobs. <p>That's why we reauthorized the Export-Import Bank. And we are proud to have the bank's chairman right here, Fred Hochberg. He's here this afternoon. He's helping this company, as we speak, sell more goods overseas. And so today, exports are at an alltime high. We are selling more stuff around the world. We've added more than a million export-supported jobs since I took office. <p>So all these steps are making a difference, but there's more we can do. We need to pursue new trade agreements with Europe and the Pacific region. We need to invest in high-tech manufacturing centers, because I want the next revolution in manufacturing to be made here in America. <p>Our workers are at our best when we're building stuff. So today I'm also announcing the next step in our effort to cut through redtape that keeps big construction projects from getting off the ground. <p>Now, some of you, if you've heard me, I'm really big on us rebuilding our .infrastructure in this country I want to put people back to work improving our roads, our bridges, our airports, our ports. We were talking about the Panama Canal. The Panama Canal is being revamped down in Panama so that it can accommodate even bigger ships. And these cargo ships are so big that if we don't remodel our ports here in the United States, they can't dock at our ports. They'll dock someplace else. We'll lose that business. <p>So we've got to up our game when it comes to infrastructure. And the good news is, when you do that, you're putting people back to work right away, operating dredging equipment and doing other stuff, and you're also laying the foundation for future economic growth. <p>Now, the problem is, we've had some trouble out of Congress just going ahead and funding&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> I know, it's surprising, isn't it? [<i>Laughter</i>] But we've had some little difficulty getting our Republican friends to work with us to find a steady funding source for these projects that everybody knows needs to happen. But in fairness, one of the problems we've had in the past is, is that sometimes, it takes too long to get projects off the ground. There are all these permits and redtape and planning and this and that, and some of it's important to do, but we could do it faster. <p>So a while back, what I did was, I ordered everybody who was involved in approving projects to speed up the permitting process for 50 different big projects all across the country, from the Tappan Zee Bridge in New York to the Port of Charleston in South Carolina. And we've been able to, in some cases, cut approval times from 7 years down to a year. Right? So we've made progress. <p>Today I'm directing agencies across the Government to do what it takes to cut timelines for breaking ground on major infrastructure projects in half. And what that will mean is, is that construction workers get back on the jobs faster. It means more money going back into local economies, and it means more demand for outstanding dredging equipment that is made right here in Baltimore. <p>Now, some of you know, one of the guys who has been working on this, he's Deputy Transportation Secretary John Porcari, your former transportation secretary here in Maryland before Governor O'Malley generously agreed to share him with the entire country. <p>So those are some of the ways that we can create the conditions for businesses like this one to generate even more good jobs. And these are the kinds of ideas that we have to stay focused on every single day. This should be our principal focus: How are we making ourselves more competitive? How are we training our workers so that they can do the jobs that need to be done? How can we make sure that we stay on the cutting edge in terms of technology? How are we making it easier for businesses to succeed? <p>And I'm going to keep trying to work with both parties in Washington to make progress, because our challenges are solvable. I travel all around the world, and I meet people from all walks of life. And I can tell you, there's not a country on Earth that wouldn't trade places with the United States of America. That's really true. They know we've got all the ingredients to succeed. We've got the answers. The only thing that's holding us back sometimes is a lack of political will. Sometimes, our leadership isn't focused where we need to be focused. And that's where you come in. It's up to you and all the people across the country to tell the people in Washington, focus on getting stuff done. We may not agree on the way to do certain things, but I think we all love our country. We all want what's best for our kids and our grandkids. <p>Wouldn't we be better off if every American could find a good job that pays the bills and lets you afford a home and maybe take a vacation, put some money away to retire? Wouldn't we all be better off if we knew that all of our kids were getting a good education from an earliest age, if we reformed our high schools for this new economy, if we're helping more young people afford to go to college? <p>Wouldn't we be better off if every worker's wage was a wage you could live on? Nobody wants to be on welfare. Nobody wants to have to rely on a handout. They want to work. But let's make sure that work pays. <p>Wouldn't we be better off if every American could afford quality healthcare and the peace of mind that comes with it? That's why we passed health care reform. Wouldn't we be better off if we did what's necessary to protect more of our children from the horrors of gun violence? <p>There are going to be disagreements about how we get there. But let's remind ourselves that when we work together nobody can stop us, when we do the right thing. That's what I believe. That's what I'm going to keep fighting for. That's what drives me; it's all the stories of people like you that I have the great honor of meeting and working with every single day. You deserve leaders with the same dedication and commitment and focus that the people who work at this company bring to their jobs every single day. And you look at those dredges up there&mdash;and I met folks who have worked here 38 years, some who have worked 40 years, and the pride that they take in their product and the way they all work together, that's the attitude that we've got to bring to bear here. <p>I think about a woman here, Myrna LaBarre. Myrna LaBarre. Where is Myrna? There's Myrna right here. [<i>Applause</i>] Myrna LaBarre. Myrna has been at Ellicott for more than 50 years. Now, that means she started when there were no child labor laws, because she&mdash;it was clearly illegal. [<i>Laughter</i>] She was about 4 or 5, and they started putting her to work, put a broom in her hand. But when somebody asked Myrna what lessons she learned after 50 years working at the same company, she said, \\"Be honest, be helpful, accept your mistakes and improve upon them, be good to people, keep a good sense of humor, have the best work ethic possible, and handle the good times and get over the bad.\\" That's a pretty good recipe for success right there. That's who we are. [<i>Applause</i>] That's who we are. Thank you, Myrna. <p>I mean, that pretty much sums up everything. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's who we like to understand America to be, who we are as Americans. We're honest and helpful. We work hard. We're good to others. We handle the good times, and we get over the bad times. If we keep that in mind, if we just all keep Myrna's advice in mind, keep plugging away, keep fighting, we'll build an even better America than we've got right now. <p><i>Audience member.</i> We're praying! <p><i>The President.</i> And I know you're going to&mdash;we can pray too; we'll add that in there. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>If we work to create more jobs, if we give every American the tools that they need for those jobs, if we make sure that hard work pays off and that responsibility is rewarded, then once again, America is going to be the place where you can always make it if you try. And we'll all prosper together. And we'll make sure that America remains the greatest nation on Earth. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"110" "\"Hi, everybody. Over the past few months, I've laid out a series of commonsense ideas to reignite the true engine of our economic growth: a rising, thriving middle class. <p>The way I see it, there are three areas where we need to focus: one, making America a magnet for good jobs; two, making sure our workers have the education and skills they need to do those jobs; and three, making sure your hard work leads to a decent living. <p>I've also been visiting cities across the country that are doing some interesting and creative things along these lines. So, on Friday, for example, I stopped by a factory in Baltimore that's creating good jobs here at home by exporting dredging equipment abroad. I read with young kids at a pre-K program, where kids are getting a head start learning the skills they need to succeed in life. And I stopped by a program that's helping folks in tough circumstances, especially low-income dads, get the training and guidance they need to find work and support their families. <p>That's why I like getting out of the Washington echo chamber whenever I can, because too often our politics aren't focused on the same things you are: working hard, supporting your family and supporting your community, making sure your kids have every chance in life. <p>More than anything, the American people make me optimistic about where we're headed as a nation, especially after all we've been through during the past several years. And that should encourage us all to work even harder on the issues that matter to you. <p>In a little over 3 years, our businesses have created more than 6.5 million new jobs. And while our unemployment rate is still too high, it's the lowest it's been since 2008. But now, we need to create even more good, middle class jobs, and we've got to do it faster. <p>Corporate profits have skyrocketed to an alltime high. But now we need to get middle class wages and incomes rising too. <p>Our housing market is healing. But we need to do a lot more to help families stay in their homes or to help them refinance to take advantage of historically low rates. <p>And our deficits, well, they're shrinking at the fastest rate in decades. But now we've got to budget in a smarter way that doesn't hurt middle class families or harm critical investments in our future. <p>So in a lot of sectors, things are looking up. The American auto industry is thriving. American energy is booming. And American ingenuity in our high-tech sector has the potential to change the way we do almost everything. <p>In the coming weeks, I'm going to visit more cities like Baltimore and Austin, Texas&mdash;where I was 2 weeks ago&mdash;places where Americans are coming together to strengthen their own communities and economies and, in the process, making this country better for all of us. <p>And I'm going to keep on trying to work with both parties in Washington to make progress on your priorities. Because I know that if we come together around creating more jobs, educating more of our kids, and building new ladders of opportunity for everyone who's willing to climb them, we'll all prosper together. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"111" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Morehouse! Well, thank you, everybody. Please be seated. <p><i>Audience member</i>. We love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. [<i>Laughter</i>] That is why I am here. <p>Now, I have to say that it is one of the great honors of my life to be able to address this gathering here today. I want to thank Dr. Wilson for his outstanding leadership, and the Board of Trustees. We have Congressmen Cedric Richmond and Sanford Bishop, both proud alumni of this school, as well as Congressman Hank Johnson. And one of my dear friends and a great inspiration to us all, the great John Lewis is here. We have your outstanding mayor, Mr. Kasim Reed, in the house. <p>To all the members of the Morehouse family, and most of all, congratulations to this distinguished group of Morehouse men, the class of 2013. <p>I have to say that it's a little hard to follow&mdash;not Dr. Wilson, but a skinny guy with a funny name. [<i>Laughter</i>] Betsegaw Tadele, he's going to be doing something. <p>[<i>At this point, thunder sounded in the background</i>.] <p>I also have to say that you all are going to get wet. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I'd be out there with you if I could. [<i>Laughter</i>] But Secret Service gets nervous. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I'm going to have to stay here, dry. [<i>Laughter</i>] But know that I'm there with you in spirit. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Some of you are graduating summa cum laude. Some of you are graduating magna cum laude. I know some of you are just graduating, \\"thank you, Lordy.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] And that's appropriate because it's a Sunday. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I see some moms and grandmas here, aunts, in their Sunday best; although, they are upset about their hair getting messed up. [<i>Laughter</i>] Michelle would not be sitting in the rain. [<i>Laughter</i>] She has taught me about hair. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to congratulate all of you: the parents, the grandparents, the brothers and sisters, the family and friends who supported these young men in so many ways. This is your day as well. Just think about it: Your sons, your brothers, your nephews, they've spent the last 4 years far from home and close to Spelman, and yet they are still here today. So you've done something right. Graduates, give a big round of applause to your family for everything that they've done for you. <p>I know that some of you had to wait in long lines to get into today's ceremony. And I would apologize, but it did not have anything to do with security. Those graduates just wanted you to know what it's like to register for classes here. [<i>Laughter</i>] And this time of year brings a different kind of stress: every senior stopping by Gloster Hall over the past week making sure your name was actually on the list of students who met all the graduation requirements. If it wasn't on the list, you had to figure out why. Was it that library book you lent to that trifling roommate who didn't return it? [<i>Laughter</i>] Was it Dr. Johnson's policy class? Did you get enough Crown Forum credits? <p>On that last point, I'm going to exercise my power as President to declare this speech sufficient Crown Forum credits for any otherwise eligible student to graduate. That is my graduation gift to you. You have a special dispensation. <p>Now, graduates, I am humbled to stand here with all of you as an honorary Morehouse man. I finally made it. [<i>Laughter</i>] And as I do, I am mindful of an old saying: \\"You can always tell a Morehouse man, but you can't tell him much.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] And that makes my task a little more difficult, I suppose. But I think it also reflects the sense of pride that's always been part of this school's tradition. <p>Benjamin Mays, who served as the president of Morehouse for almost 30 years, understood that tradition better than anybody. He said, and I quote, \\"It will not be sufficient for Morehouse College, for any college, for that matter, to produce clever graduates; but rather honest men, men who can be trusted in public and private life, men who are sensitive to the wrongs, the sufferings, and the injustices of society and who are willing to accept responsibility for correcting those ills.\\" <p>It was that mission, not just to educate men, but to cultivate good men, strong men, upright men, that brought community leaders together just 2 years after the end of the Civil War. They assembled a list of 37 men, free Blacks and freed slaves, who would make up the first prospective class of what later became Morehouse College. Most of those first students had a desire to become teachers and preachers, to better themselves so they could help others do the same. <p>A century and a half later, times have changed. But the Morehouse mystique still endures. Some of you probably came here from communities where everybody looked like you. Others may have come here in search of a community. And I suspect that some of you probably felt a little bit of culture shock the first time you came together as a class in King's Chapel. All of a sudden, you weren't the only high school sports captain, you weren't the only student council president. You were suddenly in a group of high achievers, and that meant you were expected to do something more. <p>And that's the unique sense of purpose that this place has always infused: the conviction that this is a training ground not only for individual success, but for leadership that can change the world. <p>Dr. King was just 15 years old when he enrolled here at Morehouse. He was an unknown, undersized, unassuming young freshman who lived at home with his parents. And I think it's fair to say he wasn't the coolest kid on campus; for the suits he wore, his classmates called him Tweed. But his education at Morehouse helped to forge the intellect, the discipline, the compassion, the soul force that would transform America. It was here that he was introduced to the writings of Gandhi and Thoreau and the theory of civil disobedience. It was here that professors encouraged him to look past the world as it was and fight for the world as it should be. And it was here, at Morehouse, as Dr. King later wrote, where \\"I realized that nobody . . . was afraid.\\" <p>Not even of some bad weather. I added on that part. [<i>Laughter</i>] I know it's wet out there. But Dr. Wilson told me you all had a choice and decided to do it out here anyway. That's a Morehouse man talking. <p>Now, think about it: For Black men in the forties and the fifties, the threat of violence, the constant humiliations, large and small, the uncertainty that you could support a family, the gnawing doubts born of the Jim Crow culture that told you every day that somehow you were inferior, the temptation to shrink from the world, to accept your place, to avoid risks, to be afraid&mdash;that temptation was necessarily strong. <p>And yet here, under the tutelage of men like Dr. Mays, young Martin learned to be unafraid. And he, in turn, taught others to be unafraid. And over time, he taught a nation to be unafraid. And over the last 50 years, thanks to the moral force of Dr. King and a Moses generation that overcame their fear and their cynicism and their despair, barriers have come tumbling down, and new doors of opportunity have swung open, and laws and hearts and minds have been changed to the point where someone who looks just like you can somehow come to serve as President of these United States of America. <p>So the history we share should give you hope. The future we share should give you hope. You're graduating into an improving job market. You're living in a time when advances in technology and communication put the world at your fingertips. Your generation is uniquely poised for success unlike any generation of African Americans that came before it. <p>But that doesn't mean we don't have work, because if we're honest with ourselves, we know that too few of our brothers have the opportunities that you've had here at Morehouse. In troubled neighborhoods all across this country, many of them heavily African American, too few of our citizens have role models to guide them. Communities just a couple of miles from my house in Chicago, communities just a couple miles from here, they're places where jobs are still too scarce and wages are still too low; where schools are underfunded and violence is pervasive; where too many of our men spend their youths, not behind a desk in a classroom, but hanging out on the streets or brooding behind a jail cell. <p>My job as President is to advocate for policies that generate more opportunity for everybody: policies that strengthen the middle class and give more people the chance to climb their way into the middle class, policies that create more good jobs and reduce poverty and educate more children and give more families the security of health care and protect more of our children from the horrors of gun violence. That's my job. Those are matters of public policy, and it is important for all of us&mdash;Black, White, and Brown&mdash;to advocate for an America where everybody has got a fair shot in life. Not just some. Not just a few. <p>But along with collective responsibilities, we have individual responsibilities. There are some things, as Black men, we can only do for ourselves. There are some things, as Morehouse men, that you are obliged to do for those still left behind. As Morehouse men, you now wield something even more powerful than the diploma you're about to collect, and that's the power of your example. <p>So what I ask of you today is the same thing I ask of every graduating class I address: Use that power for something larger than yourself. Live up to President Mays's challenge. Be \\"sensitive to the wrongs, the sufferings, and the injustices of society.\\" And be \\"willing to accept responsibility for correcting those ills.\\" <p>I know that some of you came to Morehouse from communities where life was about keeping your head down and looking out for yourself. Maybe you feel like you escaped and now you can take your degree and get that fancy job and the nice house and the nice car and never look back. And don't get me wrong, with all those student loans you've had to take out, I know you've got to earn some money. With doors open to you that your parents and grandparents could not even imagine, no one expects you to take a vow of poverty. But I will say, it betrays a poverty of ambition if all you think about is what goods you can buy instead of what good you can do. <p>So yes, go get that law degree. But if you do, ask yourself if the only option is to defend the rich and the powerful or if you can also find some time to defend the powerless. Sure, go get your MBA or start that business. We need Black businesses out there. But ask yourselves what broader purpose your business might serve in putting people back to work or transforming a neighborhood. The most successful CEOs I know didn't start out intent just on making money; rather, they had a vision of how their product or service would change things, and the money followed. <p>Some of you may be headed to medical school to become doctors. But make sure you heal folks in underserved communities who really need it too. For generations, certain groups in this country, especially African Americans, have been desperate in need of access to quality, affordable health care. And as a society, we're finally beginning to change that. Those of you who are under age 26 already have the option to stay on your parent's health care plan. But all of you are heading into an economy where many young people expect not only to have multiple jobs, but multiple careers. <p>So starting October 1, because of the Affordable Care Act&mdash;otherwise known as Obamacare&mdash;you'll be able to shop for a quality, affordable plan that's yours and travels with you, a plan that will insure not only your health, but your dreams if you are sick or go&mdash;get in an accident. But we're going to need some doctors to make sure it works too. We've got to make sure everybody has good health in this country. It's not just good for you, it's good for this country. So you're going to have to spread the word to your fellow young people. <p>Which brings me to a second point: Just as Morehouse has taught you to expect more of yourselves, inspire those who look up to you to expect more of themselves. We know that too many young men in our community continue to make bad choices. And I have to say, growing up, I made quite a few myself. Sometimes, I wrote off my own failings as just another example of the world trying to keep a Black man down. I had a tendency sometimes to make excuses for me not doing the right thing. But one of the things that all of you have learned over the last 4 years is, there's no longer any room for excuses. <p>I understand there's a common fraternity creed here at Morehouse: \\"Excuses are tools of the incompetent used to build bridges to nowhere and monuments of nothingness.\\" Well, we've got no time for excuses. Not because the bitter legacy of slavery and segregation have vanished entirely; they have not. Not because racism and discrimination no longer exist; we know those are still out there. It's just that in today's hyperconnected, hypercompetitive world, with millions of young people from China and India and Brazil, many of whom started with a whole lot less than all of you did, all of them entering the global workforce alongside you, nobody is going to give you anything that you have not earned. <p>Nobody cares how tough your upbringing was. Nobody cares if you suffered some discrimination. And moreover, you have to remember that whatever you've gone through, it pales in comparison to the hardships previous generations endured, and they overcame them. And if they overcame them, you can overcome them too. <p>You now hail from a lineage and legacy of immeasurably strong men, men who bore tremendous burdens and still laid the stones for the path on which we now walk. You wear the mantle of Frederick Douglass and Booker T. Washington and Ralph Bunche and Langston Hughes and George Washington Carver and Ralph Abernathy and Thurgood Marshall and, yes, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. These men were many things to many people. And they knew full well the role that racism played in their lives. But when it came to their own accomplishments and sense of purpose, they had no time for excuses. <p>Every one of you have a grandma or an uncle or a parent who's told you that at some point in life, as an African American, you have to work twice as hard as anyone else if you want to get by. I think President Mays put it even better. He said, \\"Whatever you do, strive to do it so well that no man living and no man dead and no man yet to be born can do it any better.\\" <p>And I promise you, what was needed in Dr. Mays's time&mdash;that spirit of excellence and hard work and dedication and no excuses&mdash;is needed now more than ever. If you think you can just get over in this economy just because you have a Morehouse degree, you're in for a rude awakening. But if you stay hungry, if you keep hustling, if you keep on your grind and get other folks to do the same, nobody can stop you. <p>And when I talk about pursuing excellence and setting an example, I'm not just talking about in your professional life. One of today's graduates, Frederick Anderson&mdash;where's Frederick? Frederick, right here. I want&mdash;I know it's raining, but I'm going to tell about Frederick. Frederick started his college career in Ohio, only to find out that his high school sweetheart back in Georgia was pregnant. So he came back and enrolled in Morehouse to be closer to her. Pretty soon, helping raise a newborn and working night shifts became too much, so he started taking business classes at a technical college instead, doing everything from delivering newspapers to buffing hospital floors to support his family. <p>And then he enrolled at Morehouse a second time. But even with a job, he couldn't keep up with the cost of tuition. So after getting his degree from that technical school, this father of three decided to come back to Morehouse for a third time. As Frederick says, \\"God has a plan for my life, and He's not done with me yet.\\" <p>And today, Frederick is a family man and a working man and a Morehouse man. And that's what I'm asking all of you to do: Keep setting an example for what it means to be a man. Be the best husband to your wife or your boyfriend or your partner. Be the best father you can be to your children, because nothing is more important. <p>I was raised by a heroic single mom, wonderful grandparents, made incredible sacrifices for me. And I know there are moms and grandparents here today who did the same thing for all of you. But I sure wish I had had a father who was not only present, but involved. Didn't know my dad. And so my whole life, I've tried to be for Michelle and my girls what my father was not for my mother and me. I want to break that cycle where a father is not at home, where a father is not helping to raise that son or daughter. I want to be a better father, a better husband, a better man. <p>It's hard work that demands your constant attention and frequent sacrifice. And I promise you&mdash;Michelle will tell you&mdash;I'm not perfect. She's got a long list of my imperfections. [<i>Laughter</i>] Even now I'm still practicing, I'm still learning, still getting corrected in terms of how to be a fine husband and a good father. But I will tell you this: Everything else is unfulfilled if we fail at family, if we fail at that responsibility. <p>I know that when I am on my deathbed someday, I will not be thinking about any particular legislation I pass. I will not be thinking about a policy I promoted. I will not be thinking about the speech I gave. I will not be thinking the Nobel Prize I received. I will be thinking about that walk I took with my daughters. I'll be thinking about a lazy afternoon with my wife. I'll be thinking about sitting around the dinner table and seeing them happy and healthy and knowing that they were loved. And I'll be thinking about whether I did right by all of them. <p>So be a good role model. Set a good example for that young brother coming up. If you know somebody who's not on point, go back and bring that brother along. Those who've been left behind, who haven't had the same opportunities we have, they need to hear from you. You've got to be engaged on the barbershop, on the basketball court, at church, spend time and energy and presence to give people opportunities and a chance. Pull them up, expose them, support their dreams. Don't put them down. <p>We've got to teach them&mdash;just like what we have to learn&mdash;what it means to be a man: to serve your city like Maynard Jackson; to shape the culture like Spike Lee; to be like Chester Davenport, one of the first people to integrate the University of Georgia Law School. When he got there, nobody would sit next to him in class. But Chester didn't mind. Later on, he said: \\"It was the right thing for me to do. Someone needed to be the first.\\" And today Chester is here celebrating his 50th reunion. Where is Chester Davenport? He's here. <p>So if you've had role models&mdash;fathers, brothers like that&mdash;thank them today. And if you haven't, commit yourself to being that man to somebody else. <p>And finally, as you do these things, do them not just for yourself, but don't even do them just for the African American community. I want you to set your sights higher. At the turn of the last century, W.E.B. Du Bois spoke about the \\"talented tenth,\\" a class of highly educated, socially conscious leaders in the Black community. But it's not just the African American community that needs you. The country needs you. The world needs you. <p>As Morehouse men, many of you know what it's like to be an outsider, know what it's like to be marginalized, know what it's like to feel the string of&mdash;sting of discrimination. And that's an experience that a lot of Americans share. Hispanic Americans know that feeling when somebody asks them where they come from or tell them to go back. Gay and lesbian Americans feel it when a stranger passes judgment on their parenting skills or the love that they share. Muslim Americans feel it when they're stared at with suspicion because of their faith. Any woman who knows the injustice of earning less pay for doing the same work, she knows what it's like to be on the outside looking in. <p>So your experiences give you special insight that today's leaders need. If you tap into that experience, it should endow you with empathy: the understanding of what it's like to walk in somebody else's shoes, to see through their eyes; to know what it's like when you're not born on third base, thinking you hit a triple. It should give you the ability to connect. It should give you a sense of compassion and what it means to overcome barriers. <p>And I will tell you, class of 2013, whatever success I have achieved, whatever positions of leadership I have held have depended less on Ivy League degrees or SAT scores or GPAs and have instead been due to that sense of connection and empathy, the special obligation I felt, as a Black man like you, to help those who need it most: people who didn't have the opportunities that I had. Because there but for the grace of God, go I; I might have been in their shoes. I might have been in prison. I might have been unemployed. I might not have been able to support a family. And that motivates me. <p>So it's up to you to widen your circle of concern, to care about justice for everybody: White, Black, and Brown. Everybody. Not just in your own community, but also across this country and around the world. To make sure everyone has a voice and everybody gets a seat at the table; that everybody, no matter what you look like or where you come from, what your last name is, where&mdash;it doesn't matter, everybody gets a chance to walk through those doors of opportunity if they are willing to work hard enough. <p>When Leland Shelton was 4 years old&mdash;where's Leland? Stand up, Leland. When Leland Shelton was 4 years old, social services took him away from his mama, put him in the care of his grandparents. By age 14, he was in the foster care system. Three years after that, Leland enrolled in Morehouse. And today he is graduating Phi Beta Kappa on his way to Harvard Law School. But he's not stopping there. As a member of the National Foster Care Youth and Alumni Policy Council, he plans to use his law degree to make sure kids like him don't fall through the cracks. And it won't matter whether they're Black kids or Brown kids or White kids or Native American kids, because he'll understand what they're going through. And he'll be fighting for them. He'll be in their corner. That's leadership. That's a Morehouse man right there. <p>That's what we've come to expect from you, Morehouse, a legacy of leaders, not just in our Black community, but for the entire American community: to recognize the burdens you carry with you, but to resist the temptation to use them as excuses; to transform the way we think about manhood and set higher standards for ourselves and for others; to be successful, but also to understand that each of us has responsibilities not just to ourselves, but to one another and to future generations. Men who refuse to be afraid. Men who refuse to be afraid. <p>Members of the class of 2013, you are heirs to a great legacy. You have within you that same courage and that same strength, the same resolve as the men who came before you. That's what being a Morehouse man is all about. That's what being an American is all about. <p>Success may not come quickly or easily. But if you strive to do what's right, if you work harder and dream bigger, if you set an example in your own lives and do your part to help meet the challenges of our times, then I am confident that, together, we will continue the never-ending task of perfecting our Union. <p>Congratulations, class of 2013. God bless you, God bless Morehouse, and God bless the United States of America.\" "
"112" "\"Thank you, everybody. Everybody, please have a seat. Please have a seat. <p>Let me begin by saying that you just heard from one of the finest Senators we've got in this country and an example of the kind of young national leadership that we are seeing. Michael, who was a superintendent in schools, cares about policy, cares about education, and he's doing a great job in the Senate. And so I couldn't be prouder to call him a friend. Please give Michael Bennet a big round of applause. <p>And, Michael, if it makes you feel any better, what&mdash;the feeling you described is exactly how I feel every time I precede Michelle on the podium. [<i>Laughter</i>] She&mdash;people want to get rid of me quick too. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I also want to acknowledge one of the finest young mayors that we've got in the country, Kasim Reed in the house. And the person primarily responsible for Kasim's success, his mother, who, of course, looks too young to be his mother, but is his mother. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And I want to thank Arthur Blank for hosting us. Speaking of people responsible for our success, Arthur's mom is here. She is celebrating her 98th birthday today, and so we've got to give her a big round of applause. Happy birthday. [<i>Applause</i>] Happy birthday. And Arthur's promised, for your birthday, that the Falcons will win the Super Bowl this year. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's a promise. <p>I just had the pleasure of speaking at the Morehouse commencement. And it was a spectacular gathering, a very wet gathering because there were thunderstorms, but people were undaunted. And you had 500-plus incredible young men and their families there. The valedictorian was a young man, an immigrant from Ethiopia, who, like me, was skinny, and initially at least, it was very hard to pronounce his name. And he's now going to be going off to Microsoft to help do program design at Microsoft's head office. <p>During the course of the address that I gave I had the opportunity to address a young man who had been taken away from his mother when he was 4, lived with his grandparents, but then had some issues there, ended up in the foster system, and 3 years after he entered into the foster care system, was admitted to Morehouse and is now on his way to Harvard Law School, where he intends to practice law in the child welfare system and is already on the national advisory board for children's welfare. <p>And I tell these stories because all around the country, I get a chance to meet young people who are simply remarkable, who have overcome the biggest odds, who are doing things that I could not ever dream of doing. And it makes you so optimistic about the future of America. There is a spirit of innovation and a spirit of determination, and there is an awareness of the environment and social equity and a belief that there's nothing that can stop America when people are pulling together. And you see it in these young people, and it just makes you ready to go out there and fight the good fight. <p>And the challenge is, is that all too often, that same spirit isn't as evident as it needs to be in Washington. Sometimes, you feel as if Washington is impeding rather than advancing the possibilities that these young people represent. <p>And so, for the last 4 years, I've been fairly busy&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;ending a war; winding down another war; making sure that we went after Al Qaida and those who attacked us on 9/11; recovering from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression; saving an auto industry; stabilizing the banking system; making sure that we have a system in place that every American has access to health care; ensuring that we begin on the road to energy independence; deal with issues like climate change; double our fuel efficiency on cars; double our production of clean energy; make sure that our education system is on a solid path of reform; and making sure that college is affordable so that those young people that I saw at Morehouse, that more of them are able to graduate without a mountain of debt. <p>And all of that progress is because of you. Couldn't have done it had it not been for the incredible support of so many people in this room. But what I think we're all aware of is that our job is not finished, that those Morehouse graduates that we just saw, they're entering into a job market that is still challenging, and because of some policies in Washington like the sequester, growth may end up slowing and we may start seeing once again the job market stall in ways that makes it a lot harder for them to realize their full potential. <p>We know that we've still got a lot of work to do when it comes to education. One of the things that I talked about during the State of the Union is making sure that we've got early childhood education in place. The last time I was in Georgia, I was out at Decatur. It's got a wonderful model program for early childhood education. You've got kids who are poor alongside kids who are middle class and alongside disabled kids, all of them coming together with outstanding teachers who have teacher-coaches. <p>And we can document, every dollar we spend on early childhood education, we get $7 back in fewer dropouts, in fewer teen pregnancies, in fewer incarcerations. It pays off. But what those kids in Decatur experience, there are a lot more kids out there who don't have that same chance, don't have that same shot. <p>We know that we've still got a lot&mdash;to do a lot more work when it comes to energy. We are sitting on this revolution in the energy sector. Probably in 5, 6, 7 years, America will be a net exporter of natural gas. And we will be able to say, probably in 15 years or so, that we are about as close as you can be to energy independent as America has ever been. But despite that, what we also know is, is that the energy sources of the future are not going to be enough&mdash;or the past are not going to be enough. We've got to look at the energy source of the future. <p>And there's still a lot more work to be done to make our economy more energy efficient, to make sure that we're dealing with serious issues like climate change. When I look at Arthur's incredible kids and grandkids, I'm thinking&mdash;just like I'm thinking about when I see Malia and Sasha&mdash;I want to make sure that 30 years from now, 40 years from now, when they're with their kids and their grandkids, that they've got a planet that isn't in chaos because of decisions that we made or decisions that we failed to make. So we've got a lot more work to do there. <p>We've still got to implement health care. We've actually seen health care costs increase at the slowest rate that we've seen in decades, and it's now&mdash;we've seen this over the last 3, 3&frac12; years. So we're making real changes in terms of health care delivery to improve quality and reduce costs. But unfortunately, for a lot of people, they're not seeing those savings because costs are being passed on to them from their employers. And it's still the biggest driver of our deficits. It's still a source of concern when it comes to Medicare and Medicaid. So we're going to have to do a lot of work on that front. <p>Infrastructure: We've got about $2 trillion of deferred maintenance. And I haven't gone through the Atlanta airport recently&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. I don't have to take off my shoes, generally, when I fly. [<i>Laughter</i>] But my assumption is, is that there's some reworking that we could be doing: roads, bridges, ports all across the Gulf. I was down in Costa Rica meeting with the Central American Presidents, and I was reminded once again, Panama is revamping its canal; they're going to be bringing in these mega-container cargo ships. And right now a bunch of those ships can't dock in our ports all along the Gulf&mdash;Georgia, South Carolina, Louisiana. And if we don't revamp those, we're going to lose business. <p>So the good news is every single item that I just mentioned, we've got good, commonsense solutions that we can implement right now. The bad news is, is that there's a shortage of common sense in Washington. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And so part of the reason that what you're doing here today is so important is because it gives us the opportunity to elect more people like a Michael Bennet, who are not ideological, who don't come at this thinking there's just one way of doing things, who are interested in data and are interested in facts and are interested in figuring out what works. And that kind of approach to governance&mdash;if we get a critical mass in the Senate and we can potentially get a critical mass of folks like that in the House&mdash;means that the sky is the limit. Nothing can stop us. <p>I travel all around the world, and the one thing I have to tell you is there's not a country that would not gladly trade places with the United States of America. All right? I mean, you're seeing tremendous changes everywhere. Obviously, in a place like China, we've seen more people rise out of poverty than any time in human history. That is a good thing. We shouldn't feel threatened by that, we should welcome that by&mdash;first of all, because our humanity demands that we welcome people being out of dire poverty, and if it's managed properly, it means that China is more likely to be peaceful, and it means those are big markets for our companies. <p>But what it also means is that&mdash;sometimes, people get worried, are we being overtaken? Is America falling behind? <p>[<i>At this point, an audience member sneezed</i>.] <p>Well&mdash;bless you. [<i>Laughter</i>] Let me tell you, you talk to Chinese leaders; they look at what we've got in terms of our network of universities and the dynamism and talent of our businesses and our strong middle class, and they would love to have our problems. Would love to have our problems. India, same thing. Brazil, same thing. What's holding us back is a tendency in Washington to put politics ahead of policy, to put the next election ahead of the next generation. And that mindset is what we need to change. <p>And that's what Michael Bennet represents, and that's what your efforts represent here: our capacity to get beyond the kind of short-term tactical, partisan thinking that has come to so dominate Washington and to start moving in a direction in which we're just trying to get stuff done. <p>Which doesn't mean that there aren't going to be politics involved; it doesn't mean that there are not going to be some rough and tumble. And one thing that I think folks like myself and Michael and Kasim and others learned is that if you get in this business, folks are going to take their shots at you. And I've got the gray hair to prove it. [<i>Laughter</i>] But that kind of stuff doesn't bother me, and I know it doesn't bother others who are in elected office, if we feel like we're getting stuff done. If we feel that, at the end of the day, when we look back on our public service, we can say, you know what, this country is stronger, better positioned for the future than it was before. <p>And I think we have that possibility. And you're starting to see in Washington some sense, even among the most partisan folks there, that we've, kind of&mdash;the balance has tipped too far away from getting stuff done. And that's why, for example, I'm optimistic about our capacity to get immigration reform done. Michael is one of the group of eight that's been putting this together, seeing four Democrats, four Republicans, who are sitting down and methodically, systematically just trying to fix a broken system because they understand that it needs to get done and that if, in fact, we're able to preserve our identity as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants, our economy is going to be strong, and we're going to be better positioned to compete all around the world. <p>So the upshot is this: Despite sometimes the doom and gloom of what you hear emanating out of Washington, you should be optimistic about this country. I sure am. I think that we are on track with just a few important decisions that are well within our capacity to make sure that the 21st century is the American century just like the 20th century was. <p>But we can't do it alone. What I told those young Morehouse men is that it's not enough that you now have succeeded individually, you now have a broader obligation to this country and to the world. And all of you who, in this room, have been so successful in so many different walks of life, I hope you still feel that sense of obligation, that sense of citizenship, that sense of giving back. That's what built this country. That's its essence. And with your help, that's the kind of spirit that Michael and I and others want to continue to bring to Washington for as long as we can. All right? <p>Thank you very much, everybody. Appreciate it.\" "
"113" "\"Good morning, everybody. As we all know by now, a series of storms swept across the Plains yesterday, and one of the most destructive tornadoes in history sliced through the towns of Newcastle and Moore, Oklahoma. In an instant, neighborhoods were destroyed. Dozens of people lost their lives. Many more were injured. And among the victims were young children, trying to take shelter in the safest place they knew, their school. <p>So our prayers are with the people of Oklahoma today. <p>Our gratitude is with the teachers who gave their all to shield their children, with the neighbors, first responders and emergency personnel who raced to help as soon as the tornado passed, and with all of those who, as darkness fell, searched for survivors through the night. <p>As a nation, our full focus right now is on the urgent work of rescue and the hard work of recovery and rebuilding that lies ahead. <p>Yesterday I spoke with Governor Fallin to make it clear to Oklahomans that they would have all the resources that they need at their disposal. Last night, I issued a disaster declaration to expedite those resources, to support the Governor's team in the immediate response, and to offer direct assistance to folks who have suffered loss. I also just spoke with Mayor Lewis of Moore, Oklahoma, to ensure that he's getting everything that he needs. <p>I've met with Secretary Napolitano this morning and my Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Adviser, Lisa Monaco, to underscore that point that Oklahoma needs to get everything that it needs right away. The FEMA Administrator, Craig Fugate, is on his way to Oklahoma as we speak. FEMA staff was first deployed to Oklahoma's Emergency Operations Center on Sunday, as the State already was facing down the first wave of deadly tornadoes. Yesterday FEMA activated urban search and rescue teams from Texas, Nebraska, and Tennessee to assist in the ongoing search and rescue efforts and a mobile response unit to boost communications and logistical support. <p>So the people of Moore should know that their country will remain on the ground, there for them, beside them as long as it takes. For there are homes and schools to rebuild, businesses and hospitals to reopen, there are parents to console, first responders to comfort, and of course, frightened children who will need our continued love and attention. <p>There are empty spaces where there used to be living rooms, and bedrooms, and classrooms, and in time, we're going to need to refill those spaces with love and laughter and community. <p>We don't yet know the full extent of the damage from this week's storm. We don't know both the human and economic losses that may have occurred. We know that severe rumbling of weather, bad weather, through much of the country still continues, and we're also preparing for a hurricane season that begins next week. <p>But if there is hope to hold on to&mdash;not just in Oklahoma, but around the country&mdash;it's the knowledge that the good people there and in Oklahoma are better prepared for this type of storm than most. And what they can be certain of is that Americans from every corner of this country will be right there with them, opening our homes, our hearts to those in need. Because we're a nation that stands with our fellow citizens as long as it takes. We've seen that spirit in Joplin, in Tuscaloosa; we saw that spirit in Boston and Breezy Point. And that's what the people of Oklahoma are going to need from us right now. <p>For those of you who want to help, you can go online right now to the American Red Cross, which is already on the ground in Moore. Already we've seen the University of Oklahoma announce that it will provide housing for displaced families. We've seen local churches and companies open their doors and their wallets. And last night the people of Joplin dispatched a team to help the people of Moore. <p>So for all those who've been affected, we recognize that you face a long road ahead. In some cases, there will be enormous grief that has to be absorbed, but you will not travel that path alone. Your country will travel it with you, fueled by our faith in the Almighty and our faith in one another. <p>So our prayers are with the people of Oklahoma today. And we will back up those prayers with deeds for as long as it takes. <p>Thank you very much.\" "
"114" "\"Thank you. I have to say that as the podium came out, which meant that was my cue, my mother-in-law said, \\"Oh, shoot.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] True story! She was getting into the music. [<i>Laughter</i>] Welcome to the White House, everybody. <p>I want to start by thanking all the incredible artists who have joined us to pay tribute to the one and only Carole King. I also want to thank Dr. James Billington and all the folks at the Library of Congress not just for making this event possible, but for the outstanding work that they do every day to preserve the very best of our culture for generations to come. <p>Of course, as we gather tonight to present this award, our thoughts and prayers remain with the wonderful people of Oklahoma. They have suffered mightily this week. And while the road ahead will be long, their country will be with them every single step of the way. That's who we are, and that's how we treat our family and friends and our neighbors wherever they are in the country. So we're going to help them recover. We're going to help them rebuild for as long as it takes. And eventually, life will go on and new memories will be made. And new laughter will come. New songs will be sung. <p>And that's often why we turn to music, during trying times, for comfort and for inspiration, and sometimes, just for a good diversion. And George Gershwin, it was said, was a \\"man who lives in music,\\" who \\"expresses everything, serious or not, sound or superficial, by means of music, because it is his native language.\\" And I can't think of a better description of tonight's Gershwin Prize recipient, singer-songwriter Carole King. <p>By the age of 4, Carole was already mastering the piano. By 15, she had already conducted her first orchestra. By 17, she had already written her first number-one hit, which you've already heard, \\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow?\\" with Gerry Goffin. So at this point, all of you are feeling like underachievers. I understand. [<i>Laughter</i>] It was pretty clear by this time that this promising young musician from New York&mdash;who grew up not far from where George and Ira Gershwin were born&mdash;was destined for similar heights. <p>Whether it was Little Eva telling us to do the \\"Loco-Motion\\" or Aretha Franklin belting out the anthem of \\"A Natural Woman\\" or James Taylor reminding us that even here in Washington, \\"You've Got a Friend\\"&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;for an entire decade, behind so many of the songs that touched our hearts, behind so many of the lyrics that stirred our soul, there was Carole, ever joyful, ever uplifting. <p>And then, in 1971, came the biggest break of all, when she showed the world that she couldn't just write hit songs, she could sing them too. Her album \\"Tapestry\\" struck a chord with a whole new legion of fans, including me. It was the very first solo album by a female artist to reach diamond status, meaning it sold more than 10 million copies. It was the first album by a female artist to win all the top Grammy awards for record, song, and album of the year, along with the Grammy for best pop vocal performance. And as one of the best selling albums of all time, it cemented Carole's status as one of the most influential singer-songwriters that America has ever seen. <p>To date, Carole has written more than 400 compositions that had been recorded by over 1,000 artists, resulting in over 100 hits. She's done everything from doo-wop to pop. She's played with everyone from Bono to Babyface. She's been inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. And tonight she's still reaching new heights, becoming the first female artist to win the Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. <p>As Carole tells it, the secret to her success is that \\"I try to get out of the way and let the process be guided by whatever is driving me.\\" That's what makes her songs so personal and so powerful, so enduring. Like the Gershwins, it's not just that Carole lives the music, it's that music lives in her. <p>So tonight it is my great pleasure to present America's highest award for popular music to a living legend, Carole King.\" "
"115" "\"<i>The President.</i> Good afternoon, everybody. Please be seated. <p>It is a great honor to return to the National Defense University. Here at Fort McNair, Americans have served in uniform since 1791, standing guard in the earliest days of the Republic and contemplating the future of warfare here in the 21st century. <p>For over two centuries, the United States has been bound together by founding documents that defined who we are as Americans and served as our compass through every type of change. Matters of war and peace are no different. Americans are deeply ambivalent about war, but having fought for our independence, we know a price must be paid for freedom. From the Civil War to our struggle against fascism, on through the long twilight struggle of the cold war, battlefields have changed, and technology has evolved. But our commitment to constitutional principles has weathered every war, and every war has come to an end. <p>And with the collapse of the Berlin Wall, a new dawn of democracy took hold abroad, and a decade of peace and prosperity arrived here at home. And for a moment, it seemed the 21st century would be a tranquil time. And then, on September 11, 2001, we were shaken out of complacency. Thousands were taken from us, as clouds of fire and metal and ash descended upon a sun-filled morning. This was a different kind of war. No armies came to our shores, and our military was not the principal target. Instead, a group of terrorists came to kill as many civilians as they could. <p>And so our Nation went to war. We have now been at war for well over a decade. I won't review the full history. What is clear is that we quickly drove Al Qaida out of Afghanistan, but then shifted our focus and began a new war in Iraq. And this carried significant consequences for our fight against Al Qaida, our standing in the world, and to this day, our interests in a vital region. <p>Meanwhile, we strengthened our defenses: hardening targets, tightening transportation security, giving law enforcement new tools to prevent terror. Most of these changes were sound. Some caused inconvenience. But some, like expanded surveillance, raised difficult questions about the balance that we strike between our interests in security and our values of privacy. And in some cases, I believe we compromised our basic values, by using torture to interrogate our enemies and detaining individuals in a way that ran counter to the rule of law. <p>So after I took office, we stepped up the war against Al Qaida, but we also sought to change its course. We relentlessly targeted Al Qaida's leadership. We ended the war in Iraq and brought nearly 150,000 troops home. We pursued a new strategy in Afghanistan and increased our training of Afghan forces. We unequivocally banned torture, affirmed our commitment to civilian courts, worked to align our policies with the rule of law, and expanded our consultations with Congress. <p>Today, Usama bin Laden is dead, and so are most of his top lieutenants. There have been no large-scale attacks on the United States, and our homeland is more secure. Fewer of our troops are in harm's way, and over the next 19 months, they will continue to come home. Our alliances are strong, and so is our standing in the world. In sum, we are safer because of our efforts. <p>Now, make no mistake, our Nation is still threatened by terrorists. From Benghazi to Boston, we have been tragically reminded of that truth. But we have to recognize that the threat has shifted and evolved from the one that came to our shores on 9/11. With a decade of experience now to draw from, this is the moment to ask ourselves hard questions about the nature of today's threats and how we should confront them. And these questions matter to every American. <p>For over the last decade, our Nation has spent well over a trillion dollars on war, helping to explode our deficits and constraining our ability to nation-build here at home. Our servicemembers and their families have sacrificed far more on our behalf. Nearly 7,000 Americans have made the ultimate sacrifice. Many more have left a part of themselves on the battlefield or brought the shadows of battle back home. From our use of drones to the detention of terror suspects, the decisions that we are making now will define the type of nation and world that we leave to our children. <p>So America is at a crossroads. We must define the nature and scope of this struggle, or else, it will define us. We have to be mindful of James Madison's warning that \\"No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.\\" Neither I, nor any President, can promise the total defeat of terror. We will never erase the evil that lies in the hearts of some human beings, nor stamp out every danger to our open society. But what we can do&mdash;what we must do&mdash;is dismantle networks that pose a direct danger to us and make it less likely for new groups to gain a foothold, all the while maintaining the freedoms and ideals that we defend. And to define that strategy, we have to make decisions based not on fear, but on hard-earned wisdom. And that begins with understanding the current threat that we face. <p>Today, the core of Al Qaida in Afghanistan and Pakistan is on the path to defeat. Their remaining operatives spend more time thinking about their own safety than plotting against us. They did not direct the attacks in Benghazi or Boston. They've not carried out a successful attack on our homeland since 9/11. <p>Instead, what we've seen is the emergence of various Al Qaida affiliates. From Yemen to Iraq, from Somalia to North Africa, the threat today is more diffuse, with Al Qaida's affiliates in the Arabian Peninsula, AQAP, the most active in plotting against our homeland. And while none of AQAP's efforts approach the scale of 9/11, they have continued to plot acts of terror, like the attempt to blow up an airplane on Christmas Day in 2009. <p>Unrest in the Arab world has also allowed extremists to gain a foothold in countries like Libya and Syria. But here too, there are differences from 9/11. In some cases, we continue to confront state-sponsored networks like Hizballah that engage in acts of terror to achieve political goals. Other of these groups are simply collections of local militias or extremists interested in seizing territory. And while we are vigilant for signs that these groups may pose a transnational threat, most are focused on operating in the countries and regions where they are based. And that means we'll face more localized threats like the&mdash;what we saw in Benghazi or the BP oil facility in Algeria in which local operatives, perhaps in loose affiliation with regional networks, launch periodic attacks against Western diplomats, companies, and other soft targets or resort to kidnaping and other criminal enterprises to fund their operations. <p>And finally, we face a real threat from radicalized individuals here in the United States. Whether it's a shooter at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, a plane flying into a building in Texas, or the extremists who killed 168 people at the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, America has confronted many forms of violent extremism in our history. Deranged or alienated individuals&mdash;often U.S. citizens or legal residents&mdash;can do enormous damage, particularly when inspired by larger notions of violent jihad. And that pull towards extremism appears to have led to the shooting at Fort Hood and the bombing of the Boston Marathon. <p>So that's the current threat: lethal yet less capable Al Qaida affiliates, threats to diplomatic facilities and businesses abroad, homegrown extremists. This is the future of terrorism. We have to take these threats seriously and do all that we can to confront them. But as we shape our response, we have to recognize that the scale of this threat closely resembles the types of attacks we faced before 9/11. <p>In the 1980s, we lost Americans to terrorism at our Embassy in Beirut, at our Marine Barracks in Lebanon, on a cruise ship at sea, at a disco in Berlin, and on a Pan Am flight&mdash;Flight 103&mdash;over Lockerbie. In the 1990s, we lost Americans to terrorism at the World Trade Center, at our military facilities in Saudi Arabia, and at our Embassy in Kenya. These attacks were all brutal, they were all deadly, and we learned that left unchecked, these threats can grow. But if dealt with smartly and proportionally, these threats need not rise to the level that we saw on the eve of 9/11. <p>Moreover, we have to recognize that these threats don't arise in a vacuum. Most, though not all, of the terrorism we faced is fueled by a common ideology, a belief by some extremists that Islam is in conflict with the United States and the West and that violence against Western targets, including civilians, is justified in pursuit of a larger cause. Of course, this ideology is based on a lie, for the United States is not at war with Islam. And this ideology is rejected by the vast majority of Muslims, who are the most frequent victims of terrorist attacks. <p>Nevertheless, this ideology persists, and in an age when ideas and images can travel the globe in an instant, our response to terrorism can't depend on military or law enforcement alone. We need all elements of national power to win a battle of wills, a battle of ideas. So what I want to discuss here today is the components of such a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy. <p>First, we must finish the work of defeating Al Qaida and its associated forces. <p>In Afghanistan, we will complete our transition to Afghan responsibility for that country's security. Our troops will come home. Our combat mission will come to an end. And we will work with the Afghan Government to train security forces and sustain a counterterrorism force, which ensures that Al Qaida can never again establish a safe haven to launch attacks against us or our allies. <p>Now, beyond Afghanistan, we must define our effort not as a boundless global war on terror, but rather, as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America. In many cases, this will involve partnerships with other countries. Already, thousands of Pakistani soldiers have lost their lives fighting extremists. In Yemen, we are supporting security forces that have reclaimed territory from AQAP. In Somalia, we helped a coalition of African nations push Al Shabaab out of its strongholds. In Mali, we're providing military aid to French-led intervention to push back Al Qaida in the Maghreb and help the people of Mali reclaim their future. <p>Much of our best counterterrorism cooperation results in the gathering and sharing of intelligence, the arrest and prosecution of terrorists. That's how a Somali terrorist apprehended off the coast of Yemen is now in a prison in New York. That's how we worked with European allies to disrupt plots from Denmark to Germany to the United Kingdom. That's how intelligence collected with Saudi Arabia helped us stop a cargo plane from being blown up over the Atlantic. These partnerships work. <p>But despite our strong preference for the detention and prosecution of terrorists, sometimes, this approach is foreclosed. Al Qaida and its affiliates try to gain footholds in some of the most distant and unforgiving places on Earth. They take refuge in remote tribal regions. They hide in caves and walled compounds. They train in empty deserts and rugged mountains. <p>In some of these places, such as parts of Somalia and Yemen, the state only has the most tenuous reach into the territory. In other cases, the state lacks the capacity or will to take action. And it's also not possible for America to simply deploy a team of special forces to capture every terrorist. Even when such an approach may be possible, there are places where it would pose profound risks to our troops and local civilians, where a terrorist compound cannot be breached without triggering a firefight with surrounding tribal communities, for example, that pose no threat to us; times when putting U.S. boots on the ground may trigger a major international crisis. <p>To put it another way, our operation in Pakistan against Usama bin Laden cannot be the norm. The risks in that case were immense. The likelihood of capture, although that was our preference, was remote given the certainty that our folks would confront resistance. The fact that we did not find ourselves confronted with civilian casualties or embroiled in an extended firefight was a testament to the meticulous planning and professionalism of our special forces, but it also depended on some luck. And it was supported by massive infrastructure in Afghanistan. <p>And even then, the cost to our relationship with Pakistan and the backlash among the Pakistani public over encroachment on their territory was so severe that we are just now beginning to rebuild this important partnership. <p>So it is in this context that the United States has taken lethal, targeted action against Al Qaida and its associated forces, including with remotely piloted aircraft, commonly referred to as drones. <p>As was true in previous armed conflicts, this new technology raises profound questions: about who is targeted and why, about civilian casualties and the risk of creating new enemies, about the legality of such strikes under U.S. and international law, about accountability and morality. So let me address these questions. <p>To begin with, our actions are effective. Don't take my word for it. In the intelligence gathered at bin Laden's compound, we found that he wrote: \\"We could lose the reserves to enemy's air strikes. We cannot fight air strikes with explosives.\\" Other communications from Al Qaida operatives confirm this as well. Dozens of highly skilled Al Qaida commanders, trainers, bomb makers, and operatives have been taken off the battlefield. Plots have been disrupted that would have targeted international aviation, U.S. transit systems, European cities, and our troops in Afghanistan. Simply put: These strikes have saved lives. <p>Moreover, America's actions are legal. We were attacked on 9/11. Within a week, Congress overwhelmingly authorized the use of force. Under domestic law and international law, the United States is at war with Al Qaida, the Taliban, and their associated forces. We are at war with an organization that right now would kill as many Americans as they could if we did not stop them first. So this is a just war, a war waged proportionally, in last resort, and in self-defense. <p>And yet, as our fight enters a new phase, America's legitimate claim of self-defense cannot be the end of the discussion. To say a military tactic is legal, or even effective, is not to say it is wise or moral in every instance. For the same progress that gives us the technology to strike half a world away also demands the discipline to constrain that power or risk abusing it. And that's why, over the last 4 years, my administration has worked vigorously to establish a framework that governs our use of force against terrorists&mdash;insisting upon clear guidelines, oversight, and accountability&mdash;that is now codified in a Presidential policy guidance that I signed yesterday. <p>In the Afghan war theater, we must and will continue to support our troops until the transition is complete at the end of 2014. And that means we will continue to take strikes against high-value Al Qaida targets, but also against forces that are massing to support attacks on coalition forces. But by the end of 2014, we will no longer have the same need for force protection, and the progress we've made against core Al Qaida will reduce the need for unmanned strikes. <p>Beyond the Afghan theater, we only target Al Qaida and its associated forces. And even then, the use of drones is heavily constrained. America does not take strikes when we have the ability to capture individual terrorists. Our preference is always to detain, interrogate, and prosecute. America cannot take strikes wherever we choose; our actions are bound by consultations with partners and respect for state sovereignty. <p>America does not take strikes to punish individuals; we act against terrorists who pose a continuing and imminent threat to the American people and when there are no other governments capable of effectively addressing the threat. And before any strike is taken, there must be near certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured, the highest standard we can set. <p>Now, this last point is critical, because much of the criticism about drone strikes, both here at home and abroad, understandably centers on reports of civilian casualties. There's a wide gap between U.S. assessments of such casualties and nongovernmental reports. Nevertheless, it is a hard fact that U.S. strikes have resulted in civilian casualties, a risk that exists in every war. And for the families of those civilians, no words or legal construct can justify their loss. For me and those in my chain of command, those deaths will haunt us as long as we live, just as we are haunted by the civilian casualties that have occurred throughout conventional fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq. <p>But as Commander in Chief, I must weigh these heartbreaking tragedies against the alternatives. To do nothing in the face of terrorist networks would invite far more civilian casualties, not just in our cities at home and our facilities abroad, but also in the very places like Sana'a and Kabul and Mogadishu where terrorists seek a foothold. Remember that the terrorists we are after target civilians and the death toll from their acts of terrorism against Muslims dwarfs any estimate of civilian casualties from drone strikes. So doing nothing is not an option. <p>Where foreign governments cannot or will not effectively stop terrorism in their territory, the primary alternative to targeted lethal action would be the use of conventional military options. As I've already said, even small special operations carry enormous risks. Conventional airpower or missiles are far less precise than drones and are likely to cause more civilian casualties and more local outrage. And invasions of these territories lead us to be viewed as occupying armies, unleash a torrent of unintended consequences, are difficult to contain, result in large numbers of civilian casualties, and ultimately, empower those who thrive on violent conflict. <p>So it is false to assert that putting boots on the ground is less likely to result in civilian deaths or less likely to create enemies in the Muslim world. The results would be more U.S. deaths, more Black Hawks down, more confrontations with local populations, and an inevitable mission creep in support of such raids that could easily escalate into new wars. <p>Yes, the conflict with Al Qaida, like all armed conflict, invites tragedy. But by narrowly targeting our action against those who want to kill us and not the people they hide among, we are choosing the course of action least likely to result in the loss of innocent life. <p>Our efforts must be measured against the history of putting American troops in distant lands among hostile populations. In Vietnam, hundreds of thousands of civilians died in a war where the boundaries of battle were blurred. In Iraq and Afghanistan, despite the extraordinary courage and discipline of our troops, thousands of civilians have been killed. So neither conventional military action nor waiting for attacks to occur offers moral safe harbor, and neither does a sole reliance on law enforcement in territories that have no functioning police or security services and, indeed, have no functioning law. <p>Now, this is not to say that the risks are not real. Any U.S. military action in foreign lands risks creating more enemies and impacts public opinion overseas. Moreover, our laws constrain the power of the President, even during wartime, and I have taken an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States. The very precision of drone strikes and the necessary secrecy often involved in such actions can end up shielding our Government from the public scrutiny that a troop deployment invites. It can also lead a President and his team to view drone strikes as a cure-all for terrorism. <p>Now, for this reason, I've insisted on strong oversight of all lethal action. After I took office, my administration began briefing all strikes outside of Iraq and Afghanistan to the appropriate committees of Congress. Let me repeat that: Not only did Congress authorize the use of force, it is briefed on every strike that America takes&mdash;every strike. That includes the one instance where we target&mdash;targeted an American citizen: Anwar Awlaki, the chief of external operations for AQAP. <p>Now, this week, I authorized the declassification of this action and the deaths of three other Americans in drone strikes to facilitate transparency and debate on this issue and to dismiss some of the more outlandish claims that have been made. For the record, I do not believe it would be constitutional for the Government to target and kill any U.S. citizen with a drone or with a shotgun, without due process; nor should any President deploy armed drones over U.S. soil. <p>But when a U.S. citizen goes abroad to wage war against America and is actively plotting to kill U.S. citizens and when neither the United States, nor our partners are in a position to capture him before he carries out a plot, his citizenship should no more serve as a shield than a sniper shooting down on an innocent crowd should be protected from a SWAT team. <p>That's who Anwar Awlaki was; he was continuously trying to kill people. He helped oversee the 2010 plot to detonate explosive devices on two U.S.-bound cargo planes. He was involved in planning to blow up an airliner in 2009. When Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Christmas Day bomber, went to Yemen in 2009, Awlaki hosted him, approved his suicide operation, helped him tape a martyrdom video to be shown after the attack, and his last instructions were to blow up the airplane when it was over American soil. I would have detained and prosecuted Awlaki if we captured him before he carried out a plot, but we couldn't. And as President, I would have been derelict in my duty had I not authorized the strike that took him out. <p>Of course, the targeting of any American raises constitutional issues that are not present in other strikes, which is why my administration submitted information about Awlaki to the Department of Justice months before Awlaki was killed and briefed the Congress before this strike as well. But the high threshold that we've set for taking lethal action applies to all potential terrorist targets, regardless of whether or not they are American citizens. This threshold respects the inherent dignity of every human life. Alongside the decision to put our men and women in uniform in harm's way, the decision to use force against individuals or groups, even against a sworn enemy of the United States, is the hardest thing I do as President. But these decisions must be made, given my responsibility to protect the American people. <p>Now, going forward, I've asked my administration to review proposals to extend oversight of lethal actions outside of war zones that go beyond our reporting to Congress. Each option has virtues in theory, but poses difficulties in practice. For example, the establishment of a special court to evaluate and authorize the lethal action has the benefit of bringing a third branch of Government into the process, but raises serious constitutional issues about Presidential and judicial authority. Another idea that's been suggested, the establishment of an independent oversight board in the executive branch, avoids those problems, but may introduce a layer of bureaucracy into national security decisionmaking, without inspiring additional public confidence in the process. But despite these challenges, I look forward to actively engaging Congress to explore these and other options for increased oversight. <p>I believe, however, that the use of force must be seen as part of a larger discussion we need to have about a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy, because for all the focus on the use of force, force alone cannot make us safe. We cannot use force everywhere that a radical ideology takes root. And in the absence of a strategy that reduces the wellspring of extremism, a perpetual war&mdash;through drones or special forces or troop deployments&mdash;will prove self-defeating, and alter our country in troubling ways. <p>So the next element of our strategy involves addressing the underlying grievances and conflicts that feed extremism, from North Africa to South Asia. As we've learned this past decade, this is a vast and complex undertaking. We must be humble in our expectation that we can quickly resolve deep-rooted problems like poverty and sectarian hatred. Moreover, no two countries are alike, and some will undergo chaotic change before things get better. But our security and our values demand that we make the effort. <p>This means patiently supporting transitions to democracy in places like Egypt and Tunisia and Libya, because the peaceful realization of individual aspirations will serve as a rebuke to violent extremism. We must strengthen the opposition in Syria, while isolating extremist elements, because the end of a tyrant must not give way to the tyranny of terrorism. We are actively working to promote peace between Israelis and Palestinians because it is right and because such a peace could help reshape attitudes in the region. And we must help countries modernize economies, upgrade education, and encourage entrepreneurship, because American leadership has always been elevated by our ability to connect with people's hopes and not simply their fears. <p>Success on all these fronts requires sustained engagement, but it will also require resources. I know that foreign aid is one of the least popular expenditures that there is. That's true for Democrats and Republicans&mdash;I've seen the polling&mdash;even though it amounts to less than 1 percent of the Federal budget. In fact, a lot of folks think it's 25 percent, if you ask people on the streets. Less than 1 percent, still wildly unpopular. But foreign assistance cannot be viewed as charity. It is fundamental to our national security. And it's fundamental to any sensible long-term strategy to battle extremism. <p>Moreover, foreign assistance is a tiny fraction of what we spend fighting wars that our assistance might ultimately prevent. For what we spent in a month in Iraq at the height of the war, we could be training security forces in Libya, maintaining peace agreements between Israel and its neighbors, feeding the hungry in Yemen, building schools in Pakistan, and creating reservoirs of good will that marginalize extremists. So that has to be part of our strategy. <p>Moreover, America cannot carry out this work if we don't have diplomats serving in some very dangerous places. Over the past decade, we have strengthened security at our Embassies, and I am implementing every recommendation of the Accountability Review Board, which found unacceptable failures in Benghazi. I've called on Congress to fully fund these efforts to bolster security and harden facilities, improve intelligence, and facilitate a quicker response time from our military if a crisis emerges. <p>But even after we take these steps, some irreducible risks to our diplomats will remain. This is the price of being the world's most powerful nation, particularly as a wave of change washes over the Arab world. And in balancing the tradeoffs between security and active diplomacy, I firmly believe that any retreat from challenging regions will only increase the dangers that we face in the long run. And that's why we should be grateful to those diplomats who are willing to serve there. <p>Targeted action against terrorists, effective partnerships, diplomatic engagement and assistance&mdash;through such a comprehensive strategy, we can significantly reduce the chances of large-scale attacks on the homeland and mitigate threats to Americans overseas. But as we guard against dangers from abroad, we cannot neglect the daunting challenge of terrorism from within our borders. <p>As I said earlier, this threat is not new. But technology and the Internet increase its frequency and, in some cases, its lethality. Today, a person can consume hateful propaganda, commit themselves to a violent agenda, and learn how to kill without leaving their home. To address this threat, 2 years ago, my administration did a comprehensive review and engaged with law enforcement. <p>And the best way to prevent violent extremism inspired by violent jihadists is to work with the Muslim American community, which has consistently rejected terrorism, to identify signs of radicalization and partner with law enforcement when an individual is drifting towards violence. And these partnerships can only work when we recognize that Muslims are a fundamental part of the American family. In fact, the success of American Muslims and our determination to guard against any encroachments on their civil liberties is the ultimate rebuke to those who say that we're at war with Islam. <p>Now, thwarting homegrown plots presents particular challenges in part because of our proud commitment to civil liberties for all who call America home. That's why, in the years to come, we will have to keep working hard to strike the appropriate balance between our need for security and preserving those freedoms that make us who we are. That means reviewing the authorities of law enforcement so we can intercept new types of communication, but also build in privacy protections to prevent abuse. <p>That means that&mdash;even after Boston&mdash;we do not deport someone or throw somebody in prison in the absence of evidence. That means putting careful constraints on the tools the Government uses to protect sensitive information, such as the state secrets doctrine. And that means finally having a strong Privacy and Civil Liberties Board to review those issues where our counterterrorism efforts and our values may come into tension. <p>The Justice Department's investigation of national security leaks offers a recent example of the challenges involved in striking the right balance between our security and our open society. As Commander in Chief, I believe we must keep information secret that protects our operations and our people in the field. To do so, we must enforce consequences for those who break the law and breach their commitment to protect classified information. But a free press is also essential for our democracy. That's who we are. And I'm troubled by the possibility that leak investigations may chill the investigative journalism that holds government accountable. <p>Journalists should not be at legal risk for doing their jobs. Our focus must be on those who break the law. And that's why I've called on Congress to pass a media shield law to guard against Government overreach. And I've raised these issues with the Attorney General, who shares my concerns. So he has agreed to review existing Department of Justice guidelines governing investigations that involve reporters, and he'll convene a group of media organizations to hear their concerns as part of that review. And I've directed the Attorney General to report back to me by July 12. <p>Now, all these issues remind us that the choices we make about war can impact&mdash;in sometimes unintended ways&mdash;the openness and freedom on which our way of life depends. And that is why I intend to engage Congress about the existing authorization to use military force, or AUMF, to determine how we can continue to fight terrorism without keeping America on a perpetual wartime footing. <p>The AUMF is now nearly 12 years old. The Afghan war is coming to an end. Core Al Qaida is a shell of its former self. Groups like AQAP must be dealt with, but in the years to come, not every collection of thugs that labels themselves Al Qaida will pose a credible threat to the United States. Unless we discipline our thinking, our definitions, our actions, we may be drawn into more wars we don't need to fight or continue to grant Presidents unbound powers more suited for traditional armed conflicts between nation states. <p>So I look forward to engaging Congress and the American people in efforts to refine, and ultimately repeal, the AUMF's mandate. And I will not sign laws designed to expand this mandate further. Our systematic effort to dismantle terrorist organizations must continue. But this war, like all wars, must end. That's what history advises. That's what our democracy demands. <p>And that brings me to my final topic: the detention of terror suspects. I'm going to repeat one more time: As a matter of policy, the preference of the United States is to capture terrorist suspects. When we do detain a suspect, we interrogate them. And if the suspect can be prosecuted, we decide whether to try him in a civilian court or a military commission. <p>During the past decade, the vast majority of those detained by our military were captured on the battlefield. In Iraq, we turned over thousands of prisoners as we ended the war. In Afghanistan, we have transitioned detention facilities to the Afghans, as part of the process of restoring Afghan sovereignty. So we bring law-of-war detention to an end, and we are committed to prosecuting terrorists wherever we can. <p>The glaring exception to this time-tested approach is the detention center at Guantanamo Bay. The original premise for opening GTMO&mdash;that detainees would not be able to challenge their detention&mdash;was found unconstitutional 5 years ago. In the meantime, GTMO has become a symbol around the world for an America that flouts the rule of law. Our allies won't cooperate with us if they think a terrorist will end up at GTMO. <p>During a time of budget cuts, we spend $150 million each year to imprison 166 people, almost a million dollars per prisoner. And the Department of Defense estimates that we must spend another 200 million to keep GTMO open at a time when we're cutting investments in education and research here at home and when the Pentagon is struggling with sequester and budget cuts. <p>Now, as President, I have tried to close GTMO. I transferred 67 detainees to other countries, before Congress imposed restrictions to effectively prevent us from either transferring detainees to other countries or imprisoning them here in the United States. <p>These restrictions make no sense. After all, under President Bush, some 530 detainees were transferred from GTMO with Congress's support. When I ran for President the first time, John McCain supported closing GTMO; this was a bipartisan issue. No person has ever escaped one of our supermax or military prisons here in the United States&mdash;ever. Our courts have convicted hundreds of people for terrorism or terrorism-related offenses, including some folks who are more dangerous than most GTMO detainees. They're in our prisons. <p>And given my administration's relentless pursuit of Al Qaida's leadership, there is no justification, beyond politics, for Congress to prevent us from closing a facility that should have never have been opened. <p><i>CODEPINK Cofounder Medea Benjamin.</i> Excuse me, President Obama, you are the Commander in Chief. You have the authority&mdash;&mdash;<i> </i><p><i>The President.</i> Today&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. So let me finish, ma'am. So today, once again&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Ms. Benjamin.</i> There's 102 people on a hunger strike. These are desperate people. <p><i>The President.</i> I'm about to address it, ma'am, but you've got to let me speak. I'm about to address it. <p><i>Ms. Benjamin.</i> You are Commander in Chief&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The President.</i> Let me address it. <p><i>Ms. Benjamin. </i>You can close Guantanamo Bay. <p><i>The President.</i> Why don't you let me address it, ma'am. <p><i>Ms. Benjamin. </i>[<i>Inaudible</i>]&mdash;release those 86 prisoners&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The President.</i> Why don't you sit down, and I will tell you exactly what I'm going to do. <p><i>Ms. Benjamin. </i>[<i>Inaudible</i>]&mdash;that includes 57 Yemenis. <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you, ma'am. Thank you. Thank you. Ma'am, thank you. You should let me finish my sentence. <p>Today I once again call on Congress to lift the restrictions on detainee transfers from GTMO. <p>I have asked the Department of Defense to designate a site in the United States where we can hold military commissions. I'm appointing a new Senior Envoy at the State Department and Defense Department whose sole responsibility will be to achieve the transfer of detainees to third countries. <p>I am lifting the moratorium on detainee transfers to Yemen so we can review them on a case-by-case basis. To the greatest extent possible, we will transfer detainees who have been cleared to go to other countries. <p><i>Ms. Benjamin. </i>Eighty-seven are cleared already. Release them today. <p><i>The President.</i> Where appropriate, we will bring terrorists to justice in our courts and our military justice system. And we will insist that judicial review be available for every detainee. <p><i>Ms. Benjamin. </i>It needs to be&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The President.</i> Now, ma'am, let me finish. Let me finish, ma'am. This is&mdash;part of free speech is you being able to speak, but also, you listening and me being able to speak. All right? [<i>Applause</i>] Thank you. <p>Now, even after we take these steps one issue will remain, which is how to deal with those GTMO detainees who we know have participated in dangerous plots or attacks, but who cannot be prosecuted, for example, because the evidence against them has been compromised or is inadmissible in a court of law. But once we commit to a process of closing GTMO, I am confident that this legacy problem can be resolved, consistent with our commitment to the rule of law. <p>And I know the politics are hard. But history will cast a harsh judgment on this aspect of our fight against terrorism and those of us who fail to end it. Imagine a future, 10 years from now or 20 years from now, when the United States of America is still holding people who have been charged with no crime on a piece of land that is not part of our country. Look at the current situation, where we are force-feeding detainees who are hold&mdash;being held on a hunger strike. I'm willing to cut the young lady who interrupted me some slack because it's worth being passionate about. Is this who we are? Is that something our Founders foresaw? Is that the America we want to leave our children? Our sense of justice is stronger than that. <p>We have prosecuted scores of terrorists in our courts. That includes Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who tried to blow up an airplane over Detroit, and Faisal Shahzad, who put a car bomb in Times Square. It's in a court of law that we will try Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is accused of bombing the Boston Marathon. Richard Reid, the shoe bomber, is, as we speak, serving a life sentence in a maximum security prison here in the United States. In sentencing Reid, Judge William Young told him, \\"The way we treat you is the measure of our own liberty.\\" When we&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Ms. Benjamin. </i>How about Abdulrahman al-Awlaki.16-year-old boy, killed by a drone? <p><i>The President</i>. We went&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Ms. Benjamin</i>. Is that the way we treat a 16-year old American? <p><i>The President</i>. He went on&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Ms. Benjamin</i>. Why was he killed? Can you tell us why Abdulrahman al-Awlaki should be killed? Can you tell the Muslim people their lives are as precious as our lives? Can you take the drones out of the hands of the CIA? Can you stop the signature strikes that are killing people on the basis of suspicious activities? <p><i>The President.</i> We're addressing that, ma'am. <p><i>Ms. Benjamin. </i>Can you apologize to the thousands of Muslims that you have killed? Will you compensate the innocent family victim? That would make us safer here at home. I love my country. I love the rule of law. But drones are making us less safe. And keeping people in indefinite detention at Guantanamo is making us less safe. Abide by the rule of law. You're a constitutional lawyer. <p>[<i>At this point, Ms. Benjamin was escorted out of the auditorium</i>.] <p><i>The President.</i> I think that the&mdash;and I'm going off script, as you might expect here. [<i>Laughter</i>] The voice of that woman is worth paying attention to. Obviously, I do not agree with much of what she said, and obviously, she wasn't listening to me in much of what I said. But these are tough issues, and the suggestion that we can gloss over them is wrong. <p>When that judge sentenced Mr. Reid, the shoe bomber, he went on to point to the American flag that flew in the courtroom. \\"That flag,\\" he said, \\"will fly there long after this is all forgotten. That flag still stands for freedom.\\" <p>So, America, we've faced down dangers far greater than Al Qaida. By staying true to the values of our founding and by using our constitutional compass, we have overcome slavery and Civil War and fascism and communism. In just these last few years as President, I've watched the American people bounce back from painful recession, mass shootings, natural disasters like the recent tornados that devastated Oklahoma. These events were heartbreaking; they shook our communities to the core. But because of the resilience of the American people, these events could not come close to breaking us. <p>I think of Lauren Manning, the 9/11 survivor who had severe burns over 80 percent of her body, who said: \\"That's my reality. I put a Band-Aid on it, literally, and I move on.\\" I think of the New Yorkers who filled Times Square the day after an attempted car bomb as if nothing had happened. I think of the proud Pakistani parents who, after their daughter was invited to the White House, wrote to us, \\"We have raised an American Muslim daughter to dream big and never give up because it does pay off.\\" <p>I think of all the wounded warriors rebuilding their lives and helping other vets to find jobs. I think of the runner planning to do the 2014 Boston Marathon, who said: \\"Next year, you're going to have more people than ever. Determination is not something to be messed with.\\" That's who the American people are: Determined and not to be messed with. And now we need a strategy and a politics that reflects this resilient spirit. <p>Our victory against terrorism won't be measured in a surrender ceremony at a battleship or a statue being pulled to the ground. Victory will be measured in parents taking their kids to school, immigrants coming to our shores, fans taking in a ballgame, a veteran starting a business, a bustling city street, a citizen shouting her concerns at a President. <p>The quiet determination, that strength of character and bond of fellowship, that refutation of fear&mdash;that is both our sword and our shield. And long after the current messengers of hate have faded from the world's memory&mdash;alongside the brutal despots and deranged madmen and ruthless demagogues who litter history&mdash;the flag of the United States will still wave from small-town cemeteries to national monuments to distant outposts abroad. And that flag will still stand for freedom. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. May God bless the United States of America.\" "
"116" "\"Hello, Midshipmen! Well, thank you, Governor O'Malley, for your kind introduction and the great support that Maryland gives this Academy. To Secretary Mabus, Admiral Greenert, and General Paxton: thank you all for your incredible leadership of our extraordinary Navy and Marine Corps teams. <p>To Vice Admiral Miller, thank you for the outstanding work that you do. To Captain Clark and all the faculty and staff; to the moms and dads who raised your sons and daughters to seek this life of service; to the local sponsor families who cared for them far from home; the members of the class of 1963&mdash;veterans who've guided these midshipmen along the way&mdash;today is also a tribute to your support and your patriotism. And I know that the class of 2013 joins me in saluting your service as well. <p>To the entire brigade of midshipmen: You embody the highest virtues of this venerable institution. And yet I know that some of you at times have enjoyed yourselves at other local institutions like McGarvey's and Armadillo's. But today is a day of celebration and also forgiveness. And so, in keeping with tradition, I declare all midshipmen on restriction for minor conduct offenses are hereby absolved. As always, Admiral Miller gets to decide what's \\"minor.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Some of these guys are laughing a little nervously about that. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, obviously, most of all, it is wonderful to be able to celebrate this incredible class of 2013. This has special meaning for me as well, because the United States Naval Academy was the very first service academy that I had the privilege to address as President. On that spring day 4 years ago, most of you were still in high school, finishing your senior year, or at NAPS, finishing up prep school. You were a little younger, and I was too. You had your entire Naval Academy experience ahead of you; I was already getting chest bumps from the graduates of 2009. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Soon after, you came to the Yard, and you got quite a welcome: the joy of I-Day, wonderful haircuts, stylish eyeglasses. And all that Plebe Year, if you got something wrong, your upperclassmen kindly corrected you, at high volume, at very close range. [<i>Laughter</i>] When Michelle brought our daughter Sasha here for a visit, she got a somewhat different reception. She was just in elementary school, but it seemed like the Navy was already doing some recruiting, because as she went through Bancroft Hall, she came to one room and saw the name on the door: \\"Sasha Obama, Class of 2023.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] So you never know. <p>Today each of you can take enormous pride, for you've met the mission of this Academy. You've proven yourselves morally, living a concept of honor and integrity, and this includes treating one another with respect and recognizing the strength of every member of your team. You're the most diverse class to graduate in Naval Academy history. And among the many proud young women graduating today, 13 will serve on submarines. <p>You've proven yourselves mentally. Now, I know that some think of this as just a small engineering school on the Severn. You've not only met its rigorous standards, you've helped this Academy earn a new distinction: the number-one public liberal arts school in America. <p>And you've proven yourselves physically: a Herndon climb of 2 minutes, 5 seconds. Now that they put the grease back on, no one will ever match your time. [<i>Laughter</i>] More importantly, last month, I welcomed Coach Ken and the team back to the White House because you beat Air Force, you beat Army, and you brought the Commander in Chief's Trophy back to Annapolis. <p>So, class of 2013, in your 4 years by the Bay, you've met every test before you. And today is the day that you've been counting down to for so long. You will take your oath. Those boards and gold bars will be placed on your shoulders. And as your Commander in Chief, I congratulate each of you on becoming our newest officers: ensigns in the United States Navy, second lieutenants in the United States Marine Corps. <p>And soon you will join the fleet. You will lead marines. And just as you've changed over the past 4 years, so too have the challenges facing our military. Before you arrived here, our Nation was engaged in two wars, Al Qaida's leadership was entrenched in their safe havens, many of our alliances were strained, and our Nation's standing in the world had suffered. And over the past 4 years, we've strengthened our alliances and restored America's image in the world. <p>The war in Iraq is over, and we welcomed our troops home. Thanks to our brave personnel&mdash;including our incredible Navy SEALs&mdash;we delivered justice to Usama bin Laden. In Afghanistan, the transition is underway, our troops are coming home, and by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistan will come to an end. <p>And today we salute all the Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice in these wars, including 18 graduates of this Academy. We honor them all, now and forever. <p>Yesterday I spoke about the way forward in the fight to keep our country secure, for even as we've decimated the Al Qaida leadership, we still face threats from Al Qaida affiliates and from individuals caught up in its ideology. Even as we move beyond deploying large ground armies abroad, we still need to conduct precise, targeted strikes against terrorists before they kill our citizens. And even as we stay vigilant in the face of terrorism and stay true to our Constitution and our values, we need to stay ready for the full range of threats, from nations seeking weapons of mass destruction to cyber criminals seeking to unleash weapons of mass destruction. <p>Now, in these tough fiscal times, we also have to make hard choices at home, including in our Armed Forces. But I want you all to know, as you enter in what I know will be extraordinary years of service, let me say as clearly as I can: The United States of America will always maintain our military superiority. And as your Commander in Chief, I'm going to keep fighting to give you the equipment and support required to meet the missions we ask of you, and also to make sure that you are getting the pay and the benefits and the support that you deserve. <p>I'll keep fighting for the capabilities and technologies you need to prevail and a shipbuilding plan that puts us on track to achieve a 300-ship fleet, with capabilities that exceed the power of the next dozen navies combined. <p>And I'll keep fighting to end those foolish across-the-board budget cuts known as the sequester, which is threatening our readiness. With deficits falling at the fastest rate in decades, it's time for Congress to budget in a smarter way that protects middle class priorities, preserves investments in our future, and keeps our military strong. Because we have the best trained, best led, best equipped military in history, and I am determined to keep it that way, and Congress should be too. <p>We need you to project power across the oceans, from the Pacific to the Persian Gulf, 100 percent on watch. We need you to partner with other navies and militaries, from Africa to the Americas. We need you to respond with compassion in times of disaster, as when you helped respond to Hurricane Sandy. And in all your work&mdash;in your lifetime of service&mdash;we need you to uphold the highest standards of integrity and character. <p>With the time I have left&mdash;and I know it's a little wet, but the Superintendent told me that marines and folks in the Navy don't mind a little water. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>With the time I have left, that's what I want to discuss today. It's no secret that in recent decades, many Americans have lost confidence in many of the institutions that help shape our society and our democracy. But I suggest to you today that institutions do not fail in a vacuum. Institutions are made up of people, individuals. And we've seen how the actions of a few can undermine the integrity of those institutions. <p>Every day, men and women of talent and skill work in the financial institutions that fund new businesses and put new families&mdash;put families in new homes and help students go to college. But we've also seen how the misdeeds of some&mdash;wild risk-taking or putting profits before people&mdash;sparked a financial crisis and deepened the recession that cost millions of Americans their jobs. <p>Every day, elected officials like those on this stage, but also all across the Nation, devote themselves to improving our communities and our country. But all too often, we've seen a politics where compromise is rejected as a dirty word and policies are driven by special interests rather than the national interest. And that breeds a cynicism that threatens our democracy. <p>Every day, our civil servants do their jobs with professionalism, protecting our national security and delivering the services that so many Americans expect. But, as we've seen again in recent days, it only takes the misconduct of a few to further erode the people's trust in their government. And that's unacceptable to me, and I know it's unacceptable to you. <p>And against this backdrop, what I said here 4 years ago remains true today: Our military remains the most trusted institution in America. When others have shirked their responsibilities, our Armed Forces have met every mission we've given them. When others have been distracted by petty arguments, our men and women in uniform come together as one American team. <p>And yet we must acknowledge that even here, even in our military, we've seen how the misconduct of some can have effects that ripple far and wide. In our digital age, a single image from the battlefield of troops falling short of their standards can go viral and endanger our forces and undermine our efforts to achieve security and peace. Likewise, those who commit sexual assault are not only committing a crime, they threaten the trust and discipline that make our military strong. That's why we have to be determined to stop these crimes, because they've got no place in the greatest military on Earth. <p>So, class of 2013, I say all this because you're about to assume the burden of leadership. As officers, you will be trusted with the most awesome of responsibilities: the lives of the men and women under your command. And when your service is complete, many of you will go on to help lead your communities, America's companies. You will lead this country. And if we want to restore the trust that the American people deserve to have in their institutions, all of us have to do our part. And those of us in leadership&mdash;myself included&mdash;have to constantly strive to remain worthy of the public trust. <p>As you go forward in your careers, we need you to carry forth the values that you've learned at this institution, because our Nation needs them now more than ever. <p>We need your honor, that inner compass that guides you, not when the path is easy and obvious, but when it's hard and uncertain; that tells you the difference between that which is right and that which is wrong. Perhaps it will be a moment when you think nobody is watching. But never forget that honor, like character, is what you do when nobody is looking. More likely, it will be when you're in the spotlight, leading others, the men and women who are looking up to you to set an example. Never ask them to do what you don't ask of yourself. Live with integrity and speak with honesty and take responsibility and demand accountability. <p>We need your honor, and we need your courage. Yes, the daring that tells you to move toward danger when every fiber of your being says to turn the other way, but even more than physical courage, we need your moral courage: the strength to do what's right, especially when it's unpopular. Because at the end of the day and at the end of your career, you want to look in the mirror and say with confidence and with pride, I fulfilled my oath. I did my duty. I stayed true to my values. <p>We need your honor and courage, and we need your commitment: that sense of purpose that says I will try even harder, I will do even better in what I expect of myself, in the way I interact with others, including those of different backgrounds. It's no accident that our military is the most respected institution in America and one of the most diverse institutions in America. So recognize the dignity in every human being. Treat one another with respect. Remember that when we harness the talents of every man and every woman from every race and every religion and every creed, no nation can ever match us. <p>And finally, we need your resolve, the same spirit reflected in your class motto: \\"Surrender to Nothing.\\" And if you seek an example, you don't need to look far, because not long ago, two midshipmen sat where you sat&mdash;from the class of 2006&mdash;and they inspire us today. <p>Here at the Academy, Brad Snyder was the captain of the swim team. He deployed to Afghanistan, and while rushing to the aid of his teammates, he stepped on an IED and lost both his eyes. With the support of family and friends, Brad learned to feel his way and move again. And before long, he was back in the swimming pool, where he said, \\"I'm free.\\" Then, just 1 year later, Brad competed at the London Paralympics and won three medals, including two golds. <p>And when Michelle and I welcomed our U.S. Olympians to the White House, Brad joined us standing tall, right in front. And he said: \\"Overcoming adversity is a decision. You can let that beat you, or you can make the decision to move forward.\\" <p>Here at the Academy, Matt Lampert was on the rowing team. He deployed to Afghanistan with his Marine special ops team. And as they entered a compound, an IED exploded, and Matt lost both his legs. He endured a long and painful recovery. But with his new legs, he learned to walk again. He practiced, he trained, and then he passed his physical tests and deployed to Afghanistan again, a double amputee, back in the fight. <p>And Matt recently completed his tour. He is back home and is looking ahead to many years of service. Reflecting on his journey&mdash;his mission to return to his unit&mdash;he said he was determined, \\"however long it was going to take.\\" <p>So, class of 2013, I cannot promise you a life of comfort and ease, for you have chosen an ancient path&mdash;the profession of arms&mdash;which carries all the perils of our modern world. And just as classes before you could not know that they would find themselves at Coral Sea or Midway or Fallujah or Helmand, we cannot know sitting here today where your service will carry you. <p>But I do know this. As you say farewell to Bancroft Hall, as you make your way down Stribling Walk one last time, you're becoming the newest link in a storied chain. As I look into your eyes today, I see the same confidence and the same professionalism, the same fidelity to our values of those who have served before you&mdash;the Jones and Nimitz and Lejeune and Burke, and yes, the Snyder and the Lampert&mdash;Americans who surrendered to nothing. <p>And I'm absolutely confident that you will uphold the highest of standards and that your courage and honor and your commitment will see us through and that you will always prove yourselves worthy of the trust our Nation is placing in you today. <p>So congratulations, class of 2013. God bless our Navy, and God bless our Marine Corps. God bless our Armed Services. God bless these United States of America.\" "
"117" "\"Hi, everybody. This week, I've been speaking about America's national security: our past, our present, and our future. <p>On Thursday, I outlined the future of our fight against terrorism: the threats we face, and the way in which we will meet them. On Friday, I went to Annapolis to celebrate the extraordinary young men and women of the United States Naval Academy's class of 2013, the sailors and marines who will not only lead that fight, but who will lead our country for decades to come. And on Monday, we celebrate Memorial DayMemorial Day. Unofficially, it's the start of summer, a chance for us to spend some extra time with family and friends, at barbecues or on the beach, getting a little fun and relaxation in before heading back to work. <p>It's also a day on which we set aside some time, on our own or with our families, to honor and remember all the men and women who have given their lives in service to this country we love. They are heroes, each and every one. They gave America the most precious thing they had: \\"the last full measure of devotion.\\" And because they did, we are who we are today: a free and prosperous nation, the greatest in the world. <p>At a time when only about 1 percent of the American people bear the burden of our defense, the service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform isn't always readily apparent. And that's partly because our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen are so skilled at what they do. It's also because those who serve tend to do so quietly. They don't seek the limelight. They don't serve for our admiration or even our gratitude. They risk their lives, and many give their lives, for something larger than themselves or any of us: the ideals of liberty and justice that make America a beacon of hope for the world. <p>That's been true throughout our history, from our earliest days, when a tiny band of revolutionaries stood up to an empire, to our 9/11 generation, which continues to serve and sacrifice today. <p>Every time a threat has risen, Americans have risen to meet it. And because of that courage&mdash;that willingness to fight and even die&mdash;America endures. That is the purpose of Memorial Memorial DayDay: to remember with gratitude the countless men and women who gave their lives so we could know peace and live in freedom. <p>And we must do more than remember. We must care for the loved ones that our fallen servicemembers have left behind. We must make sure all our veterans have the care and benefits they've earned and the jobs and opportunity they deserve. We must be there for the military families whose loved ones are in harm's way, for they serve as well. And above all, we must make sure that the men and women of our Armed Forces have the support they need to achieve their missions safely at home and abroad. <p>The young men and women I met at the Naval Academy this week know the meaning of service. They've studied the heroes of our history. They've chosen to follow in their footsteps: to stand their watch, man a ship, lead a platoon. They are doing their part. And each of us must do ours. <p>So this weekend, as we commemorate Memorial DayMemorial Day, I ask you to hold all our fallen heroes in your hearts. And every day, let's work together to preserve what their sacrifices achieved: to make our country even stronger, even more fair, even more free. That's our mission, it's our obligation, and it is our privilege, as the heirs of those who came before us and as citizens of the United States of America. <p>Thanks.\" "
"118" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. Obviously, a picture is worth a thousand words, and what we're seeing here, I think, gives you some sense of what the people of Moore and the people of Oklahoma have been dealing with over these last several days. <p>There are a couple of acknowledgements that I want to make, but let me begin by just saying that whenever I come to an area that's been devastated by some natural disaster like this, I want to make sure everybody understands I'm speaking on behalf of the entire country. Everywhere, fellow Americans are praying with you, they're thinking about you, and they want to help. <p>And so I'm just a messenger here today, letting everybody here know that you are not alone, that you've got folks behind you. <p>Obviously, the damage here is pretty hard to comprehend. Our hearts go out to the families who have been impacted, including those who have had loved ones who were lost. And that was true for the parents of some of the children here at Plaza Towers Elementary school. <p>There are a number of people I want to especially thank, because they've engaged in some heroic efforts in dealing with this disaster. First of all, Governor Mary Fallin, thank you so much for your quick response and your outstanding work. Mayor Glenn Lewis, the mayor of Moore, who has been mayor here before when there was a disaster, and because of his strong spirit and sense of community has been able to help lead the community through this disaster. We very much appreciate your work. <p>Representative Tom Cole, not only is this his congressional district, but more importantly, this is his hometown. And so for him, this carries a special sadness, but also a resolve in terms of trying to make sure that the city of Moore bounces back. Mayor Mick Cornett, Oklahoma City, a neighbor and friend, we appreciate him being here. Craig Fugate is here, and obviously we are very proud of the work that he and his FEMA team have done. Susie Pierce, superintendent of schools here, thank you for your leadership. <p>Amy Simpson, I want to especially commend, Plaza Towers Elementary school principal, as well as Shelley McMillin, the Briarwood Elementary school principal. They were on the ground when this happened, and because of their quick response, their keeping a level head, their putting kids first saved a lot of people. And they're still going through some tough times. I can only imagine being their husbands, who are here, and the panic that I'm sure they were feeling when the tornado first struck. But I know that they could not be prouder of their wives for the outstanding work that they did in this amazing situation. <p>I want to thank Chief of Police Jerry Stillings and all the first responders in this area who were some of the first folks on the scene who were putting themselves at risk to save other people's lives. That's what first responders do, but sometimes, we take them for granted, and it's important we don't and we remember moments like that. That's why it's so important that we continually support them. <p>At my direction, Craig Fugate arrived here on Tuesday. FEMA was on the ground even before Monday's tornado hit. And their teams have now completed searches of more than 1,200 buildings. We've helped to register more than 4,200 people for disaster assistance, and we've approved more than $3.4 million in direct aid. Obviously, there's a lot more to come. But it's not just a Government response. We've seen incredible outpourings of support from churches, from community groups who are helping folks begin to recover. <p>This area has known more than its share of heartbreak. But people here pride themselves on the Oklahoma standard, what Governor Fallin has called, \\"Being able to work through disasters like this, and [to] come out stronger on the other side.\\" And that's what we've been seeing this week. <p>From the forecasters who issued the warnings to the first responders who dug through the rubble, to the teachers who shielded with their own bodies their students, Oklahomans have inspired us with their love and their courage and their fellowship. <p>Neighbors have been offering up spare bedrooms and couches for those in need of shelter. Universities have opened up their buildings for temporary housing, and local companies have pitched in. <p>So this is a strong community with strong character. There's no doubt they're going to bounce back. But they need help, just like any of us would need help if we saw the kind of devastation that we're seeing here. We have about 1,200 homes that have been completely destroyed, but we've got 12,000 that have been damaged in one way or another, and that's a big piece of business. And along with the schools, we've got a hospital that has been destroyed. It's going to take a long time for this community to rebuild. <p>So I want to urge every American to step up. If I've got one message for folks here today: Go online, donate to the American Red Cross. And if you're from the area and you need to register for disaster assistance, you can call 1-800-621-FEMA. That's 1-800-621-FEMA. Or you can go to disasterassistance.gov. Disasterassistance.gov on the web. Either way, I guarantee you, if you've got some significant damage and have been impacted, go ahead and reach out, and there are going to be professionals there who are ready and willing to provide you the assistance that you need. <p>We know Moore is going to come back stronger from this tragedy. Your mayor said that you're already printing new street signs. <p><i>Mayor Glenn Lewis of Moore, Oklahoma</i>. Yes, sir. <p><i>The President</i>. And I want folks affected throughout Oklahoma to know that we're going to be with you every step of the way. <p>On Sunday, the first deadly tornadoes touched down about 40 miles from here. And I mentioned this the day afterwards&mdash;there was a story that really struck me in the press&mdash;in the rubble was found a Bible, open to the words that read: \\"A man will be as a hiding place from the wind, and a cover from the tempest.\\" And that&mdash;it's a reminder, as Scripture often is, that God has a plan, and it's important, though, that we also recognize we're an instrument of his will. And we need to know that as fellow Americans, we're going to be there as shelter from the storm for the people of Moore who have been impacted. <p>And when we say that we've got your back, I promise you, we keep our word. If you talk to folks in Alabama who have been affected over the last couple of years; you talk to the folks at Joplin, who I know have actually sent volunteers down here to Moore; if you talk to folks in New Jersey and New York, they'll tell you that when we say we're going to be there until you completely rebuild, we mean it. And I want everybody to have that confidence. <p>So again, to all the people here behind me, I want to say how proud I am of them, how grateful I am for their service. I want to make one final comment. A lot of the first responders talked about the training that they've done, in part through some Federal grants, to prepare for disasters like this. And as a consequence, when it actually happens, they know what to do, they're not losing time, they're able to go through all the drills and the training that they've gone through. <p>Training, education, both for citizenry, but also for first responders, is absolutely critical. And we've got to make sure that those resources remain in place. So I know everybody in Congress cares deeply about what's happening, and I'm confident that resources will be forthcoming when it comes to rebuilding. But remember that it's also the ongoing training and equipment, that we're making sure that those things are in place. We can't shortchange that kind of ongoing disaster response. We can't just wait until the disaster happens. That's how, in part, we were able to save a lot of lives, and I want everybody to keep that in mind. <p>So, with that, let me just again say thank you to everybody here. Madam Governor, thank you for your leadership. And may God bless the people of Oklahoma and obviously continue to bless the United States of America. <p>Thank you.\" "
"119" "\"Thank you very much. Good morning, everybody. I want to thank Secretary Chuck Hagel, not only for the introduction, but, Chuck, for your lifetime of service, from sergeant in the Army to Secretary of Defense, but always a man who carries with you the memory of friends and fallen heroes from Vietnam. We're grateful to you. <p>I want to thank General Dempsey; Major General Linnington; Kathryn Condon, who has served Arlington with extraordinary dedication and grace and who will be leaving us, but we are so grateful for the work that she's done; for Chaplain Brainerd; Secretary Shinseki; all our guests. And most of all, to members of our Armed Services and our veterans; to the families and friends of the fallen who we honor today; to Americans from all across the country who have come to pay your respects: I have to say it is always a great honor to spend this Memorial Day with you at this sacred place where we honor our fallen heroes, those who we remember fondly in our memories and those known only to God. <p>Beyond these quiet hills, across that special bridge, is a city of monuments dedicated to visionary leaders and singular moments in the life of our Republic. But it is here, on this hallowed ground, where we choose to build a monument to a constant thread in the American character: the truth that our Nation endures because it has always been home to men and women who are willing to give their all and lay down their very lives to preserve and protect this land that we love. <p>That character, that selflessness, beats in the hearts of the very first patriots who died for a democracy they had never known and would never see. It lived on in the men and women who fought to hold our Union together and in those who fought to defend it abroad, from the beaches of Europe to the mountains and jungles of Asia. This year, as we mark the 60th anniversary of the end of fighting in Korea, we offer a special salute to all those who served and gave their lives in the Korean war. And over the last decade, we've seen the character of our country again in the nearly 7,000 Americans who have made the ultimate sacrifice on battlefields and city streets half a world away. <p>Last Memorial Day, I stood here and spoke about how, for the first time in 9 years, Americans were no longer fighting and dying in Iraq. Today, a transition is underway in Afghanistan, and our troops are coming home. Fewer Americans are making the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan, and that's progress for which we are profoundly grateful. And this time next year, we will mark the final Memorial Day of our war in Afghanistan. <p>And so, as I said last week, America stands at a crossroads. But even as we turn a page on a decade of conflict, even as we look forward, let us never forget, as we gather here today, that our Nation is still at war. <p>It should be self-evident. And in generations past, it was. And during World War II, millions of Americans contributed to the war effort: soldiers like my own grandfather; women like my grandmother, who worked the assembly lines. During the Vietnam war, just about everybody knew somebody&mdash;a brother, a son, a friend&mdash;who served in harm's way. <p>Today, it's different. Perhaps it's a tribute to our remarkable All-Volunteer Force, made up of men and women who step forward to serve and do so with extraordinary skill and valor. Perhaps it's a testament to our advanced technologies, which allow smaller numbers of troops to wield greater and greater power. But regardless the reason, this truth cannot be ignored: that today, most Americans are not directly touched by war. <p>As a consequence, not all Americans may always see or fully grasp the depth of sacrifice, the profound costs that are made in our name: right now, as we speak, every day. Our troops and our military families understand this, and they mention to me their concern about whether the country fully appreciates what's happening. I think about a letter I received from a naval officer, a reservist who had just returned from a deployment to Afghanistan. And he wrote me, \\"I'm concerned that our work in Afghanistan is fading from memory.\\" And he went on to ask that we do more to keep this conflict \\"alive and focused in the hearts and minds of our own people.\\" <p>And he's right. As we gather here today, at this very moment, more than 60,000 of our fellow Americans still serve far from home in Afghanistan. They're still going out on patrol, still living in spartan forward operating bases, still risking their lives to carry out their mission. And when they give their lives, they are still being laid to rest in cemeteries in the quiet corners across our country, including here in Arlington. <p>Captain Sara Cullen had a smile that could light up a room and a love of country that led her to West Point. And after graduation, Sara became a Black Hawk pilot and married a former Black Hawk pilot. She was just 27 years old when she and four other soldiers were killed in a helicopter crash during a training mission near Kandahar. This past April, Sara was laid to rest here, in Section 60. Today Sara is remembered by her mother Lynn, who says she is \\"proud of her daughter's life, proud of her faith, and proud of her service to our country.\\" <p>Staff Sergeant Frankie Phillips came from a military family and is&mdash;was as tough as they come. A combat medic, Frankie was on patrol in Afghanistan 3 weeks ago when his vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb. He was so humble that his parents never knew how many lives he had saved until soldiers started showing up at his funeral from thousands of miles away. And last week, Frankie was laid to rest just a few rows over from Sara. <p>Staff Sergeant Eric Christian was a born leader. A member of the Marine Corps Special Operatings Command, Eric had served five tours of duty, but kept going back because he felt responsible for his teammates and was determined to finish the mission. On May 4, Eric gave his life after escorting a high-ranking U.S. official to meet with Afghan leaders. Later, his family got a letter from a marine who had served two tours with Eric. In it, the marine wrote: \\"There were people who measured their success based on how many enemies they killed or how many missions they led to conquer a foe. Eric based his success on how many of his friends he brought home, and he brought home many, including me.\\" Eric was laid to rest here at Arlington, just 6 days ago. <p>So today we remember their service. Today, just steps from where these brave Americans lie in eternal peace, we declare, as a proud and grateful nation, that their sacrifice will never be forgotten. And just as we honor them, we hold their families close. Because for the parents who lose a child, for the husbands and wives who lose a partner, for the children who lose a parent, every loss is devastating. And for those of us who bear the solemn responsibility of sending these men and women into harm's way, we know the consequences all too well. I feel it every time I meet a wounded warrior, every time I visit Walter Reed, and every time I grieve with a Gold Star family. <p>And that's why on this day we remember our sacred obligation to those who laid down their lives so we could live ours: to finish the job these men and women started by keeping our promise to those who wear America's uniform; to give our troops the resources they need; to keep faith with our veterans and their families, now and always; to never stop searching for those who have gone missing or who are held as prisoners of war. <p>But on a more basic level, every American can do something even simpler. As we go about our daily lives, we must remember that our countrymen are still serving, still fighting, still putting their lives on the line for all of us. <p>Last fall, I received a letter from Candie Averette of Charlotte, North Carolina. Both of her sons are marines. Her oldest served two tours in Iraq. Her youngest was in Afghanistan at the time. He was, in her words, \\"A hundred percent devoted to his deployment and wouldn't have had it any other way.\\" <p>Reading Candie's letter, it was clear she was extraordinarily proud of the life her boys had chosen. But she also had a request on behalf of all the mothers just like her. She said, \\"Please don't forget about my child and every other marine and soldier over there who proudly choose to defend their country.\\" <p>A mother's plea: Please don't forget. On this Memorial Day, and every day, let us be true and meet that promise. Let it be our task, every single one of us, to honor the strength and the resolve and the love these brave Americans felt for each other and for our country. Let us never forget to always remember and to be worthy of the sacrifice they make in our name. <p>May God bless the fallen and all those who serve. And may God continue to bless the United States of America.\" "
"120" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, New Jersey! It is good to be back in Jersey. <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back! <p>Let me, first of all, say thank you to Governor Christie for that introduction and the great work he's done here. Your mayor, Ed Johnson, is here as well and has been working tirelessly on your behalf. We've got three great representatives in Congress from New Jersey: Rush Holt, Frank Pallone, Donald Payne, Jr. <p>Now, last week, my advisers asked me, they said, Mr. President, do you want to spend next Tuesday in Washington, or would you rather spend it at the Jersey Shore? And I've got to say, I've got to make some tough decisions as President, but this wasn't one of them. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you anyway. <p><i>The President.</i> I appreciate that. <p>Governor Christie and I just spent some time on the Point Pleasant boardwalk. I got a chance to see the world's tallest sandcastle being built. We played some Touchdown Fever. I got to say, Christie got it in the tire the first try&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;although I did pay for his throws. [<i>Laughter</i>] I played a little Frog Bog, and Governor Christie's kids taught me the right technique for hitting the hammer to get those frogs in the buckets the way I was supposed to. [<i>Laughter</i>] And of course, I met with folks who are still rebuilding after Sandy. <p>Now, we all understand there's still a lot of work to be done. There are homes to rebuild. There are businesses to reopen. There are landmarks and beaches and boardwalks that aren't all the way back yet. But thanks to the hard work of an awful lot of people, we've got wonderful shops and restaurants and arcades that are opening their doors. And I saw what thousands of Americans saw over Memorial Day weekend: You are stronger than the storm. After all you've dealt with, after all you've been through, the Jersey Shore is back and it is open for business, and they want all Americans to know that they're ready to welcome you here. <p>And I've got to say, if they ever let me have any fun, I'd have some fun here. [<i>Laughter</i>] I was telling my staff on the ride over, I could see being a little younger&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and having some fun on the Jersey Shore. I can't do that anymore. [<i>Laughter</i>] Maybe after I leave office. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I think a friend of mine from here once put it pretty well: \\"Down the shore, everything's all right.\\" He's the only guy a President still has to call the Boss. [<i>Laughter</i>] Other than the First Lady. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But for generations, that's what this place has been about. Life isn't always easy. We're people who have to work hard and do what it takes to provide for our families. But when you come here, everything's all right. And whether you spend a lifetime here or a weekend or a summer, the shore holds a special place in your heart and in&mdash;a special place in America's mythology, America's memory. <p>When I was here 7 months ago, Hurricane Sandy had just hammered communities all across the East Coast, and lives were lost, and homes and businesses were destroyed, and folks were hurting. And I remember something Chris said back then. He said, \\"We cannot permit that sorrow to replace the resilience that I know all New Jerseyans have.\\" <p><i>Audience member.</i> Yes, we do! <p><i>The President.</i> And it didn't. You didn't let it. You kept going. Because these towns have a special character, not just in the summer, but all year round. From the moment the hurricane hit, first responders worked around the clock to save lives and property. And neighbors opened their homes and their hearts to one another. And you came together as citizens to rebuild. <p>And we're not done yet, and I want to make sure everybody understands that, because for somebody who hasn't seen their home rebuilt yet or is still trying to get their business up and running again after all those losses, we don't want them to think that somehow we've checked a box and we've moved on. That's part of the reason I came back: to let people know we're going to keep on going until we finish. <p>But if anybody wondered whether the shore could ever be all right again, you got&mdash;you got your answer this weekend. From Sea Bright to Bay Head, from Belmar to Seaside Heights, folks were hanging out on balconies and beaches. Shows were sold out at the Stone Pony. Kids were eating ice cream, going on rides, going and eating some more ice cream. [<i>Laughter</i>] Guys were trying to win those big stuffed animals to impress a special girl. So, like I said, the Jersey Shore is back in business. <p>The work's not over, though. Seven months ago, I promised you that your country would have your back. I told you we would not quit until the job was done, and I meant it. [<i>Applause</i>] I meant it. <p>Craig Fugate, the head of FEMA, he couldn't be here today, but I want to thank him and his team for their ongoing work. FEMA was here before Sandy made landfall; they're still here today. They're working with the Governor's team and with the task force I set up to support families and communities who still need help. Since the storm hit, we've provided billions of dollars to families and State and local governments across the region, and more is on the way. <p>And even as my team is helping communities recover from the last hurricane season, they're already starting to prepare for the next hurricane season, which starts this Saturday. Because if there's one thing that we've learned last year, it's that when a storm hits, we've got to be ready. Education, preparation, that's what makes a difference. That's what saves lives. And anyone who wants to make sure they're ready&mdash;for a hurricane or any other disaster&mdash;I want them to visit something: a web site called ready.gov. Make a plan. It's never too early. <p>And we've also got to remember that rebuilding efforts like these aren't measured in weeks or months, but they're measured in years. That's why just this past Thursday, we announced billions of new relief aid for New York and New Jersey transit agencies. And that's why the Army Corps of Engineers is working to restore beaches and strengthen the shore's natural defenses. That's why I joined Governor Christie and your representatives, fighting to get a relief package through Congress. We're going to keep doing what it takes to rebuild all the way and make it better than it was before, make it stronger than it was before, make it more resilient than it was before. <p>So, Jersey, you've got a&mdash;you've still got a long road ahead, but when you look out on this beach&mdash;this beautiful beach here&mdash;even in the rain, it looks good. You look out over the horizon, you can count on the fact that you won't be alone. Your fellow citizens will be there for you, just like we'll be there for folks in Breezy Point and Staten Island, and obviously, we're going to be there for the folks in Monroe [Moore; White House correction.], Oklahoma, after the devastation of last week. <p>Part of the reason I wanted to come back here was not just to send a message to New Jersey, but send a message to folks in Oklahoma: When we make a commitment that we've got your back, we mean it, and we're not going to finish until the work is done. Because that's who we are. We help each other as Americans through the bad times, and we sure make the most of the good times. <p>So let's have some good times on the New Jersey Shore this summer. And next summer and the summer after that and all year long, America, bring your family and friends. Spend a little money on the Jersey Shore. You'll find some of the friendliest folks on Earth, some of the best beaches on Earth. And you'll see that even after a tough couple of months, this space is as special as ever, and down the shore, everything is still all right. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "

We've got lots of special guests and talented performers. <p>And every day, we're reminded of the many ways in which Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders have all contributed and enriched our Nation throughout our history. Obviously for me, I don't have to look any further than my own family. I've got my brother-in-law here, Konrad, who is&mdash;Konrad Ng, who's heading up the Smithsonian Asian American center&mdash;or it probably has a longer name than that. [<i>Laughter</i>] My sister Maya, their beautiful daughters, my nieces Suhaila and Savita. <p>I can think back to my college years when my roommates were Indian and Pakistanis, which is how I learned how to cook <i>keema</i> and <i>dal</i>. [<i>Laughter</i>] Very good. And of course, I can dig back into my own memories of growing up in Hawaii and in Indonesia. And so certainly, it's been a central part of my life, the entire Asia-Pacific region. <p>But it's more than food and family, because generations of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders helped build this country and helped to defend this country and to make America what it is today. It's a history that speaks to the promise of our Nation, one that welcomes the contributions of all people, no matter their color or their beliefs, because we draw from the rich traditions of everybody who calls America home. <i>E pluribus unum</i>&mdash;\\"out of many, one\\". <p>And the artists joining us today exemplify that creed. So we've got performers like Karsh Kale, who fuses the best of East and West, mixing eclectic beats with the sounds of his heritage and creating music that's distinctly his own; that's a trait obviously that's distinctly American. We've got musicians like Paula Fuga and John Cruz, whose work represents the spirit of my native Hawaii and reminds us that we're all part of the same <i>ohana</i>. We have authors like Amy Tan, who uses her own family's immigration story to trace the stories of others. She makes out of the particular something very universal. <p>We value these voices because from the very beginning, ours has been a nation of immigrants, a nation challenged and shaped and pushed ever forward by diverse perspectives and fresh thinking. And in order to keep our edge and stay ahead in the global race, we need to figure out how to way&mdash;a way to fix our broken immigration system, to welcome that infusion of newness while still maintaining the enduring strength of our laws. And the service and the leadership of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have proved that point time and again. <p>So we take opportunities like today to honor the legacy of those who paved the way, like my friend, the late Senator from Hawaii, Daniel Inouye, the first Japanese American to serve in Congress. And to celebrate the pioneers of this generation, like Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth, one of the first female veterans elected to Congress. And one of my favorite people right now, Sri Srinivasan, who has just been confirmed. Here's Sri, right here. <p>I was proud to nominate Sri, and he was just confirmed unanimously to become the first South Asian American Federal appeals court judge. I was telling his kids, who are here today, if he starts getting a big head, walking around the house with a robe&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;asking them to call him Your Honor&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;then they should talk to me. But&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>In every election, at every board meeting, in every town across America, we see more and more different faces of leadership, setting an example for every young kid who sees a leader who looks like him or her. And that's a good thing. We've got to keep that up. We've got to do everything we can to make sure everybody works hard, everybody plays by the rules, everybody has a chance to get ahead&mdash;to start their own business, to earn a degree, to write their own page in the American story&mdash;that the laws respect everybody; that civil rights apply to everybody. That's who we are at our best, and that's what we're here to celebrate. That's the challenge that I believe we're going to meet together. <p>So I want to thank all of you for being here tonight. It is going to be a wonderful, wonderful gathering. And from Michelle and Malia and Sasha and Bo&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;thank you all for the incredible contributions that you're making each and every day. <p>God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"122" "\"Hello, Chicago! <p>Michael Jordan&mdash;no, different Michael Jordan. [<i>Laughter</i>] It is great to be home, and it is great to be among so many good friends. Starting with Jan Schakowsky, what she does not mention is&mdash;in her introduction&mdash;that not too many folks gave me a chance to win that first Senate race, but Jan Schakowsky was one of the few people who did and stepped out, along with Robin Kelly, along with Michael Jordan. <p>So there is a certain crew here of true believers, and we ended up having the primary night celebration in this hotel. And I was just saying that was probably&mdash;maybe my favorite moment in politics, as opposed to governing&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;just because nobody expected it, including maybe me. [<i>Laughter</i>] So it's wonderful to have Jan here. <p>A couple other people, obviously, I want to acknowledge. First of all, outstanding leader, soon once again to be Speaker, Nancy Pelosi in the house. We love Nancy. <p>A man who is doing a thankless job with style and grace, our DCCC chairman, Steve Israel. Tomorrow is Steve Israel's birthday, so I want to wish everybody&mdash;yes, let's go ahead and sing. <p>[<i>At this point, the President led audience members in singing \\"Happy Birthday.\\"</i>] <p>Yay! We've got a number of other extraordinary Members: a visitor, Steny Hoyer, whose leadership is invaluable and works so closely with Nancy; and then just an incredible congressional delegation headed up by our own Dick Durbin. I already mentioned Robin Kelly. We've got Cheri Bustos here. We've got Bill Foster here. We've got Bobby Rush here. We've got Rick Nolan here. Rick is not from Illinois, but we like him anyway. [<i>Laughter</i>] Sandy Levin is here. And candidate in the Illinois 13th from down south who is going to win, Ann Callis is in the house. <p>And finally, a great friend and somebody who's showing what leadership is all about here in Chicago&mdash;I could not be prouder of him&mdash;your great mayor, Rahm Emanuel. <p>All right. Now, my remarks are going to be relatively brief because game seven of the Blackhawks game is going on right now. And I expect the Blackhawks to win. I know the Crosstown Classic is going on this week, and I expect the White Sox to win. But I love the Cubs too; they're great. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm not a Cubs hater; I'm just saying. [<i>Laughter</i>] I think the Sox will win. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But the main reason I'm here is just to say thanks to all of you for the incredible privilege that you've given me to lead this country and to say that our work is not yet done. <p>Jan rattled off a list of accomplishments that I could not be prouder of, and I couldn't have gotten them done had it not been for Nancy Pelosi and an incredible congressional delegation from here in Illinois. But what we also know is, despite the headlines talking about the economy starting to pick up steam, despite recovery in the housing market, despite the fact that we've created all those jobs, despite the fact that the stock market has hit an alltime high, what we also know is, is that there are people all across this country who are still hurting. <p>People whose homes are still underwater. People just a few miles from here who desperately want to work and can't yet find work or can't get the skills they need to work. There are people just a few miles from here who are still worried about gun violence striking down their children on the way to school. There are folks all across the country who are willing to work hard, have the same kinds of values that built this country, looking after their families, taking responsibility not just for themselves, but also for their communities and their neighborhoods. <p>But the environment has changed for them, and what they need desperately is an entire nation that is willing to rally around the basic concept that if you work hard in this country, you can make it&mdash;doesn't matter where you come from, what you look like, what faith you practice, who you love&mdash;that here in America, you can make it if you try. <p>Now, the good news is that we know the answers to so many of our challenges. We know, for example, that even though the economy has picked up, that if, in fact, we started putting people back to work all across this country rebuilding our roads and our bridges and our ports and our dams and our airports, that not only would that accelerate economic growth right now, but it would lay the foundation for economic growth for decades to come. We know that. <p>And we know, by the way, if we just put it off, it's just going to get worse. This is deferred maintenance. It's like not fixing the roof on your house and&mdash;when it's leaking. It's going to be more expensive to fix later. <p>We know that in this global economy, knowledge and skills and education count for everything and that the biggest bang we can get for our education dollar is if we are investing in early childhood education so that every child is getting a good start when they enter kindergarten. We know that. <p>And we've got great models all across the country. We know how to do early childhood education well. The problem is, we haven't invested in it. We probably invest less in early childhood education in this country than in any other industrialized country in the world. Same, by the way, goes for infrastructure, which is why not a single airport out of the top 25 in the world are in America. <p>We know that if we have some commonsense laws that check to see if we're keeping guns out of the hands of criminals or folks who have significant mental illnesses, we know that that can reduce some deaths, save some kids. It doesn't solve the whole problem, but we know that. So&mdash;and we know that 90 percent of the American people and 80 percent of gun owners agree with us. Why aren't we getting that done? <p>We know that energy is what makes an economy go. And the great news, here in America, is that by 2020, we'll be a net exporter of natural gas. We will, over the next couple of decades, have the capacity to be energy independent for the first time. Incredible change. It will change geopolitics for generations to come, and it frees ourselves from dependence not only on foreign oil generally, but from some of the most volatile parts of the world. <p>But what we also know is, is that the climate is changing in ways that we can't fully predict, but we know are not going to be good for our kids. And the good news is, we've already doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars. We've already doubled our production of clean energy. And if we continue to make the investments, nobody has the know-how and the scientific skill to create the kinds of breakthroughs that deal with climate change, but we've got to go ahead and make that decision so that we can be leaders not just for our own kids, but for kids all around the world. <p>We know that making investments in science and technology pay off like nothing else. And yet right now we've got a budget that is actually cutting our commitment to science and energy because bad priorities in Washington. <p>And yet how else are we going to compete against China and Germany when they're doubling or tripling their R&D investments and we're actually seeing ours fall or at least stay stagnant. <p>So the good news is that the United States of America is better positioned than any country on Earth to make sure that the 21st century remains our century, just like the 20th was. And a world city like Chicago is better positioned than just about anybody. Look at the assets that are here. We got the best universities. We've got the most dynamic entrepreneurs. We've got everything we need to succeed. <p>But the one thing that's still missing is a politics that matches up with the decency and the hard work and determination and creativity of the American people. We've got a politics that's stuck right now. And the reason it's stuck is because people spend more time thinking about the next election than they do thinking about the next generation. <p>Now, I've got to tell you, I've run my last political race, and many of you may be relieved about that because&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;my good friend Ab Mikva in this town used to say that having a friend who is a politician is like permanently having a child in college. [<i>Laughter</i>] You're just&mdash;you're always writing checks. So I've graduated. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But the reason that I'm here is because for me to govern effectively over the next 3, 3&frac12; years, part of my task is to constantly, continually reach out to the other side to try to find common ground; to look for those Republicans who don't think compromise is a dirty word; to continue to advance the agenda that the American people sent me there to advance; to make work pay; to attract new businesses to our shores; to make sure that we're competitive; to build a middle class. And so any opportunities I have to do that, I will seize them. <p>And I have to say, as tough a fighter as Nancy Pelosi is, I have watched her, and I have watched some of the Democrats who are in this room take very tough votes, even going against some of the special interests who support Democrats typically if we think it's the right thing to do. We've shown ourselves willing to do it. <p>And so I'm constantly eager to find Republicans who are willing to do the same, because I actually don't think that any party has a monopoly on wisdom. And I actually think that Democrats, we have to be willing to compromise sometimes to get stuff done. We're not an ideological party, we're a practical party. <p>But what I will also say is this: that if day in, day out, what we confront is obstructionism for the sake of obstructionism and what appears to be an interest only in scoring political points or placating a base as opposed to trying to advance the interests of the American people, then we've got to figure out a way to work around that. And one of the best ways to work around it is to have a Democratic House of Representatives. <p>So the&mdash;so thanks to the work of Steve Israel, thanks to incredible candidates like Ann Callis, we've got a great chance of taking back the House. And I'm going to be working tirelessly, wherever I get the opportunity, to make the case to the American people that our ideas are the right ones for growing the middle class, that our ideas are the right ones to protect our environment, that our ideas are the right ones in terms of making sure our kids are getting a great education. <p>And any Republican who joins up and says, \\"I agree, those are the right ideas,\\" hey, I'm ready to work. But those who don't, I'm going to be out there making the case. And I know that that's what some of the great candidates at the DCCC are going to be doing as well. And the only way they're able to do that is if they've got support from folks like you. <p>So I just want to say to all of you, I'm grateful to you, but do not get complacent. Do not buy into this notion somehow that, oh, these problems are too big or Washington is broken. No. Washington is not broken. It's broken right now for a particular reason, but it's not permanently broken. It can be fixed. <p>We got a whole bunch of stuff done my first 2 years. We've gotten a whole bunch of done&mdash;stuff done since that time. And I'm optimistic about us getting legislation passed this year, but we could be doing a whole lot more. We can only do it with you. We can only do it not only by you contributing to the DCCC, but also by talking to your friends and neighbors and colleagues about the ideas that are important for America. <p>And we can only do it if you guys sustain a sense of hope, a sense of promise, a belief that here in America, sometimes, we take a bad turn, sometimes, we make mistakes, but the trajectory of this country is for greater rights, more prosperity, greater tolerance. People still from around the world come here, recognizing that in this country there is this unique idea that all of us count and that all of us can make it. And that's just a great gift, and it should make us hopeful. <p>And when I see young people&mdash;some of whom are here today&mdash;I am constantly inspired because they are smarter than we were, they're more sophisticated than we were, in many ways they're more conscientious than we were. So this is&mdash;the generation coming behind us, I mean, they are spectacular. We've just got to make sure that we leave for them a political system that allows them to express all that incredible creativity and ingenuity and wonderful values that they're going to be able to express through our politics. That's what this project is about, and we can't do it without you. All right? <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.\" "
"123" "\"<i>The President. </i>Thank you, everybody. Thank you. No, no, no, don't do that. This is my&mdash;you know, this is like old home week. <p><i>Bettylu K. Saltzman. </i>Mr. President<i>.</i> <p><i>The President. </i>Yes? <p><i>Mrs. Saltzman.</i> Sandy Levin is here from Michigan. <p><i>The President.</i> Yes. <p><i>Mrs. Saltzman.</i> Sandy Levin. <p><i>The President.</i> We got a&mdash;that's because he's got a relative here. [<i>Laughter</i>] The good excuse to&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Rep. Sander M. Levin. </i>I came here to cheer for the Red Wings. <p><i>The President.</i> Oh no! <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> Secret Service, can you have this man removed, please? [<i>Laughter</i>] The&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p><i>Audience member.</i> What's the score? <p><i>The President.</i> We don't know yet. If anybody is monitoring the score, please let us know. I'll make the announcement. <p>Well, look, everybody here has been introduced, but I want to say something about everybody. First of all, the Whip, Steny Hoyer, does a great job every single day. And there's nobody in the House of Representatives who understands the mechanics of getting things done and is able to deliver on behalf of the values that we care about than an outstanding Congressman from Maryland: Steny Hoyer. <p>Steve Israel has the thankless job of traveling around the country every day on behalf of Democrats, trying to get a Democratic House back. And he does it with good humor and grace and has been outstanding. And we're so grateful for him. It also happens to be the day before his birthday, so wish every&mdash;everybody wish Steve a happy birthday. <p>I was going to say nice things about Sandy Levin, but we'll skip over that. [<i>Laughter</i>] Actually, Sandy is wonderful, and nobody fights for working people harder than Sandy Levin. And we're just grateful him, for everything that he does. <p>Jan Schakowsky has been a progressive champion in this State for so many years and was one of my earliest supporters when I ran for the United States Senate. And I could not have ever achieved what I did nationally without the support of Jan Schakowsky. So we're grateful for her. <p>Nancy Pelosi. It is absolutely true that the things I'm proudest of having accomplished as President, I accomplished with Nancy Pelosi fighting every step of the way. You could not have a better partner than her. She is tough as nails. She is a great politician. She is a great leader. But all that's in service of a mission, which is to make sure that the American people can achieve their dreams through hard work and responsibility. <p>And I was mentioning this to the other&mdash;we had a little event&mdash;larger event downtown; I guess we're now in River North. But I said to them that one of&mdash;we're all politicians; we're all members of parties. But one of the things that I'm proud of as a Democrat is the fact that at certain critical junctures, we're willing to put what is politically expedient aside to do what's right. And I've seen Nancy do that, consistently. I've seen her be willing, not just to stare down the other side and say, \\"No, this is what's important for the American people,\\" I've seen her&mdash;to her own constituencies and her own base&mdash;say: \\"You know what? This is something that we need to do to compromise and get something done.\\" <p>And I've got to tell you, I could not be prouder of Nancy Pelosi and the work that she's done, and I could not be more anxious and eager to have her back as Speaker of the House. She is a great friend. So, finally, before I just make some very brief remarks and then I want to spend some time on questions, I've got to talk about Bettylu and Paul. No, it's going to&mdash;you know, don't worry. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Mrs. Saltzman.</i> Should I leave the room? <p><i>The President.</i> No, no, it's just an expression of love. The&mdash;I don't know if Bettylu actually told me that she thought I could be President. [<i>Laughter</i>] But what I do know is this, that I&mdash;when I had just gotten out of law school and was still finding my way, and I had come back here, and I was assigned to work to register voters with Project Vote, Bettylu even then was at the forefront of a nonpartisan effort to get people registered and voting, back in 1992. And right away, Bettylu treated me like a son and with the warmth and concern, and she was somebody who introduced me to so many of the people in this room and introduced me to so many people here in Chicago. <p>And so when I look around the room and I see folks like Joan Harris and Judy Gaynor and people who have been supporters of mine from the get-go, I can all trace that back to Bettylu. And we've got kind of a Obama cabal here in this room. [<i>Laughter</i>] But it's fitting that we're here, because she invested high hopes and expectations in me. And through all the ups and downs of my political career, she has been a constant, and she's always been there and has always been supportive. And when times have been tough, she was right there and stepping up all over again. And Paul, who may have been skeptical during this whole time&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;was kind enough to go along with it. <p>And so I make this point only&mdash;there are very few people&mdash;Steny or Nancy, you may have somebody in your life like this, where you can honestly say&mdash;it's not just words&mdash;you can honestly say, I probably would not be here today were it not for&mdash;I can honestly say I probably would not be President of the United States were it not for Bettylu Saltzman. And so I just wanted to say that. That's true. [<i>Applause</i>] That's true. That is true. Love that woman. Love Bettylu. It's true. Love that woman. [<i>Laughter</i>] All right. <p><i>Mrs. Saltzman.</i> Thank you, thank you. <p><i>The President.</i> It's true. <p>So we're going to have time for questions. I'm just going to make a couple of quick remarks to give you a sense of where we are now. <p>If you read the headlines over the last couple of days, you'd actually see housing recovering, the economy stronger than expected, stock market hitting record highs. And you'd have an impression, rightly, that having&mdash;after having gone through the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, that we are&mdash;we have recovered faster, we have gone further, our economy is doing better than just about every industrialized country in the world, or at least a large portion of them. And that's good news, and we should celebrate that. <p>But if you go beneath the headlines, what we also know is that there are huge numbers of people all across America who are still seeing their house underwater, huge numbers of Americans who want to work, believe in the dignity of work, but no matter how hard they try right now, still can't find a job. <p>There are still kids just a few miles from here, who are threatened by gun violence, who aren't in a school that is giving them what they need to compete in this 21st century, and whose prospects are dim, if we're honest, not because they don't have the innate capacity, but because we as a society have decided, that's not our priority. <p>We still have a situation in which, on the one hand, our energy future is more promising than we've ever allowed ourselves to believe. I mean, we will probably be a net exporter of traditional fossil fuels over the next 20 years&mdash;within the next 20 years; probably a net exporter of natural gas in the next 3 or 4 years&mdash;something that could not be imagined even 5, 10 years ago&mdash;because of the dynamism and technology that America has produced. <p>But the flipside is, we also know that the climate is warming faster than anybody anticipated 5 or 10 years ago, and that the future of Bettylu's grandkids, in part, is going to depend on our willingness to deal with something that we may not be able to see or smell, the way you could when the Chicago River was on fire, or at least could have caught on fire, but is in some ways more serious, more fundamental. <p>America is probably more tolerant, more accepting of difference than any time in our history. Obviously, you've got an African American President, a former and soon-to-be-again female Speaker of the House. The work that we did together to end \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" is something that I could not be prouder of. But we also know that there's still a lot of people who are excluded in our society and we've got more work to do. <p>Here in Illinois, we've got a vote on same-sex marriage that's going to be coming up in the State legislature. And I just want to say for the record, it's something that I deeply support. I wrestled with this for a long time, and I am absolutely convinced, it is the right thing to do. And we have to make sure that wherever we go, we are reminding people that the essence of America is that everybody is treated equally under the law, without exception. <p>And so across the board&mdash;whether it's getting early childhood education done or rebuilding our infrastructure when we've got bridges that are buckling all across the country and airports that aren't working the way they're supposed to and ports that are too small to accommodate the big ships that are going to be coming through the Panama Canal; whether it's making sure that we've got job training for people who have to retrain for the jobs of the future&mdash;we have a lot of business to do. <p>And the good news is that we have all the ingredients for success. We've got the best cards. And there's not a country on Earth that would not gladly trade places with the United States of America. The bad news is, is that what's stopping us from making more progress than we've already made is a situation in Washington in which people are willing to put the next election ahead of the next generation. <p>And I've said this before, and I will say it again: I've run my last election. My only interest at this point is effective governance. My only interest is making sure that when I look back 20 years from now, I say I accomplished everything that I could while I had this incredible privilege to advance the interests of the broadest number of Americans and to make sure that this country was stronger and more prosperous than it was when I came into office. That's my only interest. <p>And that means that I am willing to work with anybody&mdash;Republican, Democrat, or Independent&mdash;to get stuff done. And I am not going to put the pause button on for the next year and a half or 2 years or whatever it is simply to position myself for the next election. If I've got a Republican who's willing to work with me to rebuild our infrastructure, let's go. I've got a Republican out there who's willing to get serious about what we need to deal with our long-term deficit challenges, I'm prepared; come on, let's talk. I've got somebody who has a different approach to dealing with climate change&mdash;I don't have much patience for people who deny climate change, but if you've got creative approaches, market-based approaches, tell me about them. If you think I'm doing it the wrong way, let me know. I'm happy to work with you. <p>But what I have not seen so far is the same willingness that I saw and continue to see in Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer and Jan Schakowsky and Sandy Levin, that same willingness to put party interests or political interests aside to advance the interests of the American people. I have not seen that on the other side yet. <p>And what that tells me is, is that they've still got their minds on winning another election. And if that's the case, then even as we're doing everything we can to govern and even as I'm going to continue to reach out to the other side, I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that we've got Nancy Pelosi back in the speakership, because that's where she belongs. And I know the American people will benefit from her leadership. <p>So, last thing I'll say, and then we'll open it up for questions: This will be hard. And frankly, the way gerrymandering now works and the geographical distribution of the population makes winning back the House a challenge. But you know what? Me winning the Presidency was a challenge. Nancy Pelosi becoming the first female Speaker, that was a challenge. It wasn't easy back in 2006. It wasn't easy back in 2008. So it's always challenging. Politics in America is tough, and it's competitive, and the country does have some very deep divisions on a whole range of issues. But it can be done. <p>And the question is going to be, are not only the folks in this room, who are the choir, but are we able and willing to mobilize friends, neighbors, coworkers, business partners, and grab them by the collar&mdash;not literally, necessarily, but figuratively&mdash;and say to them, \\"The stakes are big here, and we've got to stop fooling around\\"? <p>If all of you feel the same passion and intensity around this midterm election as so many of you felt in 2007, 2008 when I was running for President or in 2004 when I was running for Senate, then we're going to get the House back. And when we do, we're going to be in a position to deliver for that next generation. And nothing else should matter. Nothing else is more important. <p>Thank you. All right.\" "
"124" "\"Good morning, everybody. Have a seat, have a seat. Welcome to the White House. I know it's a little warm. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>One of my favorite things about this job is that I get to spend some time with remarkable young people from all across the country. It inspires me. It makes me feel good. Those of you who have had to put on suits and ties and show up at the White House first thing on a Friday morning may not feel the same way I do&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but I appreciate all of you being here. You cleaned up very well. <p>And these students and graduates are here to talk about something that matters to millions of young people and their families, and that's the cost of a college education. Because this isn't just critical for their futures, but it's also critical for America's futures. <p>Over the past 4&frac12; years, we've been fighting our way back from a financial crisis and an incredibly punishing recession&mdash;the worst since the Great Depression&mdash;and it cost millions of Americans their jobs and their homes, the sense of security that they'd spent their lives building up. <p>The good news is today our businesses have created nearly 7 million new jobs over the past 38 months. Five hundred thousand of those jobs are in manufacturing. We're producing more of our own energy, we're consuming less energy, and we're importing less from other countries. The housing market is coming back. The stock market has rebounded. Our deficits are shrinking at the fastest pace in 50 years. People's retirement savings are growing again. The rise of health care costs are slowing. The American auto industry is back. <p>So we're seeing progress, and the economy is starting to pick up steam. The gears are starting to turn again, and we're getting some traction. But the thing is, the way we measure our progress as a country is not just where the stock market is; it's not just to how well the folks at the top are doing; it's not just about the aggregate economic numbers; it's about how much progress ordinary families are making. Are we creating ladders of opportunity for everybody who's willing to work hard? Are we creating not only a growing economy, but also the engine that is critical to long-lasting, sustained economic growth, and that is a rising, thriving middle class. That's our focus. That's what we've got to be concerned about every single day. That's our north star. <p>And that means there are three questions we have to ask ourselves as a nation. Number one, how do we make America a magnet for good jobs in this competitive 21st century economy? Number two, how do we make sure that our workers earn the skills and education they need to do those jobs? And number three, how do we make sure those jobs actually pay a decent wage or salary so that people can save for retirement, send their kids to college? <p>Those are the questions we've got to be asking ourselves every single day. So we're here today to talk about that second question: How do we make sure our workers earn the skills and education they need to do the jobs that companies are hiring for right now and are going to keep hiring for in the future? We know that the surest path to the middle class is some form of higher education: a 4-year degree, a community college degree, an advanced degree. You're going to need more than just a high school education to succeed in this economy. <p>And the young people here today, they get that. They're working through college&mdash;maybe just graduated&mdash;and earning their degree isn't just the best investment that they can make for their future, it's the best investment that they can make in America's future. <p>But like a lot of young people all across the country, these students have had to take on more and more and more debt to pay for this investment. Since most of today's college students were born, tuition and fees at public universities have more than doubled. And these days, the average student who takes out loans to pay for 4 years of college, graduates owing more than $26,000. How many people are on track here for $26,000? <p>And that doesn't just hold back our young graduates, it holds back our entire middle class because Americans now owe more on our student loans than we do on our credit cards. And those payments can last for years, even decades, which means that young people are putting off buying their first car or their first house&mdash;the things that grow our economy and create new jobs. And I've said this before, I know this first hand, Michelle and I, we did not finish paying off our student loans until about 9 years ago. And our student loans cost more than our mortgage. Right when we wanted to start saving for Sasha and Malia's college education, we were still paying off our own college education. <p>And we were lucky. We had more resources than many. So we cannot price the middle class&mdash;or folks who are willing to work hard to get into the middle class&mdash;out of a college education. We can't keep saddling young people with more and more and more debt, just as they're starting out in life. <p>Now, the good news is, over the past 4 years, my administration has done a lot to address this. Working with Members of Congress, we've expanded student aid. We've reformed the student loan system. We've saved tens of billions of taxpayer dollars that were just going to big banks and made sure that the money went to helping more young people afford college. <p>We made it easier to pay back those loans by passing a law that says you'll only have to pay 10 percent of your monthly income towards your student&mdash;Federal student loans once you graduate. This is important to emphasize, by the way, because a lot of your peers, a lot of young people don't know this. Under existing law that we passed, you never have to pay more than 10 percent of your income in paying back your Federal student loans, which means if you want to be a teacher, you want to go into a profession that does not pay a lot of money, but gives you a lot of satisfaction, you are still capable of doing that and supporting yourself. <p>We unveiled a new college scorecard that gives parents and students the clear, concise information that you need to shop around for a school with the best value for you. And I've made it clear that those colleges that don't do enough to keep college costs down should get less taxpayer support. <p>So we're doing what we can, but here's the thing: If Congress doesn't act by July 1, Federal student loan rates are set to double. And that means that the average student with these loans will rack up an additional $1,000 in debt. That's like a $1,000 tax hike. I assume most of you cannot afford that. Anybody here can afford that? No. <p>Now, if this sounds like deja vu all over again, that's because it is. We went through this last summer. Some of you were here. It wasn't as hot. [<i>Laughter</i>] I don't think we did this event outside. [<i>Laughter</i>] But we went through this. And eventually, Congress listened to all the parents and young people who said, don't double my rate. And because folks made their voices heard, Congress acted to keep interest rates low. But they only did it for a year, and that year is almost up. <p>So the test here is simple: We've got to make sure that Federal student loan rates don't double on July 1. Now, the House of Representatives has already \\"passed a student loan bill, and I'm glad that they took action. But unfortunately, their bill does not meet that test. It fails to lock in low rates for students next year. That's not smart. It eliminates safeguards for lower income families. That's not fair. It could actually cost a freshman starting school this fall more over the next 4 years than if we did nothing at all and let the interest rates double on July 1. <p>So the House bill isn't smart, and it's not fair. I'm glad the House is paying attention to it, but they didn't do it in the right way. So I'm asking young people to get involved and make your voices heard once again. Last year, you convinced 186 Republicans in the House and 24 Republicans in the Senate to work with Democrats to keep student loan rates low. You made something bipartisan happen in this town that is&mdash;that's a powerful thing. You guys were able to get Democrats and Republicans to vote for something that was important. <p>So this year, if it looks like your representatives have changed their minds, you're going to have to call them up again or e-mail them again or tweet them again and ask them what happened&mdash;what changed? You're still taking out these loans. You're still facing challenges. <p>Remind them that we're a people who help one another earn an education, because it benefits all of us. During the Civil War, Lincoln had the foresight to set up a system of land- grant colleges. At the end of World War II, we set up the GI bill so that people like my grandfather could come back from a war and get an education. All these things created the greatest middle class on Earth. <p>My mom, a single mom, was able to get the support that she needed through loans and grants&mdash;even while she was also working and raising two kids&mdash;to get her degrees. I'm only here, Michelle is only right over there on the East Wing, because we got great educations. We didn't come from privilege. And we want to make sure that the next generation has those same opportunities, because that has been good for the country as a whole. <p>It's up to us now to carry forward that tradition. Higher education cannot be a luxury for a privileged few; It is an economic necessity that every family should be able to afford, every young person with dreams and ambition should be able to access. And now is not the time for us to turn back on young people. Now is not the time to slash the investments that help us grow. Now is the time to reaffirm our commitment to you and the generation that's coming behind you, and that if we work together to generate more jobs and educate more kids and open up new opportunities for everybody who's willing to work and willing to push through those doors of opportunity, America can't be stopped. All right? <p>So I'm putting my faith in you. Let's work together. Let's get this done by July 1. Thank you everybody. God bless you. God bless America. Thank you.\" "
"125" "\"Hi, everybody. Over the past 4&frac12; years, we've been fighting our way back from an economic crisis and punishing recession that cost millions of Americans their jobs, their homes, and the sense of security they'd worked so hard to build. <p>But thanks to the grit and determination of the American people, our businesses have now created nearly 7 million new jobs over the past 38 months. An auto industry that was flatlining is once again the heartbeat of American manufacturing, with Americans buying more cars than we have in 5 years. Within the next few months, we're projected to begin producing more of our own crude oil at home than we buy from other countries, the first time that's happened in 16 years. <p>Deficits that were growing for years are now shrinking at the fastest rate in decades. The rise of health care costs is slowing too. And a housing market that was in tatters is showing new signs of real strength. Sales are rising, foreclosures are declining, construction is expanding; and home prices that are rising at the fastest rate in nearly 7 years are helping a lot of families breathe a lot easier. <p>Now we need to do more. This week, my administration announced that we're extending a program to help more responsible families modify their mortgages so they can stay in their homes. But to keep our housing market and our economy growing, Congress needs to step up and do its part. Members of Congress will be coming back next week for an important month of work. We've got to keep this progress going until middle class families start regaining that sense of security. And we can't let partisan politics get in the way. <p>Congress should pass a law giving every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage by refinancing at historically low interest rates. Congress should put more Americans to work rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges, like the one that collapsed last week in Washington State. We'd all be safer, and the unemployment rate would fall faster. <p>And Congress should fix our broken immigration system by passing commonsense reform that continues to strengthen our borders, hold employers accountable, and provides a pathway to earned citizenship and also modernizes our legal immigration system so that we're reuniting families and attracting the highly skilled entrepreneurs and engineers who will help our economy grow. <p>So there are a lot of reasons to feel optimistic about where we're headed as a country, especially after all we've fought through together. We've just got to keep going, because we've got more good jobs to create. We've got more kids to educate. We've got more doors of opportunity to open for anyone who's willing to work hard enough to walk through those doors. <p>And if we work together, I'm as confident as I've ever been that we'll get to where we need to be. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"126" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you so much. Everybody, please have a seat. Thank you so much. Welcome to the White House. And thank you, Janelle, for that introduction and sharing your story and making such a difference through your organization. We're really proud to have you here. <p>I want to thank Secretary Sebelius, Secretary Arne Duncan, Secretary Ric Shinseki for their leadership and helping to organize this event. And I also want to acknowledge some outstanding Members of Congress who are here and who care deeply about this issue. <p>And finally, I want to thank all of you for participating in this National Conference on Mental Health. We wanted to bring together folks who've suffered from mental illness and families who've supported them. We wanted to bring together advocates and educators, faith leaders, veterans, local officials. <p>All of you have shown an extraordinary commitment to what is a critical goal, and that is to make sure that people aren't suffering in silence and that we have the capacity to pull together all the resources and support and love that's out there to go after an extraordinary challenge in our society. <p>The main goal of this conference is not to start a conversation; so many of you have spent decades waging long and lonely battles to be heard. Instead, it's about elevating that conversation to a national level and bringing mental illness out of the shadows. <p>We want to let people living with mental health challenges know that they are not alone, and we've got to be making sure that we're committed to support those fellow Americans, because struggling with a mental illness or caring for someone who does can be isolating. And I think everybody here who's experienced this&mdash;the issue in one way or another understands that. It begins to feel as if not only are you alone, but that you shouldn't burden others with the challenge, and the darkness, day in, day out&mdash;what some call a cloud that you just can't seem to escape&mdash;begins to close in. <p>The truth is, in any given year, one in five adults experience a mental illness&mdash;one in five. Forty-five million Americans suffer from things like depression or anxiety, schizophrenia or PTSD. Young people are affected at a similar rate. So we all know somebody&mdash;a family member, a friend, a neighbor&mdash;who has struggled or will struggle with mental health issues at some point in their lives. Michelle and I have both known people who have battled severe depression over the years, people we love. And oftentimes, those who seek treatment go on to lead happy, healthy, productive lives. <p>So we know that recovery is possible, we know help is available, and yet, as a society, we often think about mental health differently than other forms of health. You see commercials on TV about a whole array of physical health issues, some of them very personal. [<i>Laughter</i>] And yet we whisper about mental health issues and avoid asking too many questions. <p>And the brain is a body part too; we just know less about it. And there should be no shame in discussing or seeking help for treatable illnesses that affect too many people that we love. We've got to get rid of that embarrassment; we've got to get rid of that stigma. Too many Americans who struggle with mental health illnesses are still suffering in silence rather than seeking help, and we need to see it that men and women who would never hesitate to go see a doctor if they had a broken arm or came down with the flu, that they have that same attitude when it comes to their mental health. <p>And we see it in veterans who come home from the battlefield with the invisible wounds of war, but who feel somehow that seeking treatment is a sign of weakness, when in fact it's a sign of strength. We see it in parents who would do anything for their kids, but who often fight their mental health battle alone, afraid that reaching out would somehow reflect badly on them. <p>We see it in the tragedies that we have the power to prevent. And I want to be absolutely clear: The overwhelming majority of people who suffer from mental illnesses are not violent. They will never pose a threat to themselves or others. And there are a whole lot of violent people with no diagnosable mental health issues. But we also know that most suicides each year involve someone with a mental health or substance abuse disorder. And in some cases, when a condition goes untreated, it can lead to tragedy on a larger scale. <p>We can do something about stories like these. Many cases, treatment is available and effective. We can help people who suffer from a mental illness continue to be great colleagues, great friends, the people we love. We can take out some pain and give them a new sense of hope. But it requires all of us to act. And there are a few ways we can do our part. <p>First, we've got to do a better job recognizing mental health issues in our children and making it easier for Americans of all ages to seek help. Today, less than 40 percent of people with mental illness receive treatment&mdash;less than 40 percent. Even though three-quarters of mental illnesses emerge by the end of&mdash;by the age of 24, only about half of children with mental health problems receive treatment. Now think about it: We wouldn't accept it if only 40 percent of Americans with cancers got treatment. And we wouldn't accept it if only half of young people with diabetes got help. Why should we accept it when it comes to mental health? It doesn't make any sense. <p>But the good news is, there are plenty of groups that are stepping up to change that. So a former colleague of mine, Gordon Smith, a former Republican Senator, lost his son to suicide 10 years ago. And I remember him speaking so eloquently about it. Gordon is now the head of the National Association of Broadcasters, and today the National Association of Broadcasters is announcing a new campaign designed to change attitudes about mental illness through TV ads and social media, because Gordon doesn't want other parents to go through the agonizing loss that he's endured. So we thank you, Gordon, for that great work. <p>You've got secondary school principals who are holding assemblies on mental health. You've got organizations like the YMCA who are volunteering to train staff to recognize the signs of depression and other mental illnesses in our young people. You got leaders from different faith communities who are getting their congregations involved. And dozens of other organizations have today made similar commitments, so we've very thankful to all of you. <p>There are other people who are leading by example. My great friend, Patrick Kennedy, when he was running for reelection back in 2006, he could have avoided talking about his struggles with bipolar disorder and addiction. Let's face it, he's a Kennedy. You know. [<i>Laughter</i>] He was&mdash;his seat was pretty safe. Everybody loved him. And yet Patrick used his experience as a way to connect and to lift up these issues, not hide from them. <p>And one day, a woman came up to Patrick at a senior center and told him she was afraid to tell her friends she was taking medication for a mental illness because they&mdash;she was worried they might treat her differently. She told Patrick, \\"You're the only one who knows aside from my son.\\" And so Patrick started realizing how much power there could be for people to speak out on these issues. And Patrick carried these stories back with him to Washington, where he worked with a bipartisan group of lawmakers, including his dad, to make sure the mental health services you get through your insurance plan at work are covered the same way that physical health services are. A huge victory. So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>So because of Patrick's efforts and the colleagues who worked with him, it's easier for millions of people to join him on the road to recovery, which brings me to a second point. It's not enough to help more Americans seek treatment, we also have to make sure that the treatment is there when they're ready to seek it. <p>For years now, our mental health system has struggled to serve people who depend on it. That's why, under the Affordable Care Act, we're expanding mental health and substance abuse benefits for more than 60 million Americans. And new health insurance plans are required to cover things like depression screenings for adults and behavioral assessments for children. And beginning next year, insurance companies will no longer be able to deny anybody coverage because of a preexisting mental health condition. <p>We're also investing in science and basic research to make it easier to diagnose and treat disease early. And earlier this year, I announced an ambitious initiative to develop tools for mapping the human brain, which could help scientists and researchers unlock the answers to conditions that affect mental health. <p>We're also doing more to support our troops and our veterans who are suffering from things like traumatic brain disorder&mdash;or traumatic brain injury or PTSD, posttraumatic stress disorder. Today, we lose 22 veterans a day to suicide&mdash;22. We've got to do a better job than that, of preventing these all too often silent tragedies. That's why we've poured an enormous amount of resources into high-quality care and better treatment for our troops. <p>And today, under Ric Shinseki's leadership, the VA is going even further. They're partnering with 24 communities in 9 States to help reduce wait times for veterans seeking mental health care. And they're&mdash;they've met their goal of hiring 1,600 new mental health providers, which means this summer, they're going to hold more than 150 summits like this one in communities all across the country so that every one of our servicemembers and veterans understand: Just like you take care of yourselves and each other on the battlefield, you've got to do the same thing off the battlefield. That's part of being strong. <p>For many people who suffer from a mental illness, recovery can be challenging. But what helps more than anything, what gives so many of our friends and loved ones strength, is the knowledge that you are not alone. You're not alone. You're surrounded by people who care about you and who will support you on the journey to get well. We're here for you. <p>And that's what this conference is about. That's why these issues are so important. So if there's anybody out there who's listening, if you're struggling, seek help. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Thank you, Mr. President. <p><i>The President.</i> You're welcome. If you know somebody who is struggling, help them reach out. Remember the family members who shoulder their own burdens and needs our support as well. And more than anything, let people who are suffering in silence know that recovery is possible. They're not alone. There's hope. There's possibility. And that's what all of you represent with the extraordinary advocacy and work that you've already done. <p>So thank you all for being here. Let's do everything we can to help our fellow Americans heal and thrive. And now I'd like to turn it over to Secretary Sebelius, who will be leading our opening panel. All right? <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"127" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! Welcome to the White House. And welcome to the Super Bowl champion&mdash;world champion&mdash;Baltimore Ravens. Everybody can have a seat. That's why we set up chairs. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, I suspect that these guys are wondering, what kind of introduction is that? No smoke machine. [<i>Laughter</i>] No fire cannons. Obama didn't even tear up chunks of turf and rub them on his suit. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Player.</i> Man, that's rough. <p><i>The President. </i>That reminds me, by the way, please don't do that on the South Lawn. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to congratulate Coach John Harbaugh, an outstanding coach, and general manager, Ozzie Newsome, outstanding general manager. I know there's some very proud Ravens fans in the house today, including&mdash;you got the entire delegation from Maryland here, and they're a little puffed up. <p>I notice, though, I'm the only one wearing purple. [<i>Laughter</i>] Some of you guys didn't get the memo. <p>Now, I imagine there were times last year when these players were the only ones who knew that they'd make it here to show off this trophy. Because, during the year, they lost player after player to injury; they dropped four of their last five regular season games. In the playoffs, they trailed Denver by a touchdown with 70 yards and less than a minute to go. And I still don't know how, well&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. And then, in the Super Bowl, just when it looked like they had the momentum, the lights went out for a half hour. <p><i>Player.</i> They call you for that? <p><i>The President. </i>Yes. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But these Ravens always pulled through. In that playoff game against Broncos, Jacoby Jones&mdash;those are all fans of \\"Dancing with the Stars\\"&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;he slipped behind the defense to catch a Joe Flacco Hail Mary to force overtime. I'm trying to figure out whether he was doing the two-step or the fox trot. But somehow he got open and Joe got him the ball. <p>And then, in the Super Bowl, after the lights came back on and 49ers came storming back, this team's defense&mdash;the pride and joy of Baltimore&mdash;stopped a fierce offense four straight times inside the 10-yard line: one of the most dramatic goal line stands in Super Bowl history. <p>Joe was named the game's MVP. Where's Joe? <p><i>Player</i>. Easy Joe. Easy Joe. <p><i>The President</i>. There he is. Good timing with that contract up. [<i>Laughter</i>] That was some good timing. [<i>Laughter</i>] Capped off one of the greatest postseasons ever by a quarterback: more than 1,100 passing yards, 11 touchdowns, no interceptions. I don't know about you, Joe, but I would say that qualifies as elite. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I'd say that if you keep on playing like that, you're going to challenge Biden for the most popular person from Delaware. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>After the Super Bowl, Joe said: \\"The win was representative and symbolic of our city. We're a blue-collar city, and I know that we had to keep grinding it out.\\" <p>You see that same attitude, great pride but humility in Coach Harbaugh, a guy who responds to all the attention he got for coaching against his brother in the Super Bowl by saying, \\"This isn't exactly Churchill and Roosevelt, just a couple of football coaches coming together.\\" <p>You see that grit in team advisor O.J. Brigance, a former Raven whose courageous fight against ALS is an inspiration to Americans all across the country. <p>You see the resilience in players like Torrey Smith who lost his younger brother in a motorcycle accident the night before the game against the Patriots, but Torrey wanted to play, and he responded with 127 yards and two scores. So we're so proud of Torrey. <p>And then, of course, you can't think about Baltimore without thinking of Ray Lewis and Ed Reed, two of the greatest defenders who ever played the game. Now, these two won't be wearing purple next year. Everybody is going to have to get used to that. It's welcome news for quarterbacks. <p>Ray retired on top, coming back from a tricep injury, which, I believe, was caused by that dance he does. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Player.</i> You got to do that&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The President.</i> But&mdash;no, I'm not doing that dance. [<i>Laughter</i>] It caused him to miss most of the regular season. <p>Ed sprained ligaments in both of his knees during the Super Bowl, but he still made the game's only interception. And before he left Houston, where he'll be playing next year, Ed took out a full-page ad in the Baltimore Sun to thank Ravens fans, saying, \\"I have such deep love for all of you.\\" So that's a class act. Thank you. <p>I will point out, by the way, that Ed is getting some gray hair though. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm not the only one. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Former Safety Edward E. Reed, Jr.</i> No, not at all. <p><i>The President.</i> Huh? You're like an old man. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Mr. Reed.</i> You know what they'll do to you. <p><i>The President.</i> I'm telling you. That makes me feel better. [<i>Laughter</i>] I thought I was the only guy. No. All right. <p>Well, but that's the spirit of the entire team. Last year, this team donated more than $1 million to charitable causes. They helped young people get active through the Play 60 campaign. Over Thanksgiving, they Skyped with a Maryland National Guard unit stationed in Afghanistan. Later this month, Coach Harbaugh will host a youth football clinic that emphasizes player safety and proper tackling technique. <p>And today I'm proud to announce that the Ravens will be donating brand new uniforms for varsity football and girls' basketball teams at public schools all across Baltimore; that's a total of 42 teams. We're glad to have some high school athletes from Baltimore here to celebrate with us here today. <p>So this year, Baltimore won't just be seeing the Ravens on Sundays or Monday night or Thursday night. You'll see their impact in high schools under Friday night lights. And that's a testimony to the connection they feel to this city. <p>You'll see players spending their Tuesdays&mdash;normally, their only day off during the season&mdash;visiting hospitals and schools and senior centers, and day after day, you'll see a team that loves Baltimore as much as Baltimore loves the Ravens. So I want to thank all of you for the good work that you're doing. <p>Congratulations again on your Super Bowl Championship. Best of luck next season; you're going to need it in week 11 when you go to my hometown of Chicago to play the Bears. I brought some Chicago fans in here. Just so we weren't overwhelmed&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and keep things in proper perspective. But with that, I would like to have Ozzie Newsome and Coach Harbaugh come up and just say a few words, and then I'm going to get my spiffy jersey. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>At this point, General Manager Ozzie Newsome, Jr., and Head Coach John Harbaugh made brief remarks.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Fantastic. All right. Let's strike the podium here, and we'll get some pictures.\" "
"128" "\"<i>The President. </i>Hello, Mooresville! Hello, Mooresville. It is good to be back in North Carolina. Now, first of all, I want to thank my staff for being smart enough to schedule a visit right before school lets out. [<i>Laughter</i>] Because that means everybody is in a good mood. [<i>Laughter</i>] However, Principal Tulbert told me that if I wanted to visit, I had to follow school rules. And since we just recited the Pledge of Allegiance, let me say that \\"it's always a great day to be a Red Imp.\\" The&mdash;I gather some of you are going to be Blue Devils next year. I mean, being an Imp is okay, but I guess being a Devil&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>Now, I want to thank Maureen for the wonderful introduction, but more importantly, for the great work that she and all the staff at this school are doing. I could not be more impressed with the teachers and the administrators. So give it up for them. Students, clap for your teachers. You may not realize how lucky you are to have great, dedicated teachers, but as a parent, I realize how important that is. And so we can't thank them enough. <p>I want to make sure everybody knows that we've got one of the finest Secretaries of Education we've ever had in Arne Duncan, who's here. Your mayor, Miles Atkins, is in the house. And Superintendent Edwards is here, who's doing such great work. So give him a big round of applause. <p>So I want to thank you for inviting me here today. I know it's a little warm in here, as it always is in a school gym. But I was spending a lot of time talking to the students, and they were showing me such incredible work that I got kind of carried away. <p>I've come here to Mooresville to announce an important step that we're taking to grow our economy and to reignite the engine that powers our economy, and that's a rising and thriving middle class where everybody has opportunity. <p>Over the past 4&frac12; years, we have been fighting back from the worst recession since the Great Depression, which cost millions of Americans their jobs and their homes and the sense of security that they'd worked so hard to build. And North Carolina got hit worse than a lot of States. <p>But thanks to the grit and the determination of the American people, folks are starting to come back. Our businesses have created nearly 7 million new jobs over the past 38 months; 530 [530,000; White House correction.] of those jobs are new manufacturing jobs that help us sell goods made in America all around the world. We're producing more of our own energy. We're consuming less energy from other countries. The housing market and the stock markets are rebounding. Our deficit is shrinking. People's retirement savings are growing. The American auto industry has come roaring back. <p>So we're getting traction. The gears to the economy are turning. We're starting to make progress. But we've got to build on that progress. Because while the economy is growing, there's still a lot of families out there who feel like they're working harder and harder, but can't get ahead. And the middle class has to be prospering, not just folks at the very top. That's got to be our focus: a growing economy. We've got to have a growing economy that creates good, middle class jobs. That's got to be the north star that guides all of our efforts. <p>Now, what that means&mdash;I said this at my State of the Union Address&mdash;every day, we've got to ask ourselves three questions as a nation: Number one, how do we make America a magnet for good jobs? Number two, how do we make sure our workers, our people, have the skills and education they need to do those jobs? And then, number three, how do we make sure that those jobs pay well so that a hard work leads to a decent living? <p>But the reason I'm here today is because you are helping to answer that second question: How do we make sure Americans have the chance to earn the best skills and education possible? That's why I came to Mooresville. Because at a moment when the rest of the world is trying to outeducate us, we've got to make sure that our young people&mdash;all you guys&mdash;have every tool that you need to go as far as your talents and your dreams and your ambitions and your hard work will take you. All right? <p>So that's the spirit that's reflected in the motto of your school district: \\"Every Child, Every Day.\\" It's that fundamental belief that no matter who you are, no matter what you like&mdash;look like, no matter where you come from, every child can learn. Every child can succeed. Every child, every day, deserves that chance. We've got an obligation to give every young person that chance. <p>That means making sure we've got the best teachers and giving those teachers support and paying them what they deserve. [<i>Applause</i>] <p><i>Audience member. </i>Yes! <p><i>The President.</i> Right? Yes. All the teachers say, amen. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Amen! <p><i>The President.</i> Amen. It requires parents who are more active and involved. Parents, school is not a passive thing where you just dump off your kids, they come back, and somehow, automatically they learn. You've got to be involved in the education process. It requires smarter schools that are safer places to learn. And in an age when the world's information is a just click away, it demands that we bring our schools and libraries into the 21st century. We can't be stuck in the 19th century when we're living in a 21st-century economy. <p>And that's why today we're going to take a new step to make sure that virtually every child in America's classrooms has access to the fastest Internet and the most cutting-edge learning tools. And that step will better prepare our children for the jobs and challenges of the future, and it will provide them a surer path into the middle class. And as a consequence, it will mean a stronger, more secure economy for all of us. <p>Specifically, today I am directing the Federal Communications Commission&mdash;which is the FCC&mdash;to begin a process that will connect 99 percent of America's students to high-speed broadband Internet within 5 years. Within 5 years, we're going to get it done. [<i>Applause</i>] Within 5 years. <p>Now, those of you here at Mooresville understand why this is important, but I'm speaking to a larger audience, so I want to explain why this is important. Today, the average American school has about the same bandwidth as the average American home, even though obviously, there are 200 times as many people at school as there are at home. Only around 20 percent of our students have access to true high-speed Internet in their classroom. By comparison, South Korea has 100 percent of its kids with high-speed Internet. We've got 20 percent; South Korea 100 percent. In countries where we&mdash;in a country where we expect free Wi-Fi with our coffee, why shouldn't we have it in our schools? Right? Why wouldn't we have it available for our children's education? <p>So the good news is, here in Mooresville, you've committed yourself to this cause. Starting in the third grade, as all of you know because you've lived through it, every student in the district gets a laptop and high-speed, wireless Internet in the classroom. <p>And I just saw the ways that it's changing how you learn. You don't just write papers and take tests. You're working together on videos and presentations and movies and poetry. Your high school Spanish class might Skype with students in Barcelona or Buenos Aires. One student proudly said, \\"We're able to work on more projects and homework outside of class.\\" Now, that's not normally something teenagers brag about. [<i>Laughter</i>] But that's exactly the attitude that's going to help you succeed and help your country succeed. <p>And as I was learning in talking to some of the teachers here, it's helping the teachers too, because if a student is falling behind, a teacher is seeing it in real time. <p>Somebody fall down? One thing you guys got to do, by the way, bend your knees a little bit when you're standing. If you stand up straight&mdash;yes. I'm just giving you a tip so you don't faint&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;which happens all the time, and it's really embarrassing. [<i>Laughter</i>] But if you already did, you should sit down. <p>But it gives teachers the ability to see in real time what students need help, who's falling behind, and then offer extra help. If you've already mastered a lesson, you can move on to the next one. So as one teacher said, \\"The thing I'm most proud of is not the technology, it's the relationships I can build with the students that I teach.\\" <p>Now, here at this school, this has only been going on for a few years. But so far, the results have been remarkable. Graduation rates are up. Last year, out of 115 school districts in North Carolina, you ranked in the bottom 10 in the amount of money you spend per student, but you ranked number 2 in student achievement. All right? [<i>Applause</i>] Number two. So you're spending less money getting better outcomes. And around the country, educators have started to take notice. So many people want to see this school for themselves that there's a waiting list for tours all the way into 2014. <p>But here's the thing: As special as what you've done is, I don't want this success to be restricted to one school or one school district. There is no reason why we can't replicate the success you've found here. And imagine what that will mean for our country. <p>Imagine a young girl growing up on a farm in a rural area who can now take an AP biology or AP physics class, even if her school is too small to offer it. Imagine a young boy with a chronic illness that means he can't go to school, but now he can join his classmates via Skype or FaceTime and fully participate in what's going on. <p>Imagine educators spending fewer hours teaching to a test, more time helping kids learn in new and innovative ways. Imagine more businesses starting here and hiring here in this area, in North Carolina, because they know for a fact that we've committed ourselves to equipping all of our kids with better skills and education than any place else on Earth. That's what we need. <p>So, over the next 5 years, we're going to partner with private companies to put people to work laying fiber optic cables to our schools and setting up wireless connections in our schools with speeds 10 to 100 times faster than what most schools have today. We're going to work with States to give teachers who want to use these technologies in the classroom the professional development that they need, because I was talking to Ms. Tulbert, she said, for all the teachers here, it took some adaptation to get used to these new technologies. <p>Once all these classrooms are wired for superfast Internet, that means a big new market for private innovation&mdash;America's companies who created the computers and smartphones and tablets that we all use&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> It's okay. It'll be&mdash;this happens. They'll be all right. Just give them a little space. That's why we've got the medics here. They'll be okay. <p>Oh, teachers give me some tips here. I've lost their attention. [<i>Laughter</i>] All right, everybody. Right over here. <p>So what we're going to be able to do is to get companies to compete to create affordable digital devices designed specifically to these new connected classrooms. I want to see a tablet that's the same price as a textbook. I want to see more apps that can be instantly updated with academic content the day it's available, so you don't have old, outdated textbooks with student names still in them from years ago. These are the tools that our children deserve. <p>And there's no reason why we can't do all this. If you think about the history of America, we united a continent by rail. We stretched a network of highways from sea to shining sea. We brought light to dark and remote areas. We connected the world through the Internet, through our imagination. All these projects created jobs. All these projects grew our economy. They also unified the country, and they are unifying the world. And this project we're talking about today can do the same thing. I am determined to see it through on behalf of our kids. <p>And for those of you who follow politics in Washington, here's the best news: None of this requires an act of Congress. We can and we will get started right away. Yes, we can. Now, look, there are all kinds of things I do need Congress to do, and I want to work with them everywhere I can. But where we've got an opportunity to just go ahead and do something that's going to help our young people, help our teachers, help our education system, help this economy, help our middle class, help to create jobs, we've just got to go ahead and do it. This is something we have to do for the sake of our kids and our future. <p>But there are other things that I'm going to be working with Congress to do that will improve our education system on behalf of our kids and our future. Because if we can bring our kids and our schools into the digital age, you can't tell me we can't start improving our early childhood education system and making high-quality preschool available to every child in America. You can't tell me that we can't find the wherewithal to hire even more good teachers in science and math and technology and engineering. You can't tell me that we can't rethink and redesign our high schools or partner with colleges and businesses to put our young people on the path of jobs, not just today's jobs, but tomorrow's jobs. <p>We can make sure that middle class families aren't priced out of a college education. We can make sure that interest rates on Federal student loans don't double for students and parents at the end of this month. I want to work with Democrats and Republicans to keep those rates low. <p>How many students here expect to go to college? I expect all of them to raise their hand. And so we've got to make sure that college is affordable for every young person, and that's going to require some help from Congress. <p>But we have to give every child, every day, the shot of&mdash;at success that they deserve. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Yes! <p><i>The President. </i>Every day. FDR once said, \\"We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.\\" And as long as I'm President, I'm going to keep fighting with everything I've got to build a better future for our young people and to give them a chance to build their own future. That's how we're going to strengthen our middle class. That's how we'll secure America's future for generations to come. That's what I'm going to fight for as President of the United States. That's why I'm so proud of all of you here at Mooresville. <p>Congratulations, everybody. Have a great summer. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"129" "\"Thank you, everybody! It is good to be back in California, especially when the weather is this good. [<i>Laughter</i>] And obviously, I want to first of all thank Mike and Marci and their two beautiful daughters and mom and uncles and aunt&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and everybody who helped to participate. <p>And I also want to just acknowledge somebody who I think is one of the finest public servants we've got in Washington and was somebody who worked in the private sector, then took on an incredible job of running the public schools in Denver, helped to turn them around, is now representing the great State of Colorado and is a great friend: Michael Bennet. So give Michael a big round of applause. <p>Somebody was asking where I was earlier today and asking whether I got to sleep in between, and the answer is no, because, unfortunately, Air Force One is pretty loaded up. You can make phone calls, you can read e-mails, you can look at computers, so you don't rest on plane trips. <p>But earlier this morning, I had a chance to visit a school in Mooresville, North Carolina, and the reason we were there is because they've undergone this amazing transformation. Several years ago, their superintendant made a decision that he was just going to get rid of textbooks. They were hugely expensive. Oftentimes, they were on a 7-year cycle so that kids were looking and there was still a map of the Soviet Union in there in their social studies class. [<i>Laughter</i>] And he made this radical decision that he was going to replace every textbook with a laptop for every student in the school, starting in third grade. And as a consequence of not just the technology, but training teachers to think entirely differently about curriculum and teaching, what they've done is, despite the fact that they&mdash;out of 115 districts, I think it is&mdash;they are 110th in spending per district, they now rank number 2 in performance. <p>The kids are unbelievably enthusiastic. And they showed me a whole range of things. One group of math students had started a business on their laptops&mdash;and this was for math class&mdash;and they were calculating their profits and their break-even point and when they go from red to black. It was an M&Ms machine, not surprisingly. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Another group of kids were dissecting the Inaugural Address that had been done in my first&mdash;or the Inaugural poem that had been delivered at my first Inauguration by Elizabeth Alexander, but they were able to do it on the screen, make notes on the screen that were automatically transmitted onto all the laptops of the school. And you could see these kids just excited about learning and wanting to keep learning well after the school day was done. <p>And so what we announced was our initiative that we're going to make sure, in 5 years, every school across America has the highest speed, most state-of-the-art connections so that every classroom is wired and every student can take advantage of these technologies. And one of the great things about it is in order to do this, we don't need a vote from Congress, which means that we actually, I think, will be able to get it done on time. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But I tell this story because all around the country, in places like Austin and in North Carolina and here, obviously, in California, there are incredible things going on. And we've now gone through some of the toughest years economically that this country has ever gone through, and yet, after the worst recession since the Great Depression, we're now seeing the economy slowly regain steam. Not just the stock market, which has been hitting record highs, but housing is beginning to bounce back. We've now seen growth for 3&frac12; years straight, jobs being created just about every month, and the auto industry come roaring back, the financial system stabilizing. <p>The truth of the matter is, is that because of the grit and determination of the American people, we've got all the cards we need in order to make sure that the 21st century is the American century, just like the 20th. The only thing that's holding us back is our capacity to work together around a commonsense set of solutions. Whether it's in education, whether it's on clean energy, whether it's on spurring more technology and entrepreneurship that obviously this part of the country represents and has captured the imagination of the entire world, whether we're talking about how we deal with our infrastructure, how we make sure that our fiscal policies are in line so that we're not passing on debt to the next generation, but we're also making sure that we meet our commitments to current generations when it comes to things like Social Security and Medicare, on all of these issues, there is a range of commonsense solutions available to us right now. And if we implement them, then we're going to leave an America behind for our kids that&mdash;and our grandkids&mdash;that is stronger, more prosperous, more unified, more tolerant than ever before. <p>And so the reason I'm here today is to deliver the good news that we've got what we need in order to succeed. Now, I've got to leaven that with a little bad news. The bad news is that too often, Washington is getting in our way of this progress. And the reason it's getting in our way is not because, as some suggest, Government has no role to play in this process; Government has always had a role to play. <p>I come from Illinois, the great Land of Lincoln. And in the midst of civil war, Abraham Lincoln starts the land-grant colleges, helps to create the intercontinental railroad system that links our country together, starts the National Institute of Science, understanding that there are certain investments we can only make together; that although our economy is driven by entrepreneurship and risk-taking and the private sector&mdash;the greatest engine of prosperity the world has ever known&mdash;there are some things we do better together. <p>And people in this area understand that as well as anybody. The incredible prosperity that is generated from Silicon Valley in part is because we collectively&mdash;or at least our parents or our grandparents&mdash;made investments in things like DARPA and basic research and science and helped to facilitate the framework that created the worldwide web and all the spinoffs that came out of that. <p>Oftentimes, the private sector cannot or will not make those investments because they don't automatically show a profit right away, because they may be too expensive for any single enterprise to invest in. But that's what then provides us the platform to do the incredible things that we do. <p>So the reason that Washington is a problem is not because Government generically is the problem, the reason Washington is a problem is right now it's broken. It's not working the way it needs to. And look, historically, I am a strong Democrat because I believe in the basic principle that everybody should have a chance. Everybody should have opportunity; it doesn't matter where they're born, what their last name is, what circumstances they started in, who they love. I want everybody to have a fair shot. But I'm the first one to admit Democrats don't have a monopoly on wisdom. I will say, though, right now&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;when it comes to doing the things that need to get done, we're just not getting a lot of cooperation from the other side. We're just not getting a lot of cooperation from the other side. <p>And I remain hopeful&mdash;because I've run my last campaign&mdash;that over the next 3 years, we're going to see more of the bipartisan efforts that we're seeing in some areas. For example, Michael Bennet is doing a great job working with the so-called Gang of Eight to finally get immigration reform done so that we're a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants and we are fixing a broken immigration system. So there are areas where we're starting to see glimmers of functionality in Washington. <p>But on too many area, we're not getting the kind of cooperation that we need, not because the Democrats are particularly ideological or left wing right now. The truth of the matter is, Michael and I&mdash;I know that there are a few Republicans here in the audience&mdash;if you talk to us, it turns out we're pretty commonsense folks. We don't think Government can do everything. We don't think that top-down solutions are the right way to go. We believe in the free market. We believe in a light touch when it comes to regulations. We don't want to tax all businesses out of business. But we do think that there's a role to play for Government. <p>When it comes to, for example, making sure that every child in America has early childhood education so they're getting a healthy start and by the time they hit school they're prepared to learn, that's an investment we can make. <p>When it comes to making sure a nation this wealthy provides affordable, accessible health care for every American, that's something we can do. There's no other advanced nation on Earth where 10, 15 percent of the population doesn't have health care. None. Well, why should we be any different as the greatest nation on Earth? And Government has a role to play to make that happen. <p>We have to make sure that we keep our edge when it comes to research and development. This so-called sequester that has stayed in place&mdash;in part because of the stubbornness of the other side in negotiating a sensible budget framework&mdash;is freezing up research precisely at a time when it's never been more important. And you got brilliant young people all across the country, including in this area, who may not have the capacity to go into their chosen fields because the research grants have dried up. We have a role to play. <p>When it comes to what I think will be one of the most important decisions that we make as a nation&mdash;this generation makes&mdash;the issue of climate change, we're not going to be able to make those changes solely through a bunch of individual decisions that are made. We're going to have to make some collective decisions about how much do we care about this when the science is irrefutable. And that means Government is going to have a role to play in helping to organize clean energy research and making sure that we're taking into account the pollution that we're sending into the air and that we're encouraging new ways of delivering energy and using it more efficiently. We're going to have a role to play. <p>And obviously, our Government is going to have a role to play internationally, whether it's in making sure that we're keeping the American people safe or trying to make sure that we're delivering prosperity and hope to the parts of the world where people, religious minorities, young girls still don't have opportunity. Those are all things that we have to do together. <p>So here's the bottom line: I have never been more optimistic about America than I am right now. People sometimes ask me this. They notice my gray hair, and they say, boy&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;you've got a really hard job, and how do you put up with all the stuff that's going on all the time and everything that's said about you and this and that and the other? And I try to remind folks that in so many ways, this is the greatest time in human history. For all the tragedies that we witness, for all the terrible things that we read about, for all the millions of people here in America who are still locked out of opportunity and the struggles that middle class families are going through every single day, all the people who are still unemployed, folks whose houses are still underwater, the fact of the matter is, is that we're more inclusive, we're more prosperous, we are less violent now than just about any time in human history. And that should give us hope. <p>And when we see these beautiful kids running around, I suspect they will further improve on our&mdash;on this project. But we've got to get this right. And the only way I'm going to be able to do that is if I've got people in Congress who share my optimism and share a sense that there are practical solutions out there and that compromise is not a dirty word. That's the kind of senator that Michael Bennet represents, and that's what we're going to need in the United States Senate. And I haven't even started talking about things like judicial nominations, which obviously are contingent on us maintaining a strong Democratic majority in the United States Senate. <p>So I would just ask all of you, number one, to be optimistic. Number two, I'd ask you all to stay engaged. Number three, I'd ask you to really focus on what you can do in order to ensure that the very best people who care deeply about this country, but also have a practical bent: how do we get those folks in the Senate, staying in the Senate, working cooperatively. Because ultimately, our Government represents us, and if we neglect it, then it doesn't work. And when we're engaged, it works. <p>You showed that in 2008; that's how I got elected. You showed that in 2012; that's how I got reelected. I need you to show that one more time to make sure that we have a Democratic Senate, and having a Democratic House wouldn't be bad either. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"130" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you, everybody. Well, first of all, I want to thank Vinod and Neeru and the entire family and these beasts&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;for hosting us here today. These two could eat Bo in one gulp. [<i>Laughter</i>] But it's wonderful to be here in this spectacular setting on such a beautiful day in Northern California, one of my favorite places. <p>There are a couple other people I want to acknowledge. First of all, we've got three of the finest Senators in the country who are here with us today. The person who has the thankless, but absolutely critical job of maintaining the Democratic majority in the Senate, Michael Bennet from Colorado is here. We've got my fellow Midwesterner, who is doing wonderful work on a whole range of issues, Amy Klobuchar from Minnesota. Where's Maria? There she is. And from the closest thing to being your neighbor and somebody who obviously knows the extraordinary capacity, ingenuity, and entrepreneurship because she's been in the field herself and does great work in the Senate every day: Maria Cantwell. <p>We're going to have some time for questions and, hopefully, some answers in this great setting, so I'm going to be fairly brief. I was telling Vinod that this morning, I was in North Carolina at Mooresville Middle School. And Mooresville Middle School ranks 110th out of 115 districts in North Carolina when it comes to spending per pupil. They now rank second in performance in North Carolina. And the reason is, is because they have this incredible superintendent who, several years ago, made what many considered a pretty radical decision. He said: \\"We're just going to eliminate textbooks. We're going to use the money to buy a laptop for every student and we are going to completely redesign our curriculum and how we engage our young people, and we're going to train our teachers so that we completely transform the learning experience in this middle school.\\" <p>Actually, it starts in third grade and continues all the way through 12th, but I went to the middle school. And so I had a chance to go from station to station: kids who were creating their own films and poetry based on a book that they had read in English class; kids who were designing their own business plans in math class, figuring out when they'd go from red to black; young people who were debating the merits of studying mythology, using research that had been done entirely online. <p>And what they've discovered is, is that the passion that young people now have for learning because of the&mdash;since the ownership that they've got, because of the sense that instead of just sitting there passively with somebody at the front of the classroom, they are fully engaged in this constant creative exchange with each other and their teachers. Because of that, the school has transformed itself. <p>And so we were down there to announce our goal, which is that in 5 years, every school in America will be sufficiently equipped with broadband and wireless so that you've got 100 percent coverage&mdash;or 99 percent coverage. This is something, it turns out, we can do without Congress. We're going to meet this deadline, and it has the potential to be transformational in our education system and save money in the process. <p>And I say that because, not only am I in Silicon Valley and around the world this is rightly viewed as the center of innovation, but also because so many of you who I've gotten to know over the years are yourselves innovators and entrepreneurs who have transformed the world because of the work that you've done. <p>The central question for America now is, how do we engage the entire country in a conversation about using this incredible advantage we've got of openness and inquiry and discovery, how do we use that to make ourselves more competitive? And how do we make sure that every single person in America has access to the platforms and the frameworks that they need so that if they're willing to work hard, they can succeed as well, the way Vinod succeeded, the way Mark succeeded, the way Steve succeeded, the way all of us in this room&mdash;so many of us who started with not too much&mdash;have been able to live out that American Dream. <p>Now, the good news is that after an extraordinary economic crisis, the economy has stabilized. We're growing; housing is coming back; deficits are going down; auto industry has recovered; we're creating jobs. And as I travel around the world, it turns out, actually, we've got probably the best cards out of any country. I know everybody worries about China&mdash;I'm going to be meeting with the President of China on&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> Tomorrow. <p><i>The President. </i>&mdash;&mdash;tomorrow, on Friday. Tomorrow, right. [<i>Laughter</i>] And the transformation that's taking place in China is extraordinary. And never in the history of humanity have we seen so many people move out of poverty so rapidly, in part because of what's happening in China and what's happening in India. And yet, when you look at the challenges they face and you look at the challenges we face, I'll take our challenges any day of the week. <p>In order for us to meet those challenges, though, we've got to have a functioning Government. This is not an argument that Government can do it all. It's an argument that Government has a critical role to play in funding science and research, in creating the infrastructure, not only the old infrastructure of roads and bridges and ports, but the new infrastructure of smart grids and broadband. Government has a role in educating our kids, to make sure that they've got the skills they need to compete. Government has a role in creating a regulatory structure that ensures that we're encouraging the development of clean energy and that we're protecting intellectual property. <p>Government has a role in all these things. And if we're able to get that part of it right, nobody can stop us. Because the innovation that's taking place in places like Silicon Valley, they'll move it, but we've got to make sure that what happens here is happening in a small town in Ohio and in rural parts of North Carolina; that we're not creating two societies&mdash;one that's hypercompetitive and innovative and extraordinarily prosperous and then another half in which folks are struggling just barely to get by and are having a tough time competing&mdash;but rather a situation in which all of us have a chance of success. <p>That's what we're fighting for. And from my perspective, that's what it means to be a Democrat. And I think that I speak for Maria and Amy and Mike as well; that's what leads us to believe in this democratic ideal. <p>So in order for us to accomplish that we're going to need to have a Democratic Senate. In order for us to accomplish that, I'd also like a Democratic House. Not because Democrats have a monopoly on wisdom and not because I'm more interested in politics than governance, because I've run my last election. I just want to get stuff done. And I'm going to be spending the next 3&frac12; years, every day, reaching out to Republicans and seeing where we can agree. <p>Michael Bennet is doing some great work on immigration reform. I think we have a great chance of getting that done this year. We recently announced the need to pull together a bipartisan effort around dealing with patent trolls, something that everybody here is deeply interested in. We have a chance of getting that done. <p>But on too much of the big stuff, what we see coming out of the other party is an interest in winning elections or in obstruction, not enough interest in solving problems. And too often, what we see is the notion that compromise is a dirty word. And sometimes, we see just the denial of science around climate change, for example. And in that environment, it's going to be hard for us to make progress on things that all of us here care so deeply about. <p>So I'll just leave you with this thought. For all the frustrations of Washington, though, I've never been more optimistic about this country, because of those kids I saw in Mooresville, because of the businesses that I see popping up every single day here in Silicon Valley. We've got what it takes to make sure the 21st century is the American century, just like the 20th, and that impact ripples around the world. <p>But I'm going to need your help to make it happen. Michael, Amy, Maria, we're all going to need your help to make that happen. And if you're willing to engage and be involved and stay committed as deeply as you were in 2008 and 2012, then I think we'll be successful. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.\" "
"131" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Oh, we're okay, guys. Sit down. Thank you. Thank you. <p>Well, to Peter and Meg, I just want to thank them so much. Not only have they been longtime supporters, back when a lot of people couldn't pronounce my name&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but more importantly, they have supported so many good causes, most recently Meg's unbelievable work on education here in Los Angeles. We truly appreciate it. They are not only great friends, but they're great citizens. And for them to open up their home like this we very much appreciate. So give them a big round of applause. <p>As has already been mentioned, we've got your current mayor, who has been able to overcome his natural reticence, his shyness&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;to somehow become one of the finest leaders that we have in this country. We could not be prouder of his tenure, Mayor Villaraigosa. We're grateful for him. <p>Eric Garcetti and I rode over here together, and we were reminded that the last time I think I was in this neighborhood, I was riding with Eric Garcetti&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;who at the time, I was still a candidate for President and Eric was doing great work on the city council and one of my earliest supporters. And to see him now have the opportunity to take on all the enormous challenges, but also realize the unbelievable potential of this great city is just really encouraging. So I'm looking for great things out of Eric Garcetti. We're really proud of him. <p>And I don't remember whether she was in the car or not, but I know she was part of that same team back when we were running, and since that time, she has been elected to Congress, and she is doing great work day in and day out fighting on behalf of working families. So I could not be more grateful for her friendship; Karen Bass is here as well. <p>Now, Peter gave a pretty exhaustive summary of what we need to do and what we've done, and I'm not sure I've got a lot to add. [<i>Laughter</i>] And yet I feel obligated to&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;since you guys wrote these big checks to the DNC&mdash;to say something. [<i>Laughter</i>] So let me give it a shot. What I'll do is I'll tell&mdash;I'll start with a story of what I did yesterday. <p>Yesterday morning&mdash;because I know there are a lot of folks here who are interested in education. Yesterday morning I visited a town, Mooresville, North Carolina. And the reason we went down there was because Mooresville ranks 110th, I think, out of 115 school districts in North Carolina when it comes to funding, and yet, in terms of student performance, they rank number 2. <p>And the reason is, is that the superintendent&mdash;and your superintendent, I know, is probably familiar with some of what's happened there. The superintendent there made a radical decision to replace all textbooks with laptops. They just stopped buying textbooks. The theory was, is that textbooks were only being renewed every 7 years. By the time you got it, some third-grader is looking at geography, and the Soviet Union is still around&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and it's out of date. And so he said we're just going to move to laptops. We're going to entirely reshape our teacher training process so that they understand how to interact with young people in this new medium. <p>And so I went from station to station, meeting kids who, in math class, were starting their own businesses on their laptops and tracking profits and losses and inputs and outputs and marketing. In English class, a group was evaluating the Inauguration poem that was read in my first Inauguration, except one of the students was leading the class, writing notes on a board that was automatically transmitted onto the laptops of every student in the class. You had students who said&mdash;who bragged about the fact that, we keep on learning even after school is finished, which is not what normally teenagers brag about. <p>And you have this distillation of what I see as I travel all across the country, which is incredible people, remarkable youth, energy, dynamism, creativity, enthusiasm, optimism about the country. And sometimes, when people ask me, how do you manage through all the crises and so on that you have to deal with every day, I tell them stories like that because it reminds me, as Peter and I were talking about before we walked out, sometimes, we do not fully appreciate what a good hand we've been dealt here in this country. <p>We have so much going for us, starting with our people. We have a sense of energy and dynamism and creativity that is not matched anywhere in the world. We have a system that is open and creative and disruptive, that when it's operating at its best, gives every single person the chance, if they work hard and they've got a new idea, to achieve their dreams. <p>When you look at our position in the world, we have been blessed with incredible natural resources. We have an unparalleled university system. We've got the best researchers, the best scientists. We've got incredibly hard workers and an incredibly hard work ethic. And when you add all this up, there's absolutely no reason why the 21st century shouldn't be the American century just like the 20th century. <p>The one place where we're challenged is not on a particular issue, it's the fact that over the last several years, we've got a Federal Government that has been gridlocked and a political culture that makes it difficult for us to make common cause and make commonsense, smart decisions that would serve those kids that I saw yesterday well. <p>And that's the reason you're here. That's the reason I ran in 2008. That's the reason I ran in 2012. That's the reason Antonio has been fighting the good fight and Eric is about to take up the challenge and Karen slugs it out in Congress, is because we're interested in changing a political culture in which the focus is on how do we score political points, and instead we focus on how do we get things done on behalf of the next generation. And if we get that right, we cannot be stopped. <p>On every issue that Peter mentioned, there are solutions that we know can work. You care about education? We have models of schools where kids from the poorest backgrounds, if they're getting early childhood education, if they're getting high-quality teachers, they're going to succeed. They can overcome&mdash;they are so resilient, that can overcome stuff that most of us can't even imagine. <p>You care about climate change? We've doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars and trucks. We have doubled the production of clean energy. We have actually reduced carbon emissions down to 1994 levels, and the entire economy has become more energy efficient. And if we just take a few steps that don't require any reduction in growth or diminution in our standard of living, we can make real progress, and we can lead the world. We know what we need to do. <p>If you care about jobs and the economy, manufacturing has come roaring back. We've created over half a million new manufacturing jobs at a time when people said, there's no way for manufacturing to succeed in this country. It turns out, actually, that folks are insourcing; they're bringing jobs back here to the United States because of low energy costs, because we've got incredibly productive workers, and we remain a massive market. And if we change our Tax Code, for example, to incentivize manufacturing here in the United States, there's no reason that can't continue. <p>When it comes to fiscal issues, you'll recall that we had this big debate as recently as 6 months ago about the deficit and the crisis and disaster. Well, it turns out we've actually reduced the deficit now at the fastest pace since World War II. By 2015, the deficit is projected to be 2.1 percent of GDP. It was 10 percent when I came into office. <p>And if we had just made some sensible decisions with respect to our health care programs and with respect to our Tax Code, the truth of the matter is, is that we can make every investment that we need to make to ensure long-term growth and ensure fiscal stability for generations. We don't have to make the kinds of adjustments that you're seeing Europe have to make. We don't have to radically transform our economy in ways that the Chinese are going to have to make decisions about over the never several years, because the basic framework that we've got is sound. We just have to buck up and make some sensible decisions. <p>So there is not a single issue out there where I look at it and I say we can't make progress. And by the way, there's not a single issue out there in which I say what's needed is some deeply ideological, top-down approach. There are a bunch of sensible, commonsense, centrist approaches that would do just fine. <p>So that's all by way of saying that the reason we're here today is we got to figure out how we change that political culture. Now, I've run my last campaign. I have a friend Ab Mikva, in Chicago, a former Congressman, Federal judge, White House Counsel. Ab came from the same neighborhood in Hyde Park where I live. And Ab used to say that being friends with a politician is like perpetually having a kid in college. [<i>Laughter</i>] They just&mdash;every so often, you got to write this big check. And you're trying to figure out, where is this money going. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, the good news is, I'm about to graduate. [<i>Laughter</i>] So&mdash;I can't say the same for the rest of these elected officials here, but I've run my last campaign. So all I care about right now is governance and getting things right so that I can look back at this time where I had this incredible privilege of leading this country and say the country is better because of my tenure. That's all I care about, which means that for the next 3 years, every single time I've got an opportunity to do some work with Republicans and they're game to do something sensible, I'm ready to do it. <p>So, for example, we have seen some hopeful signs that we can get finally a broken immigration reform system fixed, and I intend to get that done before the end of the summer. And for us to be able to accomplish that, we've got to have Republicans who are willing to take what, for them, are some difficult votes and some tough stands. And we've seen some good leadership from people like John McCain and Jeff Flake, but also from folks like Marco Rubio. <p>And every time I see that opportunity to work with Republicans, I will seize it. And my hope is, is that on things like early childhood education and rebuilding America's infrastructure that traditionally have not been ideological issues that I can get some cooperation out of them. <p>But I have to say that right now the nature of the Republican Party makes it very difficult for them to engage in commonsense discussions around solving problems. And all of you see it. I don't have to spell it out for you. But within their ranks there is a tendency to believe that compromise is a dirty word and that government is something to be torn down, as opposed to something to be embraced as a facilitator for the private sector and ordinary citizens to be able to achieve their dreams. <p>And so what that means is, is that I will get a lot more done with a Democratic House, and I sure need to keep a Democratic Senate. <p>And there shouldn't be any contradiction for people to recognize that wherever I can get cooperation from Republicans, I want cooperation, regardless of the politics. If I've got a bunch of Republicans who just for purely political reasons, decide we've got to get right with immigration communities and so we're going to pass immigration reform, I'm not concerned about their motives&mdash;although, I think the folks who so far have stood up are deeply sincere about what needs to be done&mdash;but even if it's political calculation, I'm game. <p>But what I also know is that deep down, there are some contradictions right now in the Republican Party that makes it hard for them to do what needs to get done in this country. And that's why I'm going to be fighting as hard as I can to make sure that we send to Congress people who share my values and share a sense of America's promise and understand that America's promise is based entirely on the notion that everybody gets a fair shot, regardless of where they came from, what they look like, what their last name is, who they love. <p>And then, those kids that I saw in Mooresville, there are kids just as gifted, just as talented, just as promising in East L.A. or in South Side of Chicago or in some rural community in Arkansas, and that we've got to be working for all those kids. That's what, for me, it means to be a Democrat. And I think that's what it means for a lot of you as well. <p>So I want to thank you for your efforts. I appreciate what Peter said about donor fatigue. On the other hand, we don't have time to be fatigued, because we've got too much to do. And everybody here has been blessed in ways that require us to give something back. Everybody here has got a story to tell, but the truth of the matter is we're here in part because we were lucky enough to be born in a country where if we worked hard and we had a big dream, we could make it happen. <p>We were lucky. And we've got an obligation then to make sure that folks coming behind us are blessed with that same good luck. And it's within our capacity. So we don't have time to be tired and we don't have excuses. We know what needs to be done. I intend to make sure that it gets done. And I'm going to need your help. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.\" "
"132" "\"Hi, everybody. In the next few days, America will take an important step towards fixing our broken immigration system. The entire United States Senate will begin debating a commonsense immigration reform bill that has bipartisan support. <p>We define ourselves as a nation of immigrants. The promise we find in those who come from every corner of the globe has always been one of our greatest strengths. It's kept our workforce vibrant and dynamic, it's kept our businesses on the cutting edge, and it's helped build the greatest economic engine the world has ever known. But for years, our out-of-date immigration system has actually harmed our economy and threatened our security. <p>Now, over the past 4 years, we've taken steps to try to patch up some of the worst cracks in the system. We strengthened security on the southern border by putting more boots on the ground than at any time in our history. And in part by using technology more effectively, today, illegal crossings are near their lowest level in decades. We focused enforcement efforts on criminals who are here illegally&mdash;who endanger our communities&mdash;and today, we deport more criminals than ever before. <p>And we took up the cause of \\"dreamers,\\" the young people who were brought to this country as children. We said that if they're able to meet certain criteria, we'd consider offering them the chance to come out of the shadows so they can continue to work here and study here and contribute to our communities legally. <p>But if we're going to truly fix a broken system, we need Congress to act in a comprehensive way. And that's why what's happening next week is so important. Now, the bill before the Senate isn't perfect; it's a compromise. Nobody will get everything they want: not Democrats, not Republicans, not me. But it is a bill that's largely consistent with the principles I've repeatedly laid out for commonsense immigration reform. <p>This bill would continue to strengthen security at our borders, increase criminal penalties against smugglers and traffickers, and hold employers more accountable if they knowingly hire undocumented workers. If enacted, it would represent the most ambitious enforcement plan in recent memory. <p>This bill would provide a pathway to earned citizenship for the 11 million individuals who are already in this country illegally, a pathway that includes passing a background check, learning English, paying taxes and a penalty, and then going to the back of the line, behind everyone who's playing by the rules and trying to come here legally. <p>This bill would modernize the legal immigration system so that, alongside training American workers for the jobs of tomorrow, we're also attracting highly skilled entrepreneurs and engineers who will grow our economy, and so that our people don't have to wait years before their loved ones are able to join them in this country that we love. <p>That's what immigration reform looks like&mdash;smarter enforcement, a pathway to earn citizenship, improvements to the legal immigration system. They're all commonsense steps. They've got broad support from Republicans and Democrats, CEOs and labor leaders, law enforcement and clergy. So there is no reason that Congress can't work together to send a bill to my desk by the end of the summer. <p>We know the opponents of reform are going to do everything they can to prevent that. They'll try to stoke fear and create division. They'll try to play politics with an issue that the vast majority of Americans want addressed. And if they succeed, we will lose this chance to finally fix an immigration system that is badly broken. <p>So if you agree that now is the time for commonsense reform, reach out to your representatives. Tell them we have to get this done so that everyone is playing by the same rules. Tell them we have the power to do this in a way that lives up to our traditions as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. <p>In the end, that's what this is all about. Men and women who want nothing more than the chance to earn their way into the American story, just like so many of our ancestors did. Throughout our history, that has only made us stronger. And it's how we'll make sure that America's best days always lie ahead. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"133" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thanks so much, everybody. Everybody have a seat. Well, welcome to the White House. It is wonderful to see all of you. Thank you, Joe, for that kind introduction. Thank you, Valerie, for the great leadership you've shown on this. And to all of you&mdash;business leaders and advocates, Members of Congress who are here, members of my administration&mdash;I am so glad that all of you could be here to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Equal Pay Act. <p>Now, when you think about it, we're not just celebrating a law, we're honoring the heroes who made that law possible, the fierce determination of Americans who saw a wrong and worked to right it. There were women who were sick and tired of being sick and tired&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;of seeing the same jobs advertised with different pay scales; women who were tired of being treated like second-class workers; women like Dorothy Height and Congresswoman Edna Kelly and Esther Peterson, all who pushed to make the Equal Pay Act a reality. And today we recognize the work of those brave women. But until equal pay truly is a reality, we're also here to recommit ourselves to the work that remains to be done. <p>Fifty years ago today, President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act into law, right here in the White House. He said it was basic to our democracy. It's the idea that all of us are created equal. And as I said in my Inaugural Address this year, our journey to equality is not complete until our wives, our mothers, our daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts. <p>The day that the bill was signed into law, women earned 30&mdash;59 cents for every dollar a man earned, on average. Today, it's about 77 cents. So it was 59, and now it's 77 cents. It's even less, by the way, if you're an African American or a Latina. So I guess that's progress, but does anybody here think that's good enough? <p><i>Audience members.</i> No! <p><i>The President.</i> I assume everybody thinks we can do better. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes! <p><i>Audience member.</i> We can. <p><i>The President.</i> Yes, we can. [<i>Laughter</i>]&mdash;so&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. That's right. <p>Over the course of her career, a working woman with a college degree will earn, on average, hundreds of thousands of dollars less than a man who does the same work. Now, that's wrong. I don't want that for Malia and Sasha. I don't want that for your daughters. I don't want that to be an example that any child growing up ends up accepting as somehow the norm. I want every child to grow up knowing that a woman's hard work is valued and rewarded just as much as any man's. <p>Now, what's important to realize also, though, is this is not just an issue of fairness. This is a family issue. This is a middle class issue. This is an economic issue. Just last week, a report confirmed what we already know: that women are increasingly the breadwinners for American families. Women are now the primary source of income for nearly 40 percent of American families. Forty percent, almost half. <p>That's not something to panic about or to be afraid about, that's a sign of the progress and the strides that we've made. But what it does mean is that when more women are bringing home the bacon, they shouldn't just be getting a little bit of bacon. [<i>Laughter</i>] If they're bringing home more of the income and that income is less than a fair share, that means that families have less to get by on for childcare or health care or gas or groceries. It makes it harder for middle class families to save and retire. It leaves small businesses with customers who have less money in their pockets, which is not good for the economy. That's not a good example to set for our sons and daughters, but it's also not a good recipe for long-term, stable economic growth. <p>So to anyone who says 77 cents on the dollar sounds pretty close to equal, I say, you're math is bad. [<i>Laughter</i>] You wouldn't like it if your vote only counted in three out of four elections. [<i>Laughter</i>] You wouldn't like it if your daughters or sons went to school, but they only got taught 3 out of 4 days a week or 4 out of 5 days a week. You wouldn't like it if you were forced to work every fourth day without pay. Men would be complaining about that. [<i>Laughter</i>] They wouldn't think that was equal or fair. <p>So this is the 21st century. It's time to close that gap. That's why the first bill I signed into law was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. <p>That's why, as Valerie mentioned, I created the first-ever White House Council on Women and Girls, which is working to close that gap. And Valerie's Council&mdash;this Council is doing a great job in bringing the experiences of women into our Federal policies as well. <p>It's why I established a National Equal Pay Task Force to help crack down on violations of equal pay laws, which, by the way, they're doing at a record rate. And through education and outreach, they're also helping employers develop tools to comply with the Nation's equal pay laws on their own. And that's why, earlier this year, I signed a Presidential memorandum directing the Federal Government to close that gap for good for its employees. Right? We have to set an example. <p>It's also why we're using the latest technology to help workers get the information they need to figure out if they're underpaid. And thanks to innovators like Rachel and Laquitta, who are up here, we can now say, \\"There's an app for that.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] But as long as this gap persists, we're going to have more work to do. And now is the time to keep up the work that all those trailblazers started 50 years ago. <p>Now is the time for Congress to step up and pass the Paycheck Fairness Act so women have better tools to fight for equal pay for equal work. Now is the time for us to encourage more young women to pursue math and science education. Now is the time for us to hire more STEM teachers so all our children are prepared for the high-tech, high-wage jobs of tomorrow. <p>Now is the time to make sure businesses offer men and women the flexibility to be good employees and good parents. And I really want to commend Deloitte and SumAll and the CEOs who are with us here today. They are creating exactly the kind of&mdash;kinds of innovative workplaces that help hard-working Americans thrive, and they're committed to pay equity. And so when you have a chance to talk to Joe, say thank you. And CEOs who are out there, if you want a first-class company that is tapping into the talents and resources of all your employees, make sure that you're putting in place systems so that they all feel like they're being treated fairly and equally. It's a simple principle, and it's a powerful one. <p>And now is the time to make sure that we are putting in place a minimum wage that you can live on, because 60 percent of those making the minimum wage are women. <p>We do all this, and this will be part of our broader agenda to create good jobs and to strengthen middle class security, to keep rebuilding an economy that works for everybody, that gives every American the chance to get ahead, no matter who you are or what you look like, what your last name is, who you love. <p>That's what I'm going to keep on fighting for. That's what you're going to keep on fighting for. And we have all of you and your predecessors to thank for the incredible progress this country has made in eliminating the barriers and injustices that might keep our daughters from enjoying the same rights, same chances, and same freedoms as our sons. I'm proud of you. <p>Thank you very much.\" "
"134" "\"<i>The President. </i>Well<i>,</i> good morning, everybody. Welcome to the White House. It is a pleasure to have so many distinguished Americans today from so many different walks of life. We've got Democrats and Republicans; we've got labor and business leaders up on stage; we have law enforcement and clergy&mdash;Americans who don't see eye to eye on every issue, in fact, in some cases, don't see eye to eye on just about any issue&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but who are today standing united in support of the legislation that is front and center in Congress this week: a bipartisan bill to fix our broken immigration system. <p>And I have to say, please give Tolu another round of applause. She did a wonderful job. It takes a lot of courage to do what Tolu did: to step out of the shadows, to share her story, and to hope that, despite the risks, she could make a difference. But Tolu, I think, is representative of so many DREAMers out there who have worked so hard&mdash;and I've had a chance to meet so many of them&mdash;who've been willing to give a face to the undocumented and have inspired a movement across America. And with each step, they've reminded us, time and again, what this debate is all about. This is not an abstract debate. This is about incredible young people who understand themselves to be Americans, who have done everything right, but have still been hampered in achieving their American Dream. <p>And they remind us that we're a nation of immigrants. Throughout our history, the promise we found in those who come from every corner of the globe has always been one of our greatest strengths. It's kept our workforce vibrant and dynamic. It's kept our businesses on the cutting edge. It's helped build the greatest economic engine that the world has ever known. <p>When I speak to other world leaders, one of the biggest advantages we have economically is our demographics. We're constantly replenishing ourselves with talent from all across the globe. No other country can match that history. <p>[<i>At this point, a beeping noise came from the audience.</i>]<i> </i><p>And what was true years ago is still true today. Who's beeping over there? [<i>Laughter</i>] You're feeling kind of self-conscious, aren't you? [<i>Laughter</i>] It's okay. <p>In recent years, one in four of America's new small-business owners were immigrants. One in four high-tech startups in America were founded by immigrants. Forty percent of Fortune 500 companies were started by a first- or second-generation American. Think about that: Almost half of the Fortune 500 companies, when they were started, were started by first- or second-generation immigrants. So immigration isn't just part of our national character, it is a driving force in our economy that creates jobs and prosperity for all of our citizens. <p>Now, here's the thing: Over the past two decades, our immigration system hasn't kept pace with changing times and hasn't matched up with our most cherished values. <p>Right now our immigration system invites the best and the brightest from all over the world to come and study at our top universities, and then once they finish&mdash;once they've gotten the training they need to build a new invention or create a new business&mdash;our system too often tells them to go back home so that other countries can reap the benefits: the new jobs, the new businesses, the new industries. That's not smart. But that's the broken system we have today. <p>Right now our immigration system keeps families apart for years at a time, even for folks who, technically, under the legal immigration system, should be eligible to become citizens, but it is so long and so cumbersome, so byzantine, that families end up being separated for years. Because of a backlog in visas, people who come here legally&mdash;who are ready to give it their all to earn their place in America&mdash;end up waiting for years to join their loved ones here in the United States. It's not right. But that's the broken system we have today. <p>Right now our immigration system has no credible way of dealing with the 11 million men and women who are in this country illegally. And yes, they broke the rules; they didn't wait their turn. They shouldn't be let off easy. They shouldn't be allowed to game the system. But at the same time, the vast majority of these individuals aren't looking for any trouble. They're just looking to provide for their families, contribute to their communities. <p>They're our neighbors. We know their kids. Too often, they're forced to do what they do in a shadow economy, where shady employers can exploit them by paying less than the minimum wage, making them work without overtime, not giving them any benefits. That pushes down standards for all workers. It's bad for everybody, because all the businesses that do play by the rules, that hire people legally, that pay them fairly, they're at a competitive disadvantage. American workers end up being at a competitive disadvantage. It's not fair. But that's the broken system that we have today. <p>Now, over the past 4 years, we've tried to patch up some of the worst cracks in the system. We made border security a top priority. Today, we have twice as many border patrol agents as we did in 2004. We have more boots on the ground along our southern border than at any time in our history. And in part, by using technology more effectively, illegal crossings are near their lowest level in decades. <p>We focused our enforcement efforts on criminals who are here illegally and who are endangering our communities. And today, deportation of criminals is at its highest level ever. <p>And having put border security in place, having refocused on those who could do our communities harm, we also then took up the cause of the DREAMers, young people like Tolu who were brought to this country as children. We said that if you're able to meet some basic criteria, like pursuing a higher education, then we'll consider offering you the chance to come out of the shadows so you can continue to work here and study here and contribute to our communities legally. <p>So my administration has done what we can on our own. And we've got members of my administration here who've done outstanding work over the past few years to try to close up some of the gaps that exist in the system. But the system is still broken. And to truly deal with this issue, Congress needs to act. And that moment is now. <p>This week, the Senate will consider a commonsense, bipartisan bill that is the best chance we've had in years to fix our broken immigration system. It will build on what we've done and continue to strengthen our borders. It will make sure that businesses and workers are all playing by the same set of rules, and it includes tough penalties for those who don't. It's fair for middle class families, by making sure that those who are brought into the system pay their fair share in taxes and for services. And it's fair for those who try to immigrate legally by stopping those who try to skip the line. It's the right thing to do. <p>Now, this bill isn't perfect. It's a compromise. And going forward, nobody is going to get everything that they want: not Democrats, not Republicans, not me. But this is a bill that's largely consistent with the principles that I and the people on this stage have laid out for commonsense reform. <p>First of all, if passed, this bill would be the biggest commitment to border security in our Nation's history. It would put another $6.5 billion&mdash;on top of what we're already spending&mdash;towards stronger, smarter security along our borders. It would increase criminal penalties against smugglers and traffickers. It would finally give every employer a reliable way to check that every person they're hiring is here legally. And it would hold employers more accountable if they knowingly hire undocumented workers. So it strengthens border security, but also enforcement within our borders. <p>I know there's a lot of talk right now about border security, so let me repeat: Today, illegal crossings are near their lowest level in decades. And if passed, the Senate bill&mdash;as currently written and as hitting the floor&mdash;would put in place the toughest border enforcement plan that America has ever seen. So nobody is taking border enforcement lightly. That's part of this bill. <p>Number two, this bill would provide a pathway to earned citizenship for the 11 million individuals who are in this country illegally. So that pathway is arduous. You've got to pass background checks. You've got to learn English. You've got to pay taxes and a penalty. And then you've got to go to the back of the line behind everybody who's done things the right way and have tried to come here legally. <p>So this won't be a quick process. It will take at least 13 years before the vast majority of these individuals are able to even apply for citizenship. So this is no cakewalk. But it's the only way we can make sure that everyone who's here is playing by the same rules as ordinary families: paying taxes and getting their own health insurance. <p>That's why, for immigration reform to work, it must be clear from the outset that there is a pathway to citizenship. If we're asking everybody to play by the same rules, you got to give people a sense of certainty that they go through all these sacrifices, do all this, that there's, at the end of the horizon, the opportunity&mdash;not the guarantee, but the opportunity&mdash;to be part of this American family. And by the way, a majority of Americans support this idea. <p>Number three, this bill would modernize the legal immigration system so that, alongside training American workers for the jobs of tomorrow, we're also attracting the highly skilled entrepreneurs and engineers from around the world who will ultimately grow our economy. And this bill would help make sure that our people don't have to wait years before their loved ones are able to join them here in America. <p>So that's what immigration reform looks like: smarter enforcement, a pathway to earned citizenship, improvements to our legal system. They're all commonsense steps. They've got bipartisan support. They've got the support of a broad cross-section of leaders from every walk of life. So there's no reason Congress can't get this done by the end of the summer. <p>Remember, the process that led to this bill was open and inclusive. For months, the bipartisan Gang of Eight looked at every issue, reconciled competing ideas, built a compromise that works. Then the Judiciary Committee held numerous hearings. More than a hundred amendments were added, often with bipartisan support. And the good news is, every day that goes by, more and more Republicans and Democrats are coming out to support this commonsense immigration reform bill. <p>And I'm sure the bill will go through a few more changes in the weeks to come. But this much is clear: If you genuinely believe we need to fix our broken immigration system, there's no good reason to stand in the way of this bill. A lot of people&mdash;Democrats and Republicans&mdash;have done a lot of good work on this bill. So if you're serious about actually fixing the system, then this is the vehicle to do it. <p>If you're not serious about it, if you think that a broken system is the best America can do, then I guess it might make sense to try to block it. But if you're actually serious and sincere about fixing a broken system, this is the vehicle to do it. And now is the time to get it done. There is no good reason to play procedural games or engage in obstruction just to block the best chance we've had in years to address this problem in a way that's fair to middle class families, to business owners, to legal immigrants. <p>And there's no good reason to undo the progress we've already made, especially when it comes to extreme steps like stripping protections from DREAMers that my administration has provided or asking law enforcement to treat them the same way they treat violent criminals. That's not who we are. <p>We owe it to America to do better. We owe it to the DREAMers to do better. We owe it to the young people like Tolu and Diego S&aacute;nchez, who's with us here today. Where's Diego? Right here. Diego came here from Argentina with his parents when he was just a kid, and growing up, America was his home. This is where he went to school. This is where he made friends. This is where he built a life. You ask Diego, and he'll tell you, he feels American in every way except one: on paper. <p>In high school, Diego found out that he was undocumented. Think about that. With all the stuff you're already dealing with in high school&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and suddenly: \\"Oh, man. Really?\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] So he had done everything right&mdash;stayed out of trouble, excelled in class, contributed to his community&mdash;feeling hopeful about his future, and suddenly, he finds out he's got to live in fear of deportation: watching his friends get their licenses knowing he couldn't get one himself; seeing his classmates apply for summer jobs knowing he couldn't do that either. <p>When Diego heard that we were going to offer a chance for folks like him to emerge from the shadows, he went and signed up. All he wanted, he said, was a chance to, \\"live a normal life\\" and to \\"contribute to the country I love.\\" And Diego, this year, was approved for deferred action. A few weeks ago, he graduated from St. Thomas University, where he was student body president and student of the year. <p>So now he's set his sights higher&mdash;master's degree and then law school&mdash;so he can pursue a career in public policy, help America shape its future. Why wouldn't we want to do the right thing by Diego? What rationale is there out there that we wouldn't want to make sure Diego achieves his dreams? Because if he does, that helps us all achieve our dreams. <p>So in the weeks to come, you'll hear some opponents of immigration reform try to gin up fear and create division and spread the same old rumors and untruths that we've heard before. And when that happens, I want you to think about Tolu, I want you to think about Diego, and I want you to think about your own parents and your own grandparents and your own great-grandparents and all the men and women and children who came here. The notion that somehow those who came through Ellis Island had all their papers right&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;had checked every box and followed procedures as they were getting on that boat&mdash;they were looking for a better life just like these families. And they want to earn their way into the American story. <p>And if you're willing to stand with them&mdash;and if you're willing to stand with all these outstanding leaders up here&mdash;then now is the time to make your voice heard. You need to call and e-mail and tweet your Senators and tell them, don't kick this problem down the road. Come together. Work together. Do your job not only to fix a broken immigration system once and for all, but to leave something better for all the generations to come, to make sure we continue to be a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. Do the right thing. <p>Thanks. God bless you. God bless America. All right.\" "
"135" "\"Thank you, everybody. Everybody, have a seat. Have a seat. Well, Tom, thank you so much for that introduction and the great support that you've given me and the incredible innovation that you and your company represents. <p>There are a couple of other people I want to thank. In addition to Shasta and Azza, who's back there and is growing like a weed&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;we've got our outstanding DNC chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Florida's own. Where's Debbie? She was here. I don't know where she is now. <p>Our DNC finance chair&mdash;don't blame him for the fact that he's from San Antonio&mdash;Henry Mu&ntilde;oz is here. Our Florida finance chair, J.P. Austin, is here. And our Florida Democratic Party chair, Allison Tant, is here. <p>So the story that Tom describes is the story of America. Somebody starts off selling lumber on the back of a pickup truck, and they end up in Florida with some really nice artwork. [<i>Laughter</i>] But in so many ways, Tom has lived out the American Dream, but there are two elements that Tom describes that go to the heart of why I think most of you are here today. <p>Number one, the idea that anybody can make it if they've got a good idea. That's what America is about. That you don't have to be born into fame and fortune in order to succeed. If you work hard, we have the most open, most innovative, most entrepreneurial society on Earth. <p>Number two, that we bet on technology. That's what's always driven progress in this country; that we believe in the idea that we can do something better. That we may have figured out how to mass-produce automobiles, but we also can figure out how to mass-produce better automobiles. That we can invent communications systems that ultimately bring the entire world together. And that's always been part of who we are: at the cutting edge. <p>And then there's a third thing that Tom represents, and that is, a belief that there's no contradiction between doing well and doing good. The idea that those of us who have been blessed in this society&mdash;we work hard, we succeed&mdash;we've got to give thing back. And that there are broader issues about how we make sure that we're passing on to the next generation the same opportunities that were given to us. <p>Now those are all American values. But part of the reason we're here is because we believe that the Democratic Party best represents those values right now. I always say this: That hasn't always been the case. I come from Illinois, and we had a pretty good Republican President named Lincoln. <p>But right now I think that when you look at who's pushing to make sure that we're investing in research and technology, who's serious about discovering the new sources of energy, energy of the future and not just energy of the past; who's serious about making sure that every young person has educational opportunities, so that if they work hard they can succeed, that's us. That's what the Democratic Party is all about. <p>And most of all, who believes that every single person in this country&mdash;not just some of us&mdash;but everybody should have a chance at success. No matter what you look like, no matter where you come from, no matter what your last name, no matter who you love, if you work hard, if you take responsibility, you can succeed. That's what we stand for. <p>That's why I ran in 2008. That's why I ran for reelection in 2012. And obviously, we've made enormous progress over the last 4&frac12; years, with the help of folks like Debbie Wasserman Schultz, making sure that every single person in America can get affordable, accessible health care we're implementing right now, making sure that we double fuel efficiency standards on cars and double the production of clean energy. <p>Hey, Azza. You want to come up and say something? [<i>Laughter</i>] Daddy is right over here. Yes, she's right over there. [<i>Laughter</i>] You can't beat daughters. I mean, sons are okay, but&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>We were able to restore growth to an economy that was crashing: 39 consecutive months of job growth, the stock market exceeding where it was before the financial crisis. Housing beginning to bounce back. So we've made progress. But what we also know is that we've still got an awful lot of work to do. And the only way we're going to get that done is if I stay focused, as President, on those issues that got people to send me to Washington: making sure that we're focused on bringing manufacturing back, making sure that we're focused on making college more affordable, making sure that we're reforming our K-12 system so that our kids get what they need, making sure that we're investing in clean energy, dealing with climate change. But I can't do it by myself. I've got to have partners. <p>Now, in some cases, we're seeing Republicans willing to work with us and compromise. I'm pleased to see that we got a good vote this week so far on immigration. That immigration bill is on the floor, and I think we have an enormous opportunity to get a bipartisan immigration bill done. And that will be not just an enormous political achievement, but an important economic foundation for us to continue to attract the best and the brightest from all around the world. <p>But sadly, all too often, we're not getting much cooperation from the other side. They seem more interested in winning the next election than helping the next generation. And so I will spend the next 3&frac12; years doing everything I can to work with anybody&mdash;Democrat, Republican, or Independent&mdash;to advance the cause of middle class families and everybody who's willing to work hard to get into the middle class. I will be doing that. But I tell you what: It would be a lot easier if I had a Democratic House and a Democratic Senate to do it. <p>So to all of you who have invested in me and invested in our vision for the future, I want to say thank you. But I also want to tell you that we've got a lot more work to do and it's going to be absolutely critical that everybody here feels the same urgency and intensity over the next year and a half leading up to the midterm elections as you did in 2008 and 2012. <p>If you do, then we can take back the House, we can keep the Senate in Democratic hands. That will allow me to appoint outstanding judges to the Federal bench. That will allow us to make sure that we are advancing issues like climate change that are critically important for the next generation. And it can be done, but it can only be done with you. <p>And for all that you've done, but also for all that you're going to be doing, I want to just say how much I appreciate it, and I'm looking forward to us partnering together for several more years so that we can get that whole agenda in place and make sure that Azza and all her peers can look back and say, you know what, our parents and our grandparents, they took care of business. <p>So thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.\" "
"136" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Boston! It is great to be back in Boston. Good to be back in Massachusetts. And most of all, it is great to be here with the next Senator from Massachusetts: Ed Markey. <p>First of all, I want to thank Ed for that great introduction. Because I am here with my great friends from Boston, because I'm here to campaign on behalf of somebody who will be an outstanding Member of the United States Senate, I am not going to talk trash about the hockey game. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm not going to say anything about the outstanding qualities of the Chicago Blackhawks. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> I'm not going to say anything. I'm not going to do it. [<i>Laughter</i>] Because I don't want to make you all feel bad. [<i>Laughter</i>] I want you to feel good. <p>Part of the reason you should feel good is not only do you have an outstanding congressional delegation, you also have a great Governor, my good friend, Deval Patrick. You've got one of the finest mayors in the United States of America; we love Tom Menino. I was just backstage talking to Tom, and he doesn't just inspire Boston and make it a better place, he inspires the country. And we're grateful for his lifetime of service. <p>The last time I saw Tom, the last time I saw a lot of you was for the memorial service honoring the victims of the marathon bombing. So this morning, before I came here, I wanted to spend some time with some Bostonians, so we stopped by Charlie's Sandwich Shoppe, and I got a burger and fries. And we were saying hi to everybody and hugging folks, and Ed was with me. And one of the people I met in the shop just by happenstance was a young man whose family had been injured by the bombing. And he was with a nurse who had been at Mass General the day those folks got brought in. And she was on her day off. But I gave her a big hug, and I reminded her of how much what she did had meant to so many people all throughout the city and she was an example of the spirit of Boston during a very difficult time. <p>And I asked people, how is the city doing? And they said, you know, we're bouncing back. Boylston Street may be open again. Life may be back to normal in a lot of ways. But we know there's still too many middle class families that aren't seeing their hard work rewarded, too many young people who are looking for work and can't find it, too many Americans who feel like the rungs on the ladder of opportunity have grown farther and farther apart. And that's why Ed and I are focused on building the true engine of long-term economic growth, and that is, a rising, thriving middle class. <p>And every day I wake up, I ask three questions: How do I make America a magnet for good jobs? How do we make sure our workers earn the skills and education they need for those jobs? How do we make sure those jobs are paying a decent living? And the answer to that is, government can't do it by itself. Obviously, the private sector is the driver of our economy. It's the engine of our growth. <p>But when people say the whole problem is government, they don't understand government can help by establishing smart priorities, by making smart choices: by investing in American manufacturing so we're bringing more of our jobs back from overseas; investing in our roads and our bridges and our ports to make sure that we are staying competitive all around the world; educating our children from the earliest years; keeping them safe from gun violence; rethinking our high schools; making college more affordable; making sure we stay at the cutting edge in science and technology; securing our energy future; addressing climate change. There are some things that government can do that will help middle-class families, and that's what Ed Markey is committed to doing. <p>We can do all this. We have all the plans. We have all the policies. We have solutions to our challenges. We have all the ingredients for success. This is not only the greatest nation on Earth in the past, this is going to be the greatest nation on Earth for the foreseeable future. There's no country on Earth that would not gladly trade places with the United States. But what's holding us back right now is inaction in Washington, gridlock in Washington: too many folks in Washington who are putting the next election ahead of the next generation. <p>Now, Boston, I want you to know I've run my last campaign. Michelle is very happy about that. [<i>Laughter</i>] So my only concern is making sure that we advance the interests of the broadest number of Americans and we leave our children a stronger, safer, more prosperous country than the one we inherited. That's all I care about. And that means I'm willing to work with anybody; I'll work with Republicans, Democrats, Independents, anybody who wants to make progress. I'm ready to get going. I want to work with them. <p>So, for example, right now on immigration, we've got a good bipartisan bill moving through the Senate that strengthens our borders and reforms the system so that everybody is playing by the same rules, reform that will allow us to continue to attract talent from all around the world, the best and the brightest. And whenever Republicans are ready to work with me, I'm ready to work with them. I want to govern not just politic. <p>And I notice on gun violence, there are a lot of Republicans out there who recognize that we need some commonsense gun safety measures. Some Republicans may be rethinking the stances that they took in the past. That's the good news. We want to encourage that. But the fact of the matter is that a whole bunch of Republicans out there are not interested in getting things done. They think compromise is a dirty word. They think the problem we've got is just working people who join unions, that that's what holding us back. They think environmental regulations are what's holding us back. They think that we're spending, I guess, too much money on science and research and technology. <p>And because of those attitudes, we've got to have some Democrats like Ed Markey, who will stand up and do the right thing. That's what we need. <p>Ed mentioned that the idea of being a Democrat&mdash;look, I don't believe that any single party has a monopoly on wisdom. My favorite President is a guy from Illinois who founded the Republican Party, effectively: Abraham Lincoln, our first Republican President. But what does make me a Democrat is the basic idea that in this country, no matter what you look like, no matter where you come from, no matter who you love, you should be able to get ahead if you're willing to work hard and act responsibly. <p>You should be able to buy a home and send your kids to college and save a little bit for retirement, make sure your kids get a good education, not go bankrupt when you get sick. Most Americans aren't asking for a lot. They know they've got to take care of themselves. They just want to make sure that if they're working hard, they can get ahead. That's the essence of what it means to be a Democrat. <p>And that's why we've got to have folks like Ed Markey, who are going to help keep weapons of war off the streets and out of our schools, make it harder for criminals to get a gun in their hands. <p>That's why we've got to have a Democrat who is going to make sure that we implement the Affordable Care Act, because in a nation this wealthy, nobody should have to go without affordable, accessible health care. They don't have to do it in Massachusetts. They shouldn't have to do it anywhere else. It's the right thing to do, and we need Ed Markey to make sure that it gets implemented. <p>We're fighting to make sure that when it comes to women's health, no employer or insurance company or politician gets to decide your health care. Women should make decisions about their health care, not some politician in Washington. <p>We need somebody who is going to be supportive of the Consumer Financial Protection Board that Elizabeth Warren and I started talking about even before I was elected President and that we've now implemented to make sure you're not getting cheated by unscrupulous financial practices. We need somebody who is going to support that robustly. That's what Ed is going to do. <p>We don't need politicians who are going to roll back these rights, we need somebody like Ed Markey who is going to fight to secure them, no matter how many times the Republicans in Washington want to refight the old battles. <p>Do you know that the House Republicans have held nearly 40 votes to repeal Obamacare? They did another one just 2 weeks ago because they figured that they were a couple new Representatives that hadn't had a chance to vote against Obamacare. That's not a productive thing to do, people. <p>This law is going to mean big things for the economic security of middle class families. We should be spending time figuring out how to spread the word that if you don't have health insurance, you can now get it. <p>We need a Senator from Massachusetts who will help me, work with me, to deal with climate change in an honest, realistic way. Ed has been fighting this battle for decades. If we want our children and our grandchildren to live in the same beautiful planet, the same abundance, and natural glory that we have enjoyed in our lives, we've got to double down on our investment in science and basic research. We can't just develop the energy sources of the past. We've got to develop the energy sources of the future. <p>We've got the tools and the capabilities to make huge strides. We've already doubled the production of clean energy. We've already doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars. We've got to keep on going forward, not backwards. And that's what Ed Markey is going to help us do. <p>We've ended a war in Iraq; we're winding down the war in Afghanistan responsibly. Now we're going to have to take care of our veterans and keep Americans safe. And I will keep working with the other side of the aisle on these issues. But I want somebody like Ed Markey who every single day is going to be fighting on behalf of our veterans, going to be fighting on behalf of our first responders. <p>These budget battles we have in Washington, they have implications for whether or not we're helping cities and States fund their firefighters, fund their police officers. And everybody here in Boston knows how much those first responders mean to us when a crisis has hit. And we've got to make sure we're there for them. <p>So look, here's the bottom line: We've gone through some tough times over these last few years, and so many of you put your faith in me in 2008 and 2012. The folks here in Massachusetts were very kind to me back in 2004, when nobody could pronounce my name. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And every single day, I think about all of you. I look out on the faces in this crowd; some of you I know, some of you have knocked on doors for me, some of you poured your heart and soul into our efforts. <p>But here's the thing that I think all of us understand: The job of rebuilding America, the job of making sure our kids have a great education, the job of making sure everybody has health care, the job of making sure that financial institutions treat everybody fairly, the job of making sure our veterans have the care that they need, the job of making sure we have a bright energy future, the job of preserving our environment, the job of making sure we stay on the cutting edge when it comes to innovation, that job is not mine alone. I can't do it by myself. I've got to have folks with me who care as passionately about these things as I do. I've got to have folks in the United States Senate who are willing to stand up for working people just like I have. I need folks in the United States Senate who, every day, are waking up thinking about the people who sent them there and trying to figure out how do I make sure that they are getting a brighter future. <p>That's who Ed Markey is. I need Ed Markey in the United States Senate. <p>So this election is going to come down to turnout. We've got a whole lot of Democrats in this state and a whole lot of Obama voters, but you can't just turnout during a presidential election. You've got to turn out in this election. You can't think, oh, I did my work in 2012. You've got some work to do right now in 2013. You can't just pat your back and say, well, I knocked on some doors back in November. I need you knocking on some doors right now in June. <p>And if you work with the same focus and the same passion&mdash;if you are knocking on some doors and making some phone calls, if you're talking to your friends and you're talking to your neighbors, if you're talking to cousin Jimmy who doesn't always vote unless you give him a phone call&mdash;if you are making sure that people know Ed Markey's remarkable record in Congress, then I guarantee you, he will be the next United States Senator from Massachusetts. He'll join Elizabeth Warren. He'll carry on the legacy of Ted Kennedy and John Kerry. He will be my partner, and we will continue the march forward on behalf of not just this generation, but future generations. <p>Thank you. Let's get to work. God bless you.\" "
"137" "\"<i>The President. </i>Hello, everybody! <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hello! <p><i>The President.</i> It is good to be back in Miami. Don't worry, I still think it's going to be a seven-game series. I'm just saying. [<i>Laughter</i>] I know everybody in Miami is feeling a little stressed right now, but&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;you've got two great teams playing. <p>I want to, first of all, just say thank you to Joe for hosting us. Opening up your house is a big deal on any occasion. When you've got Secret Service and everybody else running around, moving furniture, potentially bumping into that painting that's probably worth a lot of money&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that makes you more stressed. So can you all please move away from the painting? [<i>Laughter</i>] Just wanted to make that point. You're welcome, Joe. All right. <p>A couple of other people that I want to mention. We've got Debbie Wasserman Schultz here, the great Congresswoman and head of our DNC. We've got our DNC finance chair, Henry Mu&ntilde;oz, who's here. And we have the Florida Democratic Party chair, Allison Tant is here. And I am here. And you are here. So we've got a good party going on here tonight. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Yes, we do! <p><i>The President.</i> [<i>Laughter</i>] Happy birthday. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>It's wonderful to be out of Washington and have a chance to see folks who are doing all kinds of great work in their communities. As I was taking pictures with some people, I talked to doctors, I talked to folks who are active in the community, people who are working on behalf of immigration reform, people who are working on behalf of low-income families, teachers. And so we've got a pretty good group here of folks who, aside from politics, are making a difference every single day. And that's what America is about, is neighbors helping neighbors, friends helping friends, communities figuring out how can we continually make ourselves a better place for our kids and for our grandkids. <p>And after having gone through the worst recession since the Great Depression, America, all across the country in communities north, south, east, and west are starting to slowly see recovery. We've now created jobs for 39 consecutive months, close to 7 million jobs. We have seen housing begin to come back. The stock market has recovered. The economy is growing. We're producing more energy than we have in years. We're importing less than we have in decades. We've doubled our production of clean energy. We've doubled the fuel efficiency standards on cars. <p>Across the board, people are feeling like, all right, America is moving, and it's moving in the right direction. But what we also know&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> Good job, Mr. President. Good job. <p><i>The President.</i> What we also know is, is that we've got a lot more work to do. Because all across the country, we still have people who are looking for work and can't find it. We still have young people in schools that aren't learning what they need to compete in the 21st century. We still have young people who are burdened by massive college costs. We still have infrastructure that needs to be rebuilt. We've got research projects that could help to revolutionize our economy, but are not being adequately funded. We have folks whose homes are still underwater, and they're still struggling. And people are concerned about the possibilities of retiring with dignity and respect. <p>So we've got a lot more work to do. And the reason I'm here today is to ask for your help. I'm very proud of the record that we've been able to put together over the last 4&frac12; years, making sure that every American in this country gets health care, and we are implementing health care reform so that every single American is able to get health care and won't go bankrupt when they get sick. <p>We're very proud of the work we've done on financial reform, setting up, for example, a consumer finance agency that for the first time will be protecting consumers from unscrupulous mortgage lenders or financial institutions. I couldn't be prouder of us repealing \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" and being at the forefront of making sure that in this country, it doesn't matter who you love, it matters whether you want to serve the country that you love. <p>We're making progress on reforming education. We've put billions of dollars that were previously going to banks into helping young people go to college. We're making progress. But with all the stuff that remains to be done, I can't do it by myself. Our system of government was designed to separate powers, and so you've got three coequal branches. And I can propose a whole bunch of good stuff, things that I know will make a difference in the lives of middle class families and everybody who's working to get into the middle class. But if I don't have the kind of cooperation from Congress that I need, then all too often, those are just plans on the shelf. <p>Now, I've run my last campaign, and Michelle is very happy about that. [<i>Laughter</i>] And so what that means is, I think you can have confidence that all I care about right now is governing. All I care about right now is making sure that the country is stronger, more prosperous 3 years from now, 4 years from now, 10 years from now, 20 years from now than it was before I took office. And I will work with everybody who's got that same attitude. <p>So the good news is, for example, right now Congress is working on a serious effort to reform our broken immigration system. And I actually am pretty confident that before the summer is over, I can sign into law comprehensive immigration reform that will strengthen our borders, fix our legal immigration system, and make sure that those who are here and are undocumented can earn their way&mdash;in an arduous process, but earn their way&mdash;to be full-fledged members of our country. <p>And that's an example of what we can accomplish when we work on a bipartisan basis. Unfortunately, all too often, Republicans aren't interested in the compromise that's required to get things done. They've got a different philosophical view on a whole lot of issues. I don't think the vision that they have is one that would make the country stronger and more prosperous, but I understand they're entitled to their opinion. <p>And no party has a monopoly on wisdom, but when you get to the point where the other party will not compromise at all; when you get to the point where you've got another party that is more interested in trying to roll back health care for 30 million Americans than provide health care for 30 million Americans; when you have a party that is trying to roll back Wall Street reform and trying to&mdash;instead of trying to implement it so that we don't have another batch of Wall Street bailouts; when you have a situation where folks are trying to make sure that women don't have the capacity to choose health care for themselves and make their own health care decisions and, in some cases, are on the wrong side of the issue when it comes to equality for the LGBT community; when folks aren't interested in compromising, then I want to make sure that I've got people there who are ready to do some work. <p>I want Members of Congress who are looking out for you, not looking out for special interests, not looking out for folks who frankly are doing just fine. But I want to make sure that we've got people who are looking out for those who need help and those who are committed to growing this economy in a broad-based way for everybody so that every child in America&mdash;doesn't matter what they look like, where they come from, what their last name is&mdash;that they can succeed. That's our goal. That's the kind of Congress I want. <p>And in order for that to happen, I'm going to need all of you to be just as engaged as you were in 2012 and 2008. Sometimes, the Presidential campaigns are the ones that get a lot of notice and a lot of fanfare. And what happens, particularly among Democrats, is when it's not a Presidential year, our turnout drops off. That's what happened in 2010. You had this big gap between the number of people who vote on a Presidential year and those who vote on a non-Presidential year. We can't think in those terms. It's like if&mdash;those of you who are basketball fans, you can't take off&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;you can't just play in the fourth quarter, you've got to play all the quarters. [<i>Laughter</i>] You've got to play hard the whole time, not just part of the time. Well, the same is true when it comes to being engaged in the political process. <p>And so I'm spending a lot of time traveling around the country. I was over in North Carolina looking at a school district that had transformed itself: gotten rid of textbooks, bought every child in the school district a laptop, and are now performing higher than every school district except one in North Carolina even though they're spending less money than almost every school district. <p>I was in Austin, Texas, and seeing an incubator where young entrepreneurs are inventing new products and new systems&mdash;in part because of the research dollars that are flowing from the Federal Government&mdash;and are creating new businesses and jobs that will keep America at the cutting edge. <p>I have the honor of serving as Commander in Chief and meeting young men and women all across the country and all around the world who are putting their lives on the line every single day to protect us. <p>And I meet young people everywhere who are so inspiring because they have this innate optimism about what's possible in this country. They're not willing to settle for environmental degradation. They're not willing to settle for inequality. They're not willing to settle for people being treated differently because&mdash;or being bullied because of their sexual orientation. <p>And these young people, when you talk to them, it reminds you&mdash;just like it reminds you when you talk to our men and women in uniform, just like it reminds you when you talk to some of our small-business owners&mdash;America has got all the cards we need to succeed as long as everybody is involved. As long as everybody is engaged. As long as the vision that has driven this country all these years expresses itself not only in our neighborhoods, not only in our workplaces, not only in our churches or synagogues or mosques, not only in our day-to-day lives, but also expresses itself in Washington, expresses itself in Congress. That's what we're fighting for. <p>So I want to make sure everybody here understands our work is not done, and I'm not going to be able to do it by myself. We're going to need great Members of Congress who are passionate and motivated and thinking about how we build a thriving, growing middle class and providing ladders of opportunity for people to get into the middle class. And in order for me to have those Members of Congress, I'm going to need all of you active. So let's get to work. I hope you're still fired up. <p>I love you, Miami. Good luck in game four.\" "
"138" "\"<i>The President</i>. All right, I will not beat that act. [<i>Laughter</i>] We could not be prouder of Zea and Luna for the introduction. And welcome, all of you, to the White House for Pride Month. <p>Zea and Luna are here with their moms and also, I think, with Grandma and Grandpa, correct? And so feel free to congratulate them afterwards for their outstanding introduction. <p>There are a few other folks who don't have the same star wattage that I want to acknowledge: first of all, my Vice President, Joe Biden. [<i>Laughter</i>] We've got some outstanding Members of Congress here, including a record number from the Congressional Equality Caucus. Eric Fanning, the Under Secretary of the Air Force, is here. Major General Patricia Rose and her wife, Retired Lieutenant Julie Roth, are here. We've got Fred Hochberg and Elaine Kaplan, two outstanding members of my team, who are here. And John Berry is here; John is a former member of my team. You may not recognize him because he looks so well rested now that he's left the administration. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And even though she couldn't be here today, because she's getting ready to finally take her seat on the bench and get to work, I want to congratulate Nitza Quinones Alejandro, who, just a few hours ago, was confirmed by the Senate, making her the first openly gay Hispanic Federal judge in our country's history. <p>And what I'm especially excited about, in addition to Zea and Luna, we've got citizens from all across the country who wrote me letters over the last several years. In a letter from Kathleen, a young woman from Massachusetts, I saw someone who had experienced too much discrimination and hatred at such a young age, at the age of 24. But I also read about someone who dreams of becoming a doctor so that she can help others and who is determined to make a difference because, as she put it, she is \\"hopeful of a world filled with love.\\" <p>Love is what I saw in Valerie and Diane's letter from North Dakota, who've been together for 37 years. Their son Madison is here, 14. They told me that when Madison was little&mdash;he's not little now, by the way. [<i>Laughter</i>] He used to say that someday, he was going to become President and make it legal for his moms to get married. And now, they added, \\"I don't think we're going to have to wait that long.\\" <p>Madison, I agree with you that it's time. I agree that you should run for President. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member</i>. Does that include Joe? <p><i>Vice President Joe Biden</i>. I agree too. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President</i>. And I agree that we're not going to have to wait that long, because from Minnesota to Maryland, from the United States Senate to the NBA, it's clear, we're reaching a turning point. We have&mdash;we've become not just more accepting; we've become more loving, as a country, and as a people. Hearts and minds change with time. Laws do too. Change like that isn't something that starts here in Washington, but it's something that has the power that Washington has a great deal of difficulty resisting over time. <p>It's something that comes from the courage of those who stood up and sat in and came out. It's something that comes from the compassion of family and friends and coworkers and teammates who show their love and support. <p>[<i>At this point, a baby cried.</i>] <p>Yes, it's true. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And it's something that can be traced back to our Declaration of Independence: the fundamental principle that all of us are created equal. And as I said in my Inaugural Address, if we truly are created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well. And&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>That's the principle that's guided my administration over the past four and a half years. We passed a hate crimes bill in Matthew Shepard's name. We lifted the HIV entry ban, released the first National HIV/AIDS Strategy. We strengthened the Violence Against Women Act to protect LGBT victims. We told Medicare that&mdash;we told hospitals that accept Medicare and Medicaid that they have to treat LGBT patients just like everybody else. Starting next year, the Affordable Care Act will ban insurance companies from denying someone for coverage&mdash;from coverage just for being LGBT. We put in place new policies that treat transgender Americans with dignity and respect. And because no one should have to hide who they love to serve the country that they love, we ended \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" once and for all. <p>But we're&mdash;but part of the reason we're here is because we know we're not done yet. When Zea and Luna wrote me last December, they told me they would have voted for me if they could have. Thanks, guys. [<i>Laughter</i>] They also laid out quite an agenda. I hope Congress is listening to them. <p>But I want them and all of you to know that I'm not giving up the fight to keep our kids safe from gun violence. I'm not giving up the fight for smarter and better schools. I'll continue to support marriage equality and States' attempts to legalize it, including in my own home State of Illinois. We're not giving up on that. <p>And as we saw earlier this year with the gun safety debate, sometimes, this stuff takes time, and it's frustrating. You take two steps forward and sometimes there's a step back. But I deeply believe in something that Martin Luther King, Jr., said often, and that is that \\"the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.\\" Eventually, America gets it right. <p>Now, that doesn't mean we can be patient. We know from our own history that change happens because people push to make it happen. We've got to do the hard work of educating others, empathize&mdash;showing empathy to others, changing hearts and minds. And when we do that, then change occurs. It doesn't come always as quickly as we like, but progress comes. <p>We've got to keep pushing. We've got to make access to health care more available and affordable for folks living with HIV. We've got to implement the protections in the Affordable Care Act. We've got to keep making our classrooms and our neighborhoods safe for all of our young people. <p>And I agree with Susan, a PFLAG mom from Ohio: We've got to end LGBT discrimination in the places where we work. Susan wrote me and said, \\"If I have a concern, it is that there are so many LGBT men and women who contribute to the wealth and growth of our Nation . . . but they're still not protected from harassment in the workplace.\\" <p>And I share that concern. In 34 States, you can be fired just because of who you are or who you love. That's wrong. We've got to change it. There's a bipartisan bill moving forward in the Senate that would ban discrimination against all LGBT Americans in the workplace, now and forever. We need to get that passed. I want to sign that bill. We need to get it done now. <p>And I think we can make that happen, because after the last 4&frac12; years, you can't tell me, things can't happen. Look around. We've got gay and lesbian soldiers and sailors and airmen and marines who are here today. We've got married couples from places like New York and Washington State. You've got a couple of guys here on stage who I don't think anybody in their high schools thought would be the President and the Vice President of the United States. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Vice President Biden</i>. They thought about you. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President</i>. So don't tell me that things can't happen when we put our minds to them. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>The genius of America is that America can change. And people who love this country can change it. And that's what we're called to do. And I hope that when we gather here next year and the year after that, we'll be able to say, with pride and confidence, that together we've made our fellow citizens a little more free. We've made this country a little more equal. We've made our world a little more full of love. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless America. Enjoy the party.\" "
"139" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody. Welcome to the White House. Everybody, please have a seat. Congratulations to the 2012 WNBA champions, the Indiana Fever. [<i>Applause</i>] Hey! I told them, if you're from Indiana, you'd better have a good basketball team. [<i>Laughter</i>] They brought Indiana's other championship team with them, the Division III women's basketball champions, the 34-and-0 DePauw Tigers, who are in the audience. Where are you, Tigers? Tigers, right back here. How about that? Well, that's pretty cool. Well, we're going to have to get a picture after we do all this, with the Tigers. I don't know, by the way, if this is a recruiting violation, you guys bringing them here. [<i>Laughter</i>] This is&mdash;she's keeping her eye out for new talent. <p>This is not Coach Dunn's first trip to the White House. She came here when she was a Girl Scout; I won't say which administration that was. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Head Coach Lin Dunn.</i> Thank you. <p><i>The President.</i> I also want to recognize the WNBA President, Laurel Richie, and Fever team owner Herb Simons. Where are they? I didn't know where you went. Now, Herb is also the owner of the Indiana Pacers. I will not comment on that. [<i>Laughter</i>] Although, we do both have something in common, which is, our teams got knocked out by the Heat. [<i>Laughter</i>] But we will get even next year. <p>And while our towns have a friendly rivalry going on, I still recognize those Midwestern values when I see them. We saw it in the Indiana Fever, which is, you look out for your teammates. You kept fighting, no matter what gets thrown at you. As Coach Dunn put it: \\"We are all blue collar. We work hard on defense. We rebound. We're tough.\\" <p>And that toughness got this team through a season with more than its fair share of injuries. Nevertheless, whenever one player went down, another stepped up. So in game 3 against Connecticut in the Eastern Conference Finals, hometown hero Katie Douglas was sidelined for the rest of the season. It looked the team might be in real trouble, and then players like Erin Philips came alive. They stormed back, won the game, then the series, earning a spot in the Finals. <p>That's when they had their \\"Hoosiers\\" moment. To be fair, you have a lot more court time under your belts than the team from Hickory High. But you came into the finals as underdogs. The Minnesota Lynx were the defending champions. They had won the season series 2-0. They knew that they had to step up their game, and that's what they did. They rallied behind my good friend&mdash;who I've had the pleasure of being on the court, and she took it easy on me&mdash;Tamika Catchings, MVP, who can now add a WBNA championship to her NCAA championship&mdash;three-time Gold Medalist. And all of you then brought in&mdash;home Indiana's first professional basketball title since 1973. That's a long time. <p>And obviously, the Fever's incredible season inspired your States, inspired your fans. But I was mentioning backstage, WNBA generally inspires a lot of young people. I occasionally coach Sasha's basketball team, and for her to have wonderful role models like this who work hard, know how to play like a team, are incredibly poised and competitors, but also show good sportsmanship, that's the kind of models you want for your children. <p>So Coach Dunn has 2 years&mdash;was 2 years into her coaching career when title IX was passed. Today we've got two women's basketball championships&mdash;championship teams here in the White House. And that's a reminder of the incredible progress that we've made, thanks to pioneers like Coach Dunn. And so we really thank you for that. And we appreciate that. And I want&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>And I want to thank the entire Indiana Fever for giving back to their communities, not just being role models, but also taking time out off the court. Tamika has her own foundation, Catch the Stars, and she's helped the First Lady, Michelle, with the \\"Let's Move!\\" program to encourage kids to eat healthy and exercise. Players on the Fever have received a combined 13 WNBA Community Assist Awards for countless hours they spend volunteering. They visit local school kids as part of the Read to Achieve program. They've teamed up with the Habitat of Humanity to help build homes for folks in Indianapolis. And right after this, they're going to run a basketball clinic on the South Lawn for young people here in DC. <p>So it's that kind of commitment that makes the Fever not just a winning team, but a special team. So I really want to congratulate them on an incredible 2012 season. We wish them the best of luck in 2013. Everybody, give the Indiana Fever a big round of applause. <p>So yes! I got mine, got my jersey. Here, let's take down the&mdash;Coach, do you want to say something? <p><i>Coach Dunn.</i> Yes, I do. <p><i>The President.</i> Yes, go ahead. [<i>Laughter</i>] Come on. <p><i>Coach Dunn.</i> Well, first of all, on&mdash;I'm a little nervous. I haven't been to the White House since the fifth grade. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President</i>. Since the fifth grade. <p><i>Coach Dunn. </i>But on behalf of our owner, Herb Simon, and the great leadership that we have at Pacers Sports and Entertainment&mdash;Rick Fuson, Jim Morris, Kelly Krauskopf&mdash;and all of our families and friends that are here today. We just want to thank you so much for inviting us here to see the White House, to meet you&mdash;that's really special too, because I'm a Democrat so&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and to celebrate our championship season, our 2012 championship season. <p>And I just want you to know that this is an amazing group of women. What they did under just tremendous adversity&mdash;they kept fighting back, they kept fighting back. Nobody expected us to win the conference. And certainly no one, none of the reporters&mdash;you know all those people&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;none of them picked us to win and certainly not to upset the defending WNBA championship. So not only are they great players, great people, but they are tremendous role models. You're proud to meet a great group here. So I just want you to know how special they are. <p>And, Mr. President, the last thing I want to say is, I want to thank you personally, you and the First Lady, for all you do to empower women. You have no idea. Every day, every day, you both send a strong message that little girls can do anything they want to do and they can be anything they want to be. <p><i>The President.</i> That's the truth. <p><i>Coach Dunn.</i> And so we thank you. <p><i>The President.</i> I appreciate that. Thank you. <p><i>Coach Dunn.</i> We've got some gifts for you. <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. Got my ball, got my hat, got my jersey. I'm set. And I just want to say that I might try to recruit Coach Dunn to run for something. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>All right, let's strike the podium, and let's get a good picture.\" "
"140" "\"Hi, everybody. This Sunday is Father's Day, and so I wanted to take a moment to talk about the most important job many of us will ever have, and that's being a dad. <p>Today, we're blessed to live in a world where technology allows us to connect instantly with just about anyone on the planet. But no matter how advanced we get, there will never be a substitute for the love and support and, most importantly, the presence of a parent in a child's life. And in many ways, that's uniquely true for fathers. <p>I never really knew my own father. I was raised by a single mom and two wonderful grandparents who made incredible sacrifices for me. And there are single parents, like my mom, all across the country, who do a heroic job raising terrific kids. But I still wish I had a dad who was not only around, but involved; another role model to teach me what my mom did her best to instill&mdash;values like hard work and integrity, responsibility, delayed gratification&mdash;all of the things that give a child the foundation to envision a brighter future for themselves. <p>That's why I try, every day, to be for Michelle and my girls what my father was not for my mother and me. And I've met plenty of other people&mdash;dads and uncles and men without a family connection&mdash;who are trying to break the cycle and give more of our young people a strong male role model. <p>Being a good parent&mdash;whether you're gay or straight, a foster parent or a grandparent&mdash;isn't easy. It demands your constant attention, frequent sacrifice, and of course, a healthy dose of patience. And nobody's perfect. To this day, I'm still trying to figure out how to be a better husband to my wife and a better father to my kids. <p>And I want to do what I can as President, to encourage strong marriage and strong families. We should reform our child support laws to get more men working and engaged with their children. And my administration will continue to work with the faith and other community organizations, as well as businesses, on a campaign to encourage strong parenting and fatherhood. <p>Because if there's one thing I've learned along the way, it's that all our personal successes shine a little less brightly if we fail at family. That's what matters most. When I look back on my life, I won't be thinking about any particular legislation I passed or policy I promoted. I'll be thinking about Michelle and the journey we've been on together. I'll be thinking about Sasha's dance recitals and Malia's tennis matches; about the conversations we've had and the quiet moments we've shared. I'll be thinking about whether I did right by them and whether they knew, every day, just how much they were loved. <p>That's what I think about when I think about fatherhood. And if we can do our best to be a source of comfort and encouragement to our kids, if we can show them unconditional love and help them grow into the people they were meant to be, then we will have succeeded. <p>So happy Father's Day to all the dads out there, and have a great weekend.\" "
"141" "\"[<i>At this point, Chancellor Merkel made brief remarks, concluding as follows.</i>] <p>So allow me to raise my glass and drink to your very good health, Mr. President, to the very good health of your wife Michelle, and to pay tribute at the same time to the friendship between the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States and to the people of America and the people of Germany who constitute the true core of our friendship. <p>[<i>A toast was offered.</i>] <p><i>President Obama.</i> <i>Guten abend</i>. Thank you to you, Angela, for your very kind words, to you and Professor Sauer for your extraordinary hospitality and all of you for the incredibly warm welcome, both literally and figuratively. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Your English is much better than our German. I was just mentioning to the Chancellor that this is an area where the United States clearly has lagged behind: making sure that all of our young people learn a second and third language. So we're going to give my interpreters a break this evening. <p>Fifty years ago, as this city prepared to welcome President Kennedy, Berliners were ecstatic. Mayor Willy Brandt tried to calm everybody down; he told them, don't be too emotional. It didn't work. So after one speech, one newspaper wrote that it was one of the most emotional responses President Kennedy had ever received; it's said that more than 1,000 people fainted. We did not have 1,000 people faint today. The few who did, did so because of the weather and not because of my speech. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But like Presidents before me, and as during my President&mdash;previous visits, I could not be more grateful for the incredible reception that we have received. And I recognize that this signifies the incredible friendship between our two countries. I'm especially pleased that I've been able to bring Michelle and Malia and Sasha along. And let me just say, on behalf of Michelle and myself, we're incredibly grateful that Sasha and Malia have had the privilege to see not only the beauty, but also the history of this city. And they took a number of tours, and when we were in the hotel room, Malia was reciting back to me everything that she had learned about the formation of the wall and the history of reunification. And nothing is more gratifying than when you see your children understanding not only the facts of history, but also the values that drive history. <p>In these stunning surroundings tonight, we're reminded of the breadth of that history and the friendship between our two peoples. About the same time this palace was being built, a band of families from along the Rhine&mdash;Mennonites&mdash;set out across the Atlantic, arrived in what is now Philadelphia, and found a new home that remains to this day: Germantown. And immigrants from Germany and German Americans have continued to shape America ever since. <p>For our independence, we thank von Steuben. For our prosperity, families like Chrysler and Guggenheim, Heinz and Hershey. For inspiration, Einstein, Steinway, Steinbeck, Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig. Young Americans, like our daughters, will always be grateful to Levi Strauss for their blue jeans. [<i>Laughter</i>] And Americans will always be grateful especially for some very important German immigrants: Anheuser-Busch. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, on a very personal level, I'm thankful to Angela. Schiller once said, \\"Keep true to the dreams of your youth.\\" Angela, you've spoken often of the dreams of your youth: the freedom that you longed for. Today, as we were out on the balcony before our lunch, she pointed to the train tracks along which the wall used to run, and her memories of riding to her university and then hearing the tracks on the other side and imagining one day that she would be free. And you've not only kept to those dreams, but you've also helped those dreams become real for millions of your countrymen. <p>I'm extraordinarily grateful for our partnership and our friendship. As I've said before, you're an inspiration to me and to people around the world. <p>Two years ago, Chancellor Merkel became only the second German leader to address our Congress; the other was Adenauer. And as you closed your speech, you mentioned the Freedom Bell that hangs in the former town hall here, which was a gift in 1950 from the American people to the people of Germany, and it was modeled after our Liberty Bell. Here in Berlin, that bell tolled after President Kennedy's speech. It rang after German unification. It rang after 9/11, which obviously meant so much to us as a symbol of the freedom and friendship that binds us together. <p>What you may not know is that before the bell was given to our German friends, it traveled all around the United States. Millions of Americans joined the effort, lending their support and signing their names to a declaration of freedom. <p>And so I want to close tonight by proposing a toast. I left my wine there, so I'll go with water. <p>[<i>The President was handed a glass of wine.] </i><p>Oh, here we go. And I'm going to do so by borrowing the words that those millions of Americans once expressed to their German friends as part of this gift, the Liberty Bell. Here's what they said: \\"We believe in the sacredness and dignity of the individual. We believe that all men derive the right of freedom equally from God. And we are proud to join with millions of men and women throughout the world who hold the cause of freedom sacred.\\" <p><i>Zum wohl</i>. <p>[<i>A toast was offered.</i>]\" "
"142" "\"<i>President Obama.</i> Hello, Berlin! Thank you, Chancellor Merkel, for your leadership, your friendship, and the example of your life: from a child of the East to the leader of a free and united Germany. <p>As I've said, Angela and I don't exactly look like previous German and American leaders. But the fact that we can stand here today, along the faultline where a city was divided, speaks to an eternal truth: No wall can stand against the yearning of justice, the yearnings for freedom, the yearnings for peace that burns in the human heart. <p>Mayor Wowereit, distinguished guests, and especially the people of Berlin and Germany: Thank you for this extraordinarily warm welcome. In fact, it's so warm and I feel so good that I'm actually going to take off my jacket, and anybody else who wants to, feel free to. The&mdash;we can be a little more informal among friends. <p>As your Chancellor mentioned, 5 years ago I had the privilege to address this city as Senator. Today I'm proud to return as President of the United States. And I bring with me the enduring friendship of the American people as well as my wife Michelle and Malia and Sasha. You may notice that they're not here. The last thing they want to do is to listen to another speech from me. [<i>Laughter</i>] So they're out experiencing the beauty and the history of Berlin. And this history speaks to us today. <p>Here, for thousands of years, the people of this land have journeyed from tribe to principality to nation-state, through Reformation and Enlightenment, renowned as a \\"land of poets and thinkers,\\" among them Immanuel Kant, who taught us that freedom is the \\"unoriginated birthright of man, and it belongs to him by force of his humanity.\\" <p>Here, for two centuries, this gate stood tall as the world around it convulsed: through the rise and fall of empires, through revolutions and republics, art and music and science that reflected the height of human endeavor, but also war and carnage that exposed the depths of man's cruelty to man. <p>It was here that Berliners carved out an island of democracy against the greatest of odds. As has already been mentioned, they were supported by an airlift of hope, and we are so honored to be joined by Colonel Halvorsen, 92 years old, the original \\"Candy Bomber.\\" We could not be prouder of him. I hope I look that good, by the way, when I'm 92. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>During that time, a Marshall plan seeded a miracle, and a North Atlantic Alliance protected our people. And those in the neighborhoods and nations to the East drew strength from the knowledge that freedom was possible here in Berlin, that the waves of crackdowns and suppressions might therefore someday be overcome. <p>Today, 60 years after they rose up against oppression, we remember the East German heroes of June 17. When the wall finally came down, it was their dreams that were fulfilled. Their strength and their passion, their enduring example, remind us that for all the power of militaries, for all the authority of governments, it is citizens who choose whether to be defined by a wall or whether to tear it down. And we're now surrounded by the symbols of a Germany reborn: a rebuilt Reichstag and its glistening glass dome, an American Embassy back at its historic home on Pariser Platz. And this square itself, once a desolate no man's land, is now open to all. So while I am not the first American President to come to this gate, I am proud to stand on its eastern side to pay tribute to the past. <p>For throughout all this history, the fate of this city came down to a simple question: Will we live free or in chains? Under governments that uphold our universal rights or regimes that suppress them? In open societies that respect the sanctity of the individual and our free will or in closed societies that suffocate the soul? <p>As free peoples, we stated our convictions long ago. As Americans, we believe that \\"all men are created equal\\" with the right to life and liberty and of the pursuit of happiness. And as Germans, you declared in your Basic Law that \\"the dignity of man is inviolable.\\" Around the world, nations have pledged themselves to a Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which recognizes the inherent dignity and rights of all members of our human family. <p>And this is what was at stake here in Berlin all those years. And because courageous crowds climbed atop that wall, because corrupt dictatorships gave way to new democracies, because millions across this continent now breathe the fresh air of freedom, we can say&mdash;here in Berlin, here in Europe&mdash;our values won, openness won, tolerance won, and freedom won. Here in Berlin. <p>And yet, more than two decades after that triumph, we must acknowledge that there can, at times, be a complacency among our Western democracies. Today, people often come together in places like this to remember history, not to make it. After all, we face no concrete walls, no barbed wire. There are no tanks poised across a border. There are no visits to fallout shelters. And so sometimes, there can be a sense that the great challenges have somehow passed. And that brings with it a temptation to turn inward: to think of our own pursuits and not the sweep of history; to believe that we've settled history's accounts, that we can simply enjoy the fruits won by our forebears. <p>But I come here today, Berlin, to say complacency is not the character of great nations. Today's threats are not as stark as they were half a century ago, but the struggle for freedom and security and human dignity, that struggle goes on. And I've come here to this city of hope because the tests of our time demand the same fighting spirit that defined Berlin a half-century ago. <p>Chancellor Merkel mentioned that we mark the anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's stirring defense of freedom, embodied in the people of this great city. His pledge of solidarity&mdash;\\"<i>Ich bin ein Berliner</i>\\"&mdash;echoes through the ages. But that's not all that he said that day. Less remembered is the challenge that he issued to the crowd before him: \\"Let me ask you,\\" he said to those Berliners, \\"let me ask you to lift your eyes beyond the dangers of today and beyond the freedom of merely this city.\\" Look, he said, \\"to the day of peace with justice, beyond yourselves and ourselves to all mankind.\\" <p>Now, President Kennedy was taken from us less than 6 months after he spoke those words. And like so many who died in those decades of division, he did not live to see Berlin united and free. Instead, he lives forever as a young man in our memory. But his words are timeless because they call upon us to care more about things than just our own self-comfort, about our own city, about our own country. They demand that we embrace the common endeavor of all humanity. And if we lift our eyes, as President Kennedy called us to do, then we'll recognize that our work is not yet done. For we are not only citizens of America or Germany, we are also citizens of the world. And our fates and fortunes are linked like never before. <p>We may no longer live in fear of global annihilation, but so long as nuclear weapons exist, we are not truly safe. We may strike blows against terrorist networks, but if we ignore the instability and intolerance that fuels extremism, our own freedom will eventually be endangered. We may enjoy a standard of living that is in the envy of the world, but so long as hundreds of millions endure the agony of an empty stomach or the anguish of unemployment, we're not truly prosperous. <p>I say all this here, in the heart of Europe, because our shared past shows that none of these challenges can be met unless we see ourselves as part of something bigger than our own experience. Our alliance is the foundation of global security. Our trade and our commerce is the engine of our global economy. Our values call upon us to care about the lives of people we will never meet. When Europe and America lead with our hopes instead of our fears, we do things that no other nations can do, no other nations will do. So we have to lift up our eyes today and consider the day of peace with justice that our generation wants for this world. <p>I'd suggest that peace with justice begins with the example we set here at home, for we know from our own histories that intolerance breeds injustice. Whether it's based on race or religion, gender or sexual orientation, we are stronger when all our people&mdash;no matter who they are or what they look like&mdash;are granted opportunity and when our wives and our daughters have the same opportunities as our husbands and our sons. <p>When we respect the faiths practiced in our churches and synagogues, our mosques and our temples, we're more secure. When we welcome the immigrant with his talents or her dreams, we are renewed. When we stand up for our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters and treat their love and their rights equally under the law, we defend our own liberty as well. We are more free when all people can pursue their own happiness. And as long as walls exist in our hearts to separate us from those who don't look like us or think like us or worship as we do, then we're going to have to work harder, together, to bring those walls of division down. <p>Peace with justice means free enterprise that unleashes the talents and creativity that reside in each of us. Other models direct economic growth from the top down or rely solely on the resources extracted from the earth. But we believe that real prosperity comes from our most precious resource: our people. And that's why we choose to invest in education and science and research. <p>And now, as we emerge from recession, we must not avert our eyes from the insult of widening inequality or the pain of youth who are unemployed. We have to build new ladders of opportunity in our own societies that&mdash;even as we pursue new trade and investment that fuels growth across the Atlantic. <p>America will stand with Europe as you strengthen your union. And we want to work with you to make sure that every person can enjoy the dignity that comes from work; whether they live in Chicago or Cleveland or Belfast or Berlin, in Athens or Madrid, everybody deserves opportunity. We have to have economies that are working for all people, not just those at the very top. <p>Peace with justice means extending a hand to those who reach for freedom, wherever they live. Different peoples and cultures will follow their own path, but we must reject the lie that those who live in distant places don't yearn for freedom and self-determination just like we do, that they don't somehow yearn for dignity and rule of law just like we do. We cannot dictate the pace of change in places like the Arab world, but we must reject the excuse that we can do nothing to support it. <p>We cannot shrink from our role of advancing the values we believe in, whether it's supporting Afghans as they take responsibility for their future or working for an Israeli-Palestinian peace or engaging, as we've done in Burma, to help create space for brave people to emerge from decades of dictatorship. In this century, these are the citizens who long to join the free world. They are who you were. They deserve our support, for they too, in their own way, are citizens of Berlin. And we have to help them every day. <p>Peace with justice means pursuing the security of a world without nuclear weapons, no matter how distant that dream may be. And so, as President, I've strengthened our efforts to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and reduced the number and role of America's nuclear weapons. Because of the new START Treaty, we're on track to cut American and Russian deployed nuclear warheads to their lowest levels since the 1950s. <p>But we have more work to do. So today I'm announcing additional steps forward. After a comprehensive review, I've determined that we can ensure the security of America and our allies and maintain a strong and credible strategic deterrent while reducing our deployed strategic nuclear weapons by up to one-third. And I intend to seek negotiated cuts with Russia to move beyond cold war nuclear postures. <p>At the same time, we'll work with our NATO allies to seek bold reductions in U.S. and Russian tactical weapons in Europe. And we can forge a new international framework for peaceful nuclear power, reject the nuclear weaponization that North Korea and Iran may be seeking. <p>America will host a summit in 2016 to continue our efforts to secure nuclear materials around the world, and we will work to build support in the United States to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and call on all nations to begin negotiations on a treaty that ends the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons. These are steps we can take to create a world of peace with justice. <p>Peace with justice means refusing to condemn our children to a harsher, less hospitable planet. The effort to slow climate change requires bold action. And on this, Germany and Europe have led. In the United States, we have recently doubled our renewable energy from clean sources like wind and solar power. We're doubling fuel efficiency on our cars. Our dangerous carbon emissions have come down. But we know we have to do more, and we will do more. <p>With a global middle class consuming more energy every day, this must now be an effort of all nations, not just some. For the grim alternative affects all nations: more severe storms, more famine and floods, new waves of refugees, coastlines that vanish, oceans that rise. This is the future we must avert. This is the global threat of our time. And for the sake of future generations, our generation must move toward a global compact to confront a changing climate before it is too late. That is our job. That is our task. We have to get to work. <p>Peace with justice means meeting our moral obligations. And we have a moral obligation and a profound interest in helping lift the impoverished corners of the world: by promoting growth so we spare a child born today a lifetime of extreme poverty; by investing in agriculture so we aren't just sending food, but also teaching farmers to grow food; by strengthening public health so we're not just sending medicine, but training doctors and nurses who will help end the outrage of children dying from preventable diseases; making sure that we do everything we can to realize the promise, an achievable promise, of the first AIDS-free generation. That is something that is possible if we feel a sufficient sense of urgency. <p>Our efforts have to be about more than just charity. They're about new models of empowering people: to build institutions; to abandon the rot of corruption; to create ties of trade, not just aid, both with the West and among the nations that are seeking to rise and increase their capacity. Because when they succeed, we will be more successful as well. Our fates are linked, and we cannot ignore those who are yearning not only for freedom, but also prosperity. <p>And finally, let's remember that peace with justice depends on our ability to sustain both the security of our societies and the openness that defines them. Threats to freedom don't merely come from the outside, they can emerge from within: from our own fears, from the disengagement of our citizens. <p>For over a decade, America has been at war. Yet much has now changed over the 5 years since I last spoke here in Berlin. The Iraq war is now over. The Afghan war is coming to an end. Usama bin Laden is no more. Our efforts against Al Qaida are evolving. <p>And given these changes, last month, I spoke about America's efforts against terrorism. And I drew inspiration from one of our founding fathers, James Madison, who wrote, \\"No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.\\" James Madison is right, which is why even as we remain vigilant about the threat of terrorism, we must move beyond the mindset of perpetual war. And in America, that means redoubling our efforts to close the prison at Guantanamo. It means tightly controlling our use of new technologies like drones. It means balancing the pursuit of security with the protection of privacy. <p>And I'm confident that that balance can be struck. I'm confident of that, and I'm confident that working with Germany, we can keep each other safe while at the same time maintaining those essential values for which we fought for. <p>Our current programs are bound by the rule of law, and they're focused on threats to our security, not the communications of ordinary persons. They help confront real dangers, and they keep people safe here in the United States and here in Europe. But we must accept the challenge that all of us in democratic governments face: to listen to the voices who disagree with us, to have an open debate about how we use our powers and how we must constrain them, and to always remember that government exists to serve the power of the individual and not the other way around. That's what makes us who we are, and that's what makes us different from those on the other side of the wall. <p>That is how we'll stay true to our better history while reaching for the day of peace and justice that is to come. These are the beliefs that guide us, the values that inspire us, the principles that bind us together as free peoples who still believe the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., that \\"injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\\" <p>And we should ask&mdash;should anyone ask if our generation has the courage to meet these tests, if anybody asks if President Kennedy's words ring true today, let them come to Berlin, for here they will find the people who emerged from the ruins of war to reap the blessings of peace, from the pain of division to the joy of reunification. And here, they will recall how people trapped behind a wall braved bullets and jumped barbed wire and dashed across minefields and dug through tunnels and leapt from buildings and swam across the Spree to claim their most basic right of freedom. The wall belongs to history. But we have history to make as well. And the heroes that came before us now call to us to live up to those highest ideals: to care for the young people who can't find a job in our own countries and the girls who aren't allowed to go to school overseas; to be vigilant in safeguarding our own freedoms, but also to extend a hand to those who are reaching for freedom abroad. <p>This is the lesson of the ages. This is the spirit of Berlin. And the greatest tribute that we can pay to those who came before us is by carrying on their work to pursue peace and justice not only in our countries, but for all mankind. <p><i>Vielen Dank</i>. God bless you. God bless the peoples of Germany. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much.\" "
"143" "\"Hi, everybody. Right now the United States Senate is debating a bipartisan, commonsense bill that'd be an important step toward fixing our broken immigration system. <p>It's a bill that would continue to strengthen security at our borders and hold employers more accountable if they knowingly hire undocumented workers so they won't have an unfair advantage over businesses that follow the law. <p>It's a bill that would modernize the legal immigration system so that, as we train American workers for the jobs of tomorrow, we're also attracting the highly skilled entrepreneurs and engineers who grow our economy for everyone. <p>It's a bill that would provide a pathway to earned citizenship for the 11 million individuals who are in this country illegally, a pathway that includes passing a background check, learning English, paying taxes and a penalty, and then going to the back of the line behind everyone trying to come here legally. <p>And a few days ago, a report from the Congressional Budget Office definitively showed that this bipartisan, commonsense bill will help the middle class grow our economy and shrink our deficits by making sure that every worker in America plays by the same set of rules and pays taxes like everyone else. According to this independent report, reforming our immigration system would reduce our deficits by almost a trillion dollars over the next two decades. And it will boost our economy by more than 5 percent, in part because of businesses created, investments made, and technologies invented by immigrants. <p>This comes on the heel of another report from the independent office that monitors Social Security's finances, which says that this immigration bill would actually strengthen the long-term health and solvency of Social Security for future generations. Because with this bill, millions of additional people will start paying more in taxes for things like Social Security and education. That'll make the economy fairer for middle class families. <p>So that's what comprehensive immigration reform looks like: stronger enforcement, a smarter legal immigration system, a pathway to earned citizenship, a more vibrant, growing economy that's fairer on the middle class, and a more stable fiscal future for our kids. <p>Now, the bill isn't perfect. It's a compromise. Nobody is going to get everything they want: not Democrats, not Republicans, not me. But it's consistent with the principles that I and others have laid out for commonsense reform. That's why Republicans and Democrats, CEOs and labor leaders, are saying that now is the time to pass this bill. If you agree with us, reach out to your Senators and Representatives. Tell them that the time for excuses is over; it's time to fix our broken immigration system once and for all. <p>We can do this, because we are a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants&mdash;a place enriched by the contributions of people from all over the world&mdash;and stronger for it. That's been the story of America from the start, so let's keep it going. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"144" "\"Thank you, Georgetown. Everybody, please be seated. And my first announcement today is that you should all take off your jackets. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm going to do the same. We've got&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. It's not that sexy, now. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>It is good to be back on campus, and it is a great privilege to speak from the steps of this historic hall that welcomed Presidents going back to George Washington. <p>I want to thank your president, President DeGioia, who's here today. I want to thank him for hosting us. I want to thank the many members of my Cabinet and my administration. I want to thank Leader Pelosi and the Members of Congress who are here. We are very grateful for their support. <p>And I want to say thank you to the Hoyas in the house for having me back. It was important for me to speak directly to your generation, because the decisions that we make now and in the years ahead will have a profound impact on the world that all of you inherit. <p>On Christmas Eve, 1968, the astronauts of Apollo 8 did a live broadcast from lunar orbit. So Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, William Anders&mdash;the first humans to orbit the Moon&mdash;described what they saw, and they read Scripture from the Book of Genesis to the rest of us back here. And later that night, they took a photo that would change the way we see and think about our world. <p>It was an image of Earth: beautiful, breathtaking, a glowing marble of blue oceans and green forests and brown mountains brushed with white clouds, rising over the surface of the Moon. <p>And while the sight of our planet from space might seem routine today, imagine what it looked like to those of us seeing our home, our planet, for the first time. Imagine what it looked like to children like me. Even the astronauts were amazed. \\"It makes you realize,\\" Lovell would say, \\"just what you have back there on Earth.\\" <p>And around the same time we began exploring space, scientists were studying changes taking place in the Earth's atmosphere. Now, scientists had known since the 1800s that greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide trap heat and that burning fossil fuels release those gases into the air. That wasn't news. But in the late 1950s, the National Weather Service began measuring the levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere, with the worry that rising levels might someday disrupt the fragile balance that makes our planet so hospitable. And what they've found, year after year, is that the levels of carbon pollution in our atmosphere have increased dramatically. <p>That science, accumulated and reviewed over decades, tells us that our planet is changing in ways that will have profound impacts on all of humankind. <p>The 12 warmest years in recorded history have all come in the last 15 years. Last year, temperatures in some areas of the ocean reached record highs, and ice in the Arctic shrank to its smallest size on record, faster than most models had predicted it would. These are facts. <p>Now, we know that no single weather event is caused solely by climate change. Droughts and fires and floods, they go back to ancient times. But we also know that in a world that's warmer than it used to be, all weather events are affected by a warming planet. The fact that sea levels in New York&mdash;in New York Harbor&mdash;are now a foot higher than a century ago, that didn't cause Hurricane Sandy, but it certainly contributed to the destruction that left large parts of our mightiest city dark and underwater. <p>The potential impacts go beyond rising sea levels. Here at home, 2012 was the warmest year in our history. Midwest farms were parched by the worst drought since the Dust Bowl, and then drenched by the wettest spring on record. Western wildfires scorched an area larger than the State of Maryland. Just last week, a heat wave in Alaska shot temperatures into the 90s. <p>And we know that the costs of these events can be measured in lost lives and lost livelihoods, lost homes, lost businesses, hundreds of billions of dollars in emergency services and disaster relief. In fact, those who are already feeling the effects of climate change don't have time to deny it; they're busy dealing with it. Firefighters are braving longer wildfire seasons, and States and Federal governments have to figure out how to budget for that. Now, I had to sit on a meeting with the Department of Interior and Agriculture and some of the rest of my team just to figure out how we're going to pay for more and more expensive fire seasons. <p>Farmers see crops wilted one year, washed away the next, and higher food prices get passed on to you, the American consumer. Mountain communities worry about what smaller snowpacks will mean for tourism, and then families at the bottom of the mountains wonder what it will mean for their drinking water. Americans across the country are already paying the price of inaction in insurance premiums, State and local taxes, and the costs of rebuilding and disaster relief. <p>So the question is not whether we need to act. The overwhelming judgment of science&mdash;of chemistry and physics and millions of measurements&mdash;has put all that to rest. Ninety-seven percent of scientists&mdash;including, by the way, some who originally disputed the data&mdash;have now put that to rest. They've acknowledged the planet is warming and human activity is contributing to it. <p>So the question now is whether we will have the courage to act before it's too late. And how we answer will have a profound impact on the world that we leave behind not just to you, but to your children and to your grandchildren. As a President, as a father, and as an American, I'm here to say we need to act. <p>I refuse to condemn your generation and future generations to a planet that's beyond fixing. And that's why today I'm announcing a new national climate action plan, and I'm here to enlist your generation's help in keeping the United States of America a leader&mdash;a global leader&mdash;in the fight against climate change. <p>Now, this plan builds on progress that we've already made. Last year, I took office&mdash;the year that I took office, my administration pledged to reduce America's greenhouse gas emissions by about 17 percent from their 2005 levels by the end of this decade. And we rolled up our sleeves, and we got to work. We doubled the electricity we generate from wind and the sun. We doubled the mileage our cars will get on a gallon of gas by the middle of the next decade. <p>Here at Georgetown, I unveiled my strategy for a secure energy future. And thanks to the ingenuity of our businesses, we're starting to produce much more of our own energy. We're building the first nuclear power plants in more than three decades in Georgia and South Carolina. For the first time in 18 years, America is poised to produce more of our own oil than we buy from other nations. And today, we produce more natural gas than anybody else. So we're producing energy. And these advances have grown our economy, they've created new jobs, they can't be shipped overseas, and by the way, they've also helped to drive our carbon pollution to its lowest levels in nearly 20 years. Since 2006, no country on Earth has reduced its total carbon pollution by as much as the United States of America. <p>So it's a good start. But the reason we're all here in the heat today is because we know we've got more to do. In my State of the Union Address, I urged Congress to come up with a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change, like the one that Republican and Democratic Senators worked on together a few years ago. And I still want to see that happen. I'm willing to work with anyone to make that happen. <p>But this is a challenge that does not pause for partisan gridlock. It demands our attention now. And this is my plan to meet it: a plan to cut carbon pollution, a plan to protect our country from the impacts of climate change, and a plan to lead the world in a coordinated assault on a changing climate. <p>This plan begins with cutting carbon pollution by changing the way we use energy: using less dirty energy, using more clean energy, wasting less energy throughout our economy. <p>Now, 43 years ago, Congress passed a law called the Clean Air Act of 1970. It was a good law. The reasoning behind it was simple: New technology can protect our health by protecting the air we breathe from harmful pollution. And that law passed the Senate unanimously. Think about that: It passed the Senate unanimously. It passed the House of Representatives 375 to 1. I don't know who the one guy was&mdash;I haven't looked that up. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, you can barely get that many votes to name a post office these days. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>It was signed into law by a Republican President. It was later strengthened by another Republican President. This used to be a bipartisan issue. <p>Six years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that greenhouse gases are pollutants covered by that same Clean Air Act. And they required the Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, to determine whether they're a threat to our health and welfare. And in 2009, the EPA determined that they are a threat to both our health and our welfare in many different ways&mdash;from dirtier air to more common heat waves&mdash;and therefore subject to regulation. <p>Now, today, about 40 percent of America's carbon pollution comes from our power plants. But here's the thing: Right now there are no Federal limits to the amount of carbon pollution that those plants can pump into our air. None. Zero. We limit the amount of toxic chemicals like mercury and sulfur and arsenic in our air or our water, but power plants can still dump unlimited amounts of carbon pollution into the air for free. That's not right, that's not safe, and it needs to stop. <p>So today, for the sake of our children and the health and safety of all Americans, I'm directing the Environmental Protection Agency to put an end to the limitless dumping of carbon pollution from our power plants and complete new pollution standards for both new and existing power plants. <p>I'm also directing the EPA to develop these standards in an open and transparent way, to provide flexibility to different States with different needs, and build on the leadership that many States and cities and companies have already shown. In fact, many power companies have already begun modernizing their plants and creating new jobs in the process. Others have shifted to burning cleaner natural gas instead of dirtier fuel sources. <p>Nearly a dozen States have already implemented or are implementing their own market-based programs to reduce carbon pollution. More than 25 have set energy efficiency targets. More than 35 have set renewable energy targets. Over 1,000 mayors have signed agreements to cut carbon pollution. So the idea of setting higher pollution standards for our power plants is not new. It's just time for Washington to catch up with the rest of the country. And that's what we intend to do. <p>Now, what you'll hear from the special interests and their allies in Congress is that this will kill jobs and crush the economy and basically end American free enterprise as we know it. And the reason I know you'll hear those things is because that's what they said every time America sets clear rules and better standards for our air and our water and our children's health. And every time, they've been wrong. <p>For example, in 1970, when we decided through the Clean Air Act to do something about the smog that was choking our cities&mdash;and by the way, most young people here aren't old enough to remember what it was like, but when I was going to school in 1979, 1980 in Los Angeles, there were days where folks couldn't go outside. And the sunsets were spectacular because of all the pollution in the air. <p>But at the time when we passed the Clean Air Act to try to get rid of some of this smog, some of the same doomsayers were saying new pollution standards will decimate the auto industry. Guess what? It didn't happen. Our air got cleaner. <p>In 1990, when we decided to do something about acid rain, they said our electricity bills would go up, the lights would go off, businesses around the country would suffer, I quote, \\"a quiet death.\\" None of it happened, except we cut acid rain dramatically. <p>See, the problem with all these tired excuses for inaction is that it suggests a fundamental lack of faith in American business and American ingenuity. These critics seem to think that when we ask our businesses to innovate and reduce pollution and lead, they can't or they won't do it. They'll just kind of give up and quit. But in America, we know that's not true. Look at our history. <p>When we restricted cancer-causing chemicals in plastics and leaded fuel in our cars, it didn't end the plastics industry or the oil industry. American chemists came up with better substitutes. When we phased out CFCs&mdash;the gases that were depleting the ozone layer&mdash;it didn't kill off refrigerators or air conditioners or deodorant. [<i>Laughter</i>] American workers and businesses figured out how to do it better without harming the environment as much. The fuel standards that we put in place just a few years ago didn't cripple automakers. The American auto industry retooled, and today, our automakers are selling the best cars in the world at a faster rate than they have in 5 years, with more hybrid, more plug-in, more fuel-efficient cars for everybody to choose from. <p>So the point is, if you look at our history, don't bet against American industry. Don't bet against American workers. Don't tell folks that we have to choose between the health of our children or the health of our economy. <p>The old rules may say we can't protect our environment and promote economic growth at the same time, but in America, we've always used new technologies&mdash;we've used science, we've used research and development and discovery&mdash;to make the old rules obsolete. <p>Today, we use more clean energy&mdash;more renewables and natural gas&mdash;which is supporting hundreds of thousands of good jobs. We waste less energy, which saves you money at the pump and in your pocketbooks. And guess what? Our economy is 60 percent bigger than it was 20 years ago, while our carbon emissions are roughly back to where they were 20 years ago. <p>So obviously, we can figure this out. It's not an either-or, it's a both-and. We've got to look after our children, we have to look after our future, and we have to grow the economy and create jobs. We can do all of that as long as we don't fear the future, instead, we seize it. <p>And by the way, don't take my word for it. Recently, more than 500 businesses, including giants like GM and Nike, issued a climate declaration, calling action on climate change \\"one of the great opportunities of the 21st century.\\" Walmart is working to cut its carbon pollution by 20 percent and transition completely to renewable energy. [<i>Applause</i>] Yes. Walmart deserves a cheer for that. But think about it: Would the biggest company, the biggest retailer in America, would they really do that if it weren't good for business? If it weren't good for their shareholders? <p>A low-carbon, clean energy economy can be an engine of growth for decades to come. And I want America to build that engine. I want America to build that future right here in the United States of America. That's our task. <p>Now, one thing I want to make sure everybody understands: This does not mean that we're going to suddenly stop producing fossil fuels. Our economy wouldn't run very well if it did. And transitioning to a clean energy economy takes time. But when the doomsayers trot out the old warnings that these ambitions will somehow hurt our energy supply, just remind them that America produced more oil than we have in 15 years. What is true is that we can't just drill our way out of the energy and climate challenge that we face. That's not possible. <p>I've put forward in the past an all-of-the-above energy strategy, but our energy strategy must be about more than just producing more oil. And by the way, it's certainly got to be about more than just building one pipeline. <p>Now, I know there's been, for example, a lot of controversy surrounding the proposal to build a pipeline, the Keystone pipeline, that would carry oil from Canadian tar sands down to refineries in the Gulf. And the State Department is going through the final stages of evaluating the proposal. That's how it's always been done. But I do want to be clear: Allowing the Keystone pipeline to be built requires a finding that doing so would be in our Nation's interest. And our national interest will be served only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution. The net effects of the pipeline's impact on our climate will be absolutely critical to determining whether this project is allowed to go forward. It's relevant. <p>Now, even as we're producing more domestic oil, we're also producing more cleaner-burning natural gas than any other country on Earth. And again, sometimes, there are disputes about natural gas, but let me say this: We should strengthen our position as the top natural gas producer because, in the medium term at least, it not only can provide safe, cheap power, but it can also help reduce our carbon emissions. <p>Federally supported technology has helped our businesses drill more effectively and extract more gas. And now we'll keep working with the industry to make drilling safer and cleaner, to make sure that we're not seeing methane emissions, and to put people to work modernizing our natural gas infrastructure so that we can power more homes and businesses with cleaner energy. <p>The bottom line is, natural gas is creating jobs. It's lowering many families' heat and power bills. And it's the transition fuel that can power our economy with less carbon pollution even as our businesses work to develop and then deploy more of the technology required for the even cleaner energy economy of the future. <p>And that brings me to the second way that we're going to reduce carbon pollution: by using more clean energy. Over the past 4 years, we've doubled the electricity that we generate from zero-carbon wind and solar power. And that means jobs: jobs manufacturing the wind turbines that now generate enough electricity to power nearly 15 million homes; jobs installing the solar panels that now generate more than four times the power at less cost than just a few years ago. <p>I know some Republicans in Washington dismiss these jobs, but those who do need to call home, because 75 percent of all wind energy in this country is generated in Republican districts. [<i>Laughter</i>] And that may explain why last year, Republican Governors in Kansas and Oklahoma and Iowa&mdash;Iowa, by the way, a State that harnessed&mdash;harnesses almost 25 percent of its electricity from the wind&mdash;helped us in the fight to extend tax credits for wind energy manufacturers and producers. Tens of thousands of good jobs were on the line, and those jobs were worth the fight. <p>And countries like China and Germany are going all in in the race for clean energy. I believe Americans build things better than anybody else. I want America to win that race, but we can't win it if we're not in it. <p>So the plan I'm announcing today will help us double again our energy from wind and sun. Today I'm directing the Interior Department to green light enough private, renewable energy capacity on public lands to power more than 6 million homes by 2020. <p>The Department of Defense&mdash;the biggest energy consumer in America&mdash;will install 3 gigawatts of renewable power on its bases, generating about the same amount of electricity each year as you'd get from burning 3 million tons of coal. <p>And because billions of your tax dollars continue to&mdash;still&mdash;subsidize some of the most profitable corporations in the history of the world, my budget once again calls for Congress to end the tax breaks for big oil companies and invest in the clean energy companies that will fuel our future. <p>Now, the third way to reduce carbon pollution is to waste less energy: in our cars, our homes, our businesses. The fuel standards we set over the past few years mean that by the middle of the next decade, the cars and trucks we buy will go twice as far on a gallon of gas. That means you'll have to fill up half as often; we'll all reduce carbon pollution. And we built on that success by setting the first-ever standards for heavy-duty trucks and buses and vans. And in the coming months, we'll partner with truck makers to do it again for the next generation of vehicles. <p>Now, meanwhile, the energy we use in our homes and our businesses and our factories, our schools, our hospitals, that's responsible for about one-third of our greenhouse gases. The good news is, simple upgrades don't just cut that pollution, they put people to work manufacturing and installing smarter lights and windows and sensors and appliances. And the savings show up in our electricity bills every month forever. And that's why we've set new energy standards for appliances like refrigerators and dishwashers. And today, our businesses are building better ones that will also cut carbon pollution and cut consumers' electricity bills by hundreds of billions of dollars. <p>That means, by the way, that our Federal Government also has to lead by example. I'm proud that Federal agencies have reduced their greenhouse gas emissions by more than 15 percent since I took office. But we can do even better than that. So today I'm setting a new goal: Your Federal Government will consume 20 percent of its electricity from renewable sources within the next 7 years. We are going to set that goal. <p>We'll also encourage private capital to get off the sidelines and get into these energy-saving investments. And by the end of the next decade, these combined efficiency standards for appliances and Federal buildings will reduce carbon pollution by at least 3 billion tons. That's an amount equal to what our entire energy sector emits in nearly half a year. <p>So I know these standards don't sound all that sexy, but think of it this way: That's the equivalent of planting 7.6 billion trees and letting them grow for 10 years, all while doing the dishes. It is a great deal, and we need to be doing it. <p>So using less dirty energy, transitioning to cleaner sources of energy, wasting less energy through our economy is where we need to go. And this plan will get us there faster. But I want to be honest: This will not get us there overnight. The hard truth is, carbon pollution has built up in our atmosphere for decades now. And even if we Americans do our part, the planet will slowly keep warming for some time to come. The seas will slowly keep rising, and storms will get more severe, based on the science. It's like tapping the brakes of a car before you come to a complete stop and then can shift into reverse. It's going to take time for carbon emissions to stabilize. <p>So in the meantime, we're going to need to get prepared. And that's why this plan will also protect critical sectors of our economy and prepare the United States for the impacts of climate change that we cannot avoid. States and cities across the country are already taking it upon themselves to get ready. Miami Beach is hardening its water supply against seeping saltwater. We're partnering with the State of Florida to restore Florida's natural clean water delivery system: the Everglades. <p>The overwhelmingly Republican legislature in Texas voted to spend money on a new water development bank as long&mdash;as a long-running drought cost jobs and forced a town to truck in water from the outside. <p>New York City is fortifying its 520 miles of coastline as an insurance policy against more frequent and costly storms. And what we've learned from Hurricane Sandy and other disasters is that we've got to build smarter, more resilient infrastructure that can protect our homes and businesses and withstand more powerful storms. That means stronger seawalls, natural barriers, hardened power grids, hardened water systems, hardened fuel supplies. <p>So the budget I sent Congress includes funding to support communities that build these projects, and this plan directs Federal agencies to make sure that any new project funded with taxpayer dollars is built to withstand increased flood risk. <p>And we'll partner with communities seeking help to prepare for droughts and floods, reduce the risk of wildfires, protect the dunes and wetlands that pull double duty as green space and as natural storm barriers. And we'll also open our climate data and NASA climate imagery to the public to make sure that cities and States assess risk under different climate scenarios so that we don't waste money building structures that don't withstand the next storm. <p>So that's what my administration will do to support the work already underway across America, not only to cut carbon pollution, but also to protect ourselves from climate change. But as I think everybody here understands, no nation can solve this challenge alone, not even one as powerful as ours. And that's why the final part of our plan calls on America to lead: lead international efforts to combat a changing climate. <p>And make no mistake, the world still looks to America to lead. When I spoke to young people in Turkey a few years ago, the first question I got wasn't about the challenges that part of the world faces, it was about the climate challenge that we all face and America's role in addressing it. And it was a fair question because as the world's largest economy and second largest carbon emitter, as a country with unsurpassed ability to drive innovation and scientific breakthroughs, as the country that people around the world continue to look to in times of crisis, we've got a vital role to play. We can't stand on the sidelines. We've got a unique responsibility. And the steps that I've outlined today prove that we're willing to meet that responsibility. <p>But while America's carbon pollution fell last year, global carbon pollution rose to a record high. That's a problem. Developing countries are using more and more energy, and tens of millions of people entering a global middle class naturally want to buy cars and air conditioners of their own, just like us. Can't blame them for that. And when you have conversations with poorer countries, they'll say: Well, you went through these stages of development. Why can't we? <p>But what we also have to recognize is these same countries are also more vulnerable to the effects of climate change than we are. They don't just have as much to lose, they probably have more to lose. <p>Developing nations with some of the fastest rising levels of carbon pollution are going to have to take action to meet this challenge alongside us. They're watching what we do, but we've got to make sure that they're stepping up to the plate as well. We'll&mdash;we compete for business with them, but we also share a planet. And we have to all shoulder the responsibility for keeping the planet habitable, or we're going to suffer the consequences, together. <p>So to help more countries transitioning to cleaner sources of energy and to help them do it faster, we're going to partner with our private sector to apply private sector technological know-how in countries that transition to natural gas. We've mobilized billions of dollars in private capital for clean energy projects around the world. <p>Today I'm calling for an end of public financing for new coal plants overseas, unless they deploy carbon capture technologies or there's no other viable way for the poorest countries to generate electricity. And I urge other countries to join this effort. <p>And I'm directing my administration to launch negotiations toward global free trade in environmental goods and services, including clean energy technology, to help more countries skip past the dirty phase of development and join a global low-carbon economy. They don't have to repeat all the same mistakes that we make. <p>We've also intensified our climate cooperation with major emerging economies like India and Brazil and China, the world's largest emitter. So, for example, earlier this month, President Xi of China and I reached an important agreement to jointly phase down our production and consumption of dangerous hydrofluorocarbons, and we intend to take more steps together in the months to come. It will make a difference. It's a significant step in the reduction of carbon emissions. <p>And finally, my administration will redouble our efforts to engage our international partners in reaching a new global agreement to reduce carbon pollution through concrete action. <p>Four years ago, in Copenhagen, every major country agreed, for the first time, to limit carbon pollution by 2020. Two years ago, we decided to forge a new agreement beyond 2020 that would apply to all countries, not just developed countries. <p>What we need is an agreement that's ambitious, because that's what the scale of the challenge demands. We need an inclusive agreement because every country has to play its part. And we need an agreement that's flexible, because different nations have different needs. And if we can come together and get this right, we can define a sustainable future for your generation. <p>So that's my plan. The actions I've announced today should send a strong signal to the world that America intends to take bold action to reduce carbon pollution. We will continue to lead by the power of our example, because that's what the United States of America has always done. <p>I am convinced this is the fight America can and will lead in the 21st century. And I'm convinced this is a fight that America must lead. But it will require all of us to do our part. We'll need scientists to design new fuels, and we'll need farmers to grow new fuels. We'll need engineers to devise new technologies, and we'll need businesses to make and sell those technologies. We'll need workers to operate assembly lines that hum with high-tech, zero-carbon components, but we'll also need builders to hammer into place the foundations for a new clean energy era. <p>We're going to need to give special care to people and communities that are unsettled by this transition, not just here in the United States, but around the world. And those of us in positions of responsibility, we'll need to be less concerned with the judgment of special interests and well-connected donors and more concerned with the judgment of posterity. Because you and your children and your children's children will have to live with the consequences of our decisions. <p>As I said before, climate change has become a partisan issue, but it hasn't always been. It wasn't that long ago that Republicans led the way on new and innovative policies to tackle these issues. Richard Nixon opened the EPA. George H.W. Bush declared&mdash;first U.S. President to declare&mdash;\\"human activities are changing the atmosphere in unexpected and unprecedented ways.\\" Someone who never shies away from a challenge, John McCain introduced a market-based cap-and-trade bill to slow carbon pollution. <p>The woman that I've chosen to head up the EPA, Gina McCarthy, she's worked&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;she's terrific. Gina has worked for the EPA in my administration, but she's also worked for five Republican Governors. She's got a long track record of working with industry and business leaders to forge commonsense solutions. Unfortunately, she's being held up in the Senate. She's been held up for months, forced to jump through hoops no Cabinet nominee should ever have to, not because she lacks qualifications, but because there are too many in the Republican Party right now who think that the Environmental Protection Agency has no business protecting our environment from carbon pollution. The Senate should confirm her without any further obstruction or delay. <p>But more broadly, we've got to move beyond partisan politics on this issue. I want to be clear: I am willing to work with anybody&mdash;Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Libertarians, Greens, anybody&mdash;to combat this threat on behalf of our kids. I am open to all sorts of new ideas, maybe better ideas, to make sure that we deal with climate change in a way that promotes jobs and growth. <p>Nobody has a monopoly on what is a very hard problem, but I don't have much patience for anyone who denies that this challenge is real. We don't have time for a meeting of the Flat Earth Society. Sticking your head in the sand might make you feel safer, but it's not going to protect you from the coming storm. And ultimately, we will be judged as a people and as a society and as a country on where we go from here. <p>Our founders believed that those of us in positions of power are elected not just to serve as custodians of the present, but as caretakers of the future. And they charged us to make decisions with an eye on a longer horizon than the arc of our own political careers. That's what the American people expect. That's what they deserve. <p>And someday, our children and our children's children will look at us in the eye, and they'll ask us, did we do all that we could when we had the chance to deal with this problem and leave them a cleaner, safer, more stable world? And I want to be able to say, yes, we did. Don't you want that? <p>Americans are not a people who look backwards, we're a people who look forward. We're not a people who fear what the future holds, we shape it. What we need in this fight are citizens who will stand up and speak up and compel us to do what this moment demands. <p>Understand, this is not just a job for politicians. So I'm going to need all of you to educate your classmates, your colleagues, your parents, your friends. Tell them what's at stake. Speak up at town halls, church groups, PTA meetings. Push back on misinformation. Speak up for the facts. Broaden the circle of those who are willing to stand up for our future. <p>Convince those in power to reduce our carbon pollution. Push your own communities to adopt smarter practices. Invest. Divest. Remind folks there's no contradiction between a sound environment and strong economic growth. And remind everyone who represents you at every level of government that sheltering future generations against the ravages of climate change is a prerequisite for your vote. Make yourself heard on this issue. <p>I understand the politics will be tough. The challenge we must accept will not reward us with a clear moment of victory. There's no gathering army to defeat. There's no peace treaty to sign. When President Kennedy said we'd go to the moon within the decade, we knew we'd build a spaceship and we'd meet the goal. Our progress here will be measured differently: in crises averted, in a planet preserved. But can we imagine a more worthy goal? For while we may not live to see the full realization of our ambition, we will have the satisfaction of knowing that the world we leave to our children will be better off for what we did. <p>\\"It makes you realize,\\" that astronaut said all those years ago, \\"just what you have back there on Earth.\\" And that image in the photograph, that bright blue ball rising over the Moon's surface containing everything we hold dear&mdash;the laughter of children, a quiet sunset, all the hopes and dreams of posterity&mdash;that's what's at stake. That's what we're fighting for. And if we remember that, I'm absolutely sure we'll succeed. <p>Now, thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"145" "\"<i>President Obama.</i> Well, let me just say thank you so much for taking the time to meet with me. We've had a wonderful visit here in Senegal, and I had good opportunity to discuss a range of issues with President Sall this morning. <p>And obviously, it was very powerful to be visiting the Slave Museum here in Goree as a reminder of the potential for man's inhumanity to man, but also as a reminder that we all have to continually be vigilant on behalf of human rights. <p>The leaders&mdash;just for the press&mdash;the leaders who are gathered here today, these are all representatives of civil society, which is incredibly strong here in Senegal. And last year, when there were some significant questions as to whether Senegal's democracy would continue to represent the will of the people, it is leaders like these that were able to maintain the pressure and to maintain the focus on the peaceful transfer of power and the continuation of democratic traditions here in Senegal. And it's a reminder that democracy is not just about election day. <p>Democracy and good governance involves the need for transparency and accountability on the part of government, but also active citizens who are monitoring what the government is doing, that are speaking out. It involves a free press, freedom of assembly, rule of law. And it also involves organizations like this that aren't just working politically, but are also working to increase youth employment, helping to empower women, making sure that children and other vulnerable populations are protected. That's all part of the democratic process. <p>And I think that history shows that those countries that enjoy good governance, respect human rights, also end up having better economic growth, greater social stability and cohesion. <p>And so I just want to say, again, thank you for taking the time to meet with me. I'm looking forward to hearing how we can be more helpful in forging stronger ties between the United States and Senegal, but also to continue to encourage the kinds of empowerment that all of you represent; and that a particular focus of mine is how do we encourage more young people to get involved. <p>So, for example, Aissatou here attended the Young African Leaders Forum that we held at the White House a couple of years ago, and we're going to be talking during the course of this trip about how we can continue to expand and recruit more outstanding young African leaders to network and participate. <p>Thank you, everybody.\" "
"146" "\"<i>The President</i>. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice, for your service here in Senegal, for your powerful words about the work that brings us here together: the recognition that strong democracies depend on strong institutions. And that includes an independent judiciary system and respect for the rule of law. <p>I have to say that it's a great honor to be with such a distinguished group of justices from across Africa. Some of you may know, I am a lawyer myself. My grandmother very much wanted me to be a judge instead of going into politics, so even though I disappointed her by going into politics, at least now she knows that a group of judges are willing to meet with me even if I'm not one myself. So she would be happy about that. <p>First and foremost, this is an opportunity for me to salute the fine work that all of you are doing. These men and women, and the institutions that they represent are known for their integrity, their determination to deliver justice fairly, sometimes in the face of threats and sometimes in the face of intimidation. But they understand that what makes for a strong democracy includes a strong judiciary: one that's independent from politics; one that operates transparently so that citizens can have confidence that the process is free from undue influences; accountability, because even judges are not above the law. <p>And of course, on a much more basic level, judicial systems need funding to do their jobs. So I wanted to have this meeting here as part of my first full day in Africa on this trip because I believe that the rule of law is a foundation for governance and also a foundation for human rights and economic growth. It's a pillar of our democracy. <p>Societies are stronger and more stable when there are checks and balances on government power, when citizens know that their rights will be protected from arbitrary or capricious actions, when they have peaceful recourse when they've been on the receiving end of injustice. <p>Rule of law is what upholds universal human rights. Sometimes, when nobody else will, a judge can stand up on behalf of someone. And in the United States, one of the basic principles that we strongly believe in is, is that the judiciary is most important when it comes to minority rights because the political process oftentimes will recognize the desires of the majority. The question is, when people are on the unpopular side of an issue or a member of a minority group, where can they seek recourse? And oftentimes, it's in the courts. <p>So at our&mdash;at their best, our courts are venues where justice and equality can be realized for women and children and the poor, for marginalized groups, for victims of discrimination, victims of violence. But as I mentioned earlier, I think it's also a critical ingredient for economic development and prosperity in Africa. <p>I mentioned to President Sall of Senegal, who I was visiting with before I came here, that trade and investment around the world increasingly flows to places where there are rules and regulations that are fair and predictable, where assets and intellectual property are protected. And the courts play a vital role in that process. <p>So I wanted to have this meeting to hear from you about how we can be helpful and encouraging in building even stronger judiciaries and systems of law around the continent. The United States is proud to work with partners across Africa to strengthen independent judiciaries and help prepare future jurists. So I want to hear your thoughts, your challenges, and I want to hear from you how you think the United States can be most helpful in continuing the work that you were already doing. <p>So again, thank you for your hospitality, Mr. Chief Justice. Thanks to all of you who have, in some cases, traveled from a very long way to be here, and with that, let me give the press a moment to depart so we can have a good conversation.\" "
"147" "\"Hey! Well, the&mdash;I want to thank the President of Senegal, but also the mayor of Goree and the museum curator here. Obviously, it's a very powerful moment whenever I can travel with my family, but especially for Michelle and Malia and my mother-in-law to be able to come here and to fully appreciate the magnitude of the slave trade, to get a sense, in a very intimate way, of the incredible inhumanity and hardship that people faced before they made the Middle Passage and that crossing. <p>And I think more than anything, what it reminds us of is that we have to remain vigilant when it comes to the defense of people's human rights, because I'm a firm believer that humanity is fundamentally good, but it's only good when good people stand up for what's right. And this is a testament to, when we're not vigilant in defense of what's right, what can happen. <p>And so it's always powerful for me to visit countries outside of the United States generally, but obviously, for an African American&mdash;and an African American President&mdash;to be able to visit this site, I think, gives me even greater motivation in terms of the defense of human rights around the world. All right? <p>Thank you, guys.\" "
"148" "\"[<i>At this point, President Sall made remarks in French, which were translated by an interpreter, as follows.</i>] <p><i>President Sall.</i> Your Excellency, Mr. President Barack Obama; distinguished First Lady Michelle Obama; distinguished First Lady of Senegal Marieme Sall; distinguished members of the American delegation; distinguished Speaker of the Parliament; distinguished Prime Minister; Madame President of the Economic, Social and Environmental Council; distinguished senior ministers; distinguished ministers; honorable Members of Parliament; Your Excellencies, distinguished Ambassadors; dear friends and dear guests. <p>Mr. President, 3 months after having warmly received me at the White House, you are visiting me with your wife, your children, and the important delegation accompanying you. And you have honored us by choosing Senegal as your entry point to Africa for your first visit to the continent since your brilliant reelection last November. <p>In relationships between states, every choice conveys a symbol and a message. My fellow countrymen and myself, we understand and appreciate your visit as a token of friendship and esteem for us. This feeling, Mr. President, is mutual, and it is for you and for your great people. <p>[<i>President Sall spoke in English.</i>] <p>We welcome you, Mr. President, and First Lady Michelle Obama. We wish you and your delegation a pleasant stay in Senegal, the Land of Teranga. <p>[<i>President Sall spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter, as follows.</i>] <p>Ties between the American and Senegalese peoples are ancient, robust, and trustworthy. And the circumstances of history have bequeathed common memories to us. <p>In 1776, when the American people started their historical struggle for their freedom, in the north of Senegal, some revolutionaries rebelled the same year for the same principles of justice and freedom against excesses committed by the authorities in place. In 1761, according to Johnson and Patricia Smith in \\"Africans in America,\\" it was said that in 1761, a 7-year-old Senegalese girl embarked for a one-way trip. She disembarked in Boston. Phillis Wheatley, which was her slave name, thanks to her creative genius, became the first known black poetess in the United States of America. <p>This was a ray of light in our common history, even in the dark hours of slavery. More than two centuries later, another trip has united us, and this time, as free citizens. And, Mr. President, you wrote this in your bestseller, \\"Dreams From My Father.\\" It was in Spain, in a bus bound for Barcelona; you took a liking to one of my compatriots, Mr. Sell&eacute; Dieng. I hope he is here in this room. Selle&mdash;he's here. <p>[<i>Sell&eacute; Dieng shook hands with President Obama.</i>] <p>Thank you, Sell&eacute;. <p>And, Mr. President, so in this book of yours, you said that he told you about his wife he had left behind in Senegal and of his dream to earn enough money to bring her over. He offered coffee and water to you: a coincidental meeting, a shared history, a small gesture of kindness, you said. This spontaneous gesture of human fraternity expresses the values uniting Senegalese and Americans, definite and strong values: faith in God, family and work, openness to the other, and attachment to democracy and freedom. <p>This is the reason why so many of my fellow countrymen feel so comfortable in your country and are successfully pursuing their American Dream. In Harlem, we have \\"Little Senegal\\" when you go to the 16th Street. It's well known to all our compatriots. We would like to thank the American people for their tradition of hospitality. <p>I would like to also commend the excellent quality of our bilateral relations. Our two countries are cooperating for peace and a safer world, rid of scourges of terrorism and cross-border crime. I commend your leadership, particularly in these times when the situation here in the Sahel has become a global threat and deserves special attention. I hope our countries can put together a joint strategy in response to this new challenge. <p>In the economic and social fields, we have a robust partnership with the commitment of the Peace Corps in Senegal for more than half a century, USAID's actions and the existence of other aid instruments such as AGOA and the Millennium Challenge Account. Mr. President, I cannot forget that during the preelection turmoil, which our country went through in 2011 and 2012, the United States of America maintained their trust in the maturity and resilience of the Senegalese people and relentlessly supported our democratic tradition. We greatly appreciated this gesture of solidarity in between peoples with common values. <p>Today, as agreed to in Washington, I would like to confirm our will to forge ahead with you: forge ahead for the promotion of democracy and good governance in the spirit of our commitments stemming from the last G-8 summit; forge ahead in opening new opportunities of partnership between our countries; forge ahead for the promotion of the youth; for the growth and prosperity of our peoples in a safer world. <p>[<i>President Sall spoke in English.</i>] <p>Looking back to more than 50 years of commitment and achievement between our two countries, I am confident that even greater opportunities are laying ahead. And I want to tell you and the great American people that we are more than willing to go forward in our renewed partnership. And we are ready; yes, we are ready; and yes, we can. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>President Sall spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter, as follows.</i>] <p>Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, I'm happy to raise a toast to the health and well-being of our illustrious guests, President Barack Obama of the United States of America, the First Lady Michelle Obama, to whom I'd like to pay my respects; to the health and well-being of their children and their delegation; and to the continuous prosperity of the friendly American people. <p>Long live the United States of America. Long live Senegal. Long live the friendship between Senegal and the United States of America. Thank you, and God bless you. <p><i>President Obama.</i> President Sall, Madame First Lady, distinguished guests and friends: On behalf of myself and Michelle and our children, our entire delegation, we want to thank you for the incredible hospitality that you've shown us today. We have been deeply moved and are deeply appreciative of all the arrangements that you've made. <p>I am told that you have a tradition here of singing poets. Do not worry, I am not going to sing. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I would like to quote from one of your greatest poets&mdash;one of the world's greatest poets&mdash;your first President, L&eacute;opold Senghor. <p>The year after Senegal achieved independence, President Senghor came to the White House and met with President Kennedy. And during his visit to the United States, President Senghor said, \\"Senegal is a small country, but it is a republic which is inspired by the principles of democracy.\\" <p>And here in Senegal, we've seen&mdash;I've seen personally&mdash;the principles of democracy at work in this generation and, I believe, in future generations. Mr. President, I salute you and your administration for seeking what you have called a new mindset, a new consciousness, government that upholds the sanctity of the public good. <p>I've seen the principles of democracy in Senegal's commitment to human dignity. Michelle and I will never forget today's visit to Goree Island, where we looked out that door of no return. The world owes so much to Senegal for preserving this piece of history, one of the world's great heritage sites. <p>And as I said at Goree Island, it's a reminder of the potential in humanity that we can show one another, but it also, I think, reminds us of how vigilant we have to be in upholding the dignity and rights of all people. <p>And finally, I've seen the principle of democracy in the people of Senegal: the citizens that I met with today who stood up for democracy; the young girls that Michelle met today who are busy shaping this nation&mdash;just incredible young women&mdash;because Senegal recognizes the value of women's leadership. <p>And I couldn't be here today if I didn't mention that today, back in the United States, is NBA draft day&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and that there's going to be a team that makes a wise decision by drafting a favorite son of Senegal, Gorgui Dieng, who is an outstanding big man, and maybe the Bulls will get him. So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>So, Mr. President, I want to propose a toast to our gracious hosts, to our two great nations, to the abiding friendship between our peoples. <i>&Agrave; votre sant&eacute;. Salut.</i> Thank you.\" "
"149" "\"Well, as all of you saw, I just had a wonderful opportunity to visit this expo and meet some remarkable men and women who are helping us to meet an urgent challenge that affects nearly 900 million people around the world: chronic hunger and the need for long-term food security. <p>Here in Africa, thanks to the economic progress across the continent, incomes are rising, poverty rates are declining, there's a growing middle class. At the same time, far too many Africans still endure the daily injustice of extreme poverty and hunger. And we're here today because improvements in agriculture can make an enormous difference. Here in Senegal and across Africa, most people are employed in agriculture. And we know that, compared to other sectors, growth in agriculture is far more effective in reducing poverty, including among women. <p>Part of why this work is so important is because, if you want broad-based economic growth in a country like Senegal, starting with these small-scale farmers, putting more income into their pockets ensures that it's not just a few who are benefiting from development, but everybody is benefiting, and it makes an enormous difference. <p>So that's why when I took office, we took&mdash;at new ways that we could provide assistance and partner with countries, and we decided to make food security a priority. We helped mobilize the leading economies around the world on this mission. So this was one of our top priorities at the G-8 meetings that I attended very early on in my Presidency. In the United States, we launched our new initiative called Feed the Future, which works in partnership with 12 African countries. At the G-8 last year, we launched the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition. We kicked it off with Ghana, Ethiopia, and Tanzania. It's already grown by six more countries: Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria, Benin, Malawi, Mozambique, and Burkina Faso. And I'm very pleased about the next step: Senegal will be joining next year. <p>And rather than the old models of simply delivering food aid, the New Alliance takes an innovative approach. African countries are in the lead&mdash;identifying their priorities, devising their own plans&mdash;because they know their countries best. It also means that these programs are far more likely to be sustainable. Companies large and small&mdash;from Africa, but also from around the world&mdash;have pledged to invest in these plans. And there are companies here today making new commitments, bringing total investments in these efforts to $3.7 billion. So what we're doing is we're taking the private funds that are being leveraged and combining those with the aid funds that are being provided not just by the United States, but some of our other partner countries, and as a consequence, we're getting a much bigger bang for the buck. <p>We know this works. Today we're going to be releasing a report that shows progress so far under Feed the Future. We've already helped 7 million small farmers harness new techniques. We've boosted the value of their goods that they sell by more than $100 million, and that means higher incomes for farmers and more opportunities for farmers. And you met some of the farmers here today who are directly benefiting from this program. Not only are they able to improve their own situation, but now they're starting to hire people, and you're suddenly starting to see growth in these rural communities that makes all the difference for a country like Senegal. <p>In a place like Ethiopia, we've been hearing about farmers who are getting new loans, sometimes for small, mechanized products like this that can make all the difference. One farmer said this salary changed his life because he was able now to send his child to school. So this is making a profound difference in the lives of farmers; it's making a profound difference in communities all across the continent. <p>And here at this expo, we're seeing some of these new technologies that will unleash even more progress. That includes how farmers here in Senegal are using their cell phones to share data so they get the best price when they bring their products to market. <p>We've set a goal of lifting 50 million people from poverty within a decade, which is ambitious, but achievable. And given the millions of people that we're already reaching and the enthusiasm that we've seen today, I'm confident we're on our way. So as I said before, I think this is a moral imperative. I believe that Africa is rising and it wants to partner with us, not to be dependent, but to be self-sufficient. And what we're seeing here today are businesspeople, farmers, academics, researchers, scientists, all combining some of the best practices that have been developed over the course now of decades and leveraging it into concrete improvements in people's lives. <p>And I want to just say thank you to Raj Shah, the head of USAID, because Raj is an example of the kind of incredible work that's being done by our Government, helping to coordinate and facilitate this tremendous progress. And I want to thank all the farmers and researchers and workers who have been helping to make this possible here in Senegal and throughout this region. <p>So when people ask what's happening to their taxpayer dollars and foreign aid, I want people to know this money is not being wasted. It's helping feed families. It's helping people to become more self-sufficient. And it's creating new markets for U.S. companies and U.S. goods. It's a win-win situation. And I know that millet and maize and fertilizer doesn't always make for sexy copy, but I very much hope that all the press who were in attendance today generate a story about this, because I think if the American people knew the kind of work that was being done as a consequence of their generosity and their efforts, I think they'd be really proud. <p>So thank you very much, Raj, for the great work. <p><i>United States Agency for International Development Administrator Rajij J. Shah</i>. Thank you, Mr. President.\" "
"150" "\"Hi everybody. A few days ago, I unveiled a new national plan to confront the growing threat of a changing climate. <p>Decades of carefully reviewed science tells us our planet is changing in ways that will have profound impacts on the world we leave our children. Already, we know that the 12 warmest years in recorded history have all come in the last 15 and that last year was the warmest in American history. And while we know no single weather event is caused solely by climate change, we also know that in a world that's getting warmer than it used to be, all weather events are affected by it: more extreme droughts, floods, wildfires, and hurricanes. <p>Those who already feel the effects of a changing climate don't have time to deny it. They're busy dealing with it. The firefighters who brave longer wildfire seasons. The farmers who see crops wilted one year and washed away the next. Western families worried about water that's drying up. <p>The costs of these events can be measured in lost lives and livelihoods, lost homes and businesses, and hundreds of billions of dollars in emergency services and disaster relief. And Americans across the country are already paying the price of inaction in higher food costs, insurance premiums, and the tab for rebuilding. <p>So the question's not whether we need to act. The question is whether we will have the courage to act before it's too late. <p>The national Climate Action Plan I unveiled will cut carbon pollution, protect our country from the impacts of climate change, and lead the world in a coordinated assault on a changing climate. <p>To reduce carbon pollution, I've directed the Environmental Protection Agency to work with States and businesses to set new standards that put an end to the limitless dumping of carbon pollution from our power plants. We'll use more clean energy and waste less energy throughout our economy. <p>To prepare Americans for the impact of climate change we can't stop, we'll work with communities to build smarter, more resilient infrastructure to protect our homes and businesses and withstand more powerful storms. <p>And America will lead global efforts to combat the threat of a changing climate by encouraging developing nations to transition to cleaner sources of energy and by engaging our international partners in this fight. For while we compete for business, we also share a planet, and we must all shoulder the responsibility for its future together. <p>This is the fight America can and will lead in the 21st century. But it will require all of us, as citizens, to do our part. We will need scientists to design new fuels and farmers to grow them. We'll need engineers to devise new technologies and businesses to make and sell them. We'll need workers to man assembly lines that hum with high-tech, zero-carbon components and builders to hammer into place the foundations for a new clean energy age. We'll need to give special care to people and communities unsettled by this transition. And those of us in positions of responsibility will need to be less concerned with the judgment of special interests and well-connected donors and more concerned with the judgment of our children. <p>If you agree with me, I need you to act. Educate your classmates and colleagues, your family and friends. Speak up in your communities. Remind everyone who represents you, at every level of government, that there is no contradiction between a sound environment and a strong economy, and that sheltering future generations against the ravages of climate change is a prerequisite for your vote. <p>We will be judged&mdash;as a people, as a society, and as a country&mdash;on where we go from here. The plan I have put forward to reduce carbon pollution and protect our country from the effects of climate change is the path we need to take. And if we remember what's at stake&mdash;the world we leave to our children&mdash;I'm convinced that this is a challenge that we will meet. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"151" "\"Well, good evening, everyone. President Zuma, Madam Zuma, distinguished guests: Thank you for your incredible hospitality. When I was last here, as a Senator, my entourage was a little smaller. [<i>Laughter</i>] By that I mean no entourage. [<i>Laughter</i>] The Speaker just helpfully showed me a photograph of me and him from that first visit and pointed out that I had no gray hair in the photo&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and that the years had taken their toll. <p>I also want to thank President Zuma's staff for making my staff feel much better, because this is not the first time that a President has come to the podium without notes&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that were supposed to be there. And they are greatly relieved that that does not only happen to them. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Traveling to South Africa the first time was different because part of the thing about not having an entourage is it meant I could go take walks on the streets of Johannesburg and Soweto and Cape Town. And that's how you truly get to appreciate a country: the small interactions with shopkeepers or people who are willing to give you some directions. And I've never forgotten the beauty of this country, the warmth of its people. And tonight I am reminded of that again, and Michelle and I can't thank you enough. <p>I will not speak long. I have spoken enough today; I know Michelle heartily agrees. [<i>Laughter</i>] I will be giving another speech tomorrow about what this nation represents to me and about the future that I believe that we can build together. <p>I'm told that there's a word, a concept that has come to define the way many South Africans see themselves and each other. And I'm not sure it translates easily into English. But it's the recognition that, here on Earth, we're bound together in ways that are sometimes invisible to the eye; that there's a basic oneness to our humanity. It's the belief that we can only achieve true excellence and our full potential by sharing ourselves with each other, by caring for those around us. I believe that you call it <i>Ubuntu.</i> <p>And we feel that spirit tonight. We feel it in the lives of all those, including President Zuma, who endured the prisons and the beatings to end an unjust system so that we might stand here today in a free South Africa. And to President Zuma and to all of you who participated in that struggle, the world will always remember your sacrifice. It's a sacrifice that resonated in the United States in the same way that the U.S. civil rights movement helped to create bonds of solidarity with those in South Africa who were seeking their freedom. <p>We feel that spirit in the bonds between our two peoples that I think are unique in human history. I would not be here were it not for those freedom fighters, and I certainly would not be here if people weren't willing to fight for the principles that both our countries hold dear. <p>Now, America's founding principles&mdash;our belief that \\"all men are created equal\\"&mdash;which would find expression in your Freedom Charter, which declared that this nation \\"belongs to all who live in it, Black and White,\\" with all people \\"enjoying equal rights and opportunities.\\" In time, the tables turned. Just as I believe that many South Africans were inspired by people like Dr. King and Bobby Kennedy, we drew inspiration from your struggle. And your success reminded us that all things were possible, including the improbable idea that a son of an African man might even become an American President. <p>And we feel that spirit&mdash;<i>Ubuntu</i>&mdash;tonight because, we must admit, our minds and our hearts are not fully here because a piece of us, a piece of our heart is with a man and a family who is not far away from here. Much has been said about Madiba today. More will be said in the years to come. This evening I'd simply like to close with the words that he turned to so often himself, in that cell, the poem he read to the others in their darkest moments to give them strength: <p>Out of the night that covers me, <br>Black as the Pit from pole to pole, <br>I thank whatever gods may be <br>For my unconquerable soul. <p>In the fell clutch of circumstance <br>I have not winced nor cried aloud. <br>Under the bludgeonings of chance <br>My head is bloody, but unbowed. <p>Beyond this place of wrath and tears <br>Looms but the Horror of the shade, <br>And yet the menace of the years <br>Finds, and shall find, me unafraid. <p>It matters not how strait the gate, <br>How charged with punishments the scroll, <br>I am the master of my fate: <br>I am the captain of my soul. <p>And so I propose a toast: To a man who has always been a master of his fate, who taught us that we could be the master of ours; to a proud nation and South Africa's unconquerable soul; and to President Zuma and Madam Zuma for their outstanding leadership in carrying on the great traditions of the South African struggle. <i>Pula! </i>\" "
"152" "\"<i>President Obama.</i> Thank you. Please, please, everybody, have a seat. Hello, Cape Town! <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hello! <p><i>President Obama.</i> <i>Thobela. Molweni. Sanibona. Dumelang. Ndaa. Reperile. </i><p><i>Audience members.</i> <i>Reperil</i>e! <p><i>President Obama.</i> See, I've been practicing. <i>How-zit</i>? Did I leave anybody out? All right, I didn't want to leave anybody out here. <p>I want to thank Vice Chancellor Max Price, who's here, and&mdash;as well as Archbishop Njongonkulu. It's wonderful to have them in attendance. <p>I am so happy to be here today. It is wonderful to see all of these outstanding young people. I just had the honor of going to Robben Island with Michelle and our two daughters this afternoon. And this was my second time; I'd had the chance to visit back in 2006. But there was something different about bringing my children. And Malia is now 15, Sasha is 12, and seeing them stand within the walls that once surrounded Nelson Mandela, I knew this was an experience that they would never forget. I knew that they now appreciated, a little bit more, the sacrifices that Madiba and others had made for freedom. <p>But what I also know is, is that because they've had a chance to visit South Africa for a second time now, they also understand that Mandela's spirit could never be imprisoned, because his legacy is here for all to see. It's in this auditorium: young people, Black, White, Indian, everything in between&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;living and learning together in a South Africa that is free and at peace. <p>Obviously, today Madiba's health weighs heavily on our hearts. And like billions all over the world, I&mdash;and the American people&mdash;have drawn strength from the example of this extraordinary leader and the nation that he changed. Nelson Mandela showed us that one man's courage can move the world. And he calls on us to make choices that reflect, not our fears, but our hopes: in our own lives and in the lives of our communities and our countries. And that's what I want to speak to all of you about today. <p>Some of you may be aware of this, but I actually took my first step into political life because of South Africa. This is true. I was the same age as some of you, 19 years old, my whole life ahead of me. I was going to school on a campus in California, not quite as pretty as this one, but similar. And I must confess, I was not always focused on my studies. [<i>Laughter</i>] There were a lot of distractions. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I enjoyed those distractions. <p>And as the son of an African father and a White American mother, the diversity of America was in my blood, but I had never cared much for politics. I didn't think it mattered to me. I didn't think I could make a difference. And like many young people, I thought that cynicism&mdash;a certain ironic detachment&mdash;was a sign of wisdom and sophistication. <p>But then, I learned what was happening here in South Africa. And two young men&mdash;ANC representatives&mdash;came to our college and spoke, and I spent time hearing their stories. And I learned about the courage of those who waged the Defiance Campaign and the brutality leveled against innocent men, women, and children from Sharpseville to Soweto. And I studied the leadership of Luthuli and the words of Biko and the example of Madiba, and I knew that while brave people were imprisoned just off these shores on Robben Island, my own Government in the United States was not standing on their side. And that's why I got involved in what was known as the divestment movement in the United States. <p>It was the first time I ever attached myself to a cause. It was the first time, also, that I ever gave a speech. It was only 2 minutes long&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and I was really just a warmup act at a rally that we were holding demanding that our college divest from apartheid South Africa. So I got up on stage, I started making my speech, and then, as a bit of political theater, some people came out with glasses that looked like security officers and they dragged me off the stage. [<i>Laughter</i>] Fortunately, there are no records of this speech. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I remember struggling to express the anger and the passion that I was feeling and to echo, in some small way, the moral clarity of freedom fighters an ocean away. <p>And I'll be honest with you, when I was done, I did not think that I'd made any difference; I was even a little embarrassed. And I thought to myself, what's a bunch of university kids doing in California that is somehow going to make a difference? It felt too distant from what people were going through in places like Soweto. But looking back, as I look at that 19-year-old young man, I'm more forgiving of the fact that the speech might not have been that great, because I knew&mdash;I know now that something inside me was stirring at the time, something important. And that was the belief that I could be part of something bigger than myself; that my own salvation was bound up with those of others. <p>That's what Bobby Kennedy expressed, far better than I ever could, when he spoke here at the University of Cape Town in 1966. He said, \\"Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.\\" <p>Now, the world was very different on that June day in 1966 when Bobby Kennedy spoke those words: Mandela faced many more years as a prisoner; apartheid was entrenched in this land. In the United States, the victories of the civil rights movement were still uncertain. In fact, on the very day that Kennedy spoke here, the American civil rights leader James Meredith was shot in Mississippi, where he was marching to inspire blacks to register to vote. <p>Those were difficult, troubled, trying times. The idea of hope might have seemed misplaced. It would have seemed inconceivable to people, at that time, that less than 50 years later, an African American President might address an integrated audience at South Africa's oldest university and that this same university would have conferred an honorary degree to a President, Nelson Mandela. It would have seemed impossible. <p>That's the power that comes from acting on our ideals. That's what Mandela understood. But it wasn't just the giants of history who brought about this change. Think of the many millions of acts of conscience that were part of that effort. Think about how many voices were raised against injustice over the years: in this country, in the United States, around the world. Think of how many times ordinary people pushed against those walls of oppression and resistance and the violence and the indignities that they suffered, the quiet courage that they sustained. Think of how many ripples of hope it took to build a wave that would eventually come crashing down like a mighty stream. <p>So Mandela's life, like Kennedy's life, like Gandhi's life, like the life of all those who fought to bring about a new South Africa or a more just America, they stand as a challenge to me, but more importantly, they stand as a challenge to your generation, because they tell you that your voice matters: Your ideals, your willingness to act on those ideals, your choices can make a difference. And if there's any country in the world that shows the power of human beings to affect change, this is the one. You've shown us how a prisoner can become a President. You've shown us how bitter adversaries can reconcile. You've confronted crimes of hatred and intolerance with truth and love, and you wrote into your Constitution the human rights that sustain freedom. <p>And those are only the most publicized aspects of South Africa's transformation, because alongside South Africa's political struggle, other battles have been waged as well to improve the lives of those who, for far too long, have been denied economic opportunity and social justice. <p>During my last journey here in 2006, what impressed me so much was the good works of people on the ground teaching children, caring for the sick, bringing jobs to those in need. In Khayelitsha Township&mdash;I'm still working on some of these&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I met women who were living with HIV. And this is at a time back in 2006, where there were still some challenges in terms of the policies around HIV and AIDS here in South Africa. But they were on the ground, struggling to keep their families together, helping each other, working on behalf of each other. In Soweto, I met people who were striving to carry forward the legacy of Hector Pieterson. At the Rosa Parks Library in Pretoria, I was struck by the energy of students who&mdash;they wanted to capture this moment of promise for South Africa. <p>And this is a moment of great promise. South Africa is one of the world's economic centers. Obviously, you can see it here in Cape Town. In the country that saw the first human heart transplant, new breakthroughs are being made in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. I was just talking to your vice chancellor. People come to this university from over 100 countries to study and teach. In America, we see the reach of your culture, from Freshlyground's concerts to the&mdash;we've got the Nando's just a couple of blocks from the White House. [<i>Laughter</i>] And thanks to the first World Cup ever held on this continent, the world now knows the sound of the vuvuzela<i>.</i> I'm not sure that's, like, the greatest gift that South Africa ever gave. [<i>Laughter</i>] But it&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but progress has also rippled across the African Continent. From Senegal to Cote d'Ivoire to Malawi, democracy has weathered strong challenges. <p>Many of the fastest growing economies in the world are here in Africa, where there is a historic shift taking place from poverty to a growing, nascent middle class. Fewer people are dying of preventable disease. More people have access to health care. More farmers are getting their products to market at fair prices. From microfinance projects in Kampala to stock traders in Lagos to cell phone entrepreneurs in Nairobi, there is an energy here that can't be denied: Africa rising. <p>We know this progress, though, rests on a fragile foundation. We know that progress is uneven. Across Africa, the same institutions that should be the backbone of democracy can, all too often, be infected with the rot of corruption. The same technology that enables record profits, sometimes, means widening a canyon of inequality. The same interconnection that binds our fates makes all of Africa vulnerable to the undertow of conflict. <p>So there is no question that Africa is on the move, but it's not moving fast enough for the child still languishing in poverty in forgotten townships. It's not moving fast enough for the protester who is beaten in Harare or the woman who is raped in Eastern Congo. We've got more work to do, because these Africans must not be left behind. <p>And that's where all of you come in, the young people of Africa. Just like previous generations, you've got choices to make. You get to decide where the future lies. Think about it: Over 60 percent of Africans are under 35 years old, so demographics means young people are going to be determining the fate of this continent and this country. You've got time and numbers on your side, and you'll be making decisions long after politicians like me have left the scene. <p>And I can promise you this: The world will be watching what decisions you make. The world will be watching what you do. Because one of the wonderful things that's happening is, where people used to only see suffering and conflict in Africa, suddenly, now they're seeing opportunity: for resources, for investment, for partnership, for influence. Governments and businesses from around the world are sizing up the continent, and they're making decisions themselves about where to invest their own time and their own energy. And as I said yesterday at a town hall meeting up in Johannesburg, that's a good thing. We want all countries&mdash;China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Europe, America&mdash;we want everybody paying attention to what's going on here, because it speaks to your progress. <p>And I've traveled to Africa on this trip because my bet is on the young people who are the heartbeat of Africa's story. I'm betting on all of you. As President of the United States, I believe that my own Nation will benefit enormously if you reach your full potential. <p>If prosperity is broadly shared here in Africa, that middle class will be an enormous market for our goods. If strong democracies take root, that will enable our people and businesses to draw closer to yours. If peace prevails over war, we will all be more secure. And if the dignity of the individual is upheld across Africa, then I believe Americans will be more free as well, because I believe that none of us are fully free when others in the human family remain shackled by poverty or disease or oppression. <p>Now, America has been involved in Africa for decades. But we are moving beyond the simple provision of assistance, foreign aid, to a new model of partnership between America and Africa: a partnership of equals that focuses on your capacity to solve problems and your capacity to grow. Our efforts focus on three areas that shape our lives: opportunity, democracy, and peace. <p>So first off, we want a partnership that empowers Africans to access greater opportunity in their own lives, in their communities, and for their countries. <p>As the largest economy on the continent, South Africa is part of a trend that extends from south to north, east to west: More and more African economies are poised to take off. And increased trade and investment from the United States has the potential to accelerate these trends, creating new jobs and opportunities on both sides of the Atlantic. <p>So I'm calling for America to up our game when it comes to Africa. We're bringing together business leaders from America and Africa to deepen our engagement. We're going to launch new trade missions and promote investment from companies back home. We'll launch an effort in Addis to renew the African Growth and Opportunity Act to break down barriers to trade, and tomorrow I'll discuss a new trade Africa initiative to expand our ties across the continent, because we want to unleash the power of entrepreneurship and markets to create opportunity here in Africa. <p>It was interesting, yesterday at the town hall meeting, I had with a number of young people, first three questions had to do with trade, because there was a recognition&mdash;these young people said, I want to start a&mdash;I want to start something. I want to build something, and then I want to sell something. Now, to succeed, these efforts have to connect to something bigger. <p>And for America, this isn't just about numbers on a balance sheet or the resources that can be taken out of the ground. We believe that societies and economies only advance as far as individuals are free to carry them forward. And just as freedom cannot exist when people are imprisoned for their political views, true opportunity cannot exist when people are imprisoned by sickness or hunger or darkness. <p>And so the question we've been asking ourselves is, what will it take to empower individual Africans? <p>For one thing, we believe that countries have to have the power to feed themselves, so instead of shipping food to Africa, we're now helping millions of small farmers in Africa make use of new technologies and farm more land. And through a new alliance of governments and the private sector, we're investing billions of dollars in agriculture that grows more crops, brings more food to market, gives farmers better prices, and helps lift 50 million people out of poverty in a decade. An end to famine, a thriving African agricultural industry, that's what opportunity looks like. That's what we want to build with you. <p>We believe that countries have to have the power to prevent illness and care for the sick. And our efforts to combat malaria and tropical illness can lead to an achievable goal: ending child and maternal deaths from preventable disease. Already, our commitment to fight HIV/AIDS has saved millions and allows us to imagine what was once unthinkable: an AIDS-free generation. And while America will continue to provide billions of dollars in support, we can't make progress without African partners. So I'm proud that by the end of my Presidency, South Africa has determined it will be the first African country to fully manage its HIV care and treatment program. That's an enormous achievement. Healthy mothers, healthy children, strong public health systems, that's what opportunity looks like. <p>And we believe that nations must have the power to connect their people to the promise of the 21st century. Access to electricity is fundamental to opportunity in this age. It's the light that children study by, the energy that allows an idea to be transformed into a real business. It's the lifeline for families to meet their most basic needs. And it's the connection that's needed to plug Africa into the grid of the global economy. You've got to have power. And yet two-thirds of the population in sub-Saharan Africa lacks access to power, and the percentage is much higher for those who don't live in the cities. <p>So today I am proud to announce a new initiative. We've been dealing with agriculture; we've been dealing with health, now we're going to talk about power: Power Africa, a new initiative that will double access to power in sub-Saharan Africa&mdash;double it. We're going to start by investing $7 billion in U.S. Government resources. We're going to partner with the private sector, who themselves have committed more than $9 billion in investment. And in partnership with African nations, we're going to develop new sources of energy. We'll reach more households not just in cities, but in villages and on farms. We'll expand access for those who live currently off the power grid. And we'll support clean energy to protect our planet and combat climate change. So a light where currently there is darkness, the energy needed to lift people out of poverty, that's what opportunity looks like. <p>So this is America's vision: a partnership with Africa that unleashes growth and the potential of every citizen, not just a few at the very top. And this is achievable. There's nothing that I've outlined that cannot happen. But history tells us that true progress is only possible where governments exist to serve their people and not the other way around. <p>If anyone wants to see the difference between freedom and tyranny, let them come here, to South Africa. Here, citizens braved bullets and beatings to claim that most basic right: the ability to be free, to determine your own fate, in your own land. And Madiba's example extended far beyond that victory. Now, I mentioned yesterday at the town hall, like America's first President, George Washington, he understood that democracy can only endure when it's bigger than just one person. So his willingness to leave power was as profound as his ability to claim power. <p>The good news is that this example is getting attention across the continent. We see it in free and fair elections from Ghana to Zambia. We hear it in the voices of civil society. I was in Senegal and met with some civil society groups, including a group called Y'en Marre, which meant \\"fed up\\"&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that helped to defend the will of the people after elections in Senegal. We recognize it in places like Tanzania, where text messages connect citizens to their representatives. And we strengthen it when organizations stand up for democratic principles, like ECOWAS did in Cote d'Ivoire. <p>But this work is not complete. We all know that. Not in those countries where leaders enrich themselves with impunity. Not in communities where you can't start a business or go to school or get a house without paying a bribe to somebody. These things have to change. And they have to change not just because such corruption is immoral, but it's also a matter of self-interest and economics. Governments that respect the rights of their citizens and abide by the rule of law: do better, grow faster, draw more investment than those who don't. That's just a fact. <p>Just look at your neighbor Zimbabwe where the promise of liberation gave way to the corruption of power and then the collapse of the economy. Now, after the leaders of this region, led by South Africa, brokered an end to what has been a long-running crisis, Zimbabweans have a new Constitution, the economy is beginning to recover. So there is an opportunity to move forward, but only if there is an election that is free and fair and peaceful, so that Zimbabweans can determine their future without fear of intimidation and retribution. And after elections, there must be respect for the universal rights upon which democracy depends. <p>These are things that America stands for, not perfectly, but that's what we stand for, that's what my administration stands for. We don't tell people who their leaders should be, but we do stand up with those who support the principles that lead to a better life. And that's why we're interested in investing not in strongmen, but in strong institutions: independent judiciaries that can enforce the rule of law, honest police forces that can protect the people's interests instead of their own, an open government that can bring transparency and accountability. And yes, that's why we stand up for civil society&mdash;for journalists and NGOs and community organizers and activists&mdash;who give people a voice. That's why we support societies that empower women, because no country will reach its potential unless it draws on the talents of our wives and our mothers and our sisters and our daughters. <p>Just to editorialize here for a second, because my father's home country of Kenya&mdash;like much of Africa&mdash;you see women doing work and not getting respect. And I tell you, you can measure how well a country does by how it treats its women. And all across this continent, and all around the world, we've got more work to do on that front. <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>]. <p><i>The President. </i>We've got some sisters saying, \\"Amen.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, I know that there are some in Africa who hear me say these things, who see America's support for these values, and say that's intrusive. Why are you meddling? I know there are those who argue that ideas like democracy and transparency are somehow Western exports. I disagree. Those in power who make those arguments are usually trying to distract people from their own abuses. Sometimes, they are the same people who, behind closed doors, are willing to sell out their own country's resource to foreign interests, just so long as they get a cut. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm just telling the truth. <p>Now, ultimately, I believe that Africans should make up their own minds about what serves African interests. We trust your judgment, the judgment of ordinary people. We believe that when you control your destiny, if you've got a handle on your governments, then governments will promote freedom and opportunity, because that will serve you. And it shouldn't just be America that stands up for democracy, it should be Africans as well. So here in South Africa, your democratic story has inspired the world. And through the power of your example, and through your position in organizations like SADC and the African Union, you can be a voice for the human progress that you've written into your own Constitution. You shouldn't assume that that's unique to South Africa. People have aspirations like that everywhere. <p>And this brings me to the final area where our partnership can empower people: the pursuit and protection of peace in Africa. So long as parts of Africa continue to be ravaged by war and mayhem, opportunity and democracy cannot take root. Across the continent, there are places where, too often, fear prevails. From Mali to Mogadishu, senseless terrorism all too often perverts the meaning of Islam&mdash;one of the world's great religions&mdash;and takes the lives of countless innocent Africans. From Congo to Sudan, conflicts fester, robbing men and women and children of the lives that they deserve. In too many countries, the actions of thugs and warlords and drug cartels and human traffickers hold back the promise of Africa, enslaving others for their own purposes. <p>Now, America cannot put a stop to these tragedies alone, and you don't expect us to. That's a job for Africans. But we can help, and we will help. I know there's a lot of talk of America's military presence in Africa. But if you look at what we're actually doing, time and again, we're putting muscle behind African efforts. That's what we're doing in the Sahel, where the nations of West Africa have stepped forward to keep the peace as Mali now begins to rebuild. That's what we're doing in Central Africa, where a coalition of countries is closing the space where the Lord's Resistance Army can operate. That's what we're doing in Somalia, where an African Union force, AMISOM, is helping a new Government to stand on its own two feet. <p>These efforts have to lead to lasting peace, not just words on a paper or promises that fade away. Peace between and within Sudan and South Sudan, so that these governments get on with the work of investing in their deeply impoverished peoples. Peace in the Congo, with nations keeping their commitments, so rights are at last claimed by the people of this war-torn country and women and children no longer live in fear. <p><i>Audience member.</i> That's my country&mdash;[<i>Laughter and applause</i>]. <p><i>The President.</i> Absolutely. <p>Peace in Mali, where people will make their voices heard in new elections this summer. In each of these cases, Africa must lead and America will help. And America will make no apology for supporting African efforts to end conflict and stand up for human dignity. <p>You know, this year marks the 50th anniversary of the OAU, now the African Union; an occasion that is more historic because the AU is taking on these challenges. And I want America to take our engagement not just on security issues, but on environmental issues and economic issues and social issues, educational issues, I want to take that engagement to a whole new level. So I'm proud to announce that next year, I'm going to invite heads of state from across sub-Saharan Africa to a summit in the United States to help launch a new chapter in U.S.-African relations. And as I mentioned yesterday, I'm also going to hold a summit with the next class of our Young African Leaders Initiative, because we want to engage leaders and tomorrow's leaders in figuring out how we can best work together. <p>So let me close by saying this: Governments matter. Political leadership matters. And I do hope that some of you here today decide to follow the path of public service. It can sometimes be thankless, but I believe it is&mdash;can also be a noble life. But we also have to recognize that the choices we make are not limited to the policies and programs of government. Peace and prosperity in Africa and around the world also depends on the attitudes of people. <p>Too often, the source of tragedy, the source of conflict involves the choices ordinary people make that divide us from one another: Black from White, Christian from Muslim, tribe from tribe. Africa contains a multitude of identities, but the nations and people of Africa will not fulfill their promise so long as some use these identities to justify subjugation, an excuse to steal or kill or disenfranchise others. <p>And ultimately, that's the most important lesson that the world learned right here in South Africa. Mandela once wrote: \\"No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.\\" <p>I believe that to be true. I believe that's always been true, from the dawn of the first man to the youth today, and all that came in between here in Africa: kingdoms come and gone; the crucible of slavery and the emergence from colonialism; senseless war, but also iconic movements for social justice; squandered wealth, but also soaring promise. <p>Madiba's words give us a compass in a sea of change, firm ground amidst swirling currents. We always have the opportunity to choose our better history. We can always understand that most important decision: the decision we make when we find our common humanity in one another. That's always available to us, that choice. <p>And I've seen that spirit in the welcoming smiles of children on Goree Island and the children of Mombasa on Kenya's Indian Ocean coast. That spirit exists in the mother in the Sahel who wants a life of dignity for her daughters and in the South African student who braves danger and distance just to get to school. It can be heard in the songs that rise from villages and city streets, and it can be heard in the confident voices of young people like you. <p>It is that spirit&mdash;that innate longing for justice and equality, for freedom and solidarity&mdash;that's the spirit that can light the way forward. It's in you. And as you guide Africa down that long and difficult road, I want you to know that you will always find the extended hand of a friend in the United States of America. <p>Thank you very much. God bless you.\" "
"153" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. Good evening, everybody. Please, please have a seat. I apologize that we we're a little bit late, but some of your colleagues had many things to say, and they were all extremely valuable. And I wanted to spend at least as much time listening as I was speaking. <p>Let me begin by expressing our gratitude to President Kikwete and the people of Dar es Salaam and Tanzania for their incredible hospitality. Thank you to our hosts, the Corporate Council on Africa, for bringing us here together. And I want to acknowledge the Secretary General of the East Africa Community, Richard Sezibera, and the President of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka. I want to thank both of them for their incredible leadership. So please give them a round of applause. <p>And I want to welcome all of you who have come from across the region&mdash;Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi&mdash;and beyond, including the United States. <p>I'm pleased to be joined by leaders from across my administration, including my new U.S. Trade Representative, Mike Froman. Mike, where are you? The&mdash;stand up so everybody knows&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;because Mike will be very busy working to increase trade and commerce between the United States and Africa. We've also got USAID Administrator Raj Shah. We've got a son of Ethiopia who achieved great success in America and now leads our Millennium Challenge Corporation, Daniel Yohannes. And President of the Export-Import Bank Fred Hochberg; Director of U.S. Trade and Development Agency Lee Zak; and our Executive Vice President of OPIC, Mimi Alemayehou. <p>Now, we just had an opportunity to have a terrific conversation with some of you about what we can be doing together to promote investment between our countries and economic growth here in Africa. And that's what I want to just speak on briefly today. <p>This is my final leg of my visit to Africa. And at every stop, one of my main messages has been that even as this continent faces great challenges, this is also a moment of great promise for Africa. And it's a tribute to the extraordinary drive and talents and determination of Africans all across the continent. So yesterday, in Cape Town, I said that I believe this creates opportunities for a new kind of relationship between the United States and Africa: a partnership rooted in equality and shared interests. And it starts by building on the progress that we're seeing and empowering Africans to access even greater economic opportunity. <p>And that's a worthy goal in its own right, but I'm also here because, in a global economy, our fortunes are linked like never before. So more growth and opportunity in Africa can mean more growth and opportunity in the United States. And this is not charity, this is self-interest. And that's why a key element of my engagement with Africa, and a key focus during this trip, has been to promote trade and investment that can create jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. And I believe we can accomplish that, because we've got an enormous opportunity to unleash the next era of African growth. And many of you know it better than I because you're at the forefront of it. <p>Africa is home to many of the world's fastest growing economies. Sectors like retail, telecom, and manufacturing are gaining speed. And here in East Africa, over a decade, the region's economy quadrupled. The world's investing in Africa like never before. In fact, we're close to reaching a historic milestone where foreign aid to Africa is surpassed by foreign investment in Africa. And that's great news. <p>And that growth is changing lives. Poverty rates are coming down. Incomes are going up. More Africans are joining a growing middle class. African consumers are spending more and creating new markets where we can all sell our goods. <p>So I see Africa as the world's next major economic success story. And the United States wants to be a partner in that success. That's why OPIC has tripled its investments in Africa, from hospitals in Ghana to biomass power generation right here in Tanzania. We launched a campaign to encourage more American companies to do business here. And we've increased the value of our financing and support for trade and investment dramatically, to more than $7 billion. <p>And we've seen progress. Over the past decade, under the African Growth and Opportunity Act, African exports to the U.S. have surged and support jobs across the continent. Our exports to Africa have tripled, with Caterpillar, for example, from my home State of Illinois, selling mining trucks to Mozambique. Boeing's selling airplanes to Kenya&mdash;Kenyan Airways. America-made solar-powered water treatment systems sold in Senegal and Cameroon, they're supporting jobs back in Pennsylvania. <p>So we're making progress, but we're here because we know there's a lot more work that has to be done. There's a lot of untapped potential. The entire GDP of sub-Saharan Africa is still less than $2 trillion, which is about the same as Italy. Our entire trade with Africa is about the same as our trade with Brazil or South Korea, countries with a fraction of Africa's population. Of all our exports to the world, only about 2 percent goes to Africa. So I know we could be doing much more together. And let me suggest a few ways where we can make progress. <p>First, to keep our trade growing, we need to renew AGOA. But we've also got to make some decisions about how we can make it more effective. Today, the vast majority of our trade with Africa is with just three countries: South Africa, Nigeria, and Angola. We need to broaden that. We need to make sure more Africans are taking advantage of the opportunity to export to the United States. And one of the best ways to do that is to make sure more African goods can compete in the global marketplace. And that means more opportunities for small and medium-sized companies and entrepreneurs and merchants and farmers, including women. And so I'm pleased that Mike Froman will kick off this process at the next AGOA Forum next month in Addis. <p>But let me be candid: Improving AGOA is not going to be enough. The real answer to unlocking the next era of African growth is not in Washington, it's here in Africa. And during the discussion with business leaders, we've got some terrific ideas about how we can release that energy. <p>First of all, African governments are going to have to take the lead, not because the United States says so, because&mdash;but because that's what works best. And for those willing to do the hard work of the necessary reforms to create a vibrant market economy and business environment, the United States is going to be a steady and eager partner. <p>So, for example, the vast majority of Africans working in agriculture, that's potential that has not been fully tapped. So we need country-led plans that can attract private capital so we're boosting the income of small farmers, which can fuel broad-based economic growth and lift 50 million Africans from poverty, putting some money in the pockets of the agricultural sector: small farmers, small shareholders. Suddenly, you've got customers for a whole range of products, and that gives additional opportunities for African manufacturers or telecom companies or insurance. Tidjane, he always wants me to talk about insurance. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>} <p><i>The President.</i> Yes. <p>For the overwhelming number of Africans who are young, we've got to make sure they've got skills and the networks and the capital to realize their ambitions. So that's one of the reasons I'm announcing the expansion of my Young African Leaders Initiative, so we're investing in the next generation of African leaders in government and nonprofits, but also in business. <p>We know that it has to become easier to do business in Africa. This is something that we had extensive conversations about, and all of you know this better than anyone. You've figured out how to work around the constraints, but we need to tear down these constraints. It still takes way too long&mdash;too many documents, too much bureaucracy&mdash;just to start a business, to build a new facility, to start exporting. And one of the useful comments that came during our discussion is, if we're going to, for example, build a lot of power around Africa, we can't have a 7-year timeframe for building a power plant. We got to move. Things have to go faster. And government can have an impact on that, for good or for ill. <p>So as part of our partnership for growth, we're working with countries like Tanzania and Ghana to make sure rules and regulations are encouraging investment, not scaring it away. And by the way, if we can synchronize regionally between countries so that there is some standardization of how business gets done, that's helpful too, because then people don't have to try to figure out and unlock a different bureaucracy and a different system and different paperwork for even the most routine tasks. <p>We know that strengthening good governance is good business as well, and this is something that I've been emphasizing throughout my trip with leaders and with citizens in Senegal and South Africa and now in Tanzania. No one should have to pay a bribe to start a business or ship their goods. You shouldn't have to hire somebody's cousin who doesn't come to work just to get your job&mdash;get your business done. [<i>Laughter</i>] You shouldn't have to do that. <p>So as part of our global effort against corruption, we're working with countries across Africa to improve governance, advance open government, uphold the rule of law, because trade will flow where rules are predictable and investment is protected. <p>We also know that unleashing Africa's economic potential demands more access to electricity. That's how businesses keep the light on. That's how communities can literally connect to the global economy. And more than two-thirds of the people in sub-Saharan Africa have no access to electricity, even as Africa's potential to produce energy is vast. And that's unacceptable in 2013. <p>So that's why yesterday I announced Power Africa, our initiative to double access to electricity in sub-Saharan Africa. And I want to thank the African Development Bank for its partnership, as well as many companies that have stepped up with commitments, including some here. And I have to say, those who are involved in this process, they continually tell us the problem is not going to be private sector financing. The problem is going to be getting the rules right, creating the framework whereby we can build to scale rapidly. That's what we're committed to doing. <p>We're starting with countries that are making progress already with reforms in the energy sector: Tanzania, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda, Mozambique, and Liberia. And with a focus on cleaner energy, we will initially add 10,000 megawatts of new electricity generation, which expands electricity to 20 million homes and businesses. <p>We also know that many of the greatest opportunities for growth are often in markets right next door, right across the border. But if it's easier for you to sell to Europe than it is to the folks right next door, we've got a problem. That's a constraint on African development and growths. So here in East Africa, by reducing tariffs and pursuing a customs union, you've already doubled trade between your countries in recent years. But we've got to keep working. It should not take longer to ship products between African countries than it does to ship to Europe. A company like Ford shouldn't have to transport cars to Kenya from South Africa by airplane because it's so expensive or unreliable to do it by road or by rail. So you've got to create a situation in which is easier to trade within Africa. <p>So today I'm announcing a new initiative, Trade Africa, to boost trade with and within Africa, starting with the East Africa Community. And as part of this effort, we'll negotiate a regional investment treaty with the EAC. We'll launch a new program to facilitate trade by focusing on moving goods across borders faster and cheaper. We'll work with the countries involved to modernize customs; move to single, more efficient border crossings; reduce bottlenecks; reduce the roadblocks that stymie the flow of goods to market. <p>And we're focused on specific goals. So moving goods faster between ports like Dar es Salaam and Mombasa to Burundi and Rwanda in the interior; or reducing the wait times that truckers endure at the border; increasing East African exports to the United States under AGOA by 40 percent; and not simply increasing trade within East Africa&mdash;doubling it. That's our aim. That's what we're&mdash;those are the goals we're setting for ourselves under Trade Africa and here in East Africa. And we intend to be&mdash;we intend this to be the foundation for similar progress regionally that we can do across the continent in years to come. <p>And finally, we're going to sustain our efforts. I'm making this trip early in my second term because I intend for this to be the beginning of a new level of economic engagement with Africa. So I'm announcing today that my new Commerce Secretary, Penny Pritzker, will lead a major trade mission to Africa in her first year. My Treasury Secretary and my Energy Secretary will come to the region as well. We will bring American investors and businesses together in a major conference on doing business in Africa. Other American trade missions next year will focus on forging new partnerships in agriculture and energy and infrastructure. So across the board, we want to step up our game. <p>And the bottom line is this: I want to make sure we're doing everything we can to encourage the new growth we're seeing across Africa and more trade between our countries. And that's what your companies represent. That's what the incredible young men and women from across Africa who I met at our town hall in Soweto represent. I was hearing their stories and the impact they're already having and listening to their hopes and seeing their determination to build their lives and their communities and their countries, and it just reinforced everything I believe about Africa and its people. <p>If people across this continent are just given a chance, if they're just empowered with the skills and the resources and the capital, and government is accelerating and advancing their opportunities as opposed to it being an impediment, they can achieve extraordinary progress. And that's what I believe. And I know that's what you believe. <p>And that's why the United States is going to keep investing in efforts that unleash that potential and its greater&mdash;greatest natural resource, which is its citizens. When we do, I'm absolutely convinced it won't just mean more growth and opportunity for Africa, it will mean greater prosperity for the United States and indeed the world. So thank you very much for participating. Appreciate it. Thank you.\" "
"154" "\"Well, President Kikwete, Madam First Lady, distinguished guests: On behalf of myself and Michelle, our delegation, our daughters, we want to thank you for the incredible warmth and hospitality with which you've greeted us throughout the day. We could not be more grateful. <p>I am not the first American leader to visit this beautiful country. Other Presidents and prominent citizens have come before me. We just came from South Africa, where Robert Kennedy famously spoke of how every time we stand up for an ideal, we send out a \\"tiny ripple of hope.\\" Less known is that after that trip to South Africa, Robert Kennedy also came here to Tanzania. It was a little different back then. Kennedy and his wife Ethel rode in the back of an open truck. The Secret Service has me and Michelle inside a fortified limousine. We call it the Beast. [<i>Laughter</i>] As Kennedy's truck made its way through the crowds, he picked up two boys and let them ride alongside them. The Secret Service doesn't let me do these things. [<i>Laughter</i>] When Kennedy came, it was a public holiday here. I apologize to Tanzanians that you all had to work today. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But while have&mdash;while these times have changed, the good feelings stay the same. We've been deeply touched by the welcome and the warm wishes from the Tanzanian people: along the streets as we came in here, with you tonight. Dar es Salaam means \\"harbor of peace,\\" and we thank you for sharing that sense of peace and brotherhood for which this country and its people have long been known. <p>Mr. President, you've shown wisdom and strength in seeking reforms so that more Tanzanians can enjoy progress, more opportunity. And like me, you're strengthened by a woman who is a leader in her own right. I am told that Mama Kikwete is fond of a traditional Tanzanian saying: \\"My neighbor's child is my child.\\" And that sentiment, I think, also captures the feeling the partnership between our two countries must have. We live thousands of miles apart, but as fellow human beings, we share a sense of obligation to each other, especially to the youngest among us. <p>So you might say an American child is my child. We might say a Tanzanian child is my child. In this way, both of our nations will be looking after all of our children, and we'll be living out the vision of President Nyerere. The core values that he proclaimed for Tanzania also describe what both our countries seek: wisdom, unity, and peace&mdash;<i>hekima, umoja, na amani.</i> <p>So what I'd like to do is to propose a toast, if I can get my water here: To our gracious Tanzanian hosts, to our Tanzanian friends, and to wisdom, unity, and peace that we all seek in the world. <p>[<i>At this point, a toast was offered</i>.] <p>Cheers.\" "
"155" "\"Good morning, everybody. Please have a seat. Well, it is wonderful to be here with President Kikwete. I want to thank everybody from Ubungo Power Plant for this visit. We are here today to focus on one of the biggest hurdles to Africa's economic development: the fact that nearly 70 percent of Africans lack access to electricity. <p>And that's why in my speech in Cape Town, I announced a major new initiative, Power Africa, to double access to electricity here in Africa. Now, the first step that we're going to take is to try to bring electricity to 20 million homes and businesses. <p>And this plant represents the kind of public-private partnership that we want to replicate all across the continent. This facility was idle. But the Tanzanian Government, under President Kikwete's leadership, committed to making reforms in the energy sector. With support from the Millennium Challenge grant, General Electric, and Symbion, they got it up and running again. More Tanzanians got electricity. <p>So Power Africa embraces this model. Public and private resources will be matched with projects led by African countries that are taking the lead on reform. In this case, African Governments commit to energy reforms, the U.S. is committing some $7 billion in support, and private sector companies have already committed more than $9 billion. And this is just the beginning, because we look forward to even more companies joining this effort. <p>So this is a win-win. It's a win for Africans: Families get to electrify their homes; businesses can run their plants; investors can say, if we locate in an African country, that they're going to be able to power up in a reliable way. All this will make economies grow. It's a win for the United States because the investments made here, including in cleaner energy, means more exports for the U.S. and more jobs in the U.S. And obviously, a growing market in Africa will mean more opportunities for all countries. <p>And this reflects&mdash;is representative of my new approach when it comes to development. I believe that the purpose of development should be to build capacity and to help other countries actually stand on their own feet, whether it's in agriculture, in health systems, in electricity. Instead of perpetual aid, development has to fuel investment and economic growth so that assistance is no longer necessary or some of the more successful countries in Africa can start being donors instead of recipients of assistance. <p>But development isn't just about big projects. Sometimes, simple ideas can bring about transformational change. Some of you saw the Soccket, the soccer ball that we were kicking around that generates electricity as it's kicked. I don't want to get too technical, but I thought it was pretty cool. And this is developed by two young women from the U.S., so Soccket turns one of the most popular games in Africa into a source of electricity and progress. And you can imagine this in villages all across the continent. <p>So that's just the example of the kind of creativity that is possible if we've got the public sector and the private sector and the not-for-profit sectors all working together. <p>Now, in order for this to work, though, we all have to feel a sense of urgency. One of the things, Mr. President, that I learned around the business roundtable is: if we are going to electrify Africa, we've got to do it with more speed. We can't have projects that take 7, 8, 9 years to be approved and to get on line. If we're going to make this happen, we've got to cut through the redtape, and that can only happen with leadership like the leadership that President Kikwete has shown. <p>We've got to be able to say, when the environmental studies are done, when the planning is done, when the paperwork is done, we can move this approval process, clear the redtape, make sure that the regulatory structure is in place, and get these things up and running in a timely way. Because it's hard to attract private-sector business if they feel as if their money is going to be tied up forever in uncertainty. So we want to focus on speed, but we also want to do it right. And the United States intends to be a strong partner in this process. <p>This is my last stop on my trip. We're going to be heading home right after this. And as I think about the week that we've spent here, I think about the farmers in Senegal who are harnessing new technologies and, as a consequence, increasing yields; women who started off with 1 hectare now having 16 and doubling or tripling their income and buying a tractor for the first time, and suddenly, they're employing people, and the entire community is benefiting. <p>I think about amazing young Africans that I saw at the town hall meeting down in Soweto, and their eagerness to promote trade, not just to seek aid, to be entrepreneurs and start businesses, and just hoping that the Governments will support them and that the efforts will be made to increase transparency and accountability and to eliminate corruption. <p>I think about the visit here to Tanzania: the incredible progress that's been made in reducing malaria and HIV and tuberculosis, the progress that's been made in terms of education and agricultural improvements, and progress that's being made as represented by this power plant. <p>And I think of all these things, and I see leaders like President Kikwete who are making every effort to do the right thing, and I'm inspired. Because I'm absolutely convinced that, with the right approach, Africa and its people can unleash a new era of prosperity. And that's what Power Africa is all about. That's what Feed the Future is all about. That's what all our efforts are going to be about, is making sure that Africans have the tools to create a better life for their people and that the United States is a partner in that process. It's going to be good for Africa, it's going to be good for the United States, and it's going to be good for the world. <p>So thank you very much, everyone. And most of all, thank you, President Kikwete, for your wonderful hospitality. Thank you.\" "
"156" "\"<i>The President.</i> Come on out guys. [<i>Applause</i>] <p>Hello, everybody. <p><i>Audience members</i>. Hello! <p><i>The President</i>. Welcome to the White House. And Happy Fourth of July! <p>So we've tried to plan a proper Fourth of July celebration. We're grilling some food. We've got the fireworks coming. We've got lots of music. The band fun. is here with us today. And we've got multiple groups from our Marine Band. We've got the Marine concert band. We've got the Dixieland band. We've got the marching band. And we've got Free Country, the country band. <p>So we hope everybody has a great time. We are incredibly grateful for your service, and we're thankful that you get a chance to spend the Fourth here with us. And by the way, it's Malia's birthday, so she is appreciative that you're all going to be wishing her a happy birthday as well. <p>So I don't want to keep you from the food, but let me just say this. There are children all over the world, right now, asking their parents what's so special about today. And maybe some of those little ones are running around, even here in the South Lawn, thinking, well, this is just an excuse for some hotdogs. [<i>Laughter</i>] But it's worth remembering what happened 237 years ago on this date and what it meant to the world. <p>On July 4, 1776, a small band of patriots declared that we were a people created equal, free to think and worship and live as we please; that our destiny would not be determined for us, it would be determined by us. And it was bold and it was brave. And it was unprecedented; it was unthinkable. At that time in human history, it was kings and princes and emperors who made decisions. <p>But those patriots knew there was a better way of doing things, that freedom was possible, and that to achieve their freedom, they'd be willing to lay down their lives, their fortunes, their honor. And so they fought a revolution. And few would have bet on their side, but for the first time of many times to come, America proved the doubters wrong. <p>And now, 237 years later, this improbable experiment in democracy, the United States of America, stands as the greatest nation on Earth. And what makes us great is, not our size or our wealth, but our values and our ideals and the fact that we're willing to fight for them. A land of liberty and opportunity, a global defender of peace and freedom, a beacon of hope for people everywhere who cherish those ideals. <p>And we have also earned it&mdash;you have earned it&mdash;because as part of a long line of folks who are willing to fight for those ideals, we've been able to not only preserve and make more perfect this Union, but also try to spread that light elsewhere. You, the fighting men and women of the United States, and those who came before you, you've played a special role. You've defended our Nation at home and abroad. You fought for our Nation's beliefs to make the world a better and safer place. People in scattered corners of the world live in peace today, are free to write their own futures, because of you. <p>And we've got all of you here today. We've got Army. We've got Navy. We've got Air Force. We've got Marines. We've got Coast Guard. And we've got National Guard. That's all right, National Guard, we love you too. <p>And up here with me are, incredibly, capable and brave men and women from each service branch. And we salute you, one and all. We salute our soldiers, like Specialist Heidi Olson, who, when she was wounded by an IED in Afghanistan, gave lifesaving treatment to another injured soldier, and then another. She had to be ordered to stop and get treatment for herself when the medevac aircraft arrived. And for her courage she was awarded a Bronze Star. Give her a big round of applause. <p>We salute our sailors, like Petty Officer Joe Marcinkowski, who serves wounded warriors at Walter Reed, coordinating their care and supporting their families throughout their recoveries. Thank you, Joe. <p>We salute our airmen, like Staff Sergeant Adam Ybarra, who helped save 9 lives in 11 combat search and mission rescues in Afghanistan in 2012. Give Adam a big round of applause. <p>We salute our marines, like Corporal Amber Fifer, who was shot five times in an attack in Helmand Province and is staying on to serve as a Marine Corps drill instructor. <p>And we salute our Coasties, including Petty Officer Randy Haba, who was one of the first responders to rescue the crew of a ship off the coast of North Carolina when Hurricane Sandy struck and saved the lives of five mariners. <p>So every day, men and women like them, and like all of you, are carrying forward the ideals that inspired that American Dream, 237 years ago. Defending our Nation and our freedoms with strength and with sacrifice is your daily charge. And it's the charge of all of us, the charge of all who serve worldwide, including our troops that are still in harm's way and their families back home. They serve too. And so we think of them, we pray for them. <p>And on behalf of all Americans, I want to say thank you and wish you all a very, very happy Fourth of July. You've earned it. So God bless you. God bless your families. God bless the United States of America. <p>And with that, let me turn it back over to the Marine Band.\" "
"157" "\"Hi, everybody. I hope you all had a safe and happy Fourth of July filled with parades and cookouts, fireworks, and family reunions. <p>We celebrated at the White House with a few hundred members of the military and their families. And we took a moment amid the festivities to remember what our Independence Day is all about: what happened 237 years ago and what it meant to the world. <p>On July 4, 1776, a small band of patriots declared that we were a people created equal, free to think and worship and live as we please. It was a declaration heard around the world: that we were no longer colonists, we were Americans, and our destiny would not be determined for us, it would be determined by us. <p>It was a bold and tremendously brave thing to do. It was also nearly unthinkable. At the time, kings and princes and emperors ruled the world. But those patriots were certain that a better way was possible. And to achieve it, to win their freedom, they were willing to lay it all on the line: their lives, their fortunes, their sacred honor. They fought a revolution. Few would have bet on their side to win, but for the first of many times to come, America proved the doubters wrong. <p>And now, 237 years later, the United States&mdash;this improbable Nation&mdash;is the greatest in the world: a land of liberty and opportunity, a global defender of peace and freedom, a beacon of hope to people everywhere who cherish those ideals. Generations of Americans made our country what it is today&mdash;farmers and teachers, engineers and laborers, entrepreneurs and elected leaders&mdash;people from all walks of life, from all parts of the world, all pulling in the same direction. <p>And now we, the people, must make their task our own: to live up to the words of that Declaration of Independence and secure liberty and opportunity for our own children and for future generations. <p>I want to say a special word of thanks to the men and women of our military, who have played such a vital role in the story of our Nation. You have defended us at home and abroad. And you fought on our Nation's behalf to make the world a better, safer place. People in scattered corners of the world are living in peace today, free to write their own futures, because of you. We are grateful for your service and your sacrifice, especially those still serving in harm's way and your families here at home. <p>So God bless you all, and may God bless the United States of America.\" "
"158" "\"Everybody, please have a seat. Well, thank you so much. <p>Back in 2007, when I was first running for this office, I had the opportunity to visit Google headquarters in Mountain View, in Silicon Valley, to discuss ways we could use technology to allow more citizens to participate in their democracy and bring a Government built largely in the 20th century into the 21st century. <p>After all, we had already set out to build a new type of campaign, one that used technology to bring people together and then trusted them with that technology to organize on their own. And the idea was simple: Instead of bringing more people to the campaign, we wanted to bring the campaign to more people and let them determine its course and its nature. If you wanted to make phone calls or knock on doors, you didn't have to come into a field office first, you could just get the information you needed right on your phone and go out there and do it. If you wanted to get your friends involved, then we had the tools to help you connect. <p>And I very much felt that some of the things that we were doing to help us get elected could also be used once we were elected. If you wanted to share your story, we could help you get your story out. And throughout this process, we created one of the most inclusive and one of the most successful campaigns in American history. <p>Now, once we got to Washington, instead of an operation humming with the latest technology, I had to fight really hard just to keep my BlackBerry. [<i>Laughter</i>] And as anyone knows, dealing with the Federal Government is not always high tech, and it's not always user-friendly. <p>So, over the past 4&frac12; years, we've worked diligently to change that. Just like we did on that campaign, we started by recruiting some of the smartest people from the private sector to work side by side with some of the smartest people in the public sector to help get it done. So that day that I visited Google, I promised to appoint the Nation's first CTO, Chief Technology Officer. And soon after I took office, I did. Today, our Chief Technology Officer, Todd Park, and our Chief Information Officer, Steve VanRoekel, are working with their teams to innovate and apply the best technology to help solve some of our biggest challenges, from creating jobs to reducing health care costs, to keeping our Nation secure. <p>We are the first to confess that progress has not always come quick and major challenges still remain. But we've made huge swaths of your Government more efficient and more transparent, and more accountable than ever before. And we've done it by focusing on three areas. <p>First, we found ways to deliver the services that citizens expect in smarter, faster, and better ways. So, for example, until recently, when a natural disaster struck, teams from FEMA had to rely exclusively on in-person inspections to figure out which families needed help. Now they analyze satellite and aerial imagery and get housing assistance to areas that need it most, more quickly. After Hurricane Sandy, most folks were able to sign up for assistance using FEMA's mobile and web apps, updating and checking the status of their applications. And FEMA agents went door to door in some areas with iPads, helping residents who had lost power and Internet access sign up for disaster relief without leaving their homes; so making sure that we're delivering services better, faster, more efficiently. <p>Second, we've identified new ways to reduce waste and save taxpayers money. So, for example, just by working to get rid of overlapping IT systems, we've identified more than $2.5 billion in savings across the Federal Government, and that's just the beginning. I've proposed and signed into law the elimination of dozens of Federal programs and cut even more that were either duplicative, not working, or no longer needed, saving billions of dollars a year. And the basic principle is simple: Taxpayers deserve the biggest bang for their buck, especially at a time when budgets are tight, and we've got to do a lot more with less. And now anyone visit whitehouse.gov to see your taxpayer receipt. This is a literal receipt that tells you just how and where your tax dollars are being spent. <p>Finally, for the first time in history, we've opened up huge amounts of Government data to the American people and put it on the Internet for free. At data.gov, you can search through and download more than 75,000 data sets, data on everything from what different hospitals charge for different procedures to credit card complaints, to weather and climate measurements. And what's happening is, entrepreneurs and business owners are now using that data&mdash;the people's data&mdash;to create jobs and solve problems that Government can't solve by itself or can't do as efficiently. <p>So there's a company called Opower, for example, that's used open Government data on general energy trends and weather to help families save more than $300 million on their energy bills. There's another company called iTriage&mdash;founded by two emergency room doctors&mdash;that is using freely downloadable data about health care providers from the Department of Health and Human Services to help more than 9 million people find the closest doctors and hospitals that meet their needs. And the list goes on. And these companies have now hired hundreds of people, and they're still hiring. And millions of people have already used these applications that were created as a consequence of releasing this data. <p>So we've made some good progress on all fronts, but now we need to do more. So today I met with all my Cabinet, including a number of new Cabinet members, some of whom have extraordinary private sector experience, and I've directed the Cabinet to develop an aggressive management agenda for my second term that delivers a smarter, more innovative, and more accountable Government for its citizens. And we're going to continue to adopt good ideas from the private sector. <p>I've asked Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the Office&mdash;the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, to lead this effort. And Sylvia was part of a team at OMB that presided over 3 years of budget surpluses in the 1990s. After philanthropic work at the Gates Foundation and the Wal-Mart Foundation, she's come back to help us move this effort forward. <p>She's not the only one. We've also welcomed a new class of Presidential Innovation Fellows, and I'd love for the press to meet some of these folks, because they're extraordinary. These are Americans with vast private sector technology expertise who have volunteered to come serve their country in the private [public]* sector. So, for example, Scott Wu helped found a company that helps recent graduates turn their good ideas into good businesses. And Claire Holroyd used to manage product design for everything from mobile phones to video games. Garren Givens founded an innovative shopping site that adapts to your tastes as you browse. And so they and 40 other Fellows are taking this private sector expertise and bringing it into the Government, making it smarter, making it more user friendly. <p>Today, for example, many online shopping web sites help fill in some of your information so you don't have to enter it every time you log in. As a consequence, we're working on a project called MyUSA that will save you time by doing the same thing with Government forms. And if you're applying for Federal benefits, we think you should be able to track the status of your application in real time, just like you can follow location of a package all the way to your doorstep. These are things that are in the pipeline right now. <p>Currently, when our Government asks for bids on a project, it's usually written in complicated language with complicated requirements that most people don't understand. We're working to make things simpler so it's easier for more small businesses across the country to bid on projects. And we'll help businesses create more jobs doing work that needs to be done. And by opening up more competition to Government contracts, we'll save taxpayers money in the process. <p>We recently relaunched an upgraded, easier healthcare.gov. Beginning October 1, Americans will be able to log on and comparison shop an array of private health insurance plans side by side, just like you go online and compare the best deal on cars or the best deal on computers. Because you'll finally be part of a new pool with millions of other Americans, insurers will actually want to compete for your business. And we've made&mdash;we've worked really hard to make these marketplaces user friendly. So, for example, when the prototype of an application to join the marketplace came in at 21 pages, we rejected it. We said let's do better. It's now three pages long. And by the way, that's a lot shorter than the application you have to fill out for private insurance currently. <p>Last year, I also asked Congress for the authority to reorganize and consolidate the Federal bureaucracy. We're doing a lot of this work administratively, but unfortunately, there are still a bunch of rules, a lot of legislation that has poorly designed some of our agencies and forces folks to engage in bureaucratic jump hoop&mdash;hoop jumping instead of just going ahead and focusing on mission and delivering good service to our citizens. So what we've asked is, let's clean this up. Let's consolidate it. <p>Almost every President from Herbert Hoover to Ronald Reagan had this authority to redesign the Federal Government, the executive branch, to deliver services better, just like every business owner seeking to make sure that his or her company keep pace with the times. Currently, we do not have that capacity. And so I'm going to keep on doing what we can administratively, but we sure could use Congress's help, particularly at a time when Congress is saying they want more efficient Government&mdash;they give a lot of lip service to it&mdash;and we're operating under severe fiscal constraints. <p>It makes sense for us to be able to redesign Government so that it can deliver on the functions that the American people are looking for. We should all want a Government that's smarter, quicker, and more responsive to the needs of the American people. <p>Now, the good news is, America is full of talented, dedicated public servants who are working really hard every day to uphold the public trust. And those of us who believe that Government has a responsibility to guarantee some level of basic security and to make sure everybody gets a fair shot at success&mdash;from the entrepreneur who wants to start a business, to the workers who will work in that business&mdash;we also have a responsibility to make sure that Government works. And that's why I'm glad that we've got people like Scott and Claire and Garren and so many other talented, idealistic men and women who have signed up to help us tackle these challenges. That's why we're so proud that Sylvia is going to be heading this up. <p>And I'm going to be asking more people around the country&mdash;more inventors and entrepreneurs and visionaries&mdash;to sign up to serve. We've got to have the brightest minds to help solve our biggest challenges. And it's a reminder that in this democracy, we the people recognize that this Government belongs to us, and it's up to each of us and every one of us to make it work better. We can't just stand on the sidelines. We can't take comfort in just being cynical. We all have a stake in Government success, because the Government is us. <p>And we're doing things right. When we're tracking weather more effectively, that saves lives for folks who are in the path of a tornado. When we're delivering, effectively, data on improved health care choices, that's going to save lives and reduce costs. And we've got the potential to do so much better than we're doing right now, but we're going to need the help of the private sector and non-for-profits. Most of all, we want to make sure that we're empowering some of the folks who are sitting here today to make sure that they can deliver on the kind of 21st-century Government that the American people want. <p>So thank you very much, everybody. Keep up the good work.\" "
"159" "\"Hey! Thank you so much. Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat. See, everybody is cheering because I've bought their books, I've seen their movies, I buy their records. [<i>Laughter</i>] So we're major contributors here. <p>Well, hello, everybody, and welcome to the White House. Thank you for joining us to celebrate the recipients of the 2012&mdash;because, I guess, this is retrospective&mdash;National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medals. <p>Now, one of the special privileges of this office is getting a chance to honor individuals who have played an important role in my life as well as in the Nation's life. And that's what today is all about: celebrating some extraordinary men and women who've used their talents in the arts and the humanities to open up minds and nourish souls and help us understand what it means to be human and what it means to be an American. <p>I want to give some special thanks to the people who help to preserve and to support that cultural legacy: the Acting Chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Arts, Joan Shigekawa. Give Joan a big round of applause. Where is she? There she is. And her predecessor, the irrepressible Rocco Landesman. As well as the Acting Chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, Carole Watson. Both organizations do an incredible job lifting up some of today's best artists and scholars and helping to cultivate the next generation of talent and intellect. <p>And I'd like to also acknowledge the Cochairs of the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities, George Stevens, Jr. Where's George? There he is. As well as Margo Lion. Where's Margo? Good to see you. As well as Members of Congress who are here today, all of whom support the arts. <p>But we are primarily here to acknowledge these incredible individuals. And frankly, this is just fun for me because I feel like I know you all, because I've enjoyed your performances; your writings have fundamentally changed me, I think, for the better; Marilynne. I believe that. <p>At first glance, this is a pretty diverse group. We've got incredible singers and dancers; we have poets and producers, musicians, playwrights, scholars. They come from all across the country, all around the world. And yet, for all their differences, today's honorees have one thing in common, and that is, they are teachers. Whether they realize it or not, they've taught us about ourselves and about our world. <p>American philosopher Will Durant once wrote that \\"The aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things, but their inward significance.\\" And that's an extraordinary skill: to tell the untold stories of history, to reveal the sculpture that's waiting there in a block of stone, to transform written music into song, to make it look like those planes in space are actually flying like they are. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm just saying, I remember when I first saw \\"Star Wars.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] There's a whole generation that thinks special effects always looked like they do today. [<i>Laughter</i>] But it used to be you'd see, like, the string&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;on the little model spaceships. Anyway, I'm being led astray. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Because the arts and the humanities aren't just a source of entertainment. They challenge us to think and to question and to discover, to seek that inward significance, and that helps us grow and to change and to reach new heights and to understand each other at a time when the world is constantly crying for the capacity to bridge that gap and speak to people who aren't like us. And that's exactly what these artists and these humanists have done by working hard, developing their craft, following their dreams, never giving up. <p>Somebody like Allen Toussaint, who is being honored here for his incredible contributions to the rhythm and blues and jazz music of his beloved New Orleans. After his hometown was battered by Katrina and Allen was forced to evacuate, he did something even more important for his city: He went back. And since then, Allen's devoted his musical talent to lifting up and building up a city. And today, he's taking the stage all over the world, with all kinds of incredible talent, doing everything he can to revive the legendary soul of the Big Easy. <p>Somebody like Ernest Gaines, who grew up as descendent of sharecroppers in the South and farming the same land as his ancestors. He did not let that define his future. Instead, he took that experience and used it to help fill in gaps in American literature with the stories of African American life. And then, Ernest moved back to Louisiana onto the very same land he and his family had once worked. And he spent more than 20 years teaching college students to find their own voices and reclaiming some of the stories of their own families and their own lives. <p>Somebody like Joan Didion, who rightly has earned distinction as one of the most celebrated American writers of her generation. I'm surprised she hasn't already gotten this award. [<i>Laughter</i>] But in her early years, she was in school only sporadically, basically taught herself how to read while she and her family followed her Army office father around the country. She obviously learned quickly. She won a contest for Vogue in college, gave up her dream of being an oceanographer; writing became her world. And today, decades into career, she remains one of our sharpest and most respected observers of American politics and culture. <p>What's true for those three is true for all the recipients here. So many of you have touched me and touched Michelle, and now we're trying to get them to&mdash;Malia and Sasha&mdash;to see some of Anna's work or read \\"Gilead\\" because we want to share that, because we think it was important to us. <p>And we were&mdash;we celebrate people like our honorees here today not just because of their talent, but because they create something new. They create a new space and that becomes a lasting contribution to American life. And that's true for all of these honorees. <p>So together, the men and women with us today have helped us appreciate individual talent, but as I said earlier, they've also helped us to bridge our differences: to recognize all the things we share as Americans, whether it's arts or humanities or sports. <p>Frank, I grew up reading Sports Illustrated, and I think it was very good for me. I don't know about you. [<i>Laughter</i>] Because all these endeavors, they don't discriminate, they don't prejudge; they speak to all of us equally if we're open to it. They're part of all of our common heritage. They convey all these distinct voices and emotions and stories, and that's us. That's who we are. <p>So for more than 200 years, that culture has helped shape our views of democracy and freedom and tolerance and progress. Sometimes, the observations or the incredible art or scholarship that's been done by these honorees are overlooked, but somewhere, they're having an impact. And like Bobby Kennedy talked about, they create \\"ripples of hope.\\" They're like stones in a lake, and it emanates, and we never know exactly how&mdash;or who will be touched by it. But it makes a difference. And it's made us better. <p>And the work that we honor today, the lifetime achievement of these artists and these scholars, reminds us that the human imagination is still the most powerful tool that we have as a people. That's why we celebrate their creativity and the fundamental optimism, the notion that if they work that hard, somebody will actually pay attention. And that's why we have to remain committed to the dreamers and the creators and innovators who fuel that progress and help us light the way ahead, because our children, our grandchildren deserve to grow up in a country where their dreams know no bounds and their ambitions extend as far as their talents and hard work can take them. And it's important that they have examples, people who've carved out a path for them. <p>So I want to thank today's honorees for doing their part to foster that spirit, to enrich our entire Nation. Every one of them has helped us see beyond outward appearances and appreciate the significant&mdash;the significance of what's within. And for that we are incredibly grateful. <p>So it is now my privilege to present these medals to each of them as one of our military aides reads their citations. Lee. <p><i>[At this point, Maj. Samuel \\"Lee\\" Meyer, USMC, Marine Aide to the President, read the citations, and the President presented the medals, assisted by Maj. Michael Wagner, USA, </i><i>Army Aide to the President.]</i> <p>Let's give our honorees one more big round of applause. Hey! You guys also. <p>Well, I could not imagine a more deserving group of honorees. We are thrilled to have them here. <p>Fear not, the party is not over. [<i>Laughter</i>] My understanding is the food here at the White House is not bad. [<i>Laughter</i>] And we may get some nice tunes from our Marine Band; they can play anything, so feel free to make requests. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But to all the honorees, thank you again for enriching our lives in so many different ways. We're going to have an opportunity to see you and your families and take some pictures with the honorees. In the meantime, enjoy the reception. And thank you all. I hope you've enjoyed it. Thank you.\" "
"160" "\"Hi, everybody. Two weeks ago, a large bipartisan majority of Senators voted to pass commonsense, comprehensive immigration reform, taking an important step towards fixing a broken immigration system once and for all. <p>Now, this bill was a compromise, and neither side got everything they wanted. But it was largely consistent with the key principles of commonsense reform that most of us in both parties have repeatedly laid out. If passed, the Senate's plan would build on the historic gains we've made in border security over the past 4 years with the most aggressive border security plan in our history. It would offer a pathway to earned citizenship for the 11 million people who are in this country illegally, a pathway that includes paying penalties, learning English, and going to the end of the line behind everyone trying to come here legally. And it would modernize our legal immigration system to make it more consistent with our values. <p>The Senate's plan would also provide a big boost to our recovery. And on Wednesday, we released a report detailing exactly how big a boost that would be. The report is based on the findings of independent, nonpartisan economists and experts who concluded that, if the Senate's plan becomes law, our economy will be 5 percent larger in two decades compared to the status quo. That's $1.4 trillion added to our economy just by fixing our immigration system. <p>Here in America, we've always been a nation of immigrants. That's what's kept our workforce dynamic, our businesses on the cutting edge, and our economy the strongest in the world. But under the current system, too many smart, hard-working immigrants are prevented from contributing to that success. <p>Immigration reform would make it easier for highly skilled immigrants and those who study at our colleges and universities to start businesses and create jobs right here in America. Foreign companies would be more likely to invest here. The demand for goods and services would go up, creating more jobs for American workers. Every worker and business would be required to pay their fair share in taxes, reducing our deficit by nearly $850 billion over the next two decades. And since a large portion of those taxes go towards retirement programs that millions of Americans depend on, Social Security would actually get stronger over the long term, adding 2 years to the life of the program's trust fund. <p>That's what immigration reform would mean for our economy, but only if we act. If we don't do anything to fix our broken system, our workforce will continue to shrink as baby boomers retire. We won't benefit from highly skilled immigrants starting businesses and creating jobs here. American workers will have to make due with lower wages and fewer protections. And without more immigrants and businesses paying their fair share in taxes, our deficit will be higher, and programs like Social Security will be under more strain. <p>And we've been debating this issue for more than a decade, ever since President Bush first proposed the broad outlines of immigration reform, and I think he gave a very good speech this past week expressing his hope that a bipartisan, comprehensive bill can become law. <p>If Democrats and Republicans, including President Bush and I, can agree on something, that's a pretty good place to start. Now the House needs to act so I can sign commonsense immigration reform into law. And if you agree, tell your Representatives that now is the time. Call or e-mail or post on their Facebook walls and ask them to get this done. Because together, we can grow our economy and keep America strong for years to come. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"161" "\"<i>President Obama.</i> Well, good afternoon, everybody. And on behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the White House. <p>Twenty-three years ago, President George H.W. Bush began a tradition. He knew that across the country every day, Americans were finding ways to serve each other and give back to their communities, often with very few resources and very little recognition. And President Bush knew that their good works were valuable to the people they helped. But beyond that, he knew that their spirit of service was vital to our national character. So he created an award, the Daily Point of Light Award, to recognize Americans who serve their neighbors and communities in innovative ways that inspire us all. <p>And for the rest of his Presidency, nearly every single day, President Bush gave someone a Daily Point of Light Award. And after he left the White House, he kept going and going and going. In between skydiving and other activities&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;he kept going, which should come as no surprise, since we're talking about somebody who has served his country in such extraordinary ways. And when you do a parachute jump at the age of 85, not just a parachute jump, but another parachute jump&mdash;I believe his seventh&mdash;this is somebody who's not going to slow down any time soon. <p>So today we are extraordinarily honored to be joined by the family that helped build the Points of Light Foundation into the world's largest organization dedicated to volunteer service. President Bush, Mrs. Bush, Neil Bush, we want to welcome you. And we also want to recognize Michelle Nunn, the CEO of Points of Light. It's worth applause. <p>Now, this is not the first time President Bush and I have come together for an event like this. Four years ago, I went down to Texas A&M, where President Bush has his library, to help celebrate the 20th anniversary of Points of Light. And I appreciated the warm welcome&mdash;by which I mean the extremely loud \\"howdy\\"&mdash;that I received. [<i>Laughter</i>] I was deeply impressed by how invested the students there are in community service. But most of all, I was moved by how much they love President Bush. <p>And now we've come together to mark another milestone. As of this minute, 4,999 Points of Light Awards have been presented to individuals and organizations across this country. And so now I have the honor of joining President Bush in presenting number 5,000. [<i>Applause</i>] Number 5,000. <p>About 10 years ago, Floyd Hammer and Kathy Hamilton were getting ready to retire. They had been farming for years. They had earned a break. They planned to sail around the world. And then their friend told them about a special place that they should visit along the way: In a village in Tanzania, a volunteer mission was helping to renovate an HIV/AIDS clinic. And Floyd and Kathy thought it sounded like a worthwhile detour. <p>When they arrived in Tanzania, the country was in the third year of a brutal drought. People were starving and dying. Many of them were children. And having seen this, Kathy and Floyd simply had to do something about it. And so their vision of a leisurely retirement was replaced by a new mission: fighting global hunger. Today, the nonprofit they created, Outreach, has distributed free meals to hungry children here in the United States and in more than 15 countries worldwide: to date, more than 233 million meals. They've gone to see many of the kids that they met in Tanzania grow up healthy and strong. And this work, they say, is the most rewarding thing they've ever done. And I have to say, having just been to Tanzania with Michelle, we can attest to how important this kind of work is, how it changes lives. <p>It's also fitting that later this week, on July 18, people around the world will celebrate the legacy of the magnificent public servant, Nelson Mandela, by performing acts of public and community service. And as people look for examples, Outreach provides an extraordinary demonstration of how service can lift people's lives. <p>And so if the purpose of this award is to celebrate Americans who work to make our country and a world a better place&mdash;not for their own advantage or for any ulterior motives, but just to serve, pure and simple&mdash;I can't think of anyone more deserving than Kathy Hamilton and Floyd Hammer. <p>Now, before we actually present this award, I would be remiss if I didn't take a moment to honor the man who made this all possible. He hates this, but I'm going to do it anyway. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Much has been said about President Bush's own extraordinary life of service, but I'm not sure everybody fully appreciates how much he's done to strengthen our country's tradition of service. In addition to this award, he created the first White House office dedicated to promoting voluntarism, and he championed and signed the National and Community Service Act. By Washington standards, it was a modest law. It involved little money; President Bush signed it with little fanfare. But looking back, we see that it sparked a national movement. By laying the groundwork for the Corporation for National and Community Service and AmeriCorps and Senior Corps, it gave tens of millions of Americans meaningful opportunities to serve. <p>And today, thanks to those programs and others like them, and thanks to the passion of leaders like President Bush and citizens who found the same passion over the years, voluntarism has gone from something some people do some of the time to something lots of people do as a regular part of their lives. <p>Since 1989, the number of Americans who volunteer has grown by more than 25 million. Service is up across age groups and across regions. It's now a graduation requirement in many high schools and colleges. It's embedded in the culture of businesses large and small. And speaking for my family, volunteering has brought joy and meaning to Michelle and me and our daughters over the years, and I know that's the case for many of your families too. <p>This national tradition may seem perfectly ordinary to many Americans, especially those who have grown up during this period. But in fact, it reflects tremendous progress. And today, we can say that our country is a better and a stronger force for good in the world because, more and more, we are a people that serve. And for that, we have to thank President Bush and his better half, Barbara, who is just as committed as her husband to service and has dedicated her life to it as well. <p>Now, the Presidents who followed President Bush have had the good sense to continue this work, and not just because one of them calls him Dad. [<i>Laughter</i>] Even after leaving office, President Clinton and both President Bushes have come together to help people affected by natural disasters here at home and around the world, a reminder that service is not a Democratic or a Republican value, but it's a core part of being an American. And at the White House today, we're proud to carry forward that legacy. <p>I created the Office of Social Innovation and Civic Participation to find new ways to use innovation to strengthen service. We expanded the Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships&mdash;originally created by President George W. Bush&mdash;which works closely with religious and community organizations across the country to help Americans in need. <p>And today I want to announce a new task force, with representatives from Cabinet agencies and other departments across the Government, to take a fresh look at how we can better support national service, in particular, on some of our most important national priorities: improving schools, recovering from disasters, and mentoring our kids. And this task force will be led by my team here at the White House, along with Wendy Spencer, who is here&mdash;the CEO of the Corporation for National and Community Service&mdash;who previously led the volunteer commission in Florida for Governor Jeb Bush. So we've got a whole family thing working. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>In times of tight budgets and some very tough problems, we know that the greatest resource we have is the limitless energy and ingenuity of our citizens. And when we harness that energy and create more opportunities for Americans to serve, we pay tribute to the extraordinary example set by President Bush. <p>And just to close on a personal note, Mr. President, I am one of millions of people who have been inspired by your passion and your commitment. You have helped so many Americans discover that they too have something to contribute, that they too have the power to make a difference. <p>You've described for us those thousand points of light, all the people and organizations spread out all across the country who are like stars brightening the lives of those around them. But given the humility that's defined your life, I suspect it's harder for you to see something that's clear to everybody else around you, and that's how bright a light you shine, how your vision and example have illuminated the path for so many others, how your love of service has kindled a similar love in the hearts of millions here at home and around the world. And frankly, just the fact that you're such a gentleman and such a good and kind person, I think, helps to reinforce that spirit of service. <p>So, on behalf of all of us, let me just say that we are surely a kinder and gentler nation because of you, and we can't thank you enough. So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>So it is now my great pleasure to join President Bush and all of you in presenting this extraordinary award to an extraordinary couple who have done so much for so many people. We are very grateful to them. Floyd and Kathy, will you please step up and receive your award? <p>[<i>At this point, the President presented the award, and Outreach Inc. Secretary Treasurer Kathy Hamilton made brief remarks.</i>] <p><i>President Obama.</i> Now I think we're going to have Neil come up and&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Points of Light Chairman Neil Bush.</i> We're going to Dad first. <p><i>President Obama.</i> &mdash;&mdash;going Dad first? Do we have the mike? Here we go. <p><i>Former President George H.W.</i> <i>Bush.</i> My remarks are simply to say something nice about Neil, my son. [<i>Laughter</i>] <i>President Obama.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>Former President Bush.</i> No, it's not hard to do, and he's been very active in this whole concept of volunteering, helping others. And so it's my privilege then to introduce Neil, and first, of course, thank President and Mrs. Obama for this wonderful hospitality. It's like coming home for Barbara and me. With the rest of you just coming to this magnificent house and being greeted by this superb hospitality knows no bounds. <p>So thank you all very much. Now, Neil. <p>[<i>Neil Bush and Points of Light Chief Executive Officer Michelle Nunn each made brief remarks.</i>] <p><i>President Obama.</i> Well, thank you very much, Michelle, for your outstanding work. To all the Points of Light Award recipients, we're proud of you, congratulations, and keep up the great work. You inspire us and make us want to do that much more. Especially when you see young people who are already making such a difference and such an impact, it gives you enormous confidence that America, for all its challenges, will always meet them because we've got this incredible character. <p>And with that, what I want to do is once again thank President and Mrs. Bush for their outstanding leadership. We are so grateful to both of you. I want to thank Neil for his leadership, and I want to make sure that everybody enjoys a reception. And I suspect the food may be pretty good. So&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>So thank you very much, all of you, for being here. All right? Thank you.\" "
"162" "\"Thank you so much, everybody. Well, I want to thank Morgan for that introduction. And I want to thank all of you for being here. There are a couple of people that I want to make sure to especially acknowledge. First of all, the leader of the Democrats in the House of Representatives and somebody who worked harder than just about anybody to get the Affordable Care Act into law: Nancy Pelosi. Please give Nancy a round of applause. <p>We have some outstanding Members of Congress here, some mayors and elected officials who are here. I want to give a special shout-out; I'm not going to introduce all of them because it would take too much time, and I might miss somebody. But there is one person who's standing in front&mdash;sitting in front, who I want to acknowledge just because he has served for decades, and for decades fought to make sure that everybody had affordable, accessible coverage, and we're so proud of him: John Dingell, Congressman from Michigan. <p>So I want to welcome everybody to the White House. Every day, across the country and certainly here in the White House, there are people who are working as we speak to implement the Affordable Care Act and to deliver the security of quality, affordable health care to more Americans. <p>The good news is that starting October 1, new online marketplaces will allow consumers to go online and compare private health care insurance plans just like you'd compare, over the Internet, the best deal on flat-screen TVs or cars or any other product that is important to your lives. And you're going to see competition in ways that we haven't seen before. Insurance companies will compete for your business. And in States that are working hard to make sure this law delivers for their people, what we're seeing is that consumers are getting a hint of how much money they're potentially going to save because of this law. In States like California, Oregon, Washington, new competition, new choices, market forces are pushing costs down. <p>Just yesterday State officials in New York announced that average premiums for consumers who buy insurance in their new marketplace will be at least 50 percent lower next year than they are today. Think about that: 50 percent lower. So for people like Morgan who are self-employed, who have to buy on the individual market, they're suddenly going to see opportunities not just for the rebates we discussed, but also for even greater savings in their monthly premiums. <p>So if you already buy insurance on the individual market&mdash;meaning that you don't get insurance through a big group plan through your employer&mdash;that could mean thousands of dollars a year that can go towards paying a mortgage or putting a kid through college or saving for retirement. And what this means is that hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers who don't have insurance will finally be able to afford it because these exchanges, this big pool is going to reduce the cost. And you may qualify for health care tax credits; middle class families will potentially qualify for these credits that will bring the cost down even more. <p>So this is just an example of how the Affordable Care Act is doing what it's designed to do: deliver more choices, better benefits, a check on rising costs, and higher quality health care. That's what it was designed to do, and we're already seeing those effects take place. <p>Now, I mention all this because yesterday, despite all the evidence that the law is working the way it was supposed to for middle class Americans, Republicans in the House of Representatives voted for nearly the 40th time&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;to dismantle it. We've got a lot of problems in this country, and there's a lot of work that Congress needs to do: get a farm bill passed, get immigration reform done, make sure we've got a budget in place that invests in our children and our future. And yet, instead, we're refighting these old battles. [<i>Laughter</i>] Sometimes, I just try to figure out why. Maybe they think it's good politics. But part of our job here is not to always think about politics. Part of our job here is to sometimes think about getting work done on behalf of the American people, on behalf of the middle class and those who are striving to get into the middle class. <p>And so the progress that we're seeing in California and Washington and Oregon and now New York, that's progress that we want to make sure we're seeing all across the country. Because there are still millions of people out there who not only want to get health insurance, but many who have health insurance who deserve a better deal and deserve the kinds of savings that the Affordable Care Act will offer. <p>Now, if you're one of the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance&mdash;could be through your employer or through Medicare or through Medicaid&mdash;you already have an array of new benefits in place. You don't have to wait until October 1. You're already getting benefits even if you don't know that it's because of the Affordable Care Act. You're getting better protections. You're getting more value for each dollar that you spend on your health care. <p>And that last point&mdash;the issue of getting better value for your buck&mdash;is what I want to focus on today. For years, too many middle class families saw their health care costs go up and up and up, without much explanation as to why or how their money was being spent. But today, because of the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies have to spend at least 80 percent of every dollar that you pay in premiums on your health care: not on overhead, not on profits, but on you. <p>Now, many insurance companies are already exceeding that target, and they're bringing down premiums and providing better value to their customers. But those that aren't now actually have to reimburse you. If they're not spending your premium dollars on your health care&mdash;at least 80 percent of it&mdash;they've got to give you some money back. <p>Last year, millions of Americans opened letters from their insurance companies, but instead of the usual dread that comes from getting a bill&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;they were pleasantly surprised with a check. In 2012, 13 million rebates went out in all 50 States. Another 8.5 [million]* rebates are being sent out this summer, averaging around 100 bucks each. And for families like Morgan's that are working hard, every dollar counts. It makes a difference. <p>As she said during her introduction, she'd been buying insurance on the individual market in Maryland for years. After she got a rebate for the first time&mdash;and I'm quoting Morgan now&mdash;she said, \\"It felt like someone was actually being held accountable for the dollars I was spending on health care.\\" That's one of core principles of the Affordable Care Act: holding insurance companies and providers accountable so that we all get a better deal. <p>Dan Hart, who's here from Chicago, had read these rebates were happening. But he didn't think anything of it until he got a check in the mail for $136. And Dan is a father of two, and as any parent will tell you, those kids, they suck up a lot of money. So&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. Am I right? [<i>Laughter</i>] Absolutely. So he used his rebate to pay some bills. <p>Rick Shewell and Claudia Diamond co-own a stationery store in Arlington, Virginia. They knew about the provisions of the Affordable Care Act, but, Rick said, \\"I figured I'd never see the money.\\" So it was a complete surprise when they got a rebate for $320, put that money right back into their small business. <p>And this is happening all across the country, and it's happening because of the Affordable Care Act. Hasn't been reported on a lot. I bet if you took a poll, most folks wouldn't know when that check comes in that this was because of Obamacare&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that they got this extra money in their pockets. But that's what's happening. <p>Now, even if you don't get a rebate, even if you didn't get a rebate, there's a good chance that these reforms are helping you as well, because one easy way to meet the goal of spending 80 percent of every dollar on care is to charge less for your care. Now, we've got more work to do to get rising health care costs under control. And some of the gains that we've made, some of the progress we've made in slowing the rise of health care costs isn't always passed on to workers. Sometimes, companies may keep it, and they are charging their employees a higher copay or higher deductible or in some way shifting some costs onto some workers. <p>But generally speaking, what we've seen is that health care costs have slowed drastically in a lot of areas since we've passed the Affordable Care Act. We've got a lot more work to do, but health care inflation is not skyrocketing the way it was. And because of this new rule, because of the fact that it improves the value of the coverage that you purchase, last year alone, Americans saved $3.4 billion in lower premiums. That's $3.4 billion on top of these rebates. <p>So that's just one way this law is helping middle class families. But it represents everything the Affordable Care Act means for folks who already have insurance: better benefits, stronger protections, more bang for your buck&mdash;the basic notion that you ought to get what you pay for. <p>Now, I recognize that there are still a lot of folks&mdash;in this town, at least&mdash;who are rooting for this law to fail. Some of them seem to think this law is about me. It's not. I already have really good health care. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>It's about the dad in Maryland who, for the first time ever, saw his family's premiums go down instead of up. It's about the grandma in Oregon whose free mammogram caught her breast cancer before it had a chance to spread. It's about the mom in Arizona who can afford heart surgery for her little girl now that the lifetime cap on her coverage has been lifted. It's about the folks here today who got a little bit of relief. <p>And I'm curious: What do opponents of this law thinks the folks here today should do with the money they were reimbursed? Should they send it back to the insurance companies? Do they think that was a bad idea to make sure that insurance companies are being held accountable? I know that's not what these folks think. <p>So the upshot is, the American people deserve a fair shot. They expect businesses to play by a fair set of rules. And that's why this fight is so important. Our broken health care system threatened the hopes and the dreams of families and businesses across the country who feared that one illness or one accident could cost them everything they'd spent a lifetime building. And step by step, we're fixing that system. <p>It's hard. This is a big country, and the health care industry is massive, and there are tons of providers. And so as we implement, there are going to be glitches, and there are going to be certain States that, for political reasons, are resisting implementation. And we're just steadily working through all that stuff. <p>The same was true when Medicare was started. The same was true when Social Security got started. There were folks who, for political reasons, resisted implementation. But once it got set up, people started saying, this is a pretty good deal, it gives me a little more security. It's part of that basic bargain that if you work hard, if you're doing the right thing, that you can get ahead in this country and that you can provide some basic protections for your family. <p>And health care is at the heart of it; it's part of it. Affordable health care is not some privilege just for the few. It's a basic right that everybody should be able to enjoy. <p>So we're going to keep fighting to secure that right, to make sure that every American gets the care that they need, when they need it, at a price they can afford. That's the America we believe in. That's what families deserve. That's what we're going to keep on working to deliver. We're going to keep on working to make sure many people around this country who are already paying premiums are getting cheaper prices, that the money is being actually spent on their health care, that you're not having to worry about the fine print, and that if you don't have health insurance, you finally are in a position to get some at an affordable price, to give you and your family the kind of security you deserve. <p>That's something everybody should support. That's not something that should be subject to politics. If the folks who have been trying to make political hay out of this thing, if they had some better ideas, I've already told them, I'm happy to hear them. But I haven't heard any so far. [<i>Laughter</i>] What I've heard is just the same old song and dance. We're just going to blow through that stuff and just keep on doing the right thing for the American people. <p>So thank you very much.\" "
"163" "\"Well, I wanted to come out here, first of all, to tell you that Jay is prepared for all your questions and is very much looking forward to the session. The second thing is I want to let you know that over the next couple of weeks, there's going to obviously be a whole range of issues&mdash;immigration, economics, et cetera&mdash;we'll try to arrange a fuller press conference to address your questions. <p>The reason I actually wanted to come out today is not to take questions, but to speak to an issue that obviously has gotten a lot of attention over the course of the last week: the issue of the Trayvon Martin ruling. I gave&mdash;in a preliminary statement right after the ruling on Sunday. But watching the debate over the course of the last week, I thought it might be useful for me to expand on my thoughts a little bit. <p>First of all, I want to make sure that, once again, I send my thoughts and prayers as well as Michelle's to the family of Trayvon Martin and to remark on the incredible grace and dignity with which they've dealt with the entire situation. I can only imagine what they're going through, and it's remarkable how they've handled it. <p>The second thing I want to say is to reiterate what I said on Sunday, which is, there are going to be a lot of arguments about the legal issues in the case; I'll let all the legal analysts and talking heads address those issues. The judge conducted the trial in a professional manner. The prosecution and the defense made their arguments. The juries were properly instructed that in a case such as this, reasonable doubt was relevant, and they rendered a verdict. And once the jury has spoken, that's how our system works. But I did want to just talk a little bit about context and how people have responded to it and how people are feeling. <p>When Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is, Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago. And when you think about why, in the African American community at least, there's a lot of pain around what happened here, I think it's important to recognize that the African American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away. <p>There are very few African American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me. There are very few African American men who haven't had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars. That happens to me, at least before I was a Senator. There are very few African Americans who haven't had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off. That happens often. <p>And I don't want to exaggerate this, but those sets of experiences inform how the African American community interprets what happened one night in Florida. And it's inescapable for people to bring those experiences to bear. The African American community is also knowledgeable that there is a history of racial disparities in the application of our criminal laws, everything from the death penalty to enforcement of our drug laws. And that ends up having an impact in terms of how people interpret the case. <p>Now, this isn't to say that the African American community is naive about the fact that African American young men are disproportionately involved in the criminal justice system, that they're disproportionately both victims and perpetrators of violence. It's not to make excuses for that fact, although black folks do interpret the reasons for that in a historical context. They understand that some of the violence that takes place in poor black neighborhoods around the country is born out of a very violent past in this country and that the poverty and dysfunction that we see in those communities can be traced to a very difficult history. <p>And so the fact that sometimes that's unacknowledged adds to the frustration. And the fact that a lot of African American boys are painted with a broad brush and the excuse is given, \\"Well, there are these statistics out there that show that African American boys are more violent.\\" Using that as an excuse to then see sons treated differently causes pain. <p>I think the African American community is also not naive in understanding that, statistically, somebody like Trayvon Martin was statistically more likely to be shot by a peer than he was by somebody else. So folks understand the challenges that exist for African American boys. But they get frustrated, I think, if they feel that there's no context for it and that context is being denied. And that all contributes, I think, to a sense that if a white male teen was involved in the same kind of scenario, that from top to bottom, both the outcome and the aftermath might have been different. <p>Now, the question for me at least, and I think for a lot of folks, is where do we take this? How do we learn some lessons from this and move in a positive direction? I think it's understandable that there have been demonstrations and vigils and protests, and some of that stuff is just going to have to work its way through, as long as it remains nonviolent. If I see any violence, then I will remind folks that that dishonors what happened to Trayvon Martin and his family. But beyond protests or vigils, the question is, are there some concrete things that we might be able to do? <p>I know that Eric Holder is reviewing what happened down there, but I think it's important for people to have some clear expectations here. Traditionally, these are issues of State and local government, the criminal code. And law enforcement is traditionally done at the State and local levels, not at the Federal levels. <p>That doesn't mean, though, that as a nation, we can't do some things that I think would be productive. So let me just give a couple of specifics that I'm still bouncing around with my staff; so we're not rolling out some five-point plan, but some areas where I think all of us could potentially focus. <p>Number one, precisely because law enforcement is often determined at the State and local level, I think it would be productive for the Justice Department, Governors, mayors to work with law enforcement about training at the State and local levels in order to reduce the kind of mistrust in the system that sometimes currently exists. <p>When I was in Illinois, I passed racial profiling legislation, and it actually did just two simple things. One, it collected data on traffic stops and the race of the person who was stopped. But the other thing was it resourced us training police departments across the State on how to think about potential racial bias and ways to further professionalize what they were doing. And initially, the police departments across the State were resistant, but actually, they came to recognize that if it was done in a fair, straightforward way, that it would allow them to do their jobs better and communities would have more confidence in them and, in turn, be more helpful in applying the law. And obviously, law enforcement has got a very tough job. <p>So that's one area where I think there are a lot of resources and best practices that could be brought to bear if State and local governments are receptive. And I think a lot of them would be. And let's figure out, are there ways for us to push out that kind of training? <p>Along the same lines, I think it would be useful for us to examine some State and local laws to see if it&mdash;if they are designed in such a way that they may encourage the kinds of altercations and confrontations and tragedies that we saw in the Florida case, rather than diffuse potential altercations. <p>I know that there's been commentary about the fact that the \\"Stand Your Ground\\" laws in Florida were not used as a defense in the case. On the other hand, if we're sending a message as a society in our communities that someone who is armed potentially has the right to use those firearms even if there's a way for them to exit from a situation, is that really going to be contributing to the kind of peace and security and order that we'd like to see? <p>And for those who resist that idea that we should think about something like these \\"Stand Your Ground\\" laws, I'd just ask people to consider, if Trayvon Martin was of age and armed, could he have stood his ground on that sidewalk? And do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Mr. Zimmerman, who had followed him in a car, because he felt threatened? And if the answer to that question is at least ambiguous, then it seems to me that we might want to examine those kinds of laws. <p>Number three&mdash;and this is a long-term project&mdash;we need to spend some time in thinking about how do we bolster and reinforce our African American boys. And this is something that Michelle and I talk a lot about. There are a lot of kids out there who need help who are getting a lot of negative reinforcement. And is there more that we can do to give them the sense that their country cares about them and values them and is willing to invest in them? <p>I'm not naive about the prospects of some grand new Federal program. I'm not sure that that's what we're talking about here. But I do recognize that as President, I've got some convening power, and there are a lot of good programs that are being done across the country on this front. And for us to be able to gather together business leaders and local elected officials and clergy and celebrities and athletes and figure out how are we doing a better job helping young African American men feel that they're a full part of this society and that they've got pathways and avenues to succeed, I think that would be a pretty good outcome from what was obviously a tragic situation. And we're going to spend some time working on that and thinking about that. <p>And then, finally, I think it's going to be important for all of us to do some soul-searching. There has been talk about, should we convene a conversation on race? I haven't seen that be particularly productive when politicians try to organize conversations. They end up being stilted and politicized, and folks are locked into the positions they already have. On the other hand, in families and churches and workplaces, there's a possibility that people are a little bit more honest, and at least you ask yourself your own questions about, am I wringing as much bias out of myself as I can? Am I judging people as much as I can, based on not the color of their skin, but the content of their character? That would, I think, be an appropriate exercise in the wake of this tragedy. <p>And let me just leave you with a final thought that, as difficult and challenging as this whole episode has been for a lot of people, I don't want us to lose sight that things are getting better. Each successive generation seems to be making progress in changing attitudes when it comes to race. It doesn't mean we're in a postracial society. It doesn't mean that racism is eliminated. But when I talk to Malia and Sasha, and I listen to their friends, and I see them interact, they're better than we are&mdash;they're better than we were&mdash;on these issues. And that's true in every community that I've visited all across the country. <p>And so we have to be vigilant, and we have to work on these issues. And those of us in authority should be doing everything we can to encourage the better angels of our nature, as opposed to using these episodes to heighten divisions. But we should also have confidence that kids these days, I think, have more sense than we did back then and certainly more than our parents did or our grandparents did and that along this long, difficult journey, we're becoming a more perfect Union, not a perfect Union, but a more perfect Union. All right? <p>Thank you, guys.\" "
"164" "\"Hi, everybody. Three years ago this weekend, we put into place tough new rules of the road for the financial sector so that irresponsible behavior on the part of a few could never again cause a crisis that harms millions of middle class families. <p>As part of that reform, we set up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the first-ever independent consumer watchdog with one job: to protect families from that sort of behavior. <p>Two years ago, I nominated a man named Rich Cordray, a former attorney general from Ohio, to run this consumer protection bureau. But Republicans in the Senate refused to give him a simple up-or-down vote, not because they didn't think he was the right person for the job, but because they didn't like the law that set up the consumer watchdog in the first place. <p>So last year, I acted on my own to put him in charge, because without a Director, the CFPB couldn't use all the tools at its disposal to protect consumers from shady mortgage lenders or unscrupulous credit reporting agencies or predatory lenders who targeted veterans and seniors. And I'm pleased to say that Rich Cordray was finally confirmed this week by a bipartisan vote. <p>Because of the work that's been done at the CFPB over the past 2 years, today, mortgage lenders, student lenders, payday lenders, and credit reporting and debt collection agencies all face greater scrutiny. And if they don't play by the rules, you now have somewhere to go to get some measure of justice. In fact, the CFPB has already addressed more than 175,000 complaints from every State. <p>Today, as part of the CFPB's \\"Know Before You Owe\\" efforts, students and their parents can get a simple report with the information they need to make informed decisions before taking out student loans, and more than 700 colleges have stepped up to make this information clear and transparent. And if you've noticed that some credit card forms are actually easier to understand than they used to be, that's because of the work that Rich's team and others in the administration have done. <p>Today, veterans have the tools they need to defend against dishonest lenders and mortgage brokers who try to prey on them when they come home. Seniors are better protected from someone who sees their home or retirement savings as an easy target. And thanks to the hard work of folks at the CFPB, so far 6 million Americans have gotten more than $400 million in refunds from companies that engaged in unscrupulous practices. That's money we didn't have the power to recover before. <p>You know, we've come a long way over the past 4&frac12; years. Our economy's growing. Our businesses have created 7.2 million new jobs in the past 40 months. We've locked in new safeguards to protect against another crisis and end bailouts for good. And even though more work remains, our financial system is more fair and much more sound than it was. <p>We've still got a long way to go to restore the sense of security that too many middle class families are still fighting to rebuild. But if we keep moving forward with our eyes fixed on that north star of a growing middle class, then I'm confident we'll get to where we need to go. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"165" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! Hello, OFA! Thank you. All right, everybody, sit down, sit down. Thank you. You get me embarrassed. [<i>Laughter</i>] It is good to see all of you. I miss all you guys. I miss you. I missed you. <p>First of all, can everybody please give Bill a big round of applause for the great introduction and the great work he's doing. So proud of him. <p>I want to thank our outstanding partners: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, for being here, and our outstanding Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, for being here. <p>But mainly, I just wanted to see all you guys&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and say hey. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hey! <p><i>The President.</i> Michelle says hey. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hey! <p><i>The President.</i> The girls, they went out to camp. [<i>Laughter</i>] We're a little lonely at home right now. [<i>Laughter</i>] But Bo is still there. Bo says hey. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And it's wonderful just to see all of you from all across the country. I know you guys have all been working hard today, all kinds of training, all kinds of new ideas. Everybody is sharing approaches to how we get folks involved in our democracy and our country. And I could not be prouder of not just the work that you did before the campaign and during the campaign, but more importantly, the work that you're doing now after the campaign. It's inspiring to me. <p>And I had a chance to see some of your fellow organizers backstage and talk to them, and it just reminded me of what an incredible cross-section of people we have involved, from rural areas and big cities, educators, businesspeople, folks who are just committed to making sure that the promise of America is not just left to the professionals here in Washington, because that can cause problems&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but that folks all across the country are consistently involved and engaged and offering their ideas and pushing and prodding the political system to make sure it's responsive to families. <p>And since I first ran for office, I've always said that running for office is not just about getting elected. Now, I believe in winning; winning is good. [<i>Laughter</i>] But you run for office and you win so that you can actually get things done. All right? It's the beginning and not the end of a process. It puts you in a position to then deliver on behalf of the folks that you're fighting for. <p>And I ran in 2008 and I ran in 2012 because I believed that America was forged out of this basic bargain: the idea that if you're willing to work hard, if you're willing to put in the effort, if you're willing to sacrifice and make hard decisions and delay gratification, that if you do all those things, you can make it here in America, regardless of where you come from, what you look like, who you love, what your last name is. That was the idea behind the first campaign, and that was the idea behind everything I did after I was President. <p>And the good news is, because of the work that we've been able to do together, and more importantly, thanks to the grit and determination of the American people, we have made enormous progress over the last 5 years. Things have changed for the better, just like we sought to bring about when we worked so hard back in 2007, 2008. <p>But now we've got to keep the momentum going. In some ways, what we've done is clear away the rubble of this incredible crisis that we went through. And now the challenge is to get back to that first order of business: the challenges that were facing families even before the financial crisis and the great recession hit. <p>And we've gotten back on level ground, but now we've got to keep climbing, we've got to keep going, because there are still too many of our friends and our neighbors and family members who are out there hurting, who are still struggling, who are still treading water. The ground beneath our feet is a little firmer than it was, but we've got a long way to go before middle class families feel secure and before those who are willing to strive to get into the middle class have more ladders of opportunity. <p>So our businesses have created, for example, 7.2 million jobs over the last 40 months. Fastest job growth that we've seen since 1999, which is good. But way too many folks out there are still looking for work. And for those who were lucky enough to have a job, wages and incomes are still flatlined, whereas for the top 1 percent, they're still seeing massive increases in their wealth and incomes. So we've got growing inequality in our society and a continued sense of insecurity when it comes to ordinary families. <p>We've seen record numbers of people go to college. But every young person you meet, they talk about the incredible debt burdens that they're carrying as soon as they graduate, and they wonder whether or not they're going to be able to pay it off given their employment prospects. <p>We've seen health care costs decline&mdash;or health care inflation decline since we put the Affordable Care Act into place. But a lot of those savings still haven't been enjoyed by a lot of ordinary families, haven't been passed on to workers. <p>And so across the board, we've made progress, but we haven't yet delivered on restoring fully that basic bargain that we believed in: the idea that if you act responsibly, you're willing to work hard, that you can make it. <p>So because we've got a lot more work to do, on Wednesday, I'm going to go back to Galesburg, Illinois. We got any Illinoisans here? All right. Folks in the house from Illinois. What, they didn't give you any seats, the people from Illinois? [<i>Laughter</i>] What's going on here? But we're going to Galesburg, Illinois. And the reason is, we're going back to Knox College, which is one of the places where I gave my first&mdash;it's the place where I gave my first big speech after I had been elected to the U.S. Senate. And this was back in 2005, and I talked at that time about the building blocks that we needed to put into place, the foundation, the cornerstones that we needed to make sure that the American Dream is alive and well. <p>And I'm going to talk about where we need to go from here, how we need to put behind us the distractions and the phony debates and nonsense that somehow passes for politics these days and get back to basics, refocus on what it is that everybody is talking about around the kitchen table, what people are talking about day to day with their families. And it's going to be the kickoff to what is essentially several months of us trying to get Washington and the press to refocus on the economy and the struggles that middle class families are going to&mdash;going through, but also for us to start exploring some big and bold ideas, some of which I've offered in the past, some of which will be new, that allow us to consistently, steadily make progress. <p>Now, here's the thing: It will be a pretty good speech. [<i>Laughter</i>] But as we've learned, I've given some pretty good speeches before&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and then things still get stuck here in Washington, which is why I'm going to need your help. We had close to 20 million people who were involved in the last campaign. Think about that: close to 20 million people. We had 4 million people actively contribute in $5 or $10 or $25 increments to the campaign. And let's face it, some of those folks, they just wanted to have dinner with George Clooney. I understand that. [<i>Laughter</i>] But some of them&mdash;most of them, I like to think&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;did so because they believed in the mission and the cause of making sure that we're restoring a sense of what America can be and that we're passing it onto the next generation. <p>So one of our challenges&mdash;and I know what you've been talking about all day&mdash;is how do we keep people involved. And naturally, it's not going to be as full of razzmatazz as a campaign. And first of all, we don't have a billion of dollars to spend. [<i>Laughter</i>] Second of all, there's just something very clear about a campaign and an election date and voting and targeting. <p>Nevertheless, in some ways, this stuff is more important. And that's where all of you come in. How are we going to make sure that we're engaging all the people that we touched during the course of the campaign in this central question of creating a building&mdash;and building a rising, thriving, active, growing middle class? <p>And that's why we've been mobilizing people on a whole range of other issues. It's the reason why we're going to need you to continue to stay involved to get immigration reform across the finish line. Because now is the time for us to get comprehensive immigration reform done. <p>And it's the reason why we're going to need you to stay involved when it comes to climate change and making sure that we are passing on the kind of planet to our children and our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren that is sustainable. <p>It's why we've continued to have you guys get so active on the Affordable Care Act, because starting on October 1, we are going to be able to sign up people for these marketplaces that are going to give people a square deal when it comes to their health insurance. But we can only do it with you. <p>So we've got to get folks activated and involved. And ultimately, what you do day to day, away from the TV cameras, that's what is going to make a powerful difference. In the same way that Bill used some of the skills that he learned during the campaign to now organize around wildfires and environmental issues in Colorado, hopefully, all of you have taken away something from your involvement and made it manifest throughout communities all across the country. We need you to keep on doing that. That's the essence of citizenship. If nothing else, that's what the campaign was about. <p>And I always remind people, I've run my last campaign. Michelle is not sorry about that. [<i>Laughter</i>] I've got a little over 1,200 days left in office. I am going to spend every waking minute of every one of those days thinking about and then acting upon any good ideas out there that are going to help ordinary Americans succeed, that are going to make sure that the next generation believes in the American Dream because they've seen it in their own lives. That's how I'm going to spend my time. I hope that's how you're going to spend your time. Because if you do, I guarantee you, we will continue to make progress, and we will deliver on everything that we talked about in 2008 and 2012. <p>Thank you very much, OFA. I love you guys. Keep it up! Keep it up! Are you still fired up? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Fired up! <p><i>The President.</i> All right.\" "
"166" "\"Hey! Hello, everybody! Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you so much. Everybody, have a seat. We're among friends here; we don't have to be too formal. <p>Well, first of all, those of you who don't know Jon Carson, Jon didn't get on TV much during the campaign, and Messina was hogging all the attention. [<i>Laughter</i>] But there is nobody who is a better grassroots organizer than Jon Carson. And we owe so much to him, and we're so proud of all the work he's doing now. He is outstanding. <p>I want to thank our outstanding Democratic leader in the House of Representatives&mdash;perhaps soon to be Speaker again&mdash;Nancy Pelosi in the house. Fighting the good fight. I could not have a better partner than Nancy. And alongside her is my dear friend&mdash;and I think he probably had to take off, but I just want to still acknowledge him publicly&mdash;Harry Reid is fighting the good fight every single day, and we're so proud of him. <p>So I'm not going to give a long set of remarks, because I know all of you and mostly I just want to hear from you and have a good conversation for about 45 minutes. This week, I'm going to Galesburg, Illinois. I see an Illinois table here, so a number of you know where Galesburg is. Galesburg is where I gave my first big speech after I had been elected to the United States Senate. It was the commencement at Knox College, and it was a speech about the economy. This was in 2005, so well before the financial crisis. The housing bubble was still going strong; people were still maxing out on their credit cards. On paper at least, it looked like the economy was growing. <p>But in this speech, what I said was that the world has changed. Technology, globalization, the weakening of unions, all of this had shifted the basic bargain that had existed basically during the post-World War II era. So that for a lot of folks, the idea that if you worked hard, you could make it, you could get a good job that paid a living wage, that you would have the security of decent health care, that you would be able to retire with dignity and respect, that you could count on your kids having a better future than you did&mdash;that those things were slipping out of the grasp of a lot of folks. <p>And in Galesburg, Illinois, Maytag had been a massive employer there, and Maytag had moved out to Mexico. And what had swept through a lot of towns throughout the Midwest and Northeast had happened in Galesburg, where people were left high and dry. Tax base had declined, unemployment had soared, a lot of folks out of work; the jobs that replaced them generally were jobs that paid a much lower wage. <p>And all these trends that had been taking place were visible at the time&mdash;rising inequality, struggles in the middle class&mdash;but they were papered over to some extent by the bubble. And by the time I took office, the bottom had fallen out. <p>Now, the good news is, over the last 5 years, we fought alongside people like Nancy Pelosi. But most importantly, because of the grit and resilience and determination of the American people, we've been able to clear away the rubble and get back to where we were. <p>The speech I'm going to be giving on Wednesday focuses on the fact that those underlying trends still exist. They are still a central challenge that we face. That there's no more important question for this country than how do we create an economy in which everybody who works hard feels like they can get ahead and feel some measure of security. It isn't to say that other issues are not important. Obviously, if we don't do something about climate change, that has an impact for generations to come. Obviously, if we're not vigilant, we can see a continued erosion in women's rights and civil rights. Obviously, the scourge of gun violence is something that we still have to stay focused on. But what we also know is, is that so many of the issues that we care about are more likely to progress if people feel good about their own lives and their economic situation. <p>So this is going to be more of a thematic speech, and then we're going to follow it up with a series of more concrete proposals, some of which I've made before, some of which will be new. But the key is to try to make sure that this town refocuses on the issues that matter most to people day to day. Because I think a lot of Americans out there, they're watching&mdash;well, they don't watch cable TV, but if they did&mdash;or they're listening to the talking heads, they would say to themselves, this doesn't connect with me and what I'm going through and what my children are going through. <p>And so I'm excited about the speech, not because I think the speech is going to change any minds, but because it gives us an opportunity to refocus attention on the thing that the American people sent me to focus on. And some of the proposals that we've put forward are ones that are going to be very difficult to get through this Congress. Of course, everything is very difficult to get through this Congress. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But our goal, I think, is to lay out a vision and a plan and then to just keep on pushing, not just legislatively, but across the board, so that we're changing the nature of the conversation and focusing on what matters. For us to be able to amplify that, we're going to need OFA to get behind it. And for all of you to be here and to be willing to invest your time and energy and money into that effort makes all the difference in the world. <p>So for that, I'm thankful. And with that, I will take some questions. All right.\" "
"167" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! Please have a seat. Welcome to the White House. And let's give it up for Coach Pitino and the National Champion Louisville Cardinals. <p>Now, I have to start by recognizing a proud graduate of the University of Louisville, Senator Mitch McConnell, who is here. We've got a number other Members of Congress who are here. We've also got Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer in the house. We've got Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway in the house. And I gather we have a whole bunch of fans everywhere. So&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>Today we're here to celebrate a Louisville team that always played hard, that always worked together, that stayed focused on one singular goal, and that is, to bust my bracket. [<i>Laughter</i>] I've been having a tough time lately on my brackets. [<i>Laughter</i>] This year I was close; I had the Cardinals in the title game. But I guess I discounted the motivational power of making your 60-year-old coach promise to get a tattoo if you won. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, we're not going to ask Coach to show it here at the White House&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but I have to hand it to you, Coach, you did not chicken out. You kept your word. And in return, you've got something that will stay with you forever: a shirtless picture of you on the Internet. [<i>Laughter</i>] That will never be erased. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But even if the rest of us don't have a tattoo on our shoulder to serve as a reminder, I think we all agree this is a team we will not forget. It had a swarming defense, and as a consequence, the Cardinals were able to capture their school's third national title, but their first since 1986. They ran off 16 straight wins to end the season. They captured the Big East tournament title. They sailed through the first four games of the NCAA's. <p>In the Final Four, they needed a pair of 3-pointers from walk-on Tim Henderson to mount a late comeback&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Yes. Go ahead and give Tim a big round of applause. [<i>Laughter</i>]. <p>Mounting a late comeback against Wichita State to make the title game. And then against Michigan, they treated us to one of the best championship games that any of us has&mdash;have seen in a very, very long time. Luke Hancock led the way. At one point&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> Luke! <p><i>The President.</i> Luke! Luke! At one point scoring 14 points in a row, including four-straight 3s, before helping to ice the game with a pair of free throws in the final minutes. And that made Luke one of the first&mdash;I believe the first player ever to come off the bench and win the Final Four's most outstanding player. So it's a great testament to him. <p>This win also made Coach Pitino the first coach in history to win a championship at two different schools. And we won't name the other one, right? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Coach Pitino's second title came in the same week that he not only found out that his son been hired as coach at Minnesota, but he had been named to the Basketball Hall of Fame. So he had a pretty good year. And the horse was all right, you know. [<i>Laughter</i>] I think I actually lost some money on that horse, so&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>But Coach understands he didn't do any of this alone. As he said, \\"Players put coaches in the Hall of Fame.\\" And this team had some players. Gorgui Dieng, who is&mdash;by the way, I went to Senegal, and everybody was very excited about Mr. Dieng. Played outstanding. Peyton Siva&mdash;both Gorgui and Peyton were taken in last month's NBA draft. And so we wish them all the best of luck in their next endeavors. <p>Luke earned a spot on Team USA in the World University Games, serving as flag bearer in the opening ceremonies. Russ Smith was a third-team All-America last season. And even though he couldn't be here today, we are all excited to see what Russdiculous has in store for his senior year. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And then, of course, there's Kevin Ware. I told him to say hi to his mom because moms don't like seeing their kids get hurt. And obviously, all of us remember the terrible injury that Kevin suffered. But what we also remember is the love that all of his teammates showed for him, the way that he was on crutches a day later. A week after that, he was up there cutting the nets in Atlanta. Today he's standing here with his teammates, working out, hoping to be ready for fall practice. <p>And that's the kind of resilience and strong spirit that this team has had. They didn't just show it on the court; they showed it in the classroom and in the community. As a team, Cardinals earned just under a 3.3 GPA, which is outstanding. Three players organized a beard-shaving event that raised more than $7,500 for the American Cancer Society. Peyton spent his Christmas morning delivering toys to kids in a children's hospital. And just before this event, the team met with some of our Nation's wounded warriors, who are here in the audience with us now. And we could not be more proud of them and more grateful to them. <p>So I want to thank everybody with the Cardinals organization for their outstanding performances, their leadership, and their contributions not just to Louisville, not just to Kentucky, but to the entire country. <p>Coach, we want to congratulate you again for your amazing leadership. You're a great teacher. Congratulations again on the National Title. And from what I've seen in the preseason polls, we might see you back here at some point. [<i>Laughter</i>] So congratulations. Coach Pitino. <p><i>Head Coach Richard A. Pitino</i>. Thank you. Well, the first gift that we'd like to give our President is&mdash;it's a Louisville Slugger, which is located in Louisville. It says, \\"Nationals Champions,\\" your name on it. And the reason we picked the bat is, some press conferences are difficult, as it is for me. [<i>Laughter</i>] Feel free to use this at any time. <p><i>The President.</i> All right. There you go. You hear that, people? [<i>Laughter</i>] He's talking to you. I like that. Absolutely. <p><i>Coach Pitino.</i> And obviously, the standard jersey. <p><i>The President.</i> There you go. Thank you so much, Coach. <p><i>Coach Pitino.</i> I guess the greatest thing for us: First time you were running, I would always try to get my guys to participate in politics, and they really had very little interest. They were worried about social activities at school. And I said, you guys, when you get the right to vote, you should vote, even if it's local contests. They said, well, we don't really know a whole lot about politics. I said, you need to study it, whether you're a political science major or not. <p>When you ran, I said to my team, okay, how many guys are going to vote, trying to get them to&mdash;encourage them again. And every person, including managers and coaches, all gave me the time that they would have to miss practice to vote. So you&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p><i>The President.</i> That's wonderful. That's a good story. Appreciate it. <p><i>Coach Pitino.</i> This team, I think, is the perfect example of what a team is all about. They suffer together. They cry together. Everything that you've heard in Jimmy V.'s speech is represented with this basketball team. They do their best on the court. They do their best off the court. They love each other. <p>They were so excited to see you today, as&mdash;so were the coaching staff. [<i>Laughter</i>] And we just really, really are proud of what Louisville represents. We're a blue-collar school. Twenty percent of our students have to have a second job to pay for school. We have 26 Fulbright scholars, more than MIT and Dartmouth and a lot of elite universities&mdash;not Harvard&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but most places like that. So we're real, real proud, because they're overachievers. They go beyond it and have to work real hard. It's everything that our President is trying to build with our country. <p>So this is a tremendous capping-off of an unbelievable season. We have Kevin Ware now walking. He'll soon be running. We have two of our players moving on. We have great academic prowess in the classroom. And we got a chance today to cap off a great season with a visit to the White House and meet a President on our team that's very much well loved. So we're very excited. <p>One thing is missing&mdash;if&mdash;for my players. If Michelle was here, they would be off the limits. [<i>Laughter</i>]. <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you, everybody.\" "
"168" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Galesburg! Well, it's good to be home in Illinois! It is good to be back. [<i>Applause</i>] It's good to be back. Thank you, everybody. Everybody, have a seat, have a seat. Well, it is good to be back. <p>I want to, first of all, thank Knox College. I want to thank Knox College and your president, Teresa Amott, for having me here today. Give Teresa a big round of applause. I want to thank your Congresswoman, Cheri Bustos, who's here. Where's Cheri? There she is. We've got Governor Quinn here. I'm told we've got your Lieutenant Governor, Sheila Simon, is here. There she is. Attorney General Lisa Madigan is here. <p>I see a bunch of my former colleagues, some folks who I haven't seen in years and I'm looking forward to saying hi to. One in particular I've got to mention, one of my favorites from the Illinois Senate, John Sullivan is in the house. John was one of my earliest supporters when I was running for the U.S. Senate, and it came in really handy because he's got, like, 10 brothers, and his wife's&mdash;and sisters, and his wife has got 10 brothers and sisters&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;so they've got this entire precinct just in their family. [<i>Laughter</i>] And they all look like John&mdash;the brothers do&mdash;so he doesn't have to go to every event. He can just send one of his brothers out. [<i>Laughter</i>] It is good to see them. <p>Dick Durbin couldn't make it today, but he sends his best. And we love Dick. He is doing a great job. And we've got one of my favorite neighbors, the Senator from Missouri, Claire McCaskill, in the house, because we're going to Missouri later this afternoon. So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>And all of you are here, and it's great to see you. And I hope everybody is having a wonderful summer. The weather is perfect. Whoever was in charge of that, good job. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So, 8 years ago, I came here to deliver the commencement address for the class of 2005. Now, things were a little different back then. For example, I had no gray hair&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;or a motorcade. Didn't even have a prompter. In fact, there was a problem in terms of printing out the speech, because the printer didn't work here, and we had to drive it in from somewhere. [<i>Laughter</i>] But it was my first big speech as your newest Senator. <p>And on the way here, I was telling Cheri and Claire about how important this area was&mdash;one of the areas that I spent the most time in outside of Chicago&mdash;and how much it represented what's best in America and folks who were willing to work hard and do right by their families. And I came here to talk about what a changing economy was doing to the middle class and what we, as a country, needed to do to give every American a chance to get ahead in the 21st century. <p>See, I had just spent a year traveling the State and listening to your stories: of proud Maytag workers losing their jobs when the plant moved down to Mexico&mdash;a lot of folks here remember that; of teachers whose salaries weren't keeping up with the rising cost of groceries; of young people who had the drive and the energy, but not the money to afford a college education. <p>So these were stories of families who had worked hard, believed in the American Dream, but they felt like the odds were increasingly stacked against them. And they were right. Things had changed. <p>In the period after World War II, a growing middle class was the engine of our prosperity. Whether you owned a company or swept its floors or worked anywhere in between, this country offered you a basic bargain: a sense that your hard work would be rewarded with fair wages and decent benefits, the chance to buy a home, to save for retirement, and most of all, a chance to hand down a better life for your kids. <p>But over time, that engine began to stall, and a lot of folks here saw it. That bargain began to fray. Technology made some jobs obsolete. Global competition sends a lot of jobs overseas. It became harder for unions to fight for the middle class. Washington doled out bigger tax cuts to the very wealthy and smaller minimum wage increases for the working poor. <p>And so what happened was that the link between higher productivity and people's wages and salaries was broken. It used to be that, as companies did better, as profits went higher, workers also got a better deal. And that started changing. So the income of the top 1 percent nearly quadrupled from 1979 to 2007, but the typical family's incomes barely budged. <p>And towards the end of those three decades, a housing bubble, credit cards, a churning financial sector was keeping the economy artificially juiced up, so sometimes, it papered over some of these long-term trends. But by the time I took office in 2009 as your President, we all know the bubble had burst, and it cost millions of Americans their jobs, and their homes, and their savings. And I know a lot of folks in this area were hurt pretty bad. And the decades-long erosion that had been taking place&mdash;the erosion of middle class security&mdash;was suddenly laid bare for everybody to see. <p>Now, today, 5 years after the start of that great recession, America has fought its way back. We've fought our way back. So, together, we saved the auto industry, took on a broken health care system. We invested in new American technologies to reverse our addiction to foreign oil. We doubled wind and solar power. Together, we put in place tough new rules on the big banks and protections to crack down on the worst practices of mortgage lenders and credit card companies. We changed a Tax Code too skewed in favor of the wealthiest at the expense of working families, so we changed that, and we locked in tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans, and we asked those at the top to pay a little bit more. <p>So you add it all up, and over the past 40 months, our businesses have created 7.2 million new jobs. This year, we're off to our strongest private sector job growth since 1999. <p>And because we bet on this country, suddenly, foreign companies are too. Right now more Honda&mdash;of Honda's cars are made in America than anyplace else on Earth. Now, Airbus, the European aircraft company, they're building new planes in Alabama. And then American companies like Ford are replacing outsourcing with insourcing; they're bringing jobs back home. <p>We sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before. We produce more natural gas than any country on Earth. We're about to produce more of our own oil than we buy from abroad for the first time in nearly 20 years. The cost of health care is growing at its slowest rate in 50 years. And our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years. <p>So thanks to the grit and resilience and determination of the American people&mdash;of folks like you&mdash;we've been able to clear away the rubble from the financial crisis. We've started to lay a new foundation for stronger, more durable economic growth. And it's happening in our own personal lives as well, right? A lot of us tightened our belts, shed debt, maybe cut up a couple of credit cards, refocused on those things that really matter. <p>As a country, we've recovered faster and gone further than most other advanced nations in the world. With new American revolutions in energy and technology and manufacturing and health care, we're actually poised to reverse the forces that battered the middle class for so long and start building an economy where everyone who works hard can get ahead. <p>But&mdash;and here's the big \\"but\\"&mdash;I'm here to tell you today that we're not there yet. We all know that. We're not there yet. We've got more work to do. Even though our businesses are creating new jobs and have broken record profits, nearly all the income gains of the past 10 years have continued to flow to the top 1 percent. The average CEO has gotten a raise of nearly 40 percent since 2009. The average American earns less than he or she did in 1999. And companies continue to hold back on hiring those who have been out of work for some time. <p>Today, more students are earning their degree, but soaring costs saddle them with unsustainable debt. Health care costs are slowing down, but a lot of working families haven't seen any of those savings yet. The stock market rebound helped a lot of families get back much of what they had lost in their 401(k)s, but millions of Americans still have no idea how they're going to be able to retire. <p>So in many ways, the trends that I spoke about here in 2005&mdash;8 years ago&mdash;the trend of a winner-take-all economy where a few are doing better and better and better, while everybody else just treads water, those trends have been made worse by the recession. And that's a problem. <p>This growing inequality&mdash;not just of result, inequality of opportunity&mdash;this growing inequality, it's not just morally wrong, it's bad economics. Because when middle class families have less to spend, guess what, businesses have fewer consumers. When wealth concentrates at the very top, it can inflate unstable bubbles that threaten the economy. When the rungs on the ladder of opportunity grow farther and farther apart, it undermines the very essence of America: that idea that if you work hard, you can make it here. <p>And that's why reversing these trends has to be Washington's highest priority. [<i>Applause</i>] It has to be Washington's highest priority. It's certainly my highest priority. Unfortunately, over the past couple of years in particular, Washington hasn't just ignored this problem; too often, Washington has made things worse. <p>And I have to say that&mdash;because I'm looking around the room&mdash;I've got some friends here not just who are Democrats; I've got some friends here who are Republicans and who work&mdash;I worked with in the State legislature, and they did great work. But right now what we've got in Washington, we've seen a sizable group of Republican lawmakers suggest that they wouldn't vote to pay the very bills that Congress rang up. And that fiasco harmed a fragile recovery in 2011, and we can't afford to repeat that. <p>Then, rather than reduce our deficits with a scalpel by cutting out programs we don't need, fixing ones that we do need that maybe are in need of reform, making Government more efficient&mdash;instead of doing that&mdash;we've got folks who've insisted on leaving in place a meat cleaver called the sequester that's cost jobs. It's harmed growth. It's hurt our military. It's gutted investments in education and science and medical research. Almost every credible economist will tell you it's been a huge drag on this recovery. And it means that we're underinvesting in the things that this country needs to make it a magnet for good jobs. <p>Then, over the last 6 months, this gridlock has gotten worse. I didn't think that was possible. [<i>Laughter</i>] The good news is, a growing number of Republican Senators are looking to join their Democratic counterparts in trying to get things done in the Senate. So that's good news. For example, they worked together on an immigration bill that economists say will boost our economy by more than a trillion dollars, strengthen border security, make the system work. <p>But you've got a faction of Republicans in the House who won't even give that bill a vote. And that same group gutted a farm bill that America's farmers depend on, but also America's most vulnerable children depend on. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> And if you ask some of these folks&mdash;some of these folks, mostly in the House&mdash;about their economic agenda, how it is that they'll strengthen the middle class, they'll shift the topic to out-of-control Government spending, despite the fact that we've cut the deficit by nearly half as a share of the economy since I took office. <p>Or they'll talk about Government assistance for the poor, despite the fact that they've already cut early education for vulnerable kids. They've already cut insurance for people who've lost their jobs through no fault of their own. Or they'll bring up Obamacare&mdash;this is tried and true&mdash;despite the fact that our businesses have created nearly twice as many jobs in this recovery as businesses had at the same point in the last recovery when there was no Obamacare. So&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> My daughter has insurance now! <p><i>The President.</i> I appreciate that. That's what that's is about. That's what this is about. That's what we've been fighting for. <p>But with this endless parade of distractions and political posturing and phony scandals, Washington has taken its eye off the ball. And I am here to say this needs to stop. This needs to stop. <p>This moment does not require short-term thinking. It does not require having the same old stale debates. Our focus has to be on the basic economic issues that matter most to you, the people we represent. That's what we have to spend our time on and our energy on and our focus on. <p>And as Washington prepares to enter another budget debate, the stakes for our middle class and everybody who is fighting to get into the middle class could not be higher. The countries that are passive in the face of a global economy, those countries will lose the competition for good jobs. They will lose the competition for high living standards. That's why America has to make the investments necessary to promote long-term growth and shared prosperity: rebuilding our manufacturing base, educating our workforce, upgrading our transportation systems, upgrading our information networks. That's what we need to be talking about. That's what Washington needs to be focused on. <p>And that's why, over the next several weeks, in towns across this country, I will be engaging the American people in this debate. I'll lay out my ideas for how we build on the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class in America and what it takes to work your way into the middle class in America: job security with good wages and durable industries, a good education, a home to call your own, affordable health care when you get sick, a secure retirement even if you're not rich, reducing poverty, reducing inequality, growing opportunity. That's what we need. [<i>Applause</i>] That's what we need. That's what we need right now. That's what we need to be focused on. <p>Now, some of these ideas I've talked about before. Some of the ideas I offer will be new. Some will require Congress. Some I will pursue on my own. Some ideas will benefit folks right away. Some will take years to fully implement. But the key is to break through the tendency in Washington to just bounce from crisis to crisis. What we need is not a 3-month plan or even a 3-year plan, we need a long-term American strategy, based on steady, persistent effort, to reverse the forces that have conspired against the middle class for decades. That has to be our project. <p>Now, of course, we'll keep pressing on other key priorities. I want to get this immigration bill done. We still need to work on reducing gun violence. We've got to continue to end the war in Afghanistan, rebalance our fight against Al Qaida. We need to combat climate change. We've got to stand up for civil rights. We've got to stand up for women's rights. <p>So all those issues are important, and we'll be fighting on every one of those issues. But if we don't have a growing, thriving middle class, then we won't have the resources to solve a lot of these problems. We won't have the resolve, the optimism, the sense of unity that we need to solve many of these other issues. <p>Now, in this effort, I will look to work with Republicans as well as Democrats wherever I can. And I sincerely believe that there are members of both parties who understand this moment, understand what's at stake, and I will welcome ideas from anybody across the political spectrum. But I will not allow gridlock or inaction or willful indifference to get in our way. <p>That means whatever executive authority I have to help the middle class, I'll use it. Where I can't act on my own and Congress isn't cooperating, I'll pick up the phone, I'll call CEOs, I'll call philanthropists, I'll call college presidents, I'll call labor leaders. I'll call anybody who can help and enlist them in our efforts. <p>Because the choices that we, the people, make right now will determine whether or not every American has a fighting chance in the 21st century. And it will lay the foundation for our children's future, our grandchildren's future, for all Americans. <p>So let me give you a quick preview of what I'll be fighting for and why. The first cornerstone of a strong, growing middle class has to be, as I said before, an economy that generates more good jobs in durable, growing industries. That's how this area was built. That's how America prospered. Because anybody who was willing to work, they could go out there, and they could find themselves a job, and they could build a life for themselves and their family. <p>Now, over the past 4 years, for the first time since the 1990s, the number of American manufacturing jobs has actually gone up instead of down. That's the good news. But we can do more. So I'm going to push new initiatives to help more manufacturers bring more jobs back to the United States. We're going to continue to focus on strategies to make sure our Tax Code rewards companies that are not shipping jobs overseas, but creating jobs right here in the United States of America. <p>We want to make sure that&mdash;we're going to create strategies to make sure that good jobs in wind and solar and natural gas that are lowering costs and, at the same time, reducing dangerous carbon pollution happen right here in the United States. <p>And something that Cheri and I were talking about on the way over here, I'm going to be pushing to open more manufacturing innovation institutes that turn regions left behind by global competition into global centers of cutting-edge jobs. So let's tell the world that America is open for business. I know there's an old site right here in Galesburg, over on Monmouth Boulevard; let's put some folks to work. <p>Tomorrow I'll also visit the Port of Jacksonville, Florida, to offer new ideas for doing what America has always done best, which is building things. Pat and I were talking before I came&mdash;backstage&mdash;Pat Quinn; he was talking about how I came over the Don Moffitt Bridge. But we've got work to do all across the country. We've got ports that aren't ready for the new supertankers that are going to begin passing through the new Panama Canal in 2 years' time. If we don't get that done, those tankers are going to go someplace else. We've got more than 100,000 bridges that are old enough to qualify for Medicare. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Businesses depend on our transportation systems, on our power grids, on our communications networks. And rebuilding them creates good-paying jobs right now that can't be outsourced. <p>And by the way, this isn't a Democratic idea. Republicans built a lot of stuff. This is the Land of Lincoln. Lincoln was all about building stuff&mdash;first Republican President. And yet, as a share of our economy, we invest less in our infrastructure than we did two decades ago. And that's inefficient at a time when it's as cheap as it's been since the 1950s to build things. It's inexcusable at a time when so many of the workers who build stuff for a living are sitting at home waiting for a call. <p>The longer we put this off, the more expensive it will be and the less competitive we will be. Businesses of tomorrow will not locate near old roads and outdated ports. They'll relocate to places with high-speed Internet, and high-tech schools, and systems that move air and auto traffic faster and, not to mention, will get parents home quicker from work because we'll be eliminating some of these traffic jams. And we can watch all of that happen in other countries and start falling behind, or we can choose to make it happen right here in the United States. <p>In an age when jobs know no borders, companies are also going to seek out the countries that boast the most talented citizens, and they'll reward folks who have the skills and the talents they need; they'll reward those folks with good pay. <p>The days when the wages for a worker with a high school degree could keep pace with the earnings of somebody who got some sort of higher education, those days are over. Everybody here knows that. There are a whole bunch of folks here whose dads or grandpas worked at a plant, didn't need a high school education. You could just go there. If you were willing to work hard, you might be able to get two jobs. And you could support your family, have a vacation, own your home. But technology and global competition, they're not going away. Those old days aren't coming back. <p>So we can either throw up our hands and resign ourselves to diminishing living standards, or we can do what America has always done, which is adapt and pull together and fight back and win. That's what we have to do. <p>And that brings me to the second cornerstone of a strong middle class&mdash;and everybody here knows it&mdash;an education that prepares our children and our workers for the global competition that they're going to face. And if you think education is expensive, wait until you see how much ignorance costs in the 21st century. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>If we don't make this investment, we're going to put our kids, our workers, and our country at a competitive disadvantage for decades. So we have to begin in the earliest years. And that's why I'm going to keep pushing to make high-quality preschool available for every 4-year-old in America. Not just because we know it works for our kids, but because it provides a vital support system for working parents. <p>And I'm going to take action in the education area to spur innovation that don't require Congress. So today, for example, as we speak, Federal agencies are moving on my plan to connect 99 percent of America's students to high-speed Internet over the next 5 years. We're making that happen right now. We've already begun meeting with business leaders and tech entrepreneurs and innovative educators to identify the best ideas for redesigning our high schools so that they teach the skills required for a high-tech economy. <p>And we're also going to keep pushing new efforts to train workers for changing jobs. So here in Galesburg, for example, a lot of the workers that were laid off at Maytag chose to enroll in retraining programs like the one at Carl Sandburg College. And while it didn't pay off for everyone, a lot of the folks who were retrained found jobs that suited them even better and paid even more than the ones they had lost. <p>And that's why I've asked Congress to start a community-college-to-career initiative so that workers can earn the skills that high-tech jobs demand without leaving their hometown. And I'm going to challenge CEOs from some of America's best companies to hire more Americans who've got what it takes to fill that job opening, but have been laid off for so long that nobody is giving their r&eacute;sum&eacute; an honest look. <p><i>Audience member.</i> More talent! <p><i>The President.</i> True that. That too. <p>I'm also going to use the power of my office over the next few months to highlight a topic that's straining the budgets of just about every American family, and that's the soaring cost of higher education. Everybody is touched by this, including your President, who had a whole bunch of loans he had to pay off. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Three years ago, I worked with Democrats to reform the student loan system so that taxpayer dollars stopped padding the pockets of big banks and instead helped more kids afford college. Then, I capped loan repayments at 10 percent of monthly incomes for responsible borrowers, so that if somebody graduated and they decided to take a teaching job, for example, that didn't pay a lot of money, they knew that they were never going to have to pay more than 10 percent of their income and they could afford to go into a profession that they loved. That's in place right now. And this week, we're working with both parties to reverse the doubling of student loan rates that happened a few weeks ago because of congressional inaction. <p>So this is all a good start, but it isn't enough. Families and taxpayers can't just keep paying more and more and more into an undisciplined system where costs just keep on going up and up and up. We'll never have enough loan money, we'll never have enough grant money, to keep up with costs that are going up 5, 6, 7 percent a year. We've got to get more out of what we pay for. <p>Now, some colleges are testing new approaches to shorten the path to a degree or blending teaching with online learning to help students master material and earn credits in less time. In some States, they're testing new ways to fund college based not just on how many students enroll, but how many of them graduate, how well did they do. <p>So this afternoon I'll visit the University of Central Missouri to highlight their efforts to deliver more bang for the buck to their students. And in the coming months, I will lay out an aggressive strategy to shake up the system, tackle rising costs, and improve value for middle class students and their families. It is critical that we make sure that college is affordable for every single American who's willing to work for it. <p>Now, so you've got a good job; you get a good education&mdash;those have always been the key stepping stones into the middle class. But a home of your own has always been the clearest expression of middle class security. For most families, that's your biggest asset. For most families, that's where your life's work has been invested. And that changed during the crisis, when we saw millions of middle class families experience their home values plummeting. The good news is, over the past 4 years, we've helped more responsible homeowners stay in their homes. And today, sales are up, and prices are up, and fewer Americans see their homes underwater. <p>But we're not done yet. The key now is to encourage homeownership that isn't based on unrealistic bubbles, but instead, is based on a solid foundation, where buyers and lenders play by the same set of rules, rules that are clear and transparent and fair. <p>So already, I've asked Congress to pass a really good, bipartisan idea&mdash;one that was championed, by the way, by Mitt Romney's economic adviser&mdash;and this is the idea to give every homeowner the chance to refinance their mortgage while rates are still low so they can save thousands of dollars a year. It will be like a tax cut for families who can refinance. <p>Now, I'm also acting on my own to cut redtape for responsible families who want to get a mortgage but the bank is saying no. We'll work with both parties to turn the page on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and build a housing finance system that's rock solid for future generations. <p>So we've got more work to do to strengthen homeownership in this country. But along with homeownership, the fourth cornerstone of what it means to be middle class in this country is a secure retirement. And I hear from too many people across the country, face to face or in letters that they send me, that they feel as if retirement is just receding from their grasp. It's getting farther and farther away. They can't see it. <p>Now, today, a rising stock market has millions of retirement balances going up, and some of the losses that had taken place during the financial crisis have been recovered. But we still live with an upside-down system where those at the top, folks like me, get generous tax incentives to save, while tens of millions of hard-working Americans who are struggling, they get none of those breaks at all. So as we work to reform our Tax Code, we should find new ways to make it easier for workers to put away money and free middle class families from the fear that they won't be able to retire. <p>And if Congress is looking for a bipartisan place to get started, I should just say, they don't have to look far. We mentioned immigration reform before. Economists show that immigration reform makes undocumented workers pay their full fare&mdash;share of taxes, and that actually shores up the Social Security system for years. So we should get that done. <p>All right. Good job, good education for your kids, home of your own, secure retirement. <p>Fifth, I'm going to keep focusing on health care because middle class families and small-business owners deserve the security of knowing that neither an accident or an illness is going to threaten the dreams that you've worked a lifetime to build. <p>As we speak, we're well on our way to fully implementing the Affordable Care Act. We're going to implement it. Now, if you're one of the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance, either through the job or Medicare or Medicaid, you don't have to do anything, but you do have new benefits and better protections than you did before. You may not know it, but you do. Free checkups, mammograms, discounted medicines if you're on Medicare&mdash;that's what the Affordable Care Act means. You're already getting a better deal. No lifetime limits. <p>If you don't have health insurance, then starting on October 1, private plans will actually compete for your business, and you'll be able to comparison shop online. There will be a marketplace online, just like you'd buy a flat-screen TV or plane tickets or anything else you're doing online, and you'll be able to buy an insurance package that fits your budget and is right for you. <p>And if you're one of the up to half of all Americans who've been sick or have a preexisting condition&mdash;if you look at this auditorium, about half of you probably have a preexisting condition that insurance companies could use to not give you insurance if you lost your job or lost your insurance&mdash;well, this law means that beginning January 1, insurance companies will finally have to cover you and charge you the same rates as everybody else, even if you have a preexisting condition. That's what the Affordable Care Act does. That's what it does. <p>Now, look, I know&mdash;because I've been living it&mdash;that there are folks out there who are actively working to make this law fail. I mean&mdash;and I don't always understand exactly what their logic is here, why they think giving insurance to folks who don't have it and making folks with insurance a little more secure, why they think that's a bad thing. But despite the politically motivated misinformation campaign, the States that have committed themselves to making this law work are finding that competition and choice are actually pushing costs down. <p>So just last week, New York announced that premiums for consumers who buy their insurance in these online marketplaces will be at least 50 percent lower than what they're paying today&mdash;50 percent lower. So folks' premiums in the individual market will drop by 50 percent. And for them and for the millions of Americans who've been able to cover their sick kids for the first time&mdash;like this gentlemen who just said his daughter has got health insurance&mdash;or have been able to cover their employees more cheaply or are able to have their kids who are younger than&mdash;who are 25 or 26 stay on their parent's plan&mdash;for all those folks, you'll have the security of knowing that everything you've worked hard for is no longer one illness away from being wiped out. <p>Now, finally, as we work to strengthen these cornerstones of middle class security&mdash;good job with decent wages and benefits, a good education, home of your own, retirement security, health care security&mdash;I'm going to make the case for why we've got to rebuild ladders of opportunity for all those Americans who haven't quite made it yet, who are working hard, but are still suffering poverty wages, who are struggling to get full-time work. <p>There are a lot of folks who are still struggling out here, too many people in poverty. Here in America, we've never guaranteed success; that's not what we do. More than some other countries, we expect people to be self-reliant. Nobody is going to do something for you. We've tolerated a little more inequality for the sake of a more dynamic, more adaptable economy. That's all for the good. But that idea has always been combined with a commitment to equality of opportunity to upward mobility: the idea that no matter how poor you started, if you're willing to work hard and discipline yourself and defer gratification, you can make it too. That's the American idea. <p>Unfortunately, opportunities for upward mobility in America have gotten harder to find over the past 30 years. And that's a betrayal of the American idea. And that's why we have to do a lot more to give every American the chance to work their way into the middle class. <p>Now, the best defense against all of these forces&mdash;global competition, economic polarization&mdash;is the strength of the community. So we need to&mdash;we need a new push to rebuild rundown neighborhoods. We need new partnerships with some of the hardest hit towns in America to get them back on their feet. And because no one who works full-time in America should have to live in poverty, I am going to keep making the case that we need to raise the minimum wage, because it's lower right now than it was when Ronald Reagan took office. It's time for the minimum wage to go up. <p>We're not a people who allow chance of birth to decide life's biggest winners and losers. And after years in which we've seen how easy it can be for any of us to fall on hard times&mdash;folks in Galesburg, folks in the Quad Cities, you know there are good people who work hard, sometimes, they get a bad break: a plant leaves; somebody gets sick; somebody loses a home. We've seen it in our family and in our friends and in our neighbors. We've seen it happen. And that means we cannot turn our backs when bad breaks hit any of our fellow citizens. <p>So good jobs, a better bargain for the middle class and the folks who are working to get into the middle class, an economy that grows from the middle out, not the top down&mdash;that's where I will focus my energies. That's where I will focus my energies not just for the next few months, but for the remainder of my Presidency. <p>These are the plans that I'll lay out across this country. But I won't be able to do it alone, so I'm going to be calling on all of us to take up this cause. We'll need our businesses, who are some of the best in the world, to pressure Congress to invest in our future. And I'll be asking our businesses to set an example by providing decent wages and salaries to their own employees. And I'm going to highlight the ones that do just that. <p>There are companies like Costco, which pays good wages and offers good benefits. Companies like&mdash;there are companies like the Container Store, that prides itself on training its employees and on employee satisfaction. Because these companies prove that it's not just good for the employees, it's good for their businesses to treat workers well. It's good for America. <p>So I'm going to be calling on the private sector to step up. I will be saying to Democrats, we've got to question some of our old assumptions. We've got to be willing to redesign or get rid of programs that don't work as well as they should. We've got to be willing to&mdash;we've got to embrace changes to cherished priorities so that they work better in this new age. We can't just&mdash;Democrats can't just stand pat and just defend whatever Government's doing. If we believe that Government can give the middle class a fair shot in this new century&mdash;and I believe that&mdash;we've got an obligation to prove it. And that means that we've got to be open to new ways of doing things. <p>And we'll need Republicans in Congress to set aside short-term politics and work with me to find common ground. Now, it's interesting, in the runup to this speech, a lot of reporters say that, well, Mr. President, these are all good ideas, but some of them you've said before; some of them sound great, but you can't get those through Congress. Republicans won't agree with you. And I say, look, the fact is there are Republicans in Congress right now who privately agree with me on a lot of the ideas I'll be proposing. I know because they've said so. But they worry they'll face swift political retaliation for cooperating with me. <p>Now, there are others who will dismiss every idea I've put forward either because they're playing to their most strident supporters or, in some cases, because, sincerely, they have a fundamentally different vision for America: one that says inequality is both inevitable and just; one that says an unfettered free market without any restraints inevitably produces the best outcomes, regardless of the pain and uncertainty imposed on ordinary families and Government is the problem and we should just shrink it as small as we can. <p>In either case, I say to these Members of Congress: I'm laying out my ideas to give the middle class a better shot. So now it's time for you to lay out your ideas. You can't just be against something, you got to be for something. <p>Even if you think I've done everything wrong, the trends I just talked about were happening well before I took office. So it's not enough for you just to oppose me, you got to be for something. What are your ideas? If you're willing to work with me to strengthen American manufacturing and rebuild this country's infrastructure, let's go. If you've got better ideas to bring down the cost of college for working families, let's hear them. If you think you have a better plan for making sure that every American has the security of quality, affordable health care, then stop taking meaningless repeal votes and share your concrete ideas with the country. <p>Repealing Obamacare and cutting spending is not an economic plan. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's not. <p>If you're serious about a balanced, long-term fiscal plan that replaces the mindless cuts currently in place, or if you're interested in tax reform that closes corporate loopholes and gives working families a better deal, I'm ready to work. But you should know that I will not accept deals that don't meet the basic test of strengthening the prospects of hard-working families. This is the agenda we have to be working on. <p>We've come a long way since I first took office. As a country, we're older and wiser. I don't know if I'm wiser, but I'm certainly older. [<i>Laughter</i>] And as long as Congress doesn't manufacture another crisis&mdash;as long as we don't shut down the Government just because I'm for keeping it open&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;as long as we don't risk a U.S. default over paying bills that we've already racked up, something that we've never done&mdash;we can probably muddle along without taking bold action. If we stand pat and we don't do any of the things I talked about, our economy will grow, although slower than it should. New businesses will form. The unemployment rate will probably tick down a little bit. Just by virtue of our size and our natural resources and, most of all, because of the talent of our people, America will remain a world power, and the majority of us will figure out how to get by. <p>But you know, if that's our choice&mdash;if we just stand by and do nothing in the face of immense change&mdash;understand that part of our character will be lost. Our founding precept about wide-open opportunity, each generation doing better than the last, that will be a myth, not reality. The position of the middle class will erode further. Inequality will continue to increase. Money's power will distort our politics even more. <p>Social tensions will rise, as various groups fight to hold on to what they have or start blaming somebody else for why their position isn't improving. And the fundamental optimism that's always propelled us forward will give way to cynicism or nostalgia. <p>And that's not the vision I have for this country. It's not the vision you have for this country. That's not the America we know. That's not the vision we should be settling for. That's not a vision we should be passing on to our children. <p>I have now run my last campaign. I do not intend to wait until the next campaign or the next President before tackling the issues that matter. I care about one thing and one thing only, and that's how to use every minute&mdash;the only thing I care about is how to use every minute of the remaining 1,276 days of my term&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;to make this country work for working Americans again. That's all I care about. I don't have another election. <p>Because I'll tell you, Galesburg, that's where I believe America needs to go. I believe that's where the American people want to go. And it may seem hard today, but if we're willing to take a few bold steps&mdash;if Washington will just shake off its complacency and set aside the kind of slash-and-burn partisanship that we've just seen for way too long&mdash;if we just make some commonsense decisions, our economy will be stronger a year from now. It will be stronger 5 years from now. It will be stronger 10 years from now. <p>If we focus on what matters, then more Americans will know the pride of that first paycheck. More Americans will have the satisfaction of flipping the sign to \\"Open\\" on their own business. More Americans will have the joy of scratching the height of their kid on that door of their brandnew home. <p>And in the end, isn't that what makes us special? It's not the ability to generate incredible wealth for the few, it's our ability to give everybody a chance to pursue their own true measure of happiness. We haven't just wanted success for ourselves, we want it for our neighbors too. <p>That's why&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;I mean, when we think about our own communities, we're not a mean people, we're not a selfish people, we're not a people that just looks out for number one. Why should our politics reflect those kinds of values? That's why we don't call it John's dream or Susie's dream or Barack's dream or Pat's dream, we call it the American Dream. And that's what makes this country special: the idea that no matter who you are or what you look like or where you come from or who you love, you can make it if you try. And that's what we're fighting for. <p>So yes, Congress is tough right now, but that's not going to stop me. We're going to do everything we can, wherever we can, with or without Congress, to make things happen. We're going to take&mdash;go on the road and talk to you, and you'll have ideas, and we want to see which ones we can implement. But we're going to focus on this thing that matters. <p>One of America's greatest writers, Carl Sandburg, born right here in Galesburg over a century ago&mdash;he saw the railroads bring the world to the prairie and then the prairie send out its bounty to the world. And he saw the advent of new industries, new technologies, and he watched populations shift. He saw fortunes made and lost. And he saw how change could be painful, how a new age could unsettle long-held customs and ways of life. But he had that frontier optimism, and so he saw something more on the horizon. And he wrote: \\"I speak of new cities and new people. The past is a bucket of ashes. Yesterday is a wind gone down, a sun dropped in the west. There is only an ocean of tomorrows, a sky of tomorrows.\\" <p>Well, America, we've made it through the worst of yesterday's winds. We just have to have the courage to keep moving forward. We've got to set our eyes on the horizon. We will find an ocean of tomorrows. We will find a sky of tomorrows for the American people and for this great country that we love. <p>So thank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\" "
"169" "\"Hello, Warrensburg! Hello, Mules! Hello, Jennies! Well, I know it's hot. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's why I took off my jacket. If you've still got yours on, feel free to take it off. It is great to be back in Missouri. It's great to be back in the Midwest. It's great to be here at UCM. <p>I want to thank your outstanding president, Dr. Chuck Ambrose, for having me here today. Give Brian a big round of applause for the introduction. You've got your outstanding Governor, Jay Nixon, in the house. Your mayor, Charlie Rutt, is here. And I brought a special guest with me who is celebrating her birthday today: your Senator, Claire McCaskill. I figured, the least I could do is give her a ride on Air Force One for her birthday. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So we've got Mules in the house. We've got Jennies in the house. We've got Governors, we've got Senators, and now we've probably got some very confused people watching at home, because they're&mdash;who is Jennie? The&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>I want to thank all the students who came out on a summer afternoon. I know that summer is&mdash;especially a day as pretty as today, it's tempting to be outside. I know classes don't start for a few more weeks. You could be over on Pine Street beating the heat. The&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. Now that I think about it, it may be good that you're here instead of getting into trouble. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I've just come from Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, where I gave a pretty long speech on the economy. I will not repeat the whole thing here. But what I did want to talk about today is what I've talked about when I gave my first big speech as a Senator 8 years ago, and that's where we as a country need to go to give every American a chance to get ahead in the 21st century. And UCM understands how important that is. <p>Just a little context here. In the period after World War II, you had a growing middle class that was the engine of our prosperity. The economy did well in part because everybody was participating. And whether you owned a company or you swept the floors of that company or you worked anywhere in between, America offered a basic bargain: If you work hard, then you'll be rewarded with fair wages and benefits. You'll have the chance to buy your own home. You'll have the chance to save for retirement. You'll have the protection of decent health insurance. But most of all, you'll have the chance to pass on a better life to your kids. <p>And then what happened was, that engine began to stall. The bargain began to fray. So technology made some jobs obsolete. All right? Nobody goes to a bank teller anymore. You want to schedule a trip somewhere, you get online. Global competition sent some jobs overseas. When I was in Galesburg, we talked about the Maytag plant that used to make household brands there, and people&mdash;thousands of people used to work in the plant, and it went down to Mexico. Then Washington doled out bigger tax cuts to folks at the top income brackets, smaller minimum wage increases for people who were struggling. You combine all this, and the income of the top 1 percent quadrupled from 1979 to 2007, but the typical family's incomes barely budged. <p>So a lot of middle class families began to feel that the odds were stacked against them, and they were right. And then for a while, this was kind of papered over because we had a housing bubble going on, and everybody was maxing out on their credit cards, everybody was highly leveraged, there were a lot of financial deals going around. And so it looked like the economy was going to be doing okay, but then by the time I took office, the bottom had fallen out. And it cost, as we know, millions of Americans their jobs or their homes or their savings. And that long-term erosion of middle class security was evident for everybody to see. <p>Now, the good news is, 5 years later&mdash;5 years after the crisis first hit&mdash;America has fought its way back. So together, we saved an auto industry. We took on a broken health care system. We invested in new American technologies to reducereverse our addiction to foreign oil. We doubled the production of clean energy. Natural gas took off. We put in place tough new rules on big banks and mortgage lenders and credit card companies. We changed the Tax Code so it was fair for middle class folks and didn't just benefit folks at the very top like me. No, it's true, because things were skewed too much towards folks who were already blessed, already lucky. And you take all that together, and now you add it all up. <p>What we've seen is over the past 40 months, our businesses have created more than 7.2 million new jobs. This year, we're off to our strongest private sector job growth since 1999. All right? Our exports have surged, so we sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before. We produce more natural gas than any country on Earth. We're about to produce more of our own oil than we buy from overseas, and that's the first time that's happened in nearly 20 years. The cost of health care is growing at its slowest rate in 50 years, so we're slowing the growth of health care costs. And our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years. Deficits have been cut by almost half from the time I took office. <p>So we did this together, because Americans are gritty and resilient and work hard. We've been able to clear away the rubble of the financial crisis. We're starting to lay a new foundation for more durable economic growth. And with the new revolutions in energy and technology and manufacturing and health care, we're actually poised&mdash;we're in a position to reverse all those forces that battered middle class families for too long. We can start building now an economy where everybody who works hard can get ahead. That's all good. That's the good news. <p>But, Missouri, I'm here to tell you what you already know, which is, we're not there yet. In some ways, the trends that have been building for decades&mdash;this winner-take-all economy where a few do better and better, but everybody else just treads water&mdash;all those trends were made worse by the recession. And reversing these trends has to be Washington's number-one priority. [<i>Applause</i>] It has to be Washington's number-one priority. <p>Putting people back to work, making sure the economy is working for everybody, building the middle class, making sure they're secure&mdash;that's my highest priority. That's what I'm interested in. Because when the economy is working for middle class families, it solves an awful lot of other problems. Now the poor start having ladders of opportunity they can climb into if they work hard. A lot of the social tensions are reduced because everybody is feeling pretty good. <p>Now, unfortunately, over the past couple of years in particular, Washington hasn't just ignored this problem, they've actually made it worse. And I am interested in working with everybody, and there are a bunch of not just Democrats, but also Republicans who recognize that Washington is not working. But we've also seen a group of folks, particularly in the House, a group of Republicans in Congress that&mdash;they suggested they wouldn't vote to pay the bills that Congress had already run up. And that fiasco harmed a fragile recovery back in 2011. <p>We've got a growing number of Republican Senators who are trying to get things done with their Democratic counterparts, just passed an immigration bill that economists say are&mdash;is going to boost our economy by more than a trillion dollars. But so far at least, there's a faction of House Republicans who won't let the bill go to the floor for a vote. And if you ask them: \\"Well, okay, well, what's your economic agenda for the middle class? How are we going to grow our economy so everybody prospers?\\" They'll start talking about out-of-control Government spending; although, as I said, Government spending has actually gone down and the deficits are going down. Or they'll talk about Obamacare, the whole idea that somehow if we don't provide health insurance to 50 million Americans, that's going to improve the economy. Never mind the fact that our jobs growth is a lot faster now than it was during the last recovery, when Obamacare wasn't around. <p>So we've got some basic challenges that we're just going to have to meet. We've cut our deficit. We're creating jobs at nearly twice the pace. We are providing health care for Americans that need it. But we now have to get back and focus on what's important. An endless parade of distractions and political posturing and phony scandals can't get in the way of what we need to do. And I'm here to say, it's got to stop. We've got to focus on jobs and the economy and helping middle class families get ahead. And if we do that, we're going to solve a whole lot of problems. <p>And as we're thinking about these issues, we can't get involved in short-term thinking. We can't have all the same old debates. That's not what the moment requires. We've got to focus on the core economic issues that matter to you. And as Washington is now preparing for another debate about the budget, the stakes could not be higher. If we don't make the investments America needs to make this country a magnet for good jobs, if we don't make investments in education and manufacturing and science and research and transportation and information networks, we will be waving the white flag while other countries forge ahead in a global economy. If we just stand by and do nothing, we're saying it's okay for middle class folks to keep taking it on the chin. And I don't think it's okay. <p>And that's why I came here to Warrensburg today. I need you involved in this debate to remind Washington what's at stake. And over the next several weeks, in towns just like this one, I'm going to lay out my ideas for how we build on the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class, what it takes to work your way into the middle class: a good job with good wages in durable, growing industries; a good education for our kids and our workers; a home to call your own; affordable health care that's there for you when you or your family members get sick; a secure retirement even if you're not rich; more ladders of opportunity for people who want to earn their way into the middle class as long as they're willing to work for it. <p>And what we need what we need is not a 3-month plan or even a 3-year plan, we need a long-term plan based on steady, persistent effort to reverse the forces that have conspired against middle class families for decades. And I am confident&mdash;I know&mdash;there are members of both parties who understand what's at stake. <p>So I welcome ideas from anybody across the political spectrum. But I'm not going to allow gridlock or inaction or willful indifference to get in this country's way. We've got to get moving. So where I can act on my own, I'm going to. I'm not going to wait for Congress. Because the choices that we make now aren't just going to determine what happens to the young people here at this school, it's going to determine what happens to your kids and your grandkids. So one thing I really want to focus on here, because UCM is doing some extraordinary things, I want to focus on just briefly that second cornerstone: an education that prepares our kids and our workers for the global competition that you'll face. That is why I wanted to highlight what's happening here at University of Central Missouri, because you guys are doing some things right. <p>In an age where business knows no borders, jobs are going to seek out the countries that have the most talented, skilled citizens, and those are the folks who are going to make a good living. The days when the wages for a worker with a high school degree could keep pace with the earnings of somebody with a college degree, those days are over. You can see it all throughout the Midwest, where you've got folks who a generation ago could just walk into a factory or a plant, didn't have a lot of skills, get trained on the job, make a good living, live out a middle class life. That's not going to happen anymore. Technology, global competition, those things are not going away. <p>So we can either throw up our hands and resign ourselves to lower living standards or we can do what America has always done: We can adapt, we can pull together, we can fight back, we can win. And if we don't invest in American education, then we're going to put our kids, our workers, our countries, our businesses at a competitive disadvantage. Because if you think it's&mdash;if you think education is expensive, you should see how much ignorance is going to cost in the 21st century. It's going to be expensive. <p>So what do we need to do on education? Number one, it's got to start in the earliest years. And that means working with States to make high-quality preschool available for every 4-year-old in America. Every study shows this is a smart investment, encourages healthy behaviors, increases our kids' success in the classroom, increases their earning power as they grow up, reduces rates of teen pregnancy, reduces criminal behavior. It's really important. And any working parent will tell you that knowing your kid is in a safe place to learn is a big relief, so it's also important for the parents. <p>Now, this idea of early childhood education, it shouldn't be partisan. States with Republican Governors are doing it just like a lot of Democratic Governors are doing it. Our kids don't care about politics. We should prove that we care about them and make this thing happen. And I'm going to keep on pushing, as long as I am President, until we have a situation where every kid is getting a good, healthy start in life and are prepared when they go to school. <p>We're going to take action on proven ideas to upgrade our schools that don't require Congress. So, for example, last month, I announced a goal of connecting 99 percent of America's students to high-speed Internet within 5 years. We're working&mdash;we're going ahead and taking steps for that to happen right now. Now, some of you may have gone to schools where you had Internet in every classroom, but a lot of schools right now, they've got a&mdash;maybe a computer lab, but if you go in the classroom, kids, they don't have it. In America, in this country, every child at every desk should have access to the entire world's information, and every teacher should have the cutting-edge technology to help their kids succeed and learn. We're going to make that happen. <p>We've got to rethink our high schools so that our kids graduate with the real-world skills that this new age demands. We've got to reward the schools that forge partnerships with local colleges and businesses and that focus on the fields of the future, like science and technology and math and engineering. <p>And I'm going to use the power of my office over the next few months to highlight a topic that affects probably everybody here, and that is the soaring cost of higher education. Now, 3 years ago, I worked with Democrats to reform the student loan system so that taxpayer dollars weren't going to pad the pockets of big banks and instead were going to help students get a college education. So millions of students were helped by that. We took action to cap loan repayments at 10 percent of monthly incomes for responsible borrowers. A lot of young people don't know this, but if you've taken out Federal loans, then if you choose a job, let's say, that doesn't pay as much as you'd like or you deserve, if you're a teacher or some other profession, you only have to pay 10 percent of your income, which means that you can afford to go to college and know that you're not going to be broke when you graduate, which is important. And not enough young people are using this. <p>As we speak&mdash;and then, as we speak, we're working with both parties to reverse the doubling of student loan rates that happened a few weeks ago because Congress didn't get its act together. We've got to get student loan rates&mdash;interest rates back down. <p>So these are all good steps, but here's the problem, and this is where what's happening at University of Central Missouri is so important. We can put more and more money into student loans, we can put more and more money into grants, but if college costs keep on going up, then there's never going to be enough money. I can keep student loan rates low, but if you're borrowing $80,000 for college or $100,000 and you get out, it doesn't matter whether interest rate is 3.5 or 8.5, you're still going to have trouble repaying it. It'll take you longer to buy a house. If you've got an idea for a business, it's going to take you longer to invest in starting your business. <p>So we've got to do something about college costs. Families and taxpayers can't just keep paying more and more into an undisciplined system. We've got to get a better bang for our buck. So States have to do their part by prioritizing higher education in their budgets, right? Because part of the reason tuition's been skyrocketing is colleges aren't&mdash;State-funded colleges aren't getting as much funding, and so then tuition is going up on the backs of students and families. But we've also got to test new ways of funding based not just on how many students enroll, but how well they do. And colleges have to do their part by keeping costs from going up. <p>So here at Central Missouri, you are a laboratory for this kind of innovation. I had a great discussion with not only the president of this university, but also the superintendent of schools here, the head of the community colleges. What's happened at UCM is you've partnered with the Lee's Summit School District, with the Metropolitan Community College, with local health care, engineering, energy, and infrastructure firms&mdash;all industries that are going to drive job growth in the future&mdash;and everybody is now working together to equip students with better skills, allow them to graduate faster, with less debt, and with the certainty of being able to get a job at the other end. That's a recipe for success over the long term. <p>So we've got students at Summit Technology Academy&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;there we go. Those students, they're beginning to accrue credits towards an associate's degree while they're still in high school, which means they can come here to earn a bachelor's degree in 2 years and graduate debt free. Debt free, on a fast track. <p>And because the community colleges and industries are involved, students are making quicker decisions about the industries that are going to create jobs, and the businesses are helping to design the programs to make sure that they have the skills for those jobs so that not only are you graduating debt free, but you also know that you've got a job waiting for you on the other end. <p>Now, that is exactly the kind of innovation we need when it comes to college costs. That's what's happening right here in Warrensburg. And I want the entire country to notice it, and I want other colleges to take a look at what's being done here. And I've asked my team to shake the trees all across the country for some of the best ideas out there for keeping college costs down, so that as students prepare to go back to school, I'm in a position to lay out what's going to be an aggressive strategy to shake up the system, to make sure that middle class students, working class students, poor kids who have the drive and the wherewithal and want to get a good college education, they can get it without basically mortgaging their entire future. We can make this happen, but this is an example of the kind of thing we've got to focus on instead of a bunch of distractions in Washington. <p>So tackling college costs, creating more good jobs, establishing a better bargain for middle class families and everybody trying to work to join into it, an economy that grows not from the top down, but from the middle out&mdash;that's not just what I'm going to focus on for the next few months, that's what I'm going to be focused on for the remainder of my Presidency. And I'm going to take these plans all across the country, and I'm going to ask folks for help because, frankly, sometimes, I just can't wait for Congress. It just takes them a long time to decide on stuff. <p>So we're going to reach out to CEOs, and we're going to reach out to workers, and we're going to reach out to college presidents, and we're going to reach out to students. We'll talk to Democrats and Independents, and yes, I will be asking Republicans to get involved, because this has to be our core project for the next decade. <p>I want to lay out my ideas to give the middle class a better shot in the 21st century. And look, I want Republicans to lay out theirs&mdash;their ideas. If they've got a better idea to bring down college costs that we haven't thought of, let's hear them. I'm ready to go. If they've got a better plan to make sure that every American knows the security of affordable health care, then please share it with the class. Raise your hand. [<i>Applause</i>] You know? But what you can't do is just manufacture another crisis because you think it might be good politics, just as our economy is getting some traction. What you can't do is shut down our Government just because I'm for opening the Government. You can't threaten not to pay the bills this country racked up or to cut investments in education and science and basic research that are going to help us grow. <p>If we're going to manage deficits and debt, let's do it in a sensible way. We can do this if we work together. And it may seem hard right now, but if we're willing to take a few bold steps&mdash;if Washington will just shake off its complacency, set aside the kind of slash-and-burn partisanship that we've seen over the past few years&mdash;I promise you, our economy will be stronger a year from now, just like it's stronger now than it was last year. And then it will be stronger 5 years from now, and then it will be stronger 10 years from now. And more Americans will have the pride of a first paycheck. And more Americans will have the satisfaction of starting their own business and flipping that sign that says \\"Open.\\" More folks will have the thrill of marching across the stage to earn a diploma from a university like this and then know that they've got a job waiting for them when they graduate. <p>What makes us special&mdash;a lot of times we talk about American exceptionalism, and we&mdash;how much we love this country, and there are so many wonderful things about our country. But what makes us the envy of the world has not just been our ability to generate incredible wealth for a few people, it's the fact that we've given everybody a chance to pursue their own true measure of happiness. That's who we are. <p>We haven't just wanted success for ourselves, we want it for our neighbors. We want it for our neighborhoods. That's why we don't call it Bob's dream or Barbara's dream or Barack's dream, we call it the American Dream. It's one that we share. That's who we are: the idea that no matter who you are, what you look like, where you come from, who you love, you can make it here in America if you're trying hard. <p>That's what a college education can be all about. That's what inspires your President, that's what inspires the faculty. That's why when we see young people like you, we're inspired, because you're an expression of that idea. And we've got to make sure that that continues, not just for this generation, but for the next generation. <p>And I've got a hundred&mdash;I've got 1,267 days left in my Presidency. And I'm going to spend every minute, every second, as long as I have the privilege of being in this office, making sure that I am doing every single thing that I can so that middle class families, working families, people who are out there struggling every single day, that they know that that work can lead them to a better place. And we're going to make sure that the American Dream is available for everybody, not just now, but in the future. <p>So thank you, Missouri. Thank you, UCM. Thank you, Mules. Thank you, Jennies. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Let's get to work.\" "
"170" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Jacksonville! Well, it is good to be in Jacksonville. Good to be back. How you all doing today? <p>Audience members. Good! <p><i>The President.</i> You look good. <p>Audience member. Thank you! <p><i>Audience member</i>. You look good too! <p>The President. Thank you. [Laughter] <p>I want to thank Jacksonville Port Authority Chairman Joe York. Give him a big round of applause. I want to thank the CEO of MOL America, Tsuyoshi Yoshida. I want to thank everybody here at JAXPORT for having me here today. I brought along our new Secretary of Transportation, Anthony Foxx. He is here. We've got wonderful Congresswoman Corrine Brown here. Yay, Corrine! Mayor Alvin Brown is also in the house. <p>And I would like to recognize the folks from the port and TraPac for showing me the cranes you've got back at the terminal. Those are some big cranes. [<i>Laughter</i>] This is some serious business here. And just watching what was going on down here and knowing what's possible is a reminder of all the potential that we've got in this country: to put folks to work, to rebuild America, to make sure that everybody has got a fair shot. <p>Well, yesterday, in Illinois, I talked about what we need to do as a country to build a better bargain for the middle class and everybody who's trying to get into middle class, a strategy that we've got to pursue, together, to make sure that everybody who works hard has a chance to get ahead in this 21st-century economy. Because, for decades, a growing middle class was the engine of our prosperity; it's what made us great. If you worked hard, you knew your work was going to be rewarded with fair wages, good benefits, the chance to buy a home, save for retirement, and most of all, the chance to pass down a better life to your kids. That's the American Dream. <p>But eventually, that engine of prosperity began to stall. You had technology that made some jobs obsolete. You had globalization, which meant some jobs got shipped overseas. Unions got weaker, in part because some of the laws that we passed. And so for most of the last decade, people were working harder and harder just to get by. And then you have a devastating recession because of what happened in the financial markets, and that cost millions of Americans their jobs and their homes and their savings. And what it did was lay bare for everybody to see the steady erosion of middle class security that had been happening for almost a generation. <p>Now, the good news is that after nearly 5 years since that financial crisis happened, thanks to the hard work and the resilience of the American people, America has fought back. So together, we saved an auto industry. And I was told that the terminal I was at is one of the places where we're sending out more American cars than ever before, all around the world. <p>We took on a broken health care system. We invested in new American technologies to reverse our addiction to foreign oil. We doubled our production of clean energy. We put in place tough new rules on the big banks and the mortgage lenders and credit card companies to make sure that we didn't have the same kinds of financial shenanigans that we had seen before. We changed a Tax Code that was too skewed in favor of the wealthy, made sure it was doing more for middle class and working class families. We locked in tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans, and then we asked folks at the top to pay a little bit more. <p>So you add all this up, and over the last 40 months, our businesses have created 7.2 million new jobs&mdash;7.2. And this year, we're off to our strongest private sector job growth since 1999&mdash;strongest job growth in over a decade. <p>So today, we sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before. Our exports have surged. We produce more natural gas than any country on Earth. We're about to produce more of our own oil than we buy from overseas. That's the first time that's happened in nearly 20 years. The cost of health care is growing at its slowest rate in 50 years. And our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years. So you've got health care costs starting to slow down, deficits plummeting, jobs up, exports up, energy production up. <p>We've cleared away the rubble from the financial crisis, thanks to the grit and resilience of the American people, and we've begun to lay a new foundation for stronger, more durable, more sustainable economic growth. And with the revolutions that are coming in energy and technology and manufacturing and health care, we're poised to be able to finally reverse some of those forces that were hurting middle class families for so long. We can start rebuilding an economy where everybody who works hard can get ahead. That's our goal. <p>But I'm here to tell you today what you already know: We're not there yet. In a lot of ways, those trends that have been building for decades, this winner-take-all economy where a few folks are doing better and better and better at the top and everybody else is just treading water, those trends have been made worse by the recession. And reversing those trends should be Washington's highest priority. It's my highest priority. <p>Unfortunately, over the past couple of years in particular, Washington hasn't just ignored the problem, a lot of times, it's made things worse. And sometimes, when you're on the outside, you look, and it just sounds like a bunch of noise, and you don't know what's going on between Democrats and Republicans. And my attitude is, is that we're all Americans first and no party has a monopoly on good ideas. And I think there are a number of Republicans out there who mean well, although they're not always willing to say so, because they might get in trouble. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But right now we've seen a group of Republicans in the House, in particular, who suggest they wouldn't vote to pay the very bills that Congress has already racked up. That harmed our recovery back in 2011. It would severely harm it again. It could plunge us back into financial crisis. <p>Over the last 6 months, the gridlock's gotten worse. There are a number of Republican Senators who are trying to get things done. They passed a strong immigration bill that economists say will boost our economy by more than a trillion dollars. But so far, we haven't been able to get the House Republicans to give it a vote. <p>And if you ask some of these same folks about how they'd strengthen the middle class, they'll tell you, well, out-of-control Government spending is the problem, despite the fact that as a share of the economy we have cut the deficit by nearly half since I took office. Or they'll say Obamacare is the problem; the problem is that we're trying to give health insurance to millions of Americans who don't have it. Now, I've got to tell you, our businesses have created jobs at nearly twice the pace of the last recovery, when there was no Obamacare, so it's kind of hard to figure how Obamacare is actually the problem, giving people health insurance. And by the way, tens of millions of Americans now have new benefits like free checkups and cheaper medicine on Medicare. So they don't think that's a problem. <p>The point is, with an endless distraction of political posturing and phony scandals and Lord knows what, Washington keeps taking its eye off the ball. And that needs to stop. We've got to stop with the short-term thinking. We've got to stop with the outdated debates. That's not what the moment requires: a focus on the core economic issues that matter to you, that matter to middle class Americans, all those who are trying to get in the middle class. That's what this moment requires. We've got to stay focused on how do we build an economy that works everybody. That's my focus. <p>And as Washington prepares to enter another budget battle, another budget debate, the stakes could not be higher. At a time when we need to make investments to create jobs and strengthen the middle class and grow our economy&mdash;because we've got competition coming from all around the world&mdash;we've got some of the House Republicans who put forward a budget that does just the opposite. They're pushing bills that would cut education, cut science, cut research, prevent us from meeting these priorities. <p>We should be doubling down on American clean energy technology; they're creating jobs, lowering dangerous carbon pollution. But they want to protect taxpayer giveaways to big oil companies. Let other countries win the race for the jobs of the future. That doesn't make sense. <p>Instead of helping hard-working students afford the college degree that the jobs of tomorrow increasingly demand, they want to slash funding for the very grants that help students make their tuition payments. Instead of giving more families the security of decent health care, they want to let insurance companies reinstate lifetime dollar limits and drop millions of people from their plans. <p>And if we don't make the necessary investments to ensure that America is a magnet for good jobs&mdash;investments in education, manufacturing, research, and transportation and information networks&mdash;we're just waving the white flag of surrender to other countries as they forge ahead in this global economy. That kind of attitude is saying there's nothing we can do to help middle class families compete and win and grow. And that's a bad bargain for the middle class. <p>So that's why I came down to Jacksonville today. I want you involved in this debate and remind Washington what's at stake. And over the next several weeks, in cities and towns just like this one, I'm going to lay out my ideas for how we build on the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class in America, what it takes to work your way into the middle class in America, and what we can do to help families, not help special interests, but help families. That's what we need. <p>And by the way, Jacksonville, what we need isn't a 3-month plan or even a 3-year plan, we've got to have a long-term plan based on steady, persistent effort to reverse the forces that are conspiring against middle class families. That's what I'm pushing for. And like I said, I think that there are Democrats and Republicans who understand what's at stake, and I'm going to welcome ideas from anybody across the political spectrum. But I'm not going to let gridlock or inaction or indifference to the plight of families get in the way of this country. <p>So where I can act on my own, I'm going to act on my own. I won't wait for Congress. Because the choices we make right now will determine whether or not every American will have a fighting chance in the 21st century. <p>So we know what those cornerstones of real middle class security are: a good job with good wages; a good education; a home you can call your own; affordable health care that's there for you when you get sick; a secure retirement even if you're not rich; more chances for folks to earn their way into the middle class as long as they're willing to work hard for it. <p>But I'm here today to specifically talk about the cornerstone, the essence of middle class security, and that's a good job in growth industries. We've got to help more manufacturers bring more jobs back to America. We've got to keep creating good jobs in manufacturing. We've got to create good jobs in wind and solar energy. We've got to tap into this natural gas revolution that's bringing energy costs down in this country, which means manufacturers now want to locate here because they're thinking that we've got durable, reliable supplies of energy. We've got to create more jobs today doing what you're doing right here at JAXPORT, and that's building this country's future. <p>We need modern schools for our kids. We need modern power grids and fuel networks that can withstand stronger storms. And we need modern ports so we can move more goods made in America out to the rest of the world. <p>If you want to create jobs right now, but also jobs that will have impacts for years, here's the way to do it. We know strong infrastructure is a key ingredient to a thriving economy. That's how the United States became the best place in the world to do business. Unfortunately, over the past 2 years, too many folks in Washington have been cutting these investments. The world can't wait for Congress to get its act together. <p>So let me give you an example; many of you are familiar with this. In a couple of years, new supertankers are going to start coming through the Panama Canal. Those supertankers can hold three times the amount of cargo. We want those supertankers coming here to Jacksonville. Right? If we've got more supertankers coming here, that means more jobs at the terminals. That means more warehouses in the surrounding area. That means more contractors are getting jobs setting up those warehouses. That means they've got more money to spend at the restaurant. That means the waitress has more money to spend to buy her iPod. It starts working for everybody. <p>If we want our workers and businesses to compete, then our ports have to be ready to receive those supertankers. Otherwise, they'll go to Brazil or some other place. <p><i>Audience member.</i> You tell them, Mr. President! <p><i>The President.</i> So that's why last year I acted without Congress, and I took executive action to speed up the permitting process that gets workers breaking ground on projects like this one. And then private companies came onboard here at JAXPORT. They saw it as a good investment. And we're building the same kind of partnerships across the country, especially by the way, in some of these Gulf ports: Charleston, Savannah. And now these ports are on track to be better prepared for those supertankers and their cargo loads ahead of schedule. <p>But we've now got to keep at it. The businesses of tomorrow will not locate near old roads, outdated ports; they're going to go to places where the ports are good, the roads are good, the rail lines are good, you've got high-speed Internet, you've got high-tech schools, trained workers, systems that move air traffic and auto traffic faster. <p>Think about it in terms of your own house, right? The&mdash;if you've got a leaky roof and you haven't done the tuck-pointing and the boiler is getting kind of old and rickety, you can say to yourself, well, I'm going to save money by not fixing my roof. And I'm going to save money by not getting a new boiler. And I'm not going to worry about that tuck-pointing. And then, 2 years later, 5 years down the road, what happens? House starts breaking down. You end up spending more money. <p>We can't defer things that we know we're going to have to do and, by the way, would put people to work right now doing them. But that's what we're doing right now. As a share of our economy, we're investing less in rebuilding America than we did two decades ago. We're spending less on fixing our infrastructure than China is, than Germany is. All our competitors, they know we've got to start taking care of this stuff. We're lagging behind. <p>And the irony is, right now it's cheaper to build than it's been since the 1950s. You've got a whole bunch of construction workers who are looking for work right now. You've got a whole bunch of contractors who will come in under&mdash;with low bids, and they'll come in on time. <p>So now is the time for us to do it. The longer we put this off, the more expensive it will be, the less competitive we'll be. So why aren't we doing it? Now, part of it's just politics right now. But making sure we've got world-class infrastructure, that shouldn't be a partisan issue. That's an American issue. It's not a Republican or a Democratic issue. <p>But this year's budget cuts have delayed two important rapid transit projects right here in Jacksonville that would carry more people into downtown, alleviate congestion at the same time, and put more Floridians back to work. <p>We can do better than that. There's a bipartisan bill in the Senate to fund critical improvements in our highways and our bridges, our transit and rail systems, and our ports like this one. And so the House should act quickly on that bill. Let's get more Americans back on the job doing the work America needs done. That will be good for middle class families. That will be good for middle class security. That will be good for homeownership. That will be good for education. That is the smart thing to do. Let's get past politics and do it. <p>I tell my Republican friends, this is not a partisan issue. The first Republican President is a guy from my home State. He was a pretty good President, named Abraham Lincoln. [<i>Laughter</i>] He had a whole lot of things to worry about, had a Civil War, probably the biggest crisis that this country ever experienced. And yet, in the middle of that, he was still thinking about how do we build that transcontinental railroad? How are we going to widen our canals and our ports so that we can move products all around the country and eventually the world? How do we invest in land-grant colleges so that our workers are now skilled and can get those new jobs? We're going to invest in the National Science Foundation to make sure that we stay ahead of everybody else when it comes to technology. <p>He made those investments, the first Republican President. He didn't say, well, that's not the job of government to help do that. He wouldn't have understood that kind of philosophy, because he understood there are some things we can only do together. And rebuilding our infrastructure is one of them. <p>Creating more good jobs, a better bargain for the middle class, helping folks who are working to join the middle class, an economy that grows from the middle out&mdash;this isn't what I'm going to be focusing on for the next few months, this is what I'm going to be focusing on for all the days I've got left in my Presidency. I've counted them, there are 1,266 days left&mdash;1,266 days left. <p>So, over the next several weeks, we're going to roll out these plans. We're going to take them across the country. We're going to ask not just Congress to do something, we're going to ask everybody for their help: CEOs, workers, college presidents, students, Democrats, Independents, and yes, Republicans. <p>I'm laying out my ideas to give the middle class a better shot. And if the Republicans don't agree with me, I want them to lay out their ideas. If they've got a better plan to create jobs to rebuild our infrastructure and make sure that we've got great ports all along the Gulf, come on, let me know what your ideas are. I'm listening. <p>If they've got better ideas to make sure every American knows the security of affordable health care, well, share it with the country. Repealing Obamacare and slashing our budgets in education and research and infrastructure, that's not an economic plan. There's no economist who would look at that and say, well, that's the way we're going to help middle class families; we're really going to grow doing that. <p>Shutting down the Government just because I'm for keeping it open, that's not an economic plan. Threatening that you won't pay the bills in this country when we've already racked up those bills, that's not an economic plan. That's just being a deadbeat. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So put out some plans. I don't claim to have a monopoly on every good idea. [<i>Laughter</i>] I don't. And I'm happy to steal good ideas from anybody, because I just want to make things work. And it may seem hard sometimes, but if we're willing to take a few bold steps, if Washington will just shake off its complacency and set aside just this kind of constant gridlock and \\"my way or the highway\\" attitude, then our economy will be better a year from now, just like it's better now than it was last year. And it will be better 5 years from now. And it will be better 10 years from now. <p>And I'm going to spend every single minute of every day, as long as I have the privilege of this office, making sure that I'm doing everything in my power to make this economy work for working Americans again: to build a better middle class and to make sure the American Dream is something that's alive and real and achievable for decades to come. <p>That's what I'm fighting for, Florida. That's what I need you for, Florida. Let's make it happen. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"171" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. Good evening, everybody. Please have a seat. <p>Let me begin by saying welcome to all of you. I'm so glad that all of you were able to attend. I want to acknowledge members of the diplomatic corps; we have Members of Congress here, including Keith Ellison and Andre Carson. Where's Andre? He's usually not hard to miss. [<i>Laughter</i>] There you go. Leaders from my administration and guests from all across our Nation, and to all of you and to Muslim Americans all across the country and around the world: <i>Ramadan kareem</i>. <p>Here at the White House, we now have a tradition of celebrating the sacred days of our various faiths. And these are occasions to reflect on the teachings that so many religions share: to celebrate the diversity that defines our country and to reaffirm one of our most deeply held beliefs that here in America and around the world, people should be free to choose the God that they worship however they choose, to practice their faiths freely, or to practice no faith at all. <p>For Muslims, Ramadan is a time of reflection, a chance to demonstrate one's devotion to God through prayer and through fasting. But it's also a time for family and friends to come together&mdash;as we do tonight&mdash;in a spirit of love and respect, to renew our obligations to one another, as well as to renew our commitment to our neighbors and helping the most needy among us. For as the Koran teaches, \\"Whoever does an atom's weight of good, will see its results.\\" <p>Throughout our history, Islam has contributed to the character of our country, and Muslim Americans and their good works have helped to build our Nation. And we've seen the results. We've seen those results in generations of Muslim immigrants: farmers and factory workers, helping to lay the railroads and build our cities. Muslim innovators who helped build some of our highest skyscrapers and who helped to unlock the secrets of our universe. <p>Every day, Muslim Americans are helping to shape the way that we think and the way that we work and the way that we do business. And that's the spirit that we celebrate tonight: the dreamers, the creators whose ideas are pioneering new industries, creating new jobs and unleashing new opportunities for all of us. <p>We celebrate entrepreneurs like Shazi Visram, whose parents came here from Pakistan and Tanzania to give their children a better life. And as the founder, CEO, and \\"Chief Mom\\" of Happy Family&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;Shazi is a leader in affordable, organic foods for children, which makes Michelle very happy. In just 7 years, she's grown to 58 full-time employees, 75 part-time working moms, and they're on track to hit $100 million in revenue this year. So no wonder she's been called a \\"Rockstar of the New Economy.\\" <p>By the way, every time that they sell one of their products, they contribute to global efforts to end child hunger. So Shazi is not only just an outstanding businesswoman, but also a leader that all of us can emulate. <p>We celebrate innovators like Aunim Hossain. In one of his first ventures, he designed a hand-held device to help detect breast cancer. Now, as the creator of Tista Games, he's setting his sights on the video game industry. But Aunim also has a bigger vision, and that's harnessing the talents and energy of hundreds of millions of gamers around the world to do social good. And he imagines applying the same high-quality stories and graphics in his games to the next generation of educational material to help children learn. So we're very appreciative for Aunim for the good work that he's doing. <p>We celebrate pioneers like Dr. Iya Khalil, whose father came here from Libya to finish his education; she grew up watching him in his lab and dreaming of being a scientist herself. Today, she calls herself a recovering physicist, and she puts her talents to work as an entrepreneur. She cofounded her own bio-tech research company, which today employs almost 50 people and is a leader in genomic medicine, making it possible for doctors to prescribe personalized treatment plans for patients with diseases like cancer and giving new hope to people around the world. So we thank Iya for her efforts. <p>So Shazi, Aunim, Iya, and so many of you who have traveled here tonight: Each of you have traveled your own path, but each of you have also lived out an American story. You started with an idea, something no one had done before. You took a leap of faith. And with daring and determination, you brought your dream to life. And that's what we Americans have been doing for more than two centuries. That's what we do every day: We work a little harder, we aim a little higher, and we keep striving to create more opportunity for our children and future generations. <p>And of course, this isn't just the American Dream, it's the aspiration of people around the world. It's the basic human desire for progress, to find dignity that comes from work, to give our children something better. These yearnings for economic freedom and opportunity, just as much as political freedom, are at the root of so much of the change we've seen around the world in the past few years, including in North Africa and in the Middle East. <p>And that's why, even as we support citizens seeking to determine their own destiny, a key part of our engagement with Muslim communities around the world has to be supporting economic opportunity and entrepreneurship. So we launched our annual entrepreneurship summit to spur innovation and business growth in Muslim communities. I'm going to be attending one when I go to the ASEAN meeting in Southeast Asia later this year. In my second term, we're going to keep helping young entrepreneurs pursue their dreams and create opportunities, the kind of prosperity that can transform lives around the world. <p>Whoever does an atom's weight of gold [good; White House correction.] will see its results. And when I look around the room tonight, beyond the communities you represent, I see all the profound good that's been accomplished. So all of us are seeing the results of your good work: the opportunities to create for your colleagues and your communities and for our country. So I want to thank you for what you do, and for reminding us that our Nation is stronger and more successful when we harness the talents of all Americans, no matter where we come from or what we look like, what our last names are or how we pray. <p>So God bless you all. May you and your families have a blessed Ramadan. And with that, I know people are hungry&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;let's eat. Thank you.\" "
"172" "\"Hi everybody. On Wednesday, I spoke about what we need to do as a country to build a better bargain for the middle class: to make sure everyone who works hard has a chance to get ahead in the 21st-century economy. <p>You see, over the past 4&frac12; years, America has fought its way back from the worst recession of our lifetimes. We saved the auto industry, took on a broken health care system, invested in new American technologies to reverse our addiction to foreign oil, and changed a Tax Code too skewed in favor of the wealthiest at the expense of working families. <p>As a result, our businesses have created 7.2 million new jobs over the past 40 months. We produce more renewable energy than ever and more natural gas than anyone. Health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in 50 years. And our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years. <p>Thanks to the grit and resilience of the American people, we've cleared away the rubble of crisis and begun to lay a new foundation for stronger, more durable economic growth. <p>But as any middle class family will tell you, we're not yet where we need to be. Trends that have been eroding middle class security for decades&mdash;technology that makes some jobs obsolete, global competition that makes others moveable, growing inequality and the policies that perpetuate it&mdash;all those things still exist, and in some ways, the recession made them worse. <p>Reversing these trends must be Washington's highest priority. It sure is mine. But over the past couple of years in particular, Washington has taken its eye off the ball. An endless parade of distractions and political posturing and phony scandals shift focus from what needs to be done. And as Washington prepares to enter another budget debate, the stakes could not be higher. The choices we make now will determine whether or not every American has a fighting chance in the 21st century. <p>If we don't make the investments necessary to make America a magnet for good jobs&mdash;if we don't invest in education and manufacturing and research and our transportation and information networks&mdash;we might as well hit the pause button while the rest of the world forges ahead in a global economy. And that's certainly not going to fix what ails the middle class. <p>Here's what will: a strategy that builds on the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class in America and what it takes to work your way into the middle class; good jobs that pay good wages; an education that prepares our children and our workers for the global competition they'll face; homeownership that's built on a solid foundation, where buyers and lenders play by the same set of rules; affordable health care that's there for you when you get sick; a secure retirement even if you're not rich; and more chances for folks to earn their way into the middle class as long as they're willing to work for it. <p>Over the next several weeks, in cities and towns across the country, I'll continue to lay out my ideas in each of these areas. Because reversing the forces that have conspired against the middle class for decades will require more than short-term thinking; it will require a long-term American strategy, based on steady, persistent effort. <p>I know there are members of both parties who understand what's at stake, and I'm open to ideas from across the political spectrum, as long as they meet the test of strengthening the prospects of hard-working families. But repealing Obamacare, gutting critical investments in our future, threatening to default on the bills this country has already racked up, or shutting down the Government just because I'm for keeping it open&mdash;none of those thing add up to an economic plan. None of that will take this country where it needs to go. <p>We can do this if we work together. It won't be easy, but if we take a few bold steps, and if Washington is willing to shake off its complacency and set aside some of the slash-and-burn partisanship we've seen in recent years, our economy will keep getting stronger. <p>And as long as I have the privilege of holding this office, I will spend every minute of every day doing everything in my power to make this economy work for working Americans again, to build that better bargain for the middle class, to make sure that the American Dream is something that's achievable for everybody, not just today, but for decades to come. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"173" "\"Thank you so much. Thank you. Please be seated. Good morning. <i>Annyong haseyo.</i> <p>Secretaries Hagel, Jewell, and Shinseki; Admiral Winnefeld; General Jung; all our friends from the Republic of Korea, including the legendary General Paik Sun-yup; distinguished guests; and most of all, veterans of the Korean war and your families. To our veterans, many in your eighties, a few of you in your old uniforms, which still fit&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;let me just say, you look outstanding. And I would ask that all United States, Republic of Korea, and other veterans who fought, I would ask those who can stand to please stand so that we can properly honor you here today. <p>July 27, 1953, 60 years ago today, in the village of Panmunjom, in a barren room, the generals picked up their pens and signed their names to the agreement spread before them. That night, as the armistice took hold, the guns of war thundered no more. Along the jagged front, men emerged from their muddy trenches. A marine raised his bugle and played \\"Taps.\\" And a soldier spoke for millions when he said, \\"Thank God it is over.\\" <p>In the days that followed, both sides pulled back, leaving a demilitarized zone between them. Soldiers emptied their sandbags and tore down their bunkers. Our POWs emerged from the camps. Our troops boarded ships and steamed back across the ocean. And describing the moment he passed under the Golden Gate Bridge, one of those soldiers wrote, \\"We suddenly knew we had survived the war, and we were home.\\" <p>Yet ask these veterans here today and many will tell you, compared to other wars, theirs was a different kind of homecoming. Unlike the Second World War, Korea did not galvanize our country. These veterans did not return to parades. Unlike Vietnam, Korea did not tear at our country. These veterans did not return to protest. Among many Americans, tired of war, there was, it seemed, a desire to forget, to move on. As one of these veterans recalls: \\"We just came home and took off our uniforms and went to work. That was about it.\\" <p>You, our veterans of Korea, deserved better. And down the decades, our Nation has worked to right that wrong, including here, with this eternal memorial, where the measure of your sacrifice is enshrined for all time. Because here in America, no war should ever be forgotten, and no veteran should ever be overlooked. And after the armistice, a reporter wrote, \\"When men talk in some distant time with faint remembrance of the Korean war, the shining deeds will live.\\" The shining deeds will live. <p>On this 60th anniversary, perhaps the highest tribute we can offer our veterans of Korea is to do what should have been done the day you come home. In our hurried lives, let us pause. Let us listen. Let these veterans carry us back to the days of their youth, and let us be awed by their shining deeds. <p>Listen closely and hear the story of a generation: veterans of World War II recalled to duty; husbands kissing their wives goodbye yet again; young men&mdash;some just boys, 18, 19, 20 years old&mdash;leaving behind everyone they loved \\"to defend a country they never knew and a people they never met.\\" Let's never forget all the daughters who left home, especially our heroic nurses who saved so many. Our women in Korea also served with honor. They also gave their lives. <p>Listen and hear how these Americans faced down their fears and did their duty: clutching their rifles; hearing the bugles in the distance; knowing that waves of enemy fighters would soon be upon them; in ships offshore, climbing down the ropes into the landing craft, knowing some of them would not leave that beach; on the tarmacs and flight decks, taking off in their Corsairs and Sabres, knowing that they might not return to this Earth. <p>Listen and hear of their gallantry, often outnumbered and outgunned, in some of the most brutal combat in modern history: how they held the line at the Pusan Perimeter; how they landed at Inchon and turned the tide of the war; how, surrounded and freezing, they battled their way out of Chosin Reservoir; and how they fought, foxhole by foxhole, mountain after mountain, day and night, at the Punchbowl and Heartbreak Ridge, Old Baldy and Pork Chop Hill. <p>Listen and hear how perhaps the only thing worse than the enemy was the weather: the searing heat, the choking dust of summer, the deep snow and bitter cold of winter, so cold their weapons could jam, so cold their food would turn to ice. And surely no one endured more than our POWs in those hellish camps, where the torment was unimaginable. Our POWs from Korea are some of the strongest men our Nation has ever produced, and today we honor them all, those who never came home and those who are here today. <p>Listen to these veterans, and you'll also hear of the resilience of the human spirit. There was compassion: starving prisoners who shared their food. There was love: men who charged machine guns and reached for grenades so their brothers might live. There was the dark humor of war, as when someone misunderstood the code name for mortar rounds&mdash;\\"Tootsie Rolls\\"&mdash;and then shipped our troops thousands of Tootsie Rolls: candies. <p>And there was hope, as told in a letter home written by a soldier in the 7th Cavalry. Marching through the snow and ice, something caught his eye: a young lieutenant up ahead and from the muzzle of his rifle hung a pair of tiny baby booties, \\"swinging silently in the wind . . . like tiny bells.\\" They were sent by the lieutenant's wife, pregnant with their first child, and she promised to send ribbons: blue if a boy, pink if a girl. But as the war ground on, those soldiers were scattered. Until one day, on a Korean road, he spotted the lieutenant again. \\"Swinging gaily in the first rays of the morning sun,\\" the soldier wrote, were those booties, \\"and fluttering below them was the brightest, bluest piece of ribbon I have ever seen.\\" <p>Six decades on, these moments may seem like faint remembrances of a distant time. But for you&mdash;our Korean veterans and your families&mdash;I know it must feel sometimes just like just yesterday. And on days such as this, you're back there once more. For Korea was the fire that helped to forge you. <p>As we listen to the story of your service, I say let us also learn, because your lives hold lessons for us today. Korea taught us the perils when we fail to prepare. After the Second World War, a rapid drawdown left our troops underequipped, so that in the early days of Korea, their rockets literally bounced off enemy tanks. Today, as we end a decade of war and reorient our forces for the future, as we make hard choices at home, our allies and adversaries must know: The United States of America will maintain the strongest military the world has ever known, bar none, always. That is what we do. <p>Korea taught us that, as a people, we are stronger when we stand as one. On President Truman's orders, our troops served together in integrated units. And the heroism of African Americans in Korea&mdash;and Latinos and Asian Americans and Native Americans&mdash;advanced the idea: If these Americans could live and work together over there, surely we could do the same thing here at home. <p>Change came slowly. And we continue our long journey toward a more perfect Union. But for the great strides we have made toward the ideals of equality and opportunity, we must give thanks to our Korean war veterans who helped point the way. <p>Korea reminds us that when we send our troops into battle, they deserve the support and gratitude of the American people, especially when they come home. Today let us remember that right now our sons and daughters continue to risk their lives, give their lives, in Afghanistan. And as this war ends and we welcome them home, we will make it our mission to give them the respect and the care and the opportunities that they have earned. <p>And Korea reminds us that our obligations to our fallen and their families endure long after the battle ends. To this day, 7,910 Americans are still missing from the Korean war. And we will not stop working until we give these families a full accounting of their loved ones: like Sergeant First Class William Robinson, 26 years old, missing for 63 years. This week, in Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania, the Robinsons will welcome their uncle home and finally lay him to rest with full military honors. <p>Freedom is not free. And in Korea, no one paid a heavier price than those who gave all: 36,574 American patriots and, among our allies, more than 1 million of our South Korean friends, soldiers, and civilians. That July day, when the fighting finally ended, not far from where it began, some suggested, this sacrifice had been for naught; they summed it up with a phrase: \\"Die for a tie.\\" <p>It took many decades for this memorial to gain its rightful place on this great Mall where we tell our American story. It has, perhaps, taken even longer to see clearly and understand fully the true legacy of your service. But here today we can say with confidence, that war was no tie. Korea was a victory. When 50 million South Koreans live in freedom&mdash;a vibrant democracy, one of the world's most dynamic economies, in stark contrast to the repression and poverty of the North&mdash;that is a victory, and that is your legacy. <p>When our soldiers stand firm along the DMZ, when our South Korean friends can go about their lives, knowing that the commitment of the United States to the security of the Republic of Korea will never waver, that is a victory, and that is your legacy. <p>When our allies across the Asia-Pacific know&mdash;as we have proven in Korea for 60 straight years&mdash;that the United States will remain a force for peace and security and prosperity, that's a victory; that's your legacy. <p>And for generations to come, when history recalls how free nations banded together in a long cold war and how we won that war, let it be said that Korea was the first battle, where freedom held its ground and free peoples refused to yield. That too is your victory, your legacy. <p>Most of all, your legacy burns brightest right here, in a grateful Nation that reveres you, in the loving families that cherish you, like that young soldier with those baby booties swinging from his rifle. Ever since the war, the story of that soldier has been passed among our Korean war vets. Some of you may have heard it before. And many may have wondered, what became of that soldier? Today, six decades later, we now know, because we found him. His was&mdash;Richard Shank from St. Louis, Missouri. For his valor in Korea, he earned the Silver Star. Yes, Dick survived the war. He returned home. He held his baby boy in his arms. He was able to be a father to his son. <p>But this story doesn't end there, because like so many of you, Dick continued to serve in uniform. His son grew into a man, got married, had children of his own. Those children are now adults themselves, scattered across the country. And like so many American families, they still speak with pride of their grandfather's service in Korea. <p>Today, Dick Shank lives in Gainesville, Florida, and I believe he's watching us this morning. He's 84 years old, recovering from a recent fall while roller skating. [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"Life is short,\\" he says, \\"and I just keep on living it.\\" And one of the ways he keeps living it is by meeting up every year with his buddies from Korea and recalling the time they shared together in that fight, which ended 60 years ago today. <p>Veterans of the Korean war: In the spring of your youth, you learned how short and precious life can be. And because of you, millions of people can keep on living it, in freedom and in peace. Your lives are an inspiration. Your service will never be forgotten. You have the thanks of a grateful nation. And your shining deeds will live, now and forever. <p>May God bless those who gave all in Korea. May God bless you and your families. May God bless the alliances that helped secure our prosperity and our security. And may God continue to bless these United States of America. Thank you very much.\" "
"174" "\"Well, everybody, please have a seat. Welcome to the White House on this beautiful afternoon. And congratulations to the San Francisco Giants on their second World Series title in 3 years. They're making this a habit. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to start by recognizing all the fans of the Orange and Black with us today, including San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee is in the house. One of your number-one fans in Washington, Leader Nancy Pelosi is here, season ticket holder. All the Members of Congress that we've got here today, we're glad you guys are here. <p>And we want to recognize as well Larry Baer and GM Brian Sabean for building yet another championship team. Give them a big round of applause. And of course, we've got somebody who keeps on looking younger every time I see him, the Say Hey Kid, Willie Mays in the house. And of course, we've got a big&mdash;give a big congratulations to Manager Bruce Bochy, who just last week joined greats like John McGraw and Joe Torre as one of only 21 managers to win 1,500 games. That is an incredible honor. Give Bruce a big round of applause. Congratulations. <p>Now, it wasn't that long ago that these guys were already here celebrating their last World Series title. Some things apparently don't change. The Giants still won behind stellar pitching and smothering defense and timely hitting. And even though they used a different closer down the stretch, this one still had a \\"beard to fear.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>On the other hand, some things do change. In 2010, it took five games to close out the World Series. This year it only took four. There are some new faces standing behind me, some new nicknames. You got the Reverend. You've got Blockbuster. We've even got new haircuts. Where's Tim? [<i>Laughter</i>] There he is. See, you don't even recognize him anymore. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And of course, there were new moments to write into the history books as well. During the regular season, Matt Cain threw the franchise's first perfect game with a record-tying 14 strikeouts. Posey returned from injury&mdash;I wish I was that young, you just kind of snap back&mdash;comes back, hits .336, with 24 home runs and earns the National League MVP. <p>In the playoffs, the Giants dropped the first two games to the Reds, forcing them to run off three straight wins to stay alive. And then against the Cardinals, they had to come back from a 3-to-1 hole to win in seven games. In all, this team faced elimination a total of six times in the playoffs. It's no wonder that your own fans still refer to Giants baseball as torture. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But in the World Series, they decided to take it a little easier on Giants fans. In game one, Pablo Sandoval came out swinging, with a record-tying three homeruns on his way to becoming the World Series MVP. Three games later, brooms were out; it was time for more fireworks over North Beach and another parade down Market Street. <p>And with these two championships, this team has added another chapter to the storied legacy of players like Mays and McCovey and Perry. And I think it's time to add a few more names to that list: Lincecum and Cain and Posey and Kung Fu Panda. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So as the Giants prove every day, baseball can be even bigger than All-Stars and Cy Young winners. The Junior Giants program uses baseball to teach integrity and leadership and teamwork to more than 20,000 children. The team recently won a national award for their support of the LGBT community. Two years ago, the Giants became the first professional sports franchise to record an \\"It Gets Better\\" video to help bullied youth. <p>I'm proud to announce that next season, they're planning to turn the centerfield bleachers at AT&T Park into what's believed to be the first ever edible garden in a major American sports facility. With rows of kale and strawberries and eggplant, the Giants are going to help encourage local youth to eat healthy, even at the ballpark. <p>I should add, even Michelle would say it's okay to have a hotdog once in a while though. [<i>Laughter</i>] I don't want everybody to get carried away and think they have to have kale every time they go to the ballpark. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So today we are proud to honor the Giants not only for being champions on the diamond, but also being champions for the entire San Francisco community as well. They represent their city proudly, and they do a great job at it. <p>And on that note, let's hear it one more time for the World Champion San Francisco Giants. <p>[<i>At this point, San Francisco Giants President and Chief Executive Officer Laurence M. Baer thanked the President, and Manager Bruce Bochy and catcher Gerald D. \\"Buster\\" Posey presented a World Series ball and bat to the President.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> I got a World Series ball and bat, and you should know that I can't read any of their signatures. [<i>Laughter</i>] But it's greatly appreciated. Thank you so much.\" "
"175" "\"Hello, Chattanooga! Hey! Well, it is good to be back in Tennessee. It's great to be here at Amazon. <p>I want to thank Lydia for the introduction and sharing her story. Give Lydia a big round of applause. So this is something here. I just finished getting a tour of just one little corner of this massive facility, size of 28 football fields. Last year, during the busiest day of the Christmas rush, customers around the world ordered more than 300 items from Amazon every second, and a lot of those traveled through this building. So this is kind of like the North Pole of the South right here. Got a bunch of good-looking elves here. <p>Now, before we start, I want to recognize your general manager, Mike Thomas; my tour guide and your vice president, Dave Clark; you've got the mayor of Chattanooga, Andy Berke; and you've got one, of the finest gentlemen I know, your Congressman, Jim Cooper. So thank you all for being here. <p>So I've come here today to talk a little more about something I was discussing last week, and that's what we need to do as a country to secure a better bargain for the middle class: a national strategy to make sure that every single person who's willing to work hard in this country has a chance to succeed in the 21st-century economy. <p>Now, you heard from Lydia, so you know&mdash;because many of you went through it&mdash;over the past 4&frac12; years, we've been fighting our way back from the worst recession since the Great Depression, and it cost millions of Americans their jobs and their homes and their savings. And part of what it did was, it laid bare the long-term erosion that's been happening when it comes to middle class security. <p>But because the American people are resilient, we bounced back. Together, we've righted the ship. We took on a broken health care system. We invested in new American technologies to reverse our addiction to foreign oil, changed a Tax Code that had become tilted too much in favor of the wealthy at the expense of working families, saved an auto industry. And thanks to GM and the UAW working together, we're bringing jobs back here to America, including 1,800 autoworkers in Spring Hills; 1,800 workers in Spring Hills are on the job today where a plant was once closed. <p>Today, our businesses have created 7.2 million new jobs over the last 40 months. This year, we're off to our best private sector jobs growth since 1999. We now sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before. We produce more renewable energy than ever before; we produce more natural gas than anybody else in the world. Health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in 50 years. Our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years. <p>So thanks to hard-working folks like you, thanks to the grit and resilience of the American people, we've been able to clear away some of the rubble from the financial crisis. We've started to lay a new foundation for a stronger, more durable America, the kind of economic growth that's broad based, the foundation required to make this century another American century. <p>But as I said last week, and as any middle class family will tell you: We're not there yet. Even before the financial crisis hit, we were going through a decade where a few at the top were doing better and better, but most families were working harder and harder just to get by. And reversing that trend should be Washington's highest priority. It's my highest priority. <p>But so far, for most of this year, we've seen an endless parade of distractions and political posturing and phony scandals. And we keep on shifting our way&mdash;shifting our attention away from what we should be focused on, which is, how do we strengthen the middle class and grow the economy for everybody? And as Washington heads towards yet another budget debate, the stakes couldn't be higher. <p>And that's why I'm visiting cities and towns like this one, to lay out my ideas for how we can build on the cornerstone of what it means to be middle class in America: a good job with good wages, a good education; a home to call your own; affordable health care that's there for you when you get sick; a secure retirement even if you're not rich; more chances for folks to earn their way into the middle class as long as they're willing to work for it; and most importantly, the chance to pass on a better future for our kids. <p>So I'm doing a series of speeches over the next several weeks, but I came to Chattanooga today to talk about the first and most important cornerstone of middle class security, and that's a good job in a durable, growing industry. <p>It's hard to get the other stuff going if you don't have a good job. And the truth is, everything I'm going to be talking about over the next several weeks really is about jobs. Because preparing our children and our workers for the global competition they'll face, that's about jobs. A housing finance system that makes it easier and safer to buy and build new homes, that's about jobs in the construction industry. Health care that frees you from the fear of losing everything after you've worked so hard and then having the freedom to maybe start your own business because you know you'll be able to get health care, that's about jobs. And obviously, retirement benefits speak to the quality of our jobs. <p>And let me say this, something everybody here understands: Jobs are about more than just paying the bills. Jobs are about more than just statistics. We've never just defined having a job as having a paycheck here in America. A job is a source of pride; it's a source of dignity. It's the way you look after your family. It's proof that you're doing the right things and meeting your responsibilities and contributing to the fabric of your community and helping to build the country. That's what a job is all about. It's not just about a paycheck. It's not just about paying the bills. It's also about knowing that what you're doing is important, that it counts. <p>So we should be doing everything we can as a country to create more good jobs that pay good wages. Period. <p>Now, here's the thing, Chattanooga, the problem is not that we don't have ideas about how we could create even more jobs. We've got a lot of ideas out there. There are plenty of independent economists, plenty of business owners, people from both parties, agree on some of the ingredients that we need for creating good jobs. And you've heard them debated again and again over these past few years. I've proposed a lot of these ideas myself. Just 2 years ago, I announced the \\"American Jobs Act,\\" full of ideas that every independent economist said would create more jobs. Some were passed by Congress. But I've got to admit, most of them weren't. <p>Sometimes, there were ideas that historically had Republican support, and for some reason, suddenly, Republicans didn't want to support them anymore: putting people back to work rebuilding America's infrastructure; equipping our kids and our workers with the best skills; leading the world in scientific research that helps to pave the way for new jobs in new industries; accelerating our clean energy and natural gas revolutions; fixing a broken immigration system so that American workers aren't undercut, undermined because some businesses are unscrupulous and hiring folks and not paying them decent wages. <p>Independent economists say immigration reform would boost our economy by more than a trillion dollars. So we've got ideas out there we know can work. And if we don't make these investments, if we don't make these reforms, then we might as well be waving the white flag to the rest of the world, because they're moving forward. They're not slowing down. China, Germany, India, they're going. And we can't just sit by and do nothing. Doing nothing doesn't help the middle class. <p>So today I came here to offer a framework that might help break through some of the political logjam in Washington and try to get Congress to start moving on some of these proven ideas. But let me briefly outline some of the areas I think we need to focus on if we want to create good jobs, with good wages, in durable industries, areas that will fuel our future growth. <p>Number one, jobs in American manufacturing. Over the past 4 years, for the first time since the 1990s, the number of manufacturing jobs in America hasn't gone down, it's actually gone up. So the trend lines are good; now we've got to build on that progress. I want to offer new incentives for manufacturers not to ship jobs overseas, but to bring them back here to America. I want new tax credits so communities hit hardest by plant closures can attract new investment. <p>In my State of the Union Address, I asked Congress to build on a successful pilot program we've set up. We want to create not just 15 manufacturing innovation institutes that connect businesses and universities and Federal agencies to help communities left behind by global competition to become centers of high-tech jobs, today I'm asking Congress to build on this bipartisan support and triple that number from 15 to 45: these hubs, where we're getting businesses, universities, communities all to work together to develop centers of high-tech industries all throughout the United States that allow us to be at the forefront of the next revolution of manufacturing. I want it made here in the United States of America. I don't want that happening overseas. <p>Number two&mdash;I talked about this last week&mdash;jobs rebuilding our infrastructure. I look at this amazing facility, and you guys, you don't miss a beat. I mean, you've got these packages coming out. You've got dog food and Kindles and beard trimmers and&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. I mean, there's all kinds of stuff around here. But once it's packed up, it's got to get to the customer. And how quickly and how dependably it gets to the customer depends on, do we have good roads? Do we have good bridges? Do we have state-of-the-art airports? <p>We've got about $2 trillion of deferred maintenance here in this country. So let's put more construction workers back on the job doing the work America needs done. These are vital projects that Amazon needs, businesses all across the country need, like widening Route 27 here in Chattanooga, deepening the Jacksonville Port that I visited last week. These are projects vital to our national pride. <p>We're going to be breaking ground this week at the St. Louis Arch. Congress should pass what I've called my Fix-It-First plan to put people to work immediately on our most urgent repairs, like the 100,000 bridges that are old enough to qualify for Medicare. That will create good middle class jobs right now. [<i>Applause</i>] Right now. And we should partner with the private sector to upgrade what businesses like Amazon need most. We should have a modern air traffic control system to keep planes running on time. We should have modern power grids and pipelines to survive a storm. We should have modern schools to prepare our kids for the jobs of tomorrow. <p>Number three, we need to keep creating good jobs in energy: in wind and solar and natural gas. Those new energy sources are reducing energy costs. They're reducing dangerous carbon pollution. They're reducing our dependence on foreign oil. So now is not the time to gut investments in American technology. Now is the time to double down on renewable energy and biofuels and electric vehicles and to put money into the research that will shift our cars and trucks off oil for good. <p>And let me tell you, cheaper costs of natural gas is a huge boost to our businesses here in America, so we should develop it even more. We've got to do it in a way that protects our air and our water for our children and future generations, but we can do that. We've got the technology to do it. <p>Number four, we've got to export more. We want to send American goods all around the world. A year ago, I signed a new trade agreement with Korea, because they were selling a lot of Hyundais here, but we weren't selling a lot of GM cars over there. Since we signed that deal, our Big Three automakers are selling 18 percent more cars in Korea than they were. <p>So now we've got to help more of our businesses do the same thing. I'm asking Congress for the authority to negotiate the best trade deals possible for our workers and combine it with robust training and assistance measures to make sure our workers have the support and the skills they need for this new global competition. And we're going to have to sharpen our competitive edge in the global job marketplace. <p>Two years ago, we created something called SelectUSA. This is a coordinated effort to attract foreign companies looking to invest and create jobs here in the United States. And today I'm directing my Cabinet to expand these efforts. And this October, I'm going to bring business leaders from around the world, and I'm going to connect them to State leaders and local leaders like your mayor who are ready to prove there's no better place to do business than right here in the United States of America. <p>Number five, let's help more than&mdash;let's do more to help the more than 4 million long-term unemployed Americans that are out there. One of the problems that happens is, a lot of folks, they lose their jobs during this really bad recession through no fault of their own. They've got what it takes to fill that job opening, but because they've been out of work so long employers won't even give their application a fair look. <p>So I'm challenging CEOs to do more to get these Americans back on their feet. And I'm going to bring together the CEOs and companies that are putting in place some of the best practices for recruiting and training and hiring workers who have been out of work for a long time, but want the chance to show that they're ready to go back to work. <p>And at the same time, I'm calling on our businesses to do more for their workers. Amazon is a great example of what's possible. What you're doing here at Amazon with your Career Choice Program pays 95 percent of the tuition for employees who want to earn skills in fields with high demand, not just, by the way, jobs here at Amazon, but jobs anywhere: computer-aided design or nursing. I talked to Jeff Bezos yesterday, and he was so proud of the fact that he wants to see every employee at Amazon continually upgrade their skills and improve. And if they've got a dream they want to pursue, Amazon wants to help them pursue it. <p>That's the kind of approach that we need from America's businesses. Offering training programs, health care, retirement plans, paying better wages&mdash;that's not just the right thing to do, it's actually good for your bottom line. A recent study shows that when a company makes the list of the 100 best companies to work for in America, its share price outperforms its competitors, because the stock market and investors, they know if a company has employees that are motivated and happy, that business is more likely to succeed. [<i>Applause</i>] That business is more likely to succeed. <p>And because nobody who works full-time in America should have to live in poverty, I'm going to keep on making the case and fighting for the fact that we need to raise our minimum wage, because right now it's in lower terms than it was when Ronald Reagan took office. When folks have more money in their pockets, that's good for Amazon; it means your customers have a little more money. They can order a little more of that protein powder. [<i>Laughter</i>] I noticed a lot of folks were ordering protein power. Everybody is trying to get bulked up. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So here's&mdash;those are some of the ideas that we're out there, we're promoting. We're not lacking for ideas, we're just lacking action, especially out of Washington. <p>For most of the past 2 years, Washington has just taken its eye off the ball when it comes to the middle class. And I'll tell you, look, there are a growing number of&mdash;the good news is, there are a growing number of Republican Senators who are trying to work with Democrats to get some stuff done. That's good news. <p>The bad news is that rather than keep our focus on what should be our priority&mdash;which is growing our economy and creating good middle class jobs&mdash;we've seen a certain faction of Republicans in Congress hurt a fragile recovery by saying that they wouldn't pay the very bills that Congress racked up in the first place, threatening to shut down the people's Government if they can't get rid of Obamacare. Instead of reducing our deficits with a scalpel to get rid of programs we don't need, but keep vital investments that we do, this same group has kept in place this meat cleaver called the sequester that is just slashing all kinds of important investments in education and research and our military. All the things that are needed to make this country a magnet for good middle class jobs, those things are being cut. <p>And these moves don't just hurt our economy in the long term, they hurt our middle class right now. The independent Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cuts that are being made right now in Washington will cost our economy 750,000 jobs this year, 900,000 fewer jobs next year. And a lot of the jobs at risk are at small businesses that contract with our military or our Federal agencies. <p>Over the past 4 years, another 700,000 workers at the Federal, State, and local levels of government have lost their jobs. These are cops and firefighters, and about half of them are people who work in our schools. Those are real jobs. It doesn't help a company like Amazon when a teacher or a cop or a firefighter loses their job. They don't have money to place an order. That's hundreds of thousands of customers who have less money to spend. <p>If those layoffs had not happened, if public sector employees grew like they did in the past two recessions, the unemployment rate would be 6.5 instead of 7.5. Our economy would be much better off, and the deficit would still be going down because we'd be getting more tax revenue. <p>So the point is, if Washington spent as much time and energy these past 2 years figuring out how to grow our economy and grow our middle class as it's spent manufacturing crises in pursuit of a cut-at-all-costs approach to deficits, we'd be much better off. [<i>Applause</i>] We'd be much better off. <p>And it's not like we don't have to cut our deficits. As a share of the economy, we've cut our deficits by nearly half since I took office&mdash;half. And they're projected to go down even further, but there's a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it. And we should do it in a way that actually helps middle class families instead of hurts them. <p>I've told Republicans that if they're serious about a balanced, long-term fiscal plan that replaces harmful budget cuts, that would get serious about a long-term plan that prevents those 900,000 jobs from being lost, that helps grow the economy, that helps the middle class&mdash;I am ready to go. But we can't lose sight of our north star. We can't allow an impasse over long-term fiscal challenges to distract us from what the middle class needs right now. <p>So here's the bottom line: If folks in Washington really want a grand bargain, how about a grand bargain for middle class jobs? [<i>Applause</i>] How about a grand bargain for middle class jobs? <p>I don't want to go through the same old arguments where I propose an idea and the Republicans just say no because it's my idea. So I'm going to try offering something that serious people in both parties should be able to support: a deal that simplifies the Tax Code for our businesses and creates good jobs with good wages for middle class folks who work at those businesses. <p>Right now&mdash;everybody knows this&mdash;our Tax Code is so riddled with loopholes and special interest tax breaks that a lot of companies who are doing the right thing and investing in America pay 35 percent in their taxes; corporations who have got fancy accountants and stash their money overseas, they pay little or nothing in taxes. That's not fair, and it's not good for the economy here. <p>So I'm willing to simplify our Tax Code: closes those loopholes, ends incentives to ship jobs overseas, lowers the rate for businesses that are creating jobs right here in America, provides tax incentives for manufacturers that bring jobs home to the United States. Let's simplify taxes for small-business owners, give them incentives to invest so they can spend less time filling out complicated forms, more time expanding and hiring. <p>I'm willing to do all that; that should help businesses and help them grow. But if we're going to give businesses a better deal, then we're also going to have to give workers a better deal too. I want to use some of the money that we save by closing these loopholes to create more good construction jobs with infrastructure initiatives that I already talked about. We can build a broader network of high-tech manufacturing hubs that leaders from both parties can support. We can help our community colleges arm our workers with the skills that a global economy demands. All these things would benefit the middle class right now and benefit our economy in the years to come. <p>So again, here's the bottom line: I'm willing to work with Republicans on reforming our corporate Tax Code, as long as we use the money from transitioning to a simpler tax system for a significant investment in creating middle class jobs. That's the deal. <p>And I'm just going to keep on throwing ideas out there to see if something takes. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm going to lay out my ideas to give the middle class a better shot. But now it's time for Republicans to lay out their ideas. <p>If they've got a better plan to bring back more manufacturing jobs here to Tennessee and around the country, then let them know&mdash;let me know. I want to hear them. If they've got a better plan to create jobs rebuilding our infrastructure or to help workers earn the high-tech skills that they need, then they should offer up these ideas. <p>But I've got to tell you, just gutting our environmental protection, that's not a jobs plan. Gutting investments in education, that's not a jobs plan. They keep on talking about this&mdash;an oil pipeline coming down from Canada that's estimated to create about 50 permanent jobs; that's not a jobs plan. Wasting the country's time by taking something like 40 meaningless votes to repeal Obamacare is not a jobs plan. [<i>Applause</i>] That's not a jobs plan. <p>So let's get serious. They're&mdash;look, I want to tell everybody here the truth. And you know, look, I know that the politics for Obama aren't always great in Tennessee. I understand that. But I want everybody to just hear the honest truth. I've run my last campaign, so I don't need to spin. <p>And here's the truth: There are no gimmicks that create jobs. There are no simple tricks to grow the economy. Growing the economy, making sure that the middle class is strong, it's like getting in shape. You can't just go on the muffin and doughnut diet and the latest fad and lose weight. You've got to work out, and you've got to eat better. Right? Well, the same is true for our economy. The same is true for helping the middle class. <p>We've got to have a serious, steady, long-term American strategy to reverse the long-term erosion of middle class security and give everybody a fair shot. And we know what we have to do. It involves education. It involves infrastructure. It involves research. It involves good energy policy. And we just have to stay at it. More good jobs that pay decent wages, a better bargain for the middle class, an economy that grows from the middle out&mdash;that's got to be our focus. <p>We can't be getting into a whole bunch of fads and pretend like you roll back Obamacare and suddenly, all these jobs are going to be created, because the middle class was struggling before I came into office. The middle class was losing ground before I came into office. Jobs were getting shipped overseas before Obamacare was in place. So we've got to be honest. We've got to be honest about the challenges we face, but also the opportunities that are out there. <p>And that's what I'm going to be focused on not just for the next few months. I'm going to be focused for every one of the 1,270 days I've got left in my Presidency on how to make sure that we've got more opportunity and more security for everybody who is willing to work hard in this country. That's where I believe America needs to go. And we can do it if we work together, Chattanooga. Let's get to work. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"176" "\"<i>The President.</i> Everybody, have a seat. Well, welcome to the White House, everybody. Congratulations to the NCAA Champion UConn Huskies. Congratulations to Coach Auriemma on your record-tying eighth national championship. I see this guy too much. [<i>Laughter</i>] Keep in mind, a lot of Presidents don't even get 8 years in the White House. [<i>Laughter</i>] He's spent more time than some Presidents in the White House. [<i>Laughter</i>] And he's not term limited, so he can just keep on going. <p>We've got UConn president, Susan Herbst is here. Where did she go? There she is up here. I wasn't sure where she was sitting. We've got some outstanding Huskies fans in the house, including several proud members of your congressional delegation. So give them a big round of applause. <p>Probably the most important person here is not Coach Geno, but Coach Geno's mom, who is here. So please give her a big round of applause&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;who is so proud. And she's gorgeous. And that's where you got a good head of hair. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I have to say to the Huskies, I've missed you guys. It's been, what, a couple years? Seniors Heather Buck, Caroline Doty made the trip to the White House in 2009. So they're old&mdash;this is old hat for them. Kelly Faris joined them in 2010. Now, back there, they were in the middle of a 90-game winning streak. <p>I reminded Geno at the time, when I called him, that over the first 23 months I was in office, he didn't lose once. He just pointed out to me that when they won the championship, I went on to win reelection. So he thinks we've got a good thing going here. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, most years, I think for most teams, being a champion isn't about dominating the way that you did back then. It's about being at your best when the stakes are highest. And that's what made this team so special. <p>To get that national title, they had to go through a team that, let's face it, had had your number during some previous games: Notre Dame. Heading into this season's tournament you had to play&mdash;you had played them three times, you had lost three, that heartbreaker in the Big East finals. <p>After that game, some teams might have lowered their sights. But rather than get discouraged, Geno gathered you together in the locker room, I understand, and said, \\"I'm going to show you how to win a championship.\\" And as Kelly pointed out, Geno is pretty good at his job. He knows how to win championships. <p>So it looked tough at the time, but these folks didn't stop believing in themselves. I have to confess that my bracketology needs some work. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Team member.</i> Mm-hmm. <p><i>The President.</i> Mm-hmm. [<i>Laughter</i>] Somebody back there is all, \\"Mm-hmm.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Breanna Stewart had the game of her life, became the first freshman in 25 years to be named most outstanding player in the Final Four. Give her a big round of applause. Hey! Bria Hartley, Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, and Kelly Faris earned their spots on the all-tournament team. After losing their first three games against Notre Dame by a combined 12 points, won the last one by 18. <p>After that, no matter how talented Louisville was, there wasn't much doubt that you'd take another title home to Storrs or that thousands of fans would be waiting to join them in the celebration. Because as any UConn fan will tell you, folks just love this team, and it goes beyond what they do on the court. One fan came to the victory parade to take pictures for his daughter, and he was quoted as saying: \\"We come to as many games as we can because they are truly amazing. They're great role models.\\" They're great role models. <p>And that's true in the classroom. I want to congratulate all three seniors on earning not just another title, but earning their college degrees as well. It is true overseas, where a lot of these folks played on Team USA, whether it's Geno and the six UConn Huskies who helped bring home the Gold at the London Olympics or Breanna leading our under-19 team to a championship just a few days ago. <p>When they're not hitting the books or representing their country, they find time to get involved in the community. Last year, players visited the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp for children with serious illnesses, joined the Walk for Autism. Geno just held his 11th annual charity golf tournament. And while you may be rivals with Baylor on the court, you joined together off the court to raise over $30,000 for the Kay Yow Cancer Fund. <p>And so that's why we're so happy to have you all back to the White House. These are just some incredible athletes. They've made their mark as one of the great sports dynasties of our time, but they're also just really outstanding young women. You couldn't be prouder of them. I know some parents may be here, and I know you could not be prouder of them. And I told them&mdash;and I always say this&mdash;as the father of two young, beautiful, athletic, and tall daughters&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;it just always puts a smile on my face whenever I see such class acts represent their school and their country so well. <p>So congratulations, UConn. Good luck as you get ready for the fall. I told them to take a little time off, but they said Coach won't let them. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I'm overruling him; take a weekend. [<i>Laughter</i>] Just relax a little bit. <p>So congratulations.\" "
"177" "\"Hi, everybody. This week, I went down to an Amazon warehouse in Tennessee to talk more about what we need to do to secure a better bargain for the middle class, to make sure that anyone who works hard can get ahead in the 21st-century economy. <p>Over the past 4&frac12; years, we've fought our way back from the worst recession of our lifetimes and begun to lay a foundation for stronger, more durable economic growth. Today, our businesses have created 7.3 million new jobs over the last 41 months. We now sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before. Health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in 50 years, and our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years. <p>But as any middle class family will tell you, we're not where we need to be yet. Even before this crisis hit, we were living through a decade where a few at the top were doing better and better, while most families were working harder and harder just to get by. <p>Reversing this trend must be Washington's highest priority. It sure is mine. But too often over the past 2 years, Washington has taken its eye off the ball. They've allowed an endless parade of political posturing and phony scandals to distract from growing our economy and strengthening the middle class. <p>That's why I'm laying out my ideas for how we can build on the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class in America: a good education; a home of your own; health care when you get sick; a secure retirement even if you're not rich; and the most important cornerstone of all, a good job in a durable, growing industry. <p>When it comes to creating more good jobs that pay decent wages, the problem is not a lack of ideas. Plenty of independent economists, business owners, and people from both parties agree on what we have to do. I proposed many of these ideas 2 years ago in the \\"American Jobs Act.\\" And this week, I put forward commonsense proposals for how we can create more jobs in manufacturing; in wind, solar, and natural gas; and by rebuilding America's infrastructure. <p>What we're lacking is action from Washington. And that's why, in addition to proposing ideas that we know will grow our economy, I also put forward a strategy for breaking through the Washington logjam: a grand bargain for the middle class. <p>I'm willing to work with Republicans to simplify our Tax Code for businesses large and small, but only if we take the money we save by transitioning to a simpler tax system and make a significant investment in creating good, middle class jobs. We can put construction workers back on the job rebuilding our infrastructure. We can boost manufacturing so more American companies can sell their products around the world. And we can help our community colleges arm our workers with the skills they need in a global economy, all without adding a dime to the deficit. <p>I'll keep laying out my ideas to give the middle class a better shot in the 21st century, and I'll keep reaching out to Republicans for theirs. But gutting critical investments in our future and threatening a national default on the bills that Congress has already racked up, that's not an economic plan. Denying health care to millions of Americans or shutting down the Government just because I'm for keeping it open, that won't help the middle class. <p>The truth is, there are no gimmicks when it comes to creating jobs. There are no tricks to grow the economy. Reversing the long erosion of middle class security in this country won't be easy. But if we work together and take a few bold steps, and if Washington is willing to set aside politics and focus on what really matters, we can grow our economy and give the middle class a better bargain. And together, we can make this country a place where everyone who works hard can get ahead. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "

Thank you. I am now 52, and Michelle says that I don't look a day over 51. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So over the last few weeks, I've been visiting towns all across the country, talking about what we need to do to secure a better bargain for the middle class: a national strategy to make sure that everybody who works hard has a chance to succeed in the 21st-century economy. <p>And I think people in Arizona especially understand the challenges that are out there, because for the past 4&frac12; years, together, we've fought our way back from a devastating recession that cost millions of jobs for Americans. A lot of folks lost their homes; a lot of folks lost their savings. And what the recession showed was the long erosion of middle class security that had been taking place for decades. <p>But we fought back. We took on a broken health care system. We took on a housing market that was in free fall. We invested in new technologies to reverse our addiction to foreign oil. We changed a Tax Code that had become tilted a little bit too much in favor of the wealthiest Americans at the expense of working families. We saved the auto industry. We've now got GM that plans to hire a thousand new workers right next door in Chandler to make sure we're building some of the best cars in the world right here in the United States of America. <p>Our businesses have created 7.3 million new jobs over the past 41 months. We now sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before. Our exports are way up. We produce more renewable energy than ever before, more natural gas than anybody else. Health care costs have been growing at the slowest rate in 50 years. And our deficits are coming down at the fastest rate in 60 years. So we're making progress. <p>So thanks to the efforts of a lot of people like you, we've cleared away the rubble of the financial crisis. We're starting to lay the foundation for more stable, more durable economic growth. But as any middle class family will tell you, we're not yet where we need to be. Because even before the crisis hit, we had lived through a decade where a few at the top were doing better and better, but most families were working harder and harder just to get by. <p>And reversing this trend should be&mdash;must be&mdash;Washington's highest priority. It's my highest priority. I want to make sure that in America, it doesn't matter what you look like, where you come from, who you love; you should be able to make it when you try. [<i>Applause</i>] You should be able to make it. <p>Now, unfortunately, for the last year or so, we've had an endless parade of distractions and political posturing and phony scandals that shift focus away from what do we need to do to shore up middle class families and create ladders of opportunity for folks to get into the middle class. And as Washington heads towards another budget debate, the stakes could not be higher. <p>And that's why I'm traveling around, laying out my ideas for how we have to build the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class: a good job with good wages; a home to call your own; a good education; affordable health care that's there for you when you get sick; a secure retirement even if you're not rich; the opportunity&mdash;the ladders of opportunity&mdash;for people to earn their way into the middle class, to work their way out of poverty. Those are the elements that I think all of us believe in, but right now we're not delivering as much as we should on those promises. <p>Now, last Tuesday, I went to Tennessee to talk about the first cornerstone, which is how do we make sure that we're creating good middle class jobs here in the United States of America. Today I've come to Phoenix to talk about the second component, which is the most tangible cornerstone that lies at the heart of the American Dream, at the heart of middle class life, and that's the chance to own your own home. The chance to own your own home. <p>We've got a lot of young people here who are thinking about college, they're going to get a higher education, they're going to find a job, they're going to find somebody they love, they're going to want to own a home. And the reason they will is because a home is the ultimate evidence that here in America, hard work pays off, that responsibility is rewarded. <p>I think about my grandparents' generation. When my grandfather served in World War II, he fought in Patton's army. When he got back, this country gave him a chance to go to college on the GI bill, but it also gave him the chance to buy his first home with a loan from the FHA. To him and to generations of Americans before and since, a home was more than just a house. It was a source of pride and a source of security. It was a place to raise kids, to put down roots; a place to&mdash;where you could build up savings for college or to start a business or to retire with some security. <p>And buying a home required responsibility on everybody's part. You had to save up to buy a home. And then banks were supposed to give you a fair deal, with terms you could understand, and buyers were supposed to live within their means and make sure that they could make their payments. So in that earlier generation, houses weren't for flipping around&mdash;it wasn't for speculation&mdash;houses were to live in and to build a life with. <p>And unfortunately, over time, responsibility too often gave way to recklessness. You had reckless lenders who sold loans to people they knew couldn't afford them. And let's face it, we also had some reckless buyers who knew they couldn't afford them and still took out loans. And all this created a housing bubble. And especially in some places like Arizona, it was devastating when that bubble finally burst, triggered a recession. Millions of Americans who had done everything right were hurt badly by the actions of other people. Housing prices plummeted. <p>By the time I took office, home values had fallen almost 20 percent from the year before. New housing starts had fallen nearly 80 percent from their peak. Hundreds of thousands of construction workers had lost their jobs. A record number of people were behind on their mortgage payments. And a lot of people here in Phoenix, they saw that devastation. This was part of ground zero for the housing bubble bursting. <p>So less than a month after I took office, I came here to Arizona, and I laid out steps to stabilize the housing market and help responsible homeowners get back on their feet. And the truth is, it's been a long, slow process. The housing market's so big that it was going to take some time to heal when it got hurt that badly. It's taken longer than any of us would like. But during that time, we helped millions of Americans save an average of $3,000 each year by refinancing at lower rates. We helped millions of responsible homeowners stay in their homes, which was good for their neighbors because you don't want a bunch of foreclosure signs in your neighborhood. <p>Where Congress wouldn't act, we went ahead and acted, so over the past few years, we had the Department of Justice stand up for buyers who had been discriminated against or conned by predatory lending. And we won a settlement that gave more money to victims of discrimination in 1 year than in the previous 23 years combined. <p>We worked with States to force big banks to repay more than $50 billion to more than 1.5 million families: largest lending settlement in history. We extended the time that folks who had lost their jobs could delay their payment on their mortgages while they kept looking for work. We cracked down on the bad practices that led the crisis&mdash;led to the crisis in the first place. I mean, you had some loans back there in the bubble that were called \\"liar's loans.\\" Now, something called a liar's loan, it's probably a bad idea. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So because of all these actions we've been taking, our housing market is beginning to heal. Home prices are rising at the fastest pace in 7 years. Sales are up nearly 50 percent. Construction is up nearly 75 percent. New foreclosures are down by nearly two-thirds. Millions of families have been able to come up for air; they're no longer underwater on their mortgages. <p>And just like the crisis hit Phoenix very hard, thanks to some great leadership here locally, Phoenix has also led one of the biggest comebacks in the country. So you should be proud of what you've done here. Home prices in Phoenix have risen by nearly 20 percent over the last year. New home sales are up by more than 25 percent. <p>This morning I&mdash;right before I came here, I visited Erickson Construction. [<i>Applause</i>] Hey! We've got some Erickson folks here. And they were explaining how, right when the bubble hit, Erickson shrunk&mdash;shrank to less than a hundred workers. Today they're employing 580 people&mdash;and they're hiring even more people&mdash;because the housing market's bouncing back. <p>So that's one of the things about housing: It's not just important for the person who owns the house. Our economy is so impacted by everything that happens in housing. Consumers feel better when their home values are in a better place, so they're more willing to spend. A lot of people who want to start a business, their savings may be locked up in their house. Construction workers, contractors, suppliers, carpet makers&mdash;all these folks are impacted by the housing industry. <p>So we've made progress, and that's helped to move the economy forward. But we've got to build on this progress. We're not where we need to be yet. We've got to give more hard-working Americans the chance to buy their first home. We have to help more responsible homeowners refinance their mortgages, because a lot of them still have a spread between the rates they're paying right now on their mortgage and what they could be getting if they were able to refinance. <p>And we've got to turn the page on this kind of bubble-and-bust mentality that helped to create this mess in the first place. We got to build a housing system that is durable and fair and rewards responsibility for generations to come. That's what we've got to do. <p>So I've already put forward a bunch of ideas that will help to accomplish that. And look, the fact of the matter is, Congress hasn't enacted all of them, so I'd like you to encourage Members of Congress to take some of these actions. <p>But like the other actions that we've taken, these will not help the neighbors down the street who bought a house that they couldn't afford and then walked away from it and left a foreclosed home behind. We don't want to help speculators who bought multiple homes just to make a quick buck. <p>What we want to do is put forward ideas that will help millions of responsible, middle class homeowners who still need relief. And we want to help hard-working Americans who dream of owning their own home fair and square, have a down payment, are willing to make those payments, understand that owning a home requires responsibility. And there are some immediate actions we could take right now that would help on that front, that would make a difference. So let me just list a couple of them. <p>Number one, Congress should pass a good, bipartisan idea to allow every homeowner the chance to save thousands of dollars a year by refinancing their mortgage at today's rates. We need to get that done. We've been talking about it for a year and a half, 2 years, 3 years. There's no reason not to do it. <p>Step number two, now that we've made it harder for reckless buyers to buy homes that they can't afford, let's make it a little bit easier for qualified buyers to buy the homes that they can afford. So Shaun Donovan has been working with the finance industry to make sure we're simplifying overlapping regulations; we're cutting redtape for responsible families who want to get a mortgage, but keep getting rejected by the banks. We need to give well-qualified Americans who lost their jobs during the crisis a fair chance to get a loan if they've worked hard to repair their credit. <p>And step three is something that you don't always hear about when it comes to the housing market, and that is fixing our broken immigration system. It would actually help our housing market. It's pretty simple: When more people buy homes and play by the rules, home values go up for everybody. And according to one recent study, the average homeowner has already seen the value of their home boosted by thousands of dollars just because of immigration. <p>And the good news is, with the help of your Senators, John McCain and Jeff Flake, the Senate has already passed a bipartisan immigration bill. It's got the support of CEOs and labor and law enforcement. This could help homeownership here. So I want you to encourage Republicans in the House of Representatives to stop dragging their feet. Let's go ahead and get this done. <p>Step number four, we should address the uneven recovery by rebuilding the communities hit the hardest by the housing crisis, including many right here in Arizona. Let's put construction back&mdash;construction workers back to work repairing rundown homes, tearing down vacant properties, so that the value of homes in those surrounding areas start picking up. We can put people to work right now and improve the remaining housing stock that's out there. Places that are facing a longer road back from the crisis should have their country's help to get back on their feet. <p>Step five, we should make sure families that don't want to buy a home or can't yet afford to buy one still have a decent place to rent. We&mdash;it's important for us to encourage homeownership, but a lot of people rent and there's nothing wrong with renting. And we got to make sure that we are creating affordable opportunities when it comes to rental properties. <p>In the runup to the crisis, banks and governments too often made everybody feel like they had to own a home, even if they weren't ready and didn't have the payments. That's a mistake we should not repeat. Instead, let's invest in affordable rental housing. Let's bring together cities and States to address local barriers that drive up rents for working families. <p>So if we help more Americans refinance their homes, if we help qualified families get a mortgage, we reform our immigration system, we rebuild the hardest hit communities, we make sure that folks have a decent place to rent if they're not yet able to buy, all these steps will give more middle class families the chance to either buy their own home now or eventually buy their own home. It's going to give more relief to responsible homeowners. It gives more options to families who aren't yet ready to buy. All that is going to improve the housing market and will improve the economy. <p>But&mdash;and this is the last key point I want to make&mdash;as home prices rise, we can't just reinflate another housing bubble. I mean, everybody&mdash;I hope everybody here in Arizona learned some hard lessons from what happened. Housing prices generally don't just keep on going up forever at the kind of pace it was going up. It was crazy. So what we want to do is something stable and steady. And that's why I want to lay a rock-solid foundation to make sure the kind of crisis we went through never happens again. [<i>Applause</i>] We've got to make sure it doesn't happen again. <p>And one of the key things to make sure it doesn't happen again is to wind down these companies that are not really Government, but not really private sector; they're known as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. For too long, these companies were allowed to make huge profits buying mortgages, knowing that if their bets went bad, taxpayers would be left holding the bag. It was heads we win, tails you lose. And it was wrong. And along with what happened on Wall Street, it helped to inflate this bubble in a way that ultimately killed Main Street. <p>So the good news is, right now there's a bipartisan group of Senators working to end Fannie and Freddie as we know them. And I support these kinds of reform efforts. And they're following four core principles for what I believe this reform should look like. <p>First, private capital should take a bigger role in the mortgage market. I know that sounds confusing to folks who call me a socialist; I think I saw some posters there on the way in. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I actually believe in the free market. And just like the health care law that we put in place, Obamacare&mdash;which, by the way, if you don't have health insurance or you're buying it at exorbitant rates on the individual market, starting on October 1, you can join a marketplace and be part of a pool that gives you much lower premiums, saves you a lot of money. <p>But in the same way that what we did with health care was to set up clear rules for insurance companies to protect consumers, make it more affordable, but still built on the private marketplace, I believe that our housing system should operate where there's a limited government role and private lending should be the backbone of the housing market. And that includes, by the way, community-based lenders who view their borrowers not just as a number, but as a neighbor. So that's one principle. <p>A second principle is, we can't leave taxpayers on the hook for irresponsibility or bad decisions by some of these lenders or Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. We've got to encourage the pursuit of profit, but the era of expectinga bailout after you pursue your profit and you don't manage your risk well, well, that puts the whole country at risk. And we're ending those days. We're not going to do that anymore. <p>Third principle is, we should preserve access to safe and simple mortgage products like the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage. That's something families should be able to rely on when they're making the most important purchase of their lives. <p>Number four, we've got to keep housing affordable for first-time buyers, like all these young people. When they're ready to buy a house, we've got to make sure it's affordable. Families who are working to climb their way into the middle class, we've got to do what we can to make housing affordable. And that means we've got to strengthen the FHA so it gives today's families the same kind of chance it gave my grandparents to buy a home, and it preserves those rungs on the ladder of opportunity. <p>And we've got to support, as I said, affordable rental housing. And by the way, we've also got to keep up our fight against homelessness. The mayor of Phoenix has been doing a great job here in Phoenix on that front. We've got to continue to improve it. <p>Since I took office, we helped bring one in four homeless veterans off the streets. We should be proud of that. Here in Phoenix, thanks to the hard work of everyone from Mayor Stanton to the local United Way, to US Airways, you're on track to end chronic homelessness for veterans, period, by 2014. <p>But we've got to keep going, because nobody in America&mdash;and certainly no veteran&mdash;should be left to live on the streets. <p>So here's the bottom line: put all these principles together, that's going to protect our entire economy, and it will improve the housing market not just here in Phoenix, but throughout the State and throughout the country. <p>We're also going to need to make sure, though, that we're protecting individual homeowners. We've got to give them the tools that they can protect themselves. So we've got a Consumer Finance Protection Bureau that we created. And it's laying down new rules of the road that everybody can count on when they're shopping for a mortgage. They're designing a new, simple mortgage form that will be in plain English so you can actually read it without a lawyer; although, you may still want a lawyer. Obviously, I'm not saying you don't; I'm just saying you'll be able to read it. [<i>Laughter</i>] There won't be a lot of fine print. That way you know before you owe. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And the Senate finally confirmed Richard Cordray as the head of this&mdash;head watchdog for the CFPB. So he's out there aggressively protecting consumers and homeowners. <p>Now, when it comes to some of the other leaders we need to look out for the American people, the Senate still has a job to do. Months ago, I nominated a man named Mel Watt to be our Nation's top housing regulator. He is an outstanding Member of Congress. And during that time, he was on the Housing Committee, worked with banks, worked with borrowers to protect consumers, to help responsible lenders provide credit. He is the right person for the job. Congress and the Senate should give his nomination an up-or-down vote without any more obstruction or delay. We don't have time for those kinds of games. <p>So I want to be honest with you: No program or policy is going to solve all the problems in a multitrillion-dollar housing market. The housing bubble went up so high that the heights it reached before it burst were so unsustainable, that we knew it was going to take some time for us to fully recover. But if we take the steps that I talked about today, then I know we will restore not just our home values, but also our common values. We'll make owning a home a symbol of responsibility, not speculation, a source of security for generations to come, just like it was for my grandparents. I want it to be just like that for all the young people who are here today and their children and their grandchildren. <p>And if we stay focused on middle class security and opportunities to get into the middle class, if we take the strategy that I'm laying out for the entire economy&mdash;for jobs and housing and education, health care, retirement, creating ladders of opportunity&mdash;then we will secure that better bargain for all Americans, where hard work is once again rewarded with a shot at a middle class life, which means more Americans will know the pride of that first paycheck. More Americans will know the satisfaction of flipping the sign to \\"Open\\" on their own business. More Americans will know the joy of scratching the child's height on the door of their new home, with pencil, of course. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We can do all this if we work together. And it won't be easy. But if we take just a few bold steps, and if Washington will just end the gridlock, set aside the slash-and-burn partisanship, actually try to solve problems instead of scoring political points, our economy will grow stronger a year from now, 5 years from now, 10 years from now. <p>And as long as I've got the privilege to serve as your President, that's what I'm going to be fighting for. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you.\" "
"179" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Marines! <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> Hello, Camp Pendleton! <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> Well, listen, it is great to be here, at the home of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force&mdash;- <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i>&mdash;&mdash;and one of our Nation's oldest and most decorated military units, the legendary 1st Marine Division. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> And I think I see some proud Navy folks here too. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p>Let me thank General Nicholson for the introduction and for his outstanding leadership of our Marines in Iraq, in Afghanistan. And that includes your command of the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade out of Camp Lejeune, which we recognized last year with the Presidential Unit Citation. Thank you, General Nicholson. <p>I want to thank all of your commanders for welcoming me today, including General Coglianese and General Busby. And I want to recognize your incredible staff, noncommissioned officers, including Sergeant Majors Ronald Green, Scott Helms, and David Jobe. <p>I want to salute Debbie Nicholson and all the spouses and military families who are here, because we understand they're the force behind the force. Just like Michelle is the force behind me. I want everyone to give a big round of applause to the amazing families who serve along with you. <p>And I want to acknowledge Members of Congress who are here, including Susan Davis, Darrell Issa, and Dana Rohrabacher. <p>Now, I've got to tell you the truth, I've been looking forward to this visit because&mdash;and this is a little tricky to say this&mdash;but my family and I, we've got a special place in our hearts for the Marine Corps. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> Now, part of it is because every day at the White House, we're surrounded by marines. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> In fact, we've probably got some folks here who were at the White House, who are now here at Camp Pendleton. <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> See? [<i>Laughter</i>] I figured as much. <p>And then, of course, every time I need, kind of a hop, skip, and a jump somewhere, every time I get on Marine One, I rely on some of the best aviators in the world. I've seen your honor, I've seen your courage, I've seen your commitment; whether in protecting our diplomatic posts around the world or preparing to deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan or recovering from wounds received in battle. <p>A few years ago, you gave a great Camp Pendleton welcome to my wife Michelle. And I know it's not as exciting when I come to visit&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but she says hi. I guess I'm kind of like that Army general who once said; \\"The more marines I have around, the better I like it.\\" <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> I'm here because, for more than a decade, you&mdash;and all our men and women in uniform&mdash;have borne the burden in this time of war. Ever since that awful September morning when our Nation was attacked, when thousands of innocent Americans were killed, we've been at war against Al Qaida. And our fight in Afghanistan&mdash;nearly 12 years&mdash;has become America's longest war. I'm here because we recently marked another milestone in this war. As of this past June, for the first time, Afghan forces have taken the lead for security across their entire country. <p>Instead of leading the fight, our troops now have a different mission, which is to train and advise and assist Afghan forces. And what that signals is that our war in Afghanistan has entered the final chapter. More of our troops are coming home. We'll be down to 34,000 this winter. By the end of next year&mdash;in just 17 months&mdash;the transition will be complete. Afghans will take full responsibility for their security, and our war in Afghanistan will be over. <p>None of this progress would have been possible had it not been for you. We thank all who have served there, especially our Camp Pendleton marines. After our Nation was attacked, you were some of the very first conventional forces in Afghanistan; racing in, hundreds of miles by helicopter, toppling that regime and driving Al Qaida from its camps. Then when the fight shifted to Iraq, you were there, racing towards Baghdad, deposing a dictator. And through years of combat&mdash;in Tikrit, Fallujah, and Ramadi&mdash;your courage added to the glories of the Marines' long and illustrious history. <p>When we refocused on Afghanistan, you led the way again, surging into Helmand, pushing the Taliban out of its strongholds, like Marjah and Now Zad and Sangin. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> And when future generations study those fights, they will stand in awe of the unparalleled sacrifice of the 3d Battalion, 5th Marines&mdash;our \\"Darkhorse\\" Marines. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> Today we hold close the memory of all who have made the ultimate sacrifice in these years of war. That includes 326 fallen heroes from Camp Pendleton. We honor all of them, every single one. And we stand with their families, like the Gold Star families that I had an opportunity to meet with before I came out here. We are grateful to them. We're grateful for their sacrifice. They've given a piece of their heart to America, and America will always honor their sacrifice. <p>I know some of you recently returned from Afghanistan. On behalf of a grateful Nation, welcome home. We send our prayers to all those who, at this very moment, are still in harm's way, including your Regimental Combat Team 7, which is coming home this month. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yeah! <p><i>The President.</i> I know some of you are getting ready to deploy in the months to come. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> This is still a hard fight. Our Afghan partners have stepped up. They're bearing a bigger brunt of the firepower. They're taking on a lot more casualties. They're in the lead, but it's still tough. And we're still needed. <p>And here's what I want every single one of you to know. Because of you, the 9/11 generation, we are accomplishing what we set out to do. Because of you, Usama bin Laden is no more. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> Because of you, Al Qaida's top ranks have been hammered. The core of Al Qaida in Afghanistan and Pakistan is on the way to defeat. That happened because of you. Because of you, more Afghans are reclaiming their communities&mdash;their markets, their schools, their towns&mdash;and they have a chance to forge their own future. Because of you, more Afghans are trained and stepping up and defending their own country. Because of you&mdash;and to preserve the gains you fought and bled for&mdash;we are going to make sure that Afghanistan is never again a source of attacks against our country. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> That happened because of you. <p>So the war in Afghanistan will end. For you, that means fewer deployments. It means more training time, preparing for the future, getting back to what Marines do better than anybody else on Earth: amphibious operations. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> It means more time here on the home front with your families: your wives, your husbands, your kids. <p>But of course, the end of the war in Afghanistan doesn't mean the end of threats to our Nation. As I've said before, even as we decimated the Al Qaida leadership that attacked us on 9/11, Al Qaida affiliates and like-minded extremists still threaten our homeland, still threaten our diplomatic facilities, still threaten our businesses abroad. And we've got to take these threats seriously and do all we can to confront them. We've been reminded of this again in recent days. <p>So I want to take a special time out to salute all our brave diplomats and tireless intelligence and military personnel who have been working around the clock to safeguard our Embassies and our consulates and our fellow Americans serving overseas, including all those vigilant marines standing guard at our Embassies around the world. They're doing an outstanding job. <p>As for these extremists, here's what those who would cowardly attack our civilians don't get: The United States is never going to retreat from the world. We don't get terrorized. We're going to keep standing up for our interests. We're going to keep standing up for the security of our citizens. We're going to keep standing up for human rights and dignity for people wherever they live. We're going to keep working with our allies and our partners. We're going to keep offering a future of hope and progress, in stark contrast to terrorists who only know how to kill and destroy and maim. And like generations before us, the United States of America is going to remain the greatest force for freedom that the world has ever known. <p>You are an integral part of that. That's what you do, serving in uniform every single day. But this is not just a job for our military: It takes diplomacy, it takes development, it takes trade, it takes intelligence to stay true to our values as a nation. This is a complicated time. The world is going through big changes, especially in the Middle East and North Africa. And we have to have a military strategy to protect ourselves. But we've also got to lead with our values and our ideals and all elements of our power. <p>But it does mean keeping our military the absolute best in the world. We've got to be vigilant about that. As the war in Afghanistan ends, it's true, our military, including our Marine Corps, will be leaner. Budgets will be tighter, and that's only natural. Part of ending a war, responsibly, is moving off a perpetual wartime footing. It's time to use some of the money we've been spending on war to do some nation-building right here at home. <p>But what we can't do is repeat the mistakes of history. We've seen in the past where, after a war, we hollowed out our military, left our military unprepared. We've got, right now, the best led, best trained, best equipped military in human history. Our Marine Corps is the finest expeditionary force in the world. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> And as long as I am Commander in Chief, I'm going to keep it that way. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President. </i>Now, to do that, we're going to need some help out of Washington. Congress couldn't agree on a plan to reduce the deficit in a&mdash;what I consider a sensible way, so instead what we've got is these big, across-the-board cuts called the sequester. Sequester kicked in; it includes defense. And we're already starting to see the effects. Here at Pendleton, you're feeling it. Hard-working folks are getting furloughed, families getting by on less, fewer ships available for your training exercises, the commissary your families rely on closed a day a week. We can do better than that. That's not how a great nation should be treating its military and military families. <p>And by the way, cuts in other nondefense areas of the budget affect our troops and our military families as well. Our military, part of what makes us best is we've got extraordinary recruits. But if we want the best qualified recruits, we shouldn't be cutting investments in education. We should be increasing our investments in education. <p>Our wounded warriors, our veterans depend on new technologies for their recovery and their health care, so we shouldn't be slashing investments in science and medical research. We should continue to be the world leader in science and research, so, that's why I'm going to keep on working to get rid of this sequester. You get up and do your jobs every day; let's make sure Washington gets up and does its job. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> And what makes me frustrated is, sometimes, the very folks who say they stand with our military proudly, are the same ones who are standing in the way of fixing the sequester. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> It's important to look at deeds and not words. <p>Now, keep in mind, it is true that for our national security we've always got to look and make sure we're dealing with our deficits and our debt. Our economy is strong, that means the military will be strong. If our economy is weak, that weakens our military. But our deficits right now are falling at the fastest rate in decades. We've cut them in half, and they keep on moving in the right direction. In that context, Congress needs to agree on a responsible plan that reduces our deficits, but also keeps our military strong, also invests in education, also invests in research, also invests in our infrastructure. <p>That's what you deserve. That's what your families deserve. That's what I'm fighting for, and that is my commitment to you. <p>Now, keeping our military strong requires something else, and that's taking care of our extraordinary wounded warriors. Here at Pendleton, you're doing outstanding work. For those who can, we want to get our troops back to where they want to be: back with their units. For those with traumatic brain injury, we're going to keep making unprecedented investments in new care and new treatments. For those suffering from posttraumatic stress, we're going to keep saying it as loud as we can: It is not a sign of weakness to ask for help; it is a sign of strength. And we're here to help you recover and stand tall again. <p>We've got to make sure that we're doing everything we can for our wounded warriors. And I'm pleased to see that the hospital here is making progress. That's going to be an outstanding new facility that will be helpful. <p>Keeping our military strong also means ensuring the safety of everyone who puts on the uniform. No military unit can succeed without discipline, without trust, and without cohesion. So I want you to hear it directly from me, the Commander in Chief: It undermines what this military stands for and it undermines what the Marine Corps stands for when sexual assault takes place within our units. And that's why we are going to work together&mdash;all of us&mdash;to stop these crimes of sexual assault and uphold the honor and the integrity that defines the finest military on Earth. And that message is coming all the way from the top. <p>Keeping our military strong means keeping our military families strong. Michelle and Vice President&mdash;Joe Biden's wife, Dr. Jill Biden, they've made this their mission. And because of their efforts&mdash;Joining Forces&mdash;more Americans are stepping up to support your families. And that includes more companies hiring our talented military spouses. After everything you've done for America, every American ought to be doing something to support your families. <p>As this time of war ends, some of you will be taking off the uniform and returning to civilian life. And just as we gave you the tools to succeed on the battlefield, I want to make sure we're giving you the tools to succeed in the next stage of your lives as well. <p>So we've improved transition assistance to help you find the job that's worthy of your skills. We're helping you and your families pursue your education under the post-9/11 GI bill and making sure that instead of ripping you off, schools that give you the education you paid for, are being held accountable. <p>We're making sure more States and more industries are recognizing your military skills with licenses and credentials you need for a civilian job. When I first came into office, I was meeting medics who had been treating folks on the battlefield, and when they went back to school because they wanted to be a nurse, they had to start all over again at nursing 101. And here they are, dealing with some of the worst injuries possible, and they're not getting any credit for it, which means it's costing them time, costing them money. We're changing all that. If you've done the job on the battlefield with bullets coming at you, you can sure as heck do the job back here in the United States of America. <p>Then we issued a challenge to the private sector, and so far, America's businesses have hired or trained 290,000 veterans and military spouses, and they've committed to hiring hundreds of thousands more. So, more vets are finding jobs. The unemployment rate for vets is coming down. And we're going to keep saying to every company in America, if you want somebody who knows how to get the job done, hire a veteran. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> Hire a veteran. Your generation has carried us through this time of war; well, you're going to help us write the next great chapter in American history, right here at home. <p>Now, few embody that truth more than a marine who's here today, Captain Matthew Lampert. Matt is one of our Marine special operators. He and his team were in Afghanistan cleaning out a compound, and then, in a terrible incident, an IED took both of his legs. Matt survived. And soon he had a new mission: getting back to his unit, back to his team&mdash;\\"Once a marine, always a marine.\\" <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> So Matt endured excruciating rehab, therapy that could last all day, month after month, rebuilding his strength. Recovery was slow: taking his first shaky steps on short prosthetics; then a new pair of knees; then full legs, taking him back to normal height; stepping forward with two canes, then just one, then none; learning to walk again; learning to run, in his uniform, then his body armor. And then, just 18 months after he was injured and lost both legs, Matt&mdash;a double amputee&mdash;returned to his unit and redeployed to Afghanistan. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> For a time, Matt even served as team leader. And today, Matt and his company are preparing for their next deployment, to the Pacific. His wife Camille, also a marine, is working to become a test pilot because, Matt says, she likes to \\"fly aggressively.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] And this inspiring Marine couple is looking ahead to serving their country for many years to come. <p>Matt and Camille, please wave. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. <p>There are stories like Matt and Camille's throughout our Marine Corps. They represent what's best in our Marine Corps. Semper Fidelis. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> That's the ethic of your lives: Always faithful; Always faithful to each other, the few and the proud; Always faithful to your Corps, for 237 years. Always faithful to your country, for whom you wear the eagle, globe, and anchor. After all you've given to our Nation, you have to know your Nation will always be faithful to you. <p>As your Commander in Chief, that's my commitment to you. That's the commitment America must uphold to you and your family for all the years to come. <p>Semper Fi. God bless you all. God bless the Marine Corps, and God bless the United States of America. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah!\" "
"180" "\"<i>The President.</i> Well, before I sign this, I just want to say thank you to this extraordinary coalition that helped make this signing possible. I want to thank Chairman Kline, all the Members of both House and Senate from both parties that came together to design a sensible, commonsense approach to keeping student interest rates at a reasonable level so that young people have a better opportunity to go to college, get the education that they need, not only to better their own lives, but also to strengthen the country's economy. <p>And I want to thank the advocates, including some of the young people, I suspect, will be benefiting from lower student loans&mdash;or lower student loan interest rates, because without their voice, without their participation, we probably would not have gotten this bill done. <p>Last point I'll make, and I suspect the Senators and Congressmen behind me will agree with this, even though we've been able to stabilize the interest rates on student loans, our job's not done, because the cost of college remains extraordinarily high. It's out of reach for a lot of folks, and for those who do end up attending college, the amount of debt that young people are coming out of school with is a huge burden on them. It's a burden on their families. It makes it more difficult for them to buy a home. It makes them more difficult&mdash;more difficult for them if they want to start a business. It has a depressive effect on the economy overall. And we've got to do something about it. <p>So I'm going to be looking forward to engaging this same coalition to see if we can continue to take additional steps to reform our higher education system, and I'll have some more things to say about that in the weeks to come. <p>But for now, I want to celebrate what we accomplished here and again thank everybody here for their leadership in getting it done. <p>[<i>At this point, the President signed the bill.</i>] <p>Those of you who haven't seen me do this before&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;it is a real art form. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Rep. John P.</i> <i>Kline</i>. Thank you, Mr. President, with your help on this issue. <p><i>Sen. Richard J.</i> <i>Durbin</i>. I remember the 90-minute seminar in this office. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> It was very interesting. <p><i>Sen. Durbin</i>. You won't hear from&mdash;[<i>inaudible</i>]. <p><i>The President.</i> Yes. It feels good signing bills though; I haven't done this in a while. [<i>Laughter</i>] Hint, hint. Hint, hint. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Rep. Kline</i>. How about a budget, Mr. President? <p><i>The President.</i> There you go. That's what I'm talking about. <p>All right, thank you, everybody.\" "
"181" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, DAV! Thank you so much. Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat. Do we have an extraordinary First Lady? So I&mdash;we will be celebrating our 21st anniversary in October. The first time I saw her, I knew she was something special. [<i>Laughter</i>] She was a little more skeptical about me. [<i>Laughter</i>] But persistence is the key. You just got to stay on it. Eventually, you can marry up. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>To Michelle and Jill Biden and Joining Forces, we are so proud of the work you've done to help rally America around military families and veterans. I'm inspired by what they are doing. So thank you, Michelle, for your extraordinary work. <p>DAV, I was proud to join at your convention 3 years ago. It is wonderful to be back. I want to thank your national commander. Larry Polzin, thank you so much to the entire leadership team, Joe Johnston, Marc Burgess, Donna Adams; all the incredible spouses and families of the DAV Auxiliary. I want to thank Barry Jenichoski&mdash;Jesinoski. [<i>Laughter</i>] I got it. [<i>Laughter</i>] They used to mispronounce Obama too. [<i>Laughter</i>] I want to thank Barry and your great team in Washington. <p>Disabled American Veterans, like all veterans, you carry in your hearts the story of brave service that took you to every corner of the Earth. As young men and women, you left home, left everything and everyone you ever knew because storm clouds gathered far across the sea. You had your whole lives ahead of you, but you were willing to risk all of it for this land that we love. Because you know, from hard experience, what we must never forget: Our country endures because in every generation there are Americans like you who stand beside her and guide her and protect her. <p>You fought across the Pacific, island by island. You fought into the heart of Europe, mile by mile, freeing millions from fascism. That's your legacy as veterans of the Second World War. You held the line at the Pusan Perimeter and survived the bitter cold of the Chosin Reservoir. And on this 60th anniversary of the end of that war, we salute all of our veterans of the Korean war. <p>To our Vietnam veterans, you served with valor not just in the thick of the jungle, but through intense urban combat. And let it be remembered that you won every major battle that you fought in. And so in the decades since, whenever our country has needed you, you said, \\"Send me\\"&mdash;from the sands of Desert Storm to the mountains of the Balkans to the villages of Afghanistan and Iraq. And next year, your profound sacrifice will be recognized in the heart of our Nation's Capital when our country dedicates the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial. <p>That memorial will honor your courage in war. But it will also pay tribute to your bravery in the other battle you have fought: the fight to recover from the wounds of war. And this may be your greatest triumph of all. Because rather than being defined by what you lost, by what you can't do, you've inspired America with what you can do. <p>And maybe you lost your sight, but you can still see the truth that our disabled veterans make extraordinary contributions to our country every single day. Maybe you lost an arm, but you still have the strength to pick up a friend or neighbor in need. Maybe you lost a leg, but you still stand tall for the values and freedoms that make America the greatest Nation on Earth. <p>I think of the wounded warrior who spoke for so many of you when he said, \\"Your life will never be the same, but that doesn't mean you can't go on to do amazing things with the second chance you were given.\\" I think of wounded warriors across America and how they've used that second chance: volunteering in communities; building homes; being a mentor to local kids; showing up after tornadoes, after Hurricane Sandy, to help folks rebuild. I think of the wounded warriors who reached out to the survivors of the Boston Marathon bombing with the example of their own recovery and with a simple message: \\"We stand with you.\\" <p>I think of all the inspiring wounded warriors that Michelle and I have met: their resilience, their resolve, their determination to push through and to carry on. That's the fighting spirit of our wounded warriors. That's the spirit of DAV, dedicated not just to your own recovery, but to taking care of each other. Every day, you work to ensure that America is fulfilling its promises to our men and women who have served. That's your mission. And I want you to know it is my mission too. <p>I believe that this work is more important than ever, because this time of war that we've been in is coming to an end. For nearly 12 years&mdash;ever since we were attacked on that clear September morning&mdash;our Nation has been at war. Our fight in Afghanistan is now America's longest war. At the same time, our troops fought courageously in Iraq for 9 long years. And among us today are proud veterans of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. <p>Now we've marked another milestone in Afghanistan: As of this past June, Afghan forces have taken the lead for security across their entire country. So instead of leading the fight, our troops now have a different mission: supporting Afghan forces. Our war in Afghanistan has entered the final chapter. More of our troops are coming home. This winter, we'll be down to 34,000. By the end of next year, the transition will be complete. Afghans will take full responsibility for their security, and our war in Afghanistan will be over. <p>For this progress, we thank all who have served in Afghanistan, including DAV members here today. Just a few I want to mention. We salute folks like Timothy Duke. Where's Timothy? Right here. In the early days of the war, Timothy's helicopter unit served in some of the most remote parts of Afghanistan. On another tour, in Iraq, his convoy was hit by an IED. He endured three spinal surgeries. Then he went to school on the post-9/11 GIbill. Today, he is helping at the DAV, helping veterans and their families access their benefits. That's the kind of spirit the DAV represents. Thank you, Timothy, for your outstanding service and work. <p>We salute Staff Sergeant Jacare Hogan. Where's Jacare? In Iraq, she was hit by IEDs three times. She's endured surgeries, rehab&mdash;which continue to this day&mdash;but she refused to stop serving. She deployed again to Afghanistan. As a logistics specialist, she served at forward operating bases, keeping them running, flying between bases, getting shot at along the way. At those remote outposts, she was often the only woman on base. She proudly wears the Combat Action Badge. But her service hasn't stopped. So here at DAV, she counsels others as they recover. \\"Helping [the; White House correction.] troops is what I'm about.\\" That's what she says. And we are grateful to you, Jacare, for your extraordinary service. <p>And we salute Jason Hassinger. Where is Jason? Right here. When Jason's unit was ambushed and pinned down, he was hit five times in the chest. But he pushed on, helped lead his men to safety, for which he earned the Silver Star. After months of care and rehab, he returned to his unit: going out on patrol, gritting his teeth through the pain in his chest. And today, at DAV, Jason helps his fellow vets access the benefits that they have earned. It is \\"my job\\" to \\"help people heal.\\" That's what Jason says. Thank you. <p>So Timothy, Jacare, Jason, they're just examples of all who have served in these years of war, the 9/11 generation. And now you're beginning the next chapter in your lives wearing a proud new title: veteran of the United States Armed Forces. So this time of war may be coming to an end, but the job of caring for our veterans goes on, and our work caring for our newest veterans has only just begun. <p>I mean, think about it: We lost the last veteran of the First World War 2 years ago, but we still care for the children of our World War I veterans. To this day, we still help care for children of men who fought in the Spanish-American War, even the daughter of a Civil War veteran. So when we talk about fulfilling our promises to all who serve, we're not just talking about a few years, we're talking about decades, for as long as you and your families walk this Earth. <p>With a new generation joining your ranks, I believe that now is the time to make sure our Nation is truly ready: organized and structured to get this right: not just for this year, not just for next year, but for decades to come; not just for the veterans of today's wars, but for all wars. And I believe we need to focus on five key priorities. <p>Number one, we need to make sure we've got the resources, the budgets our veterans deserve. Since I took office, we've made historic investments in our veterans. Even in these tough fiscal times, we've boosted the VA budget by more than 40 percent. We now budget for veterans health care a year in advance. And I've proposed a further increase in veterans funding for next year. <p>Now, some of you may be aware, right now we've got these reckless, across-the-board budget cuts called the sequester that's hitting a lot of folks hard. And it's cost jobs. It's hurting our military, slashing investments in education and science and medical research. I made it clear that your veterans benefits are exempt from this year's sequester. I've made that clear. But I want to tell you: Going forward, the best way to protect the VA care you have earned is to get rid of this sequester altogether. Congress needs to come together and agree on a responsible plan that reduces our deficits and keeps our promises to our veterans and keeps our promises to future generations. That's what I'm fighting for. That's what you deserve. <p>Number two, we need to make sure you're getting the veterans' health care you've been promised. We're already making record investments: more outreach, more clinics, more service. For our Vietnam vets, we made sure that you and your families finally got the disability pay you deserve because of your exposure to agent orange. For our Desert Storm veterans, we made it easier for you to get the care you need for illnesses connected to your service. For our veterans with PTSD, we made it easier for you to get the VA care you need as well, regardless of the war that you served in. <p>For our women's veterans&mdash;and there are more of you than ever&mdash;we're offering more tailored care, more clinics just for women, more clinicians trained to treat you with respect and dignity. So all told, we've made VA health care available to more than 2 million veterans who didn't have it before. <p>I've proposed more funding for prosthetics for our disabled vets to help you work and walk and run again. And for you&mdash;the caregivers and families&mdash;we're going to keep empowering you with the skills and support you need as you care for the veterans that you love. <p>We also need to keep improving mental health services, because we've got to end this epidemic of suicide among our veterans and troops. Last year, I said this had to be an all-hands-on-deck approach, not just at DOD and the VA, but across our Government. I issued an Executive order to step up our game, and we have&mdash;hiring more counselors, hiring more mental health providers, new awareness campaigns&mdash;so that those who are hurting know that asking for help is not a sign of weakness, it's a part of staying strong, it's a part of getting back up. Hundreds of medical and nursing schools have committed to improving research and care for our veterans and their families. And I've proposed more funding for mental health. We can't just promise better care, we've actually got to deliver better care. <p>So today I'm proud to announce the next step in this fight. We're unveiling a new national action plan to guide mental health research across government, industry, and academia, so that we're going to focus on developing more effective ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat mental health conditions like TBI and PTSD. And to get it done, we're moving ahead with more than $100 million in new research. So I'm not going to be satisfied until every veteran and every man and woman in uniform gets the support and the help they need to stay strong. <p>Now, on the subject of veterans health care, you may have noticed there's still a lot of misinformation out there about the new health care law, Affordable Care Act. Some folks are out there trying to scare people, including veterans. So let me say this as plainly as I can. If you already have health insurance or health care from the VA, you do not have to do a thing. Your VA health care does not change. It is safe. There are no new fees. Don't let them hoodwink you. <p>But the good news is, if you're among one of the more than 1 million veterans who don't have health insurance, starting October 1, you'll have a new option. Online marketplaces will let you shop and compare and buy private health insurance plans, just like you can go online to compare prices when you buy a TV or airplane ticket or a car. And because of the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies will no longer be able to discriminate against you or deny you coverage because of preexisting conditions like PTSD. So you'll have more security in being able to get health insurance. So don't let them fool you. No one is taking away your benefits. Your veterans health care is safe. We're not reducing veterans access to health care, we're expanding it. That's the truth. <p>And that leads me to the third priority we've got to focus on. We've got to attack this claims backlog. Now, the last time I was with you, I pledged to cut the backlog, slash those wait times, deliver your benefits sooner. And I'm going to be honest with you: It has not moved as fast as I wanted. Part of it is all these new veterans in the system who came in: agent orange, PTSD. It means a lot more claims, and despite additional resources, it's resulted in longer waits. And that's been unacceptable: unacceptable to me, unacceptable to Secretary Shinseki. <p>So we put more of our VA folks to work as claims processors, we hired more claims processors as well. We've got them working overtime, completing more than a million claims a year. We prioritized the oldest claims. Veterans groups like the DAV have pitched in as well, helping vets with their claims, getting them ready so when they bring them, they're in better shape, and they can move a little quicker. And today I can report that we are not where we need to be, but we're making progress. [<i>Applause</i>] We are making progress. So after years when the backlog kept growing, finally the backlog is shrinking. In the last 5 months alone, it's down nearly 20 percent. We're turning the tide. <p>And we're not going to let up until we eliminate the backlog once and for all. And we'll keep moving ahead with paperless systems so the backlog doesn't come back and so your claims are processed right the first time, on time. After years of military service, you shouldn't have to wait for years for the benefits you have earned. <p>Fourth, just like you fought to defend our rights and freedoms, we need to uphold the dignity and rights of every veteran. And that starts by keeping up our campaign to end homelessness among veterans. We're not just bringing our veterans off the streets, we're doing more to reach at-risk and low-income vets so they don't become homeless in the first place. And we're not going to rest until every veteran who has fought for America has a home in America. <p>Yesterday I was proud to sign into law the Helping Heroes Fly Act, to end those intrusive airport screenings so you&mdash;our wounded warriors and disabled vets, especially those of you with prosthetics&mdash;can travel with dignity. And I know how disappointing it was last year when the Senate failed to approve the Disabilities Treaty despite the fact that we had a former Senator and World War II veteran, Bob Dole, in the Senate Chamber. But we're going to keep fighting to ratify that Treaty, because the United States has always been a leader for the rights of the disabled. We believe that disabled Americans like you deserve the same opportunities to work and to study and to travel in other countries as any other American. It's the right thing to do. We need to get it done. <p>Which brings me to the final priority we need to stay focused on, and that's making sure that our veterans have every opportunity to pursue the American Dream, starting with the education and jobs worthy of your extraordinary talents. <p>With our new transition assistance program, we're doing more to help departing servicemembers and their spouses plan their careers and find that new job. We're going to keep helping our newest veterans and their families pursue their education under the post-9/11 GI bill. We're building on the Executive order I issued last year to protect you as you go looking for schools. I said we're going to stand up against dishonest recruiting and predatory practices that target our veterans. So we set new standards. And so far, more than 6,000 schools across the country have signed on and pledged to do right by you and your families. We don't want our veterans cheated. <p>I also said that schools need to step up their support so we're doing more to help our veterans succeed on campus. So today we're announcing what we call 8 Keys to Success, specific steps that schools can take to truly welcome and encourage our veterans. And so far, more than 250 community colleges and universities have signed on, and today I'm calling on schools across America to join us in this effort. Let's help our veterans get that degree, get that credential, and compete for the high-skilled jobs of tomorrow. <p>Now, I'm also going to make sure that the Federal Government keeps doing its part. I'm very proud of the fact that, since I took office, Federal departments and agencies have hired nearly 300,000 veterans, including many disabled veterans. And I'm going to keep calling on Congress to pass the veterans job corps to put our veterans to work protecting and rebuilding America. <p>And we're also doing everything we can to help you get those private sector jobs: more help with job searches, more tools like our online jobs bank to connect veterans to jobs that are open right now, making it easier for you to transfer your skills to the licenses and credentials you need for civilian jobs. And because tens of thousands of our veterans have already been helped, Congress needs to make permanent tax credits for companies that hire our veterans and wounded warriors. It's the right thing to do. <p>And we're going to keep urging companies across America to do the smart thing: hire some of the best workers you'll ever find; hire a vet. Michelle and Jill have done great work on this. And responding to our challenge, working with Joining Forces, America's businesses have already hired or trained 290,000 veterans and military spouses, and they've committed to hiring over 400,000 more. More companies are signing up all the time. We are going to get companies to understand that you can't get a better deal than hiring a veteran. <p>Because of all the efforts I've described and because of a growing economy, veterans unemployment is going down, more veterans are finding jobs, and we're going to keep at this. Because with your skills and drive, we don't just want you fighting for America overseas, we want you to be right here, building a stronger America, fighting for a better future for our kids. <p>So ensuring the resources and budgets you deserve, delivering on the health care that you've earned, making sure you can count on it, continuing to reduce the backlog, standing up for your rights and dignity, creating jobs and opportunities so you can realize your dreams&mdash;that's what I'm focused on. That's what I have told my entire administration to be focused on. That's what our country needs to stay focused for the many years to come. <p>And nobody knows this better than you, our disabled veterans. The road of recovery is often such a long haul. And America needs to be there for you during that long haul. And that's the lesson of the extraordinary young man I told you about when I spoke to you 3 years ago, an Army Ranger, Sergeant First Class Cory Remsburg. <p>A massive IED in Afghanistan nearly killed him. He was in a coma for months with severe traumatic brain injury. And I told you then how, when I saw him in the hospital, he had come out of the coma, but he still couldn't speak. And when I asked him how he was feeling, he slowly brought his hand up, and he pulled his fingers together, and he gave a thumbs up. His mom was sitting there with him. <p>A few days ago, I saw Cory and his family again, this time in Phoenix, where they live. So I wanted to give you an update on how he's doing. I won't&mdash;I suspect it won't surprise you to know that for Cory, the years since he was injured have been very hard: brain surgeries, half a dozen of them; surgeries to replace part of his skull; eye surgeries; special procedures on his lungs; skin grafts, skin flaps. All told, dozens of surgeries and procedures. <p>Rehab has been grueling. On a typical day, Cory wakes up and spends hours in therapy: physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy. So progress has come slowly, but it has come. He had to learn the simple things all over again: how to speak, how to write his name, how to throw a ball. And this past spring, he reached another milestone. After years in the hospital and rehab facilities, he finally came home, greeted by hundreds of neighbors and friends waving American flags. <p>And so when I saw Cory a few days ago, he is still blind in one eye. He still struggles to move his left side. But the young man I had seen in that hospital bed unable to speak, barely able to move, this time he was in a chair sitting up, alert, smiling, talking. And then, he wanted to show me something. And he leaned out of his chair. And he reached out, and he grabbed his walker. And with the help of his parents, he pulled himself forward, and he stood up. And he looked at me, and he gave me a sharp salute. And he said, \\"Rangers lead the way.\\" <p>And his stepmom held one arm for balance, and I held the other. And then, Cory took a step, then another, and then another one after that, all the way across the room. Little by little, Cory is learning to walk again. And he's starting to get good on his recumbent bike. He hopes to bike in a race this fall, 42 miles. He's scheduled to move into his own home, adapted to his needs with the help of a caregiver, another step towards the greater independence he seeks. And so Cory says: \\"My recovery has not been easy. Nothing in life that's worth anything is easy.\\" But he says, I don't \\"give up.\\" I don't give up. <p>The war in Afghanistan may be ending, but for Cory and our disabled vets, the work has only just begun. Cory is 30 years old. His recovery, like so many of yours, will last a lifetime. But he won't give up, because you haven't given up. And when it comes to our work, to making sure that our Nation is fulfilling its promises to the men and women who served and sacrificed, America cannot give up either. I will not give up. We cannot give up. <p>So long as I'm the United States President, I will make it my mission to make sure that America is right there beside you every step of the way, every step with Cory, every step with the DAV. God bless you. God bless our veterans. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"182" "\"For the past few weeks, I've been visiting folks across America to talk about what we need to do as a country to secure a better bargain for the middle class. <p>I've been laying out my ideas for how we can build on the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class in America: a good job, a good education, affordable health care when you get sick, a secure retirement even if you're not rich, and the chance to own your own home. <p>This week, I went to Arizona and California, two of the States hit hardest when the housing bubble burst, triggering the recession. All across the country, millions of responsible Americans were hurt badly by the reckless actions of others: Home values plummeted, construction workers were laid off, and many families lost their homes. <p>Over the past 4 years, we've worked to help millions of responsible homeowners get back on their feet. And while we're not where we need to be yet, our housing market is beginning to heal. Housing prices and sales are rising. Construction is up. Foreclosures are down. Millions of families have come up for air because they're no longer underwater on their mortgages. <p>Now we have to build on this progress. Congress should give every American the chance to refinance at today's low rates. We should help more qualified families get a mortgage and buy their first home. We should get construction workers back on the job rebuilding communities hit hardest by the crisis. And we should make sure that folks who don't want to buy a home have a decent, affordable place to rent. <p>As home prices rise, we have to turn the page on the bubble-and-burst mentality that created this mess and build a housing system that's rock solid and rewards responsibility for generations to come. That means winding down the companies known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, making sure private capital plays a bigger role in the mortgage market, and ending the era of expecting a bailout after your pursuit of profit puts the whole country at risk. We need to preserve access to safe and simple mortgages like the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage. We need to keep laying down rules of the road that protect homeowners when they're making the biggest purchase of their lives. And finally, Congress needs to confirm Mel Watt to be our Nation's top housing regulator so that he can protect consumers and help responsible lenders provide credit. <p>No program or policy will solve all the problems of a multitrillion-dollar housing market, and it will take time to fully recover. But if we work together, we can make a home a source of pride and middle class security again. And if Washington is willing to set aside politics and focus on what really matters, we can rebuild an economy where if you work hard, you can get ahead. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"183" "\"<i>The President.</i> Good morning, everybody. I just finished a discussion with my national security team about the situation in Egypt, and I wanted to provide an update about our response to the events of the last several days. <p>Let me begin by stepping back for a moment. The relationship between the United States and Egypt goes back decades. It's rooted in our respect of Egypt as a nation, an ancient center of civilization, and a cornerstone for peace in the Middle East. It's also rooted in our ties to the Egyptian people, forged through a longstanding partnership. <p>Just over 2 years ago, America was inspired by the Egyptian's people's desire for change, as millions of Egyptians took to the streets to defend their dignity and demand a government that was responsive to their aspirations for political freedom and economic opportunity. And we said, at the time, that change would not come quickly or easily, but we did align ourselves with a set of principles: nonviolence, a respect for universal rights, and a process for political and economic reform. In doing so, we were guided by values, but also by interests, because we believe nations are more stable and more successful when they're guided by those principles as well. <p>And that's why we're so concerned by recent events. We appreciate the complexity of the situation. While Muhammad Mursi was elected President in a democratic election, his Government was not inclusive and did not respect the views of all Egyptians. We know that many Egyptians&mdash;millions of Egyptians, perhaps even a majority of Egyptians&mdash;were calling for a change in course. And while we do not believe that force is the way to resolve political differences, after the military's intervention several weeks ago, there remained a chance for reconciliation and an opportunity to pursue a democratic path. <p>Instead, we've seen a more dangerous path taken through arbitrary arrests, a broad crackdown on Mr. Mursi's associations and supporters, and now, tragically, violence that's taken the lives of hundreds of people and wounded thousands more. <p>The United States strongly condemns the steps that have been taken by Egypt's interim Government and security forces. We deplore violence against civilians. We support universal rights essential to human dignity, including the right to peaceful protest. We oppose the pursuit of martial law, which denies those rights to citizens under the principle that security trumps individual freedom or that \\"might makes right.\\" And today the United States extends its condolences to the families of those who were killed and those who were wounded. <p>And given the depths of our partnership with Egypt, our national security interests in this pivotal part of the world, and our belief that engagement can support a transition back to a democratically elected civilian government, we've sustained our commitment to Egypt and its people. But while we want to sustain our relationship with Egypt, our traditional cooperation cannot continue as usual when civilians are being killed in the streets and rights are being rolled back. <p>As a result, this morning we notified the Egyptian Government that we are canceling our biannual joint military exercise which was scheduled for next month. Going forward, I've asked my national security team to assess the implications of the actions taken by the interim Government and further steps that we may take, as necessary, with respect to the U.S.-Egyptian relationship. <p>Let me say that the Egyptian people deserve better than what we've seen over the last several days. And to the Egyptian people, let me say the cycle of violence and escalation needs to stop. We call on the Egyptian authorities to respect the universal rights of the people. We call on those who are protesting to do so peacefully and condemn the attacks that we've seen by protesters, including on churches. We believe that the state of emergency should be lifted, that a process of national reconciliation should begin, that all parties need to have a voice in Egypt's future, that the rights of women and religious minorities should be respected, and that commitments must be kept to pursue transparent reforms of the constitution and democratic elections of a Parliament and a President. <p>Pursuing that path will help Egypt meet the democratic aspirations of its people, while attracting the investment, tourism, and international support that can help it deliver opportunities to its citizens. Violence, on the other hand, will only feed the cycle of polarization that isolates Egyptians from one another and from the world and that continues to hamper the opportunity for Egypt to get back on the path of economic growth. <p>Let me make one final point: America cannot determine the future of Egypt. That's a task for the Egyptian people. We don't take sides with any particular party or political figure. I know it's tempting inside of Egypt to blame the United States or the West or some other outside actor for what's gone wrong. We've been blamed by supporters of Mursi. We've been blamed by the other side, as if we are supporters of Mursi. That kind of approach will do nothing to help Egyptians achieve the future that they deserve. <p>We want Egypt to succeed. We want a peaceful, democratic, prosperous Egypt. That's our interest. But to achieve that, the Egyptians are going to have to do the work. <p>We recognize that change takes time and that a process like this is never guaranteed. There are examples in recent history of countries that are transitioned out of a military government towards a democratic government, and it did not always go in a straight line, and the process was not always smooth. There are going to be false starts. There will be difficult days. America's democratic journey took us through some mighty struggles to perfect our Union. <p>From Asia to the Americas, we know that democratic transitions are measured not in months or even years, but sometimes in generations. So in the spirit of mutual interest and mutual respect, I want to be clear that America wants to be a partner in the Egyptian people's pursuit of a better future, and we are guided by our national interest in this longstanding relationship. But our partnership must also advance the principles that we believe in and that so many Egyptians have sacrificed for these last several years, no matter what party or faction they belong to. <p>So America will work with all those in Egypt and around the world who support a future of stability that rests on a foundation of justice and peace and dignity. <p>Thank you very much.\" "
"184" "\"Hi, everybody. Over the past few weeks, I've been visiting with Americans across the country to talk about what we need to do to secure a better bargain for the middle class. <p>We need to rebuild an economy that rewards hard work and responsibility, an economy built firmly on the cornerstones of middle class life: good jobs, a good education, a home of your own, a secure retirement, and quality, affordable health care that's there when you need it. <p>Right now we're well on our way to fully implementing the Affordable Care Act. And in the next few months, we'll reach a couple milestones with real meaning for millions of Americans. <p>If you're one of the 85 percent of Americans who already have insurance, you've already got new benefits and protections under this law that you didn't before: free checkups, mammograms, and contraceptive care; discounted prescription medicine on Medicare; the fact you can stay on your parent's plan until you turn 26; and much, much more. And it's okay if you're not a fan of the Affordable Care Act; you can take advantage of these things anyway. <p>If you don't have insurance, beginning on October 1, private plans will actually compete for your business. You can comparison shop in an online marketplace, just like you would for cell phone plans or plane tickets. You may be eligible for new tax credits to help you afford the plan that's right for you. And if you're among the up to half of all Americans who've been sick or have a preexisting condition, this law means that beginning January 1, insurance companies have to cover you, and they can't use your medical history to charge you more than anybody else. <p>You can find out more about the law and how to sign up to buy your own coverage right now at healthcare.gov. Tell your friends and neighbors without insurance about it too. And tell your kids that there's a new, easy way to buy affordable plans specifically tailored to young people. <p>Many Members of Congress in both parties are working hard to inform their constituents about these benefits, protections, and affordable plans. But there's also a group of Republicans in Congress working hard to confuse people and making empty promises that they'll either shut down the health care law or, if they don't get their way, they'll shut down the Government. <p>Think about that. They're actually having a debate between hurting Americans who will no longer be denied affordable care just because they've been sick and harming the economy and millions of Americans in the process. And many Republicans are more concerned with how badly this debate will hurt them politically than they are with how badly it'll hurt the country. <p>A lot of Republicans seem to believe that if they can gum up the works and make this law fail, they'll somehow be sticking it to me. But they'd just be sticking it to you. <p>Some even say that if you call their office with questions about the law, they'll refuse to help. Call me old fashioned, but that's lousy constituent service. And it's not what you deserve. <p>Your health insurance isn't something to play politics with. Our economy isn't something to play politics with. This is not a game. It's about the economic security of millions of families. <p>See, in the States where Governors and legislatures and insurers are working together to implement this law properly&mdash;States like California, New York, Colorado, and Maryland&mdash;competition and consumer choice are actually making insurance affordable. <p>So I'm going to keep doing everything in my power to make sure this law works as it's supposed to. Because in the United States of America, health insurance isn't a privilege, it's your right. And we're going to keep it that way. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"185" "\"<i>The President.</i> Come on over, Coach. Well, welcome to the White House, everybody. Please have a seat. Now, it's mid-August, which means football is in the air. And I love baseball, but SportsCenter is better when you've also got some football on there. [<i>Laughter</i>] College football kicks off next week; NFL regular season the week after that. And so today, just to whet everybody's appetite, I am proud to welcome the only undefeated, untied team in NFL history to the White House for the very first time: Give it up for the 1972 Miami Dolphins! <p>I know this is a little unorthodox four decades after the fact, but these guys never got their White House visit after winning Super Bowl VII. I know some of them are a little harder to recognize these days. They don't have the Afros or the mutton chops, the Fu Manchus. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I want to recognize and thank, first and foremost, their outstanding coach, Coach Shula: the legendary Hall of Fame Coach Shula. I want to thank the owners, Stephen Ross, and I want to thank Tim Robbie and everyone from the Dolphins organization who helped make this event possible after all this time. <p>And I know that some people may be asking why we're doing this after all these years. And my answer is simple: I wanted to be the young guy up here for once. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Player.</i> That's cold. <p><i>The President. </i>I did have to explain to my staff, who mostly are in their early thirties, what an incredible impact these guys had, including on me, when they were playing. These Dolphins made history back before Super Bowl champs started visiting the White House. The first teams didn't start coming until after 1980. And let's face it, this is also just a fun thing to do. I like doing it as President. I even let the Packers come a couple of years ago, which was hard to do. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I decided that it was high time to pay tribute to the NFL's only perfect team and to get Butch and Sundance and the \\"No-Name Defense\\" in here too. <p>In 1972, these guys were a juggernaut. They had a grinding running game that wore opponents down. They became the first team ever with 2,000-yard rushers. They had the league's best offense. They had the league's best defense. They posted three shutouts. They doubled the score of their opponents eight times. And they did most of it after their outstanding Pro Bowl starting quarterback, Bob Griese, broke his leg in week 5. And that brought in backup Earl \\"Old Bones\\" Morrall&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;who unfortunately couldn't be here today. As one teammate later said, \\"Earl couldn't run and he couldn't throw.\\" But Earl could win, and that's what he and the Dolphins did again and again and again. <p>Winning the Super Bowl, however, was not a foregone conclusion. The Dolphins had to win in Pittsburgh just to make it there. And once they did, they still were slight underdogs to the Redskins in the big game. Plus, they'd lost in the Super Bowl the year before. People were stupidly, doubting whether Coach Shula was going to win the big one. So the pressure was on leading up to the big game. But the key to their victory, I am told, is that Csonka put an alligator in Coach Shula's shower. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So that loosened everybody up. The Dolphins went on to win their first of back-to-back titles. And with every year, this team's accomplishments just look better and better. They're one of only two teams to play in three-straight Super Bowls. Seven players have busts in the Hall of Fame. Coach Shula retired with more wins than any coach in NFL history. Each and every time that perfect record has been challenged, team after team has fallen short. <p>But these Dolphins didn't always get the credit they deserve. Some said that they only had to play 14 regular season games. I've got to come clean here. A couple a years ago, I hosted the '85 Bears out on the South Lawn. They'd also missed their chance to have a White House visit, and that day I called them the greatest team ever. But, I mean, take it with a grain of salt. They're&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;the Bears lost once in their nearly perfect season. <p><i>Player</i>. Who beat them that year? <p><i>The President</i>. It happened to be the Dolphins. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So I think you made your point. [<i>Laughter</i>] Nobody can argue with this record. Nobody can argue with what all of you have gone on to do after you hung up the shoulder pads for the last time. Players from this team have gone on to become a minister, a mayor, a doctor, a State senator, a high school counselor, many successful businessmen. Nick Buoniconti helped found the world's most comprehensive spinal cord research center. Some have dabbled in acting. [<i>Laughter</i>] I hear somebody serves up a pretty good T-bone as well. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So these are all men of accomplishment and character, and it showed on the field and off the field as well. We want to congratulate all of them, and we want to make sure that they're remembered for not only the history that sports fans will always remember, but also for all the countless contributions that they've made in their community as well. <p>So thank you, again. Congratulations. It's been a great honor to be here.\" "
"186" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Buffalo! Hello, Bulls! Well, it is good to be back in Buffalo, good to be back in New York. <p>I want to begin by making sure we all thank Silvana for the wonderful introduction. Give her a big round of applause. Her mom and dad are here somewhere. Where are they? I know they're pretty proud. There they are right there. Give mom and dad a big round of applause. <p>A number of other people I want to acknowledge here: first of all, our Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, who's doing a great job.

We just rode on the bus over from the airport, and they were telling me that Buffalo is on the move. That was the story. <p>A couple other people I want to acknowledge: SUNY Chancellor Nancy Zimpher is here, doing a great job; University President Satish Tripathi is here; and we've got all the students in the house. Thank all the students for being here. Yes! <p>Now, today is a check-in day at the dorms. So I want to thank all the students for taking a few minutes from setting up your futons and&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;your minifridges just to come out here. I hear that the last sitting President to speak here was Millard Fillmore. And he was actually chancellor of the university at the same time, which sounds fun, but I've got enough on my plate. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So this is our first stop on a 2-day road trip through New York and Pennsylvania. And after this, I head to Syracuse to speak&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;yay, Syracuse&mdash;to speak with some high schoolers. Tomorrow I'm going to visit SUNY Binghamton and Lackawanna College in Scranton. But I wanted to start here at University of Buffalo. <p>And I wanted to do it for two&mdash;for a couple of reasons. First, I know you're focused on the future. As I said, talking to the mayor, he was describing a new medical school and new opportunities for the high-tech jobs of tomorrow. So there's great work being done at this institution. I also know that everybody here must be fearless, because the football team kicks off against number-two Ohio State next weekend. Good luck, guys. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's going to be a great experience. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's going to be a great experience. It could be an upset. <p>And third, and most importantly, I know that the young people here are committed to earning your degree, to helping this university to make sure that every one of you \\"finishes in four\\"&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;makes sure that you're prepared for whatever comes next. And that's what I want to talk about here today. <p>Over the last month, I've been visiting towns across the country, talking about&mdash;yes, feel free to sit down. Get comfortable. [<i>Laughter</i>] Thank you. <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you too. The&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>Over the last month, I've been out there talking about what we need to do as a country to make sure that we've got a better bargain for the middle class and everybody who's working hard to get into the middle class: a national strategy to make sure that everybody who works hard has a chance to succeed in this 21st-century economy. <p>Now, I think all of us here know that for the past 4&frac12; years, we've been fighting back from a brutal recession that cost millions of Americans their jobs and their homes and their savings. But what the recession also did was it showed that for too long, we've seen an erosion of middle class security. <p>So together, we saved the auto industry. Together, we took on a broken health care system. We invested in new technologies. We started reversing our addiction to foreign oil. We changed a Tax Code that was tilted too far in favor of the wealthy at the expense of working families. <p>And add it all up, today our businesses have created 7.3 million new jobs over the last 41 months. We now generate more renewable energy than ever before. We sell more goods made in America to the rest of the world than ever. Health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in 50 years. Our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years. Here in Buffalo, the Governor and the mayor were describing over a billion dollars in investment, riverfront being changed, construction booming&mdash;signs of progress. <p>So thanks to the grit and the resilience of the American people, we've cleared away the rubble from the financial crisis. We've started to lay the foundation for a stronger, more durable economic growth. <p>But as any middle class family will tell you&mdash;as folks here in Buffalo will tell you&mdash;we're not where we need to be yet. Because even before the crisis hit&mdash;and it sounded like Buffalo knows something about this&mdash;we were living through a decade where a few at the top were doing better and better, most families were working harder and harder just to get by. Manufacturing was leaving, jobs moving overseas, losing our competitive edge. And it's a struggle for a lot of folks. <p>So reversing this trend should be&mdash;must be&mdash;Washington's highest priority. It's my highest priority. I've got to say, it's not always Washington's highest priority. Because rather than keeping focus on a growing economy that creates good middle class jobs, we've seen a faction of Republicans in Congress suggest that maybe America shouldn't pay its bills that have already been run up, that we should shut down Government if they can't shut down Obamacare. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> That won't grow our economy. That won't create jobs. That won't help our middle class. We can't afford, in Washington, the usual circus of distractions and political posturing. We can't afford that right now. <p>What we need is to build on the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class in America, focus on that: a good job with good wages, a good education, a home of your own, affordable health care, a secure retirement. Bread-and-butter, pocketbook issues that you care about every single day, that you're thinking about every single day. And we've got to create more pathways into the middle class for folks who are willing to work for it. That's what's always made America great. It's not just how many billionaires we produce, but our ability to give everybody who works hard the chance to pursue their own measure of happiness. That's what America is all about. <p>Now, there aren't many things that are more important to that idea of economic mobility&mdash;the idea that you can make it if you try&mdash;than a good education. All the students here know that. That's why you're here. That's why your families have made big sacrifices, because we understand that in the face of greater and greater global competition, in a knowledge-based economy, a great education is more important than ever. <p>A higher education is the single best investment you can make in your future. And I'm proud of all the students who are making that investment. And that's not just me saying it. Look, right now the unemployment rate for Americans with at least a college degree is about one-third lower than the national average. The incomes of folks who have at least a college degree are more than twice those of Americans without a high school diploma. So more than ever before, some form of higher education is the surest path into the middle class. <p>But what I want to talk about today is what's become a barrier and a burden for too many American families, and that is the soaring cost of higher education. <p>This is something that everybody knows you need: a college education. On the other hand, college has never been more expensive. Over the past three decades, the average tuition at a public 4-year college has gone up by more than 250 percent&mdash;250 percent. Now, a typical family's income has only gone up 16 percent. So think about that: Tuition's gone up 250 percent; income gone up 16 percent. That's a big gap. <p>Now, it's true that a lot of universities have tried to provide financial aid and work-study programs. And so not every student&mdash;in fact, most students are probably not paying the sticker price of tuition. We understand that. But what we also understand is that if it's going up 250 [percent]* and your incomes are only going up 16 [percent],<Sup>*</Sup> at some point, families are having to make up some of the difference, or students are having to make up some of the difference, with debt. <p>And meanwhile, over the past few years, States have been cutting back on their higher education budgets. New York has done better than a lot of States, but the fact is that we've been spending more money on prisons, less money on college. And meanwhile, not enough colleges have been working to figure out: how do we control costs? How do we cut back on costs? So all this sticks it to students, sticks it to families, but also, taxpayers end up paying a bigger price. <p>The average student who borrows for college now graduates owing more than $26,000. Some owe a lot more than that. And I'm heard&mdash;I've heard from a lot of these young people who are frustrated that they've done everything they're supposed to do&mdash;got good grades in high school, applied to college, did well in school&mdash;but now they come out, they've got this crushing debt that's crippling their self&mdash;their sense of self-reliance and their dreams. And it becomes hard to start a family and buy a home if you're servicing a thousand dollars' worth of debt every month. It becomes harder to start a business if you are servicing a thousand dollars' worth of debt every month, right? <p>And meanwhile, parents, you're having to make sacrifices, which means you may be dipping into savings that should be going to your retirement to pay for your son or daughter's&mdash;or to help pay for your son or daughter's&mdash;education. <p>So at a time when a higher education has never been more important or more expensive, too many students are facing a choice that they should never have to make: Either they say no to college and pay the price for not getting a degree&mdash;and that's a price that lasts a lifetime&mdash;or you do what it takes to go to college, but then you run the risk that you won't be able to pay it off because you've got so much debt. <p>Now, that's a choice we shouldn't accept. And by the way, that's a choice that previous generations didn't have to accept. This is a country that, early on, made a commitment to put a good education within the reach of all who are willing to work for it. And we were ahead of the curve compared to other countries when it came to helping young people go to school. <p>The folks in Buffalo understand this. And Mayor Brown was talking about the city of Buffalo and the great work that is being done through the program called Say Yes to make sure that no child in Buffalo has to miss out on a college education because they can't pay for it. <p>But even though there's a great program in this city, a lot of places, that program doesn't exist. But a generation ago, two generations ago, we made a bigger commitment. This is the country that gave my grandfather the chance to go to college on the GI bill after he came back from World War II. This is the country that helped my mother get through school while raising two kids. Michelle and I, we're only where we are today because scholarships and student loans gave us a shot at a great education. <p>And we know a little bit about trying to pay back student loans too, because we didn't come from a wealthy family. So we each graduated from college and law school with a mountain of debt. And even though we got good jobs, we barely finished paying it off just before I was elected to the U.S. Senate. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Wow! <p><i>The President.</i> Right? I mean, I was in my forties when we finished paying off our debt. And we should have been saving for Malia and Sasha by that time. But we were still paying off what we had gotten, and we were luckier because most of the debt was from law school. Our undergraduate debt was not as great because tuition had not started shooting up as high. <p>So bottom line is this: We've got a crisis in terms of college affordability and student debt. And over the past 4 years, what we've tried to do is to take some steps to make college more affordable. So we enacted historic reforms to the student loan system so taxpayer dollars stopped padding the pockets of big banks and instead helped more kids afford college. Right? <p>Because what was happening was the old system, the student loan programs were going through banks; they didn't have any risk because the Federal Government guaranteed the loans, but they were still taking billions of dollars out of the program. We said, well, let's just give the loans directly to the students and we can put more money to helping students. <p>Then we got&mdash;we set up a consumer watchdog. And that consumer watchdog is already helping students and families navigate the financial options that are out there to pay for college without getting ripped off by shady lenders. And we're providing more tools and resources for students and families to try to finance college. And if any of you are still trying to figure out how to finance college, check it out at studentaid.gov&mdash;studentaid.gov. <p>Then, we took action to cap loan repayments at 10 percent of monthly income for many borrowers who are trying to responsibly manage their Federal student loan debt. So overall, we've made college more affordable for millions of students and families through tax credits and grants and student loans that go farther than they did before. And then, just a few weeks ago, Democrats and Republicans worked together to keep student loan rates from doubling. And that saves typical&mdash;and undergraduates more than $1,500 for this year's loans. <p>So that's all a good start, but it's not enough. The problem is, is that even if the Federal Government keeps on putting more and more money in the system, if the cost is going up by 250 percent, tax revenues aren't going up 250 percent, and so at some point, the Government will run out of money, which means more and more costs are being loaded on to students and their families. <p>The system's current trajectory is not sustainable. And what that means is, State legislatures are going to have to step up. They can't just keep cutting support for public colleges and universities. It means&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. That's just the truth. Colleges are not going to be able to just keep on increasing tuition year after year, and then passing it on to students and families and taxpayers. Our economy can't afford the trillion dollars in outstanding student loan debt, much of which may not get repaid because students don't have the capacity to pay it. We can't price the middle class and everybody working to get into the middle class out of a college education. We're going to have to do things differently. We can't go about business as usual. <p>Because if we do, that will put our younger generation, our workers, our country at a competitive disadvantage for years. Higher education is still the best ticket to upward mobility in America, and if we don't do something about keeping it within reach, it will create problems for economic mobility for generations to come. And that's not acceptable. <p>So whether we're talking about a 2-year program, a 4-year program, a technical certificate, bottom line is, higher education cannot be a luxury. It's an economic imperative. Every American family should be able to afford to get it. <p>So that's the problem. Now, what are we going to do about it? Today I'm proposing major new reforms that will shake up the current system, create better incentives for colleges to do more with less, and deliver better value for students and their families. <p>And some of these reforms will require action from Congress, so we're going to have to work on that. [<i>Laughter</i>] Some of these changes I can make on my own. We are going to have to&mdash;we're going to be partnering with colleges to do more to keep costs down, and we're going to work with States to make higher education a higher priority in their budgets. <p>And one last thing: We're going to have to ask more of students who are receiving Federal aid as well. And I've got to tell you ahead of time: These reforms won't be popular with everybody, especially those who are making out just fine under the current system. But my main concern is not with those institutions, my main concern is the students those institutions are there to serve, because this country is only going to be as strong as our next generation. <p>And I've got confidence&mdash;I have confidence that our country's colleges and universities will step up&mdash;just like Chancellor Zimpher and the folks at SUNY are trying to step up&mdash;and lead the way to do the right thing for students. <p>So let me be specific. My plan comes down to three main goals. First, we're going to start rating colleges not just by which college is the most selective, not just by which college is the most expensive, not just by which college has the nicest facilities&mdash;you can get all of that on the existing rating systems. What we want to do is rate them on who's offering the best value so students and taxpayers get a bigger bang for their buck. <p>Number two, we're going to jump-start new competition between colleges, not just on the field or on the court, but in terms of innovation that encourages affordability and encourages student success and doesn't sacrifice educational quality. That's going to be the second component of it. <p>And the third is, we're going to make sure that if you have to take on debt to earn your college degree, that you have ways to manage and afford it. <p>So let me just talk about each of these briefly. <p>Our first priority is aimed at providing better value for students, making sure that families and taxpayers are getting what we pay for. Today I'm directing Arne Duncan, our Secretary of Education, to lead an effort to develop a new rating system for America's colleges before the 2015 college year. Right now private rankings like U.S. News and World Report puts out each year their rankings, and it encourages a lot of colleges to focus on ways to&mdash;how do we game the numbers? And it actually rewards them, in some cases, for raising costs. I think we should rate colleges based on opportunity: Are they helping students from all kinds of backgrounds succeed? And on outcomes, on their value to students and parents. <p>So that means metrics like: How much debt does the average student leave with? How easy is it to pay off? How many students graduate on time? How well do those graduates do in the workforce? Because the answers will help parents and students figure out how much value a college truly offers. <p>There are schools out there who are terrific values. But there are also schools out there that have higher default rates than graduation rates. And taxpayers shouldn't be subsidizing students to go to schools where the kids aren't graduating. That doesn't do anybody any good. <p>And our ratings will also measure how successful colleges are at enrolling and graduating students who are on Pell grants. And it will be my firm principle that our ratings have to be carefully designed to increase&mdash;not decrease&mdash;the opportunities for higher education for students who face economic or other disadvantages. <p>So this is going to take a little time, but we think this can empower students and families to make good choices. And it will give any college the chance to show that it's making serious and consistent improvement. So they may not&mdash;a college may not be where it needs to be right now on value, but they'll have time to try to get better. <p>And we want all the stakeholders in higher education&mdash;students, parents, businesses, college administrators, professors&mdash;to work with Secretary Duncan on this process. And over the next few months, he's going to host a series of public forums around the country to make sure we get these measures right. And then, over the next few years, we're going to work with Congress to use these ratings to change how we allocate Federal aid for colleges. <p>We are going to deliver on a promise I made last year&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. We are going to deliver on a promise we made last year, which is, colleges that keep their tuition down and are providing high-quality education are the ones that are going to see their taxpayer funding go up. It is time to stop subsidizing schools that are not producing good results and reward schools that deliver for American students and our future. <p>And we're also going to encourage States to follow the same principle. Right now most States fund colleges based on how many students they enroll, not based on how well those students do or even if they graduate. Now, some States are trying a better approach. You got Tennessee, Indiana, Ohio&mdash;they're offering more funding to colleges that do a better job of preparing students for graduation and a job. Michigan is rewarding schools that keep tuition increases low. So they're changing the incentive structure. And I'm challenging all States to come up with new and innovative ways to fund their colleges in a way that drives better results. <p>Now, for the young people here, I just want to say that just as we're expecting more from our schools that get funding from taxpayers, we're going to have to expect more from students who get subsidies and grants from taxpayers. So we're going to make sure students who receive Federal financial aid complete their courses before receiving grants for the next semester. <p>We're&mdash;we'll make sure to build in flexibility so we're not penalizing disadvantaged students or students who are holding down jobs to pay for school. Things happen. But the bottom line is, we need to make sure that if you're getting financial aid, you're doing your part to make progress towards a degree. And by the way, that's good for you too, because if you take out debt and you don't get that degree, you are not going to be able to pay off that debt, and you'll be in a bind. So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>All right, second goal: We want to encourage more&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you, Obama! <p><i>The President.</i> [<i>Laughter</i>] Thank you. <p>Second thing we want to do is to encourage more colleges to embrace innovative new ways to prepare our students for a 21st-century economy and maintain a high level of quality without breaking the bank. <p>So let me talk about some alternatives that are already out there. Southern New Hampshire University gives course credit based on how well students master the material, not just on how many hours they spend in the classroom. So the idea would be, if you're learning the material faster, you can finish faster, which means you pay less and you save money. The University of Wisconsin is getting ready to do the same thing. <p>You've got Central Missouri University&mdash;I went there, and they've partnered with local high schools and community colleges so that their students can show up at college and graduate in half the time because they're already starting to get college credits while they're in high school or while they're in a 2-year college, so by the time they get to a 4-year college, they're saving money. <p>Universities like Carnegie Mellon, Arizona State, they're starting to show that online learning can help students master the same material in less time and often at lower cost. Georgia Tech, which is a national leader in computer science, just announced it will begin offering an online master's degree in computer science at a fraction of the cost of a traditional class, but it's just as rigorous, and it's producing engineers who are just as good. <p>So a lot of other schools are experimenting with these ideas to keep tuition down. They've got other ways to help students graduate in less time, at less cost, while still maintaining high quality. The point is, it's possible. And it's time for more colleges to step up with even better ways to do it. And we're going to provide additional assistance to States and universities that are coming up with good ideas. <p>Third thing, even as we work to bring down costs for current and future students, we've got to offer students who already have debt the chance to actually repay it. Nobody wants to take on debt, especially after what we've seen and families have gone through during this financial crisis. But taking on debt in order to earn a college education has always been viewed as something that will pay off over time. We've got to make sure, though, that it's manageable. <p>As I said before, even with good jobs, it took Michelle and me a long time to pay off our student loans. While we should have been saving for Malia and Sasha's college educations, we were still paying off our own. So we know how important it is to make sure debt is manageable so that it doesn't keep you from taking a job that you really care about or getting married or buying that first home. <p>There's&mdash;there are some folks who have been talking out there recently about whether the Federal student loan program should make or cost the Government money. Here's the bottom line: Government shouldn't see student loans as a way to make money, it should be a way to help students. <p>So we need to ask ourselves: How much does Federal student loans cost students? How can we help students manage those costs better? Our national mission is not to profit off student loans, our national mission must be to profit off having the best educated workforce in the world. That should be our focus. <p>So as I mentioned a little bit earlier, 2 years ago, I capped loan repayments at 10 percent of a student's postcollege income. We call it Pay As You Earn. And it, along with some other income-driven repayment plans, have helped more than 2.5 million students so far. <p>But there are two obstacles that are preventing more students from taking advantage of it. One is that too many current and former students aren't eligible, which means we've got to get Congress to open up the program for more students. And we're going to be pushing them to do that. <p>The other obstacle is, is that a lot of students don't even know they're eligible for the program. So starting this year, we're going to launch a campaign to help more borrowers learn about their repayment options, and we'll help more student borrowers enroll in Pay As You Earn. So if you went to college, you took out debt, you want to be a teacher, and starting salary for a teacher is, let's say, 35,000, well, only 10 percent of that amount is what your loan repayment is. Now, if you're making more money, you should be paying more back. But that way, everybody has a chance to go to college; everybody has a chance to pursue their dreams. And that program is already in place. We want more students to take advantage of it. We're really going to be advertising it heavily. <p>Now, if we move forward on these three fronts&mdash;increasing value, encouraging innovation, helping people responsibly manage their debt&mdash;I guarantee you, we will help more students afford college. We'll help more students graduate from college. We'll help more students get rid of that debt so they can a good start in their careers. <p>But it's going to take a lot of hard work. Good news is&mdash;from what I hear&mdash;folks in Buffalo know something about hard work. Folks in America know something about hard work. And we've come a long way together these past 4 years. We're going to keep moving forward on this issue and on every other issue that's going to help make sure that we continue to have the strongest, most thriving middle class in the world. We're going to keep pushing to build a better bargain for everybody in this country who works hard and everybody who's trying to get into that middle class. <p>And we're going to keep fighting to make sure that this remains a country where, if you work hard and study hard and are responsible, you are rewarded, so that no matter what you look like and where you come from, what your last name is, here in America, you can make it if you try. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"187" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Syracuse! Well, it is good to be in Syracuse! <p>Can everybody give Emilio a big round of applause for that great introduction? I think Emilio's parents are probably here. Where is Emilio's parents? Wave your hands. There they are, right there. He did pretty good, didn't he? We're very proud of him. We might have to run him for something. <p>In addition to Emilio, I want to mention a couple other people. You already heard from Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, who's doing a great job every day. You've got: Mayor Stephanie Miner is here&mdash;there she is; Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is here; your Congressman Dan Maffei is here; the superintendent of the Syracuse City School District, Sharon Contreras, is here; your principal, Robert DiFlorio, is here; and most importantly, a bunch of students are here. <p>My understanding is, there are students from all five Syracuse high schools here. You got Corcoran in the house; you got Fowler in the house; Nottingham; the Institute of Technology; and our host, Henninger, is here. <p><i>Audience members</i>. Boo! <p><i>President</i>. Oh, we're all one family. <p>Now, I especially want to thank the students, because I know that you're still on summer vacation. You've got a few more days. So taking the time to be here when you've still got a little bit&mdash;that last little bit of summer break&mdash;that's a big deal, and I'm very honored to be here with you. <p>I am on a road trip&mdash;by the way, if people have seats, feel free to take a seat. I'm going to be talking for a while. If you've got no seats, then don't sit down because you will fall down. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. <p>So I'm here on a road trip through New York into Pennsylvania. This morning I was at the University at Buffalo. Tomorrow I'll be at Binghamton University and Lackawanna College in Scranton. But I wanted to come to Syracuse because you're doing something fantastic here with programs like Say Yes, Smart Scholars Early College High School. These are programs that are helping Syracuse kids get ready for college and making sure that they can afford to go. <p>And this is a community effort. All of you are coming together, and you have declared that no child in the city of Syracuse should miss out on a college education because they can't pay for it. And so we're hoping more cities follow your example because what you're doing is critical not just to Syracuse's future, but to America's future. And that's what I want to talk about briefly here today. <p>Over the past month, I've been visiting towns across the country, talking about what we need to do to secure a better bargain for the middle class and everybody who's working hard to get into the middle class, to make sure everybody who works hard has a chance to succeed in the 21st-century economy. <p>And we all understand that for the past 4&frac12; years, we had to fight our way back from a brutal recession, and millions of Americans lost their jobs and their homes and their savings. But what the recession also did was, it showed this emerging gap in terms of the life prospects of a lot of Americans. <p>What used to be taken for granted, middle class security, has slipped away from too many people. So yes, we saved the auto industry. We took on a broken health care system. We reversed our addiction to foreign oil. We changed our Tax Code that was tilted too far in favor of the wealthy at the expense of working families. And so we've made progress. Our businesses have created 7.3 million new jobs over the last 41 months. We've got more renewable energy than ever. We are importing less oil than in a very long time. We sell more goods made in America to the rest of the world than ever before. Health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in 50 years. Our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years. <p>So there's good news out there. And thanks to the grit and the resilience of the American people, we've been able to clear away the rubble of the financial crisis and start laying the foundation for a better economy. But as any middle class family will tell you, we are not&mdash;&mdash; <p>[<i>At this point, two audience members displayed a sign that read \\"Free Bradley Manning\\" and shouted slogans.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> I hear you. I got you. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> No, no, no, that's fine. Wait, wait, wait. We're okay. We're okay. That's okay. Hold on, hold on a second. Hold on, hold on. Hello, everybody, hello. Hey, hey, hey. Hold on, hold on a minute! Hold on a minute, sir. Hold on. So now&mdash;hold on a second. <p>Can I just say that as hecklers go, that young lady was very polite. [<i>Laughter</i>] She was. And she brought up an issue of importance, and that's part of what America is all about. So we don't want to&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>But what America is also all about is making sure that middle class families succeed and that people who work hard can get into the middle class. And what I was saying was, is that we're not where we need to be yet. We've still got more work to do because even before the most recent financial crisis, we had gone through a decade where folks at the top were doing better and better, most families were working harder and harder just to get by. And we've seen growing inequality in our society and less upward mobility in our society. <p>The idea used to be that here in America, anybody could make it. But part of that was because we put these ladders of opportunity for people. And unfortunately, what's happened is it's gotten tougher for a lot of folks. So we've got to reverse these trends. This has to be Washington's highest priority: How do we make sure everybody gets a fair shake? That's got to be our priority. <p>Unfortunately, you may have noticed that in Washington, rather than focusing on a growing economy and creating good middle class jobs, there's a certain faction of my good friends in the other party who've been talking about not paying the bills that they've already run up, who've been talking about shutting down the Government if they can't take away health care that we're putting in place for millions of Americans. <p>Those are not ideas that will grow our economy. They're not going to create good jobs. They're not going to strengthen the middle class; they'll weaken the middle class. So we can't afford the usual Washington circus of distractions and political posturing. We don't need that. What we've got to do is to build on the cornerstone of what it means to be middle class in America: A good job, good wages, a good education, a home, affordable health care, a secure retirement. That's what we need to focus on. <p>And we've got to create as many pathways as possible for people to succeed as long as they're willing to work hard. That's what's always made America great. We don't judge ourselves just by how many billionaires we produce. We've got to focus on our ability to make sure that everybody who works hard has a chance to pursue their own measure of happiness. <p>And in that project&mdash;in that work&mdash;there aren't a lot of things that are more important than making sure people get a good education. That is key to upward mobility; that is key to a growing economy; that is key to a strong middle class. <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you, President Obama! <p><i>The President.</i> Love you back. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, everybody here knows that. That's why you're here. That's why a lot of your families are making big sacrifices to send kids to college. You understand that in the face of global competition, a great education is more important than ever. Higher education is the single best investment you can make in your future&mdash;single best. And I'm proud of all of the students who are working toward that goal. <p>And in case any of you are wondering whether it's a good investment, think about these statistics: The unemployment rate for Americans with at least a college degree is about a third lower than the national average; the incomes of people with at least a college degree are more than twice what the incomes are of Americans who don't have a high school diploma. So more than ever before, some form of higher education&mdash;2-year, 4-year, technical college&mdash;that's the path into the middle class. <p>But the main reason I'm here is to talk about the fact that we've seen a barrier and a burden to too many American families, and that's the soaring cost of higher education. The fact is, college has never been more necessary, but it's also never been more expensive. <p>Think about this: Over the past three decades, the average tuition at a 4-year public college has risen by more than 250 percent; the typical family income has gone up 16 percent. So I wasn't a math major, but let's just think about it: college costs, 250 percent; incomes, 16 percent. What that means is, is that more and more, it's getting harder and harder for students to be able to afford that college education. And families are making bigger and bigger sacrifices, including a lot of parents who are putting off their own retirement, their own savings, because they're trying to help their kids afford a college education. <p>In the meantime, over the past few years, you've got too many States that have been cutting back on their higher education budgets. Colleges have not been cutting back on their costs. And so what you end up with is taxpayers putting in more money, students and families picking up the tab, but young people are still ending up with more debt. <p>The average student who borrows for college now graduates owing more than $26,000. And a lot of young people owe a lot more than that. I've heard from a lot of these young people. And they're frustrated because they're saying to themselves, we've done everything our society told us we were supposed to do, but crushing debt is crippling our ability to get started in our lives after we graduate; it's crippling our self-reliance and the dreams that we had. <p>At a time when higher education has never been more important or more expensive, too many students face a choice they should not have to make: Either they say no to college, or they pay the price of going to college and ending up with debt that they're not sure will pay off. And that's not a choice that we should ask young people to make; that's not a choice we should accept. <p>If you think about what built this country, this is a country that's always been at the cutting edge of making a good education available to more people. My grandfather, when he came back from World War II, he went&mdash;he had the chance to go to college on the GI bill. My mother got through school while raising two kids because she got some help. <p>Michelle and I&mdash;Michelle and I, we didn't come from rich folk. We did not come from privileged backgrounds. So we're only where we are today because scholarships and student loans gave us a shot at a good education. And we know a little bit about paying back student loans because we each graduated from college and law school with a mountain of debt. And even with good jobs, I didn't pay it off&mdash;and she didn't pay off her loans&mdash;until I was almost a U.S. Senator. I was in my 40s. <p>So over the past 4 years, what we've done is to try to take some steps to make college more affordable. First thing we did, we enacted historic reforms to the student loan system. What was happening was student loans were going through banks; banks were making billions of dollars. We said, why don't we just give the loans directly to the students? Cut out the banks, then we can help more students. <p>Then we set up a consumer watchdog that's already helping families and students sort through all the financial options so they really understand them and they're not ripped off by shady lenders. And we're providing more tools and resources for students and families trying to finance college. And by the way, high school seniors, you guys want to start figuring this stuff out. Go to studentaid.gov; that's a web site, studentaid.gov. And it will give you a sense of what's available out there. <p>We took action to cap loan repayments at 10 percent of monthly income for a lot of borrowers who are trying to pay their debt, but do so in a responsible way. <p>So overall, we've made college more affordable for millions of students and families through tax credits and grants and student loans. And just a few weeks ago, Democrats and Republicans worked together to keep student loan rates from double, and that saves a typical undergraduate more than $1,500 for this year's loans. <p>So now, that's all a good start, but it's not enough. The system we have right now is unsustainable, because if it keeps on going up 250 percent&mdash;a year, your incomes are only going up 16 percent, not 250 percent a year&mdash;over a decade, but your incomes are only going up 16 percent, it's just at a certain point, it will break the bank. There won't be enough Federal aid to make up for the difference. And families, at a certain point, aren't going to be able to send their kids to school. <p>And State legislatures, they can't just keep cutting support for public colleges and universities. Colleges can't just keep on raising tuition year after year and pushing these State cutbacks onto students and families. And Federal taxpayers are not going to be able to make up all the difference. <p>Our economy can't afford the trillion dollars&mdash;$1 trillion&mdash;in outstanding student loan debt. Because when young people have that much debt, that means they can't buy a home. It means they can't start the business that maybe they've got a great idea for. And we can't price the middle class and everybody working to get into the middle class out of a college education. It will put our young generation of workers at a competitive disadvantage for years. <p>So if a higher education is still the best ticket to upward mobility in America, and it is, then we've got to make sure it's within reach. We've got to make sure that we are improving economic mobility, not making it worse. Higher education should not be a luxury. It is a necessity, an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford. <p>So now&mdash;so what are we going to do about it? Today what I've done is propose major new reforms that will shake up the current system. We want to create better incentives for colleges to do more with less and to deliver better value for our students and their families. <p>And some of these reforms will require action from Congress, which is always difficult. Some of these changes, though, I can make on my own. And we want to work with colleges to keep costs down. States are going to need to make higher education a higher priority in their budgets. And by the way, we're going to ask more from students as well if they're receiving financial aid. <p>And some of these reforms won't be popular for every&mdash;with everybody because some folks are making out just fine under the status quo. But my concern is not to look out just for the institutions; I want to look out for the students who these institutions exist to serve. And I think&mdash;I've got confidence that our country's colleges and universities will step up to the plate if they're given the right incentives. They too should want to do the right thing for students. <p>So let me be specific. Here are three things we're going to do. Number one, I'm directing my administration to come up with a new ratings system for colleges that will score colleges on opportunity, whether they're helping students from all kinds of backgrounds succeed; and on outcomes, whether students are graduating with manageable debt, whether they're actually graduating in the first place, whether they have strong career potential when they graduate. That's the kind of information that will help students and parents figure out how much value a particular college truly offers. <p>Right now all these ranking systems, they rank you higher if you charge more and you let in fewer students. But you should have a better sense of who's actually graduating students and giving you a good deal. <p>So down the road, we're going to use these ratings, we hope, by working with Congress to change how we allocate Federal aid for colleges. And we're going to deliver on a promise that I made last year: Colleges that keep their tuition down are the ones that will see their taxpayer funding go up. We've got to stop subsidizing schools that are not getting good results, start rewarding schools that deliver for the students and deliver for America's future. That's our goal. <p>Our second goal, we want to encourage more colleges to embrace innovation, to try new ways of providing a great education without breaking the bank. A growing number of colleges across the country are testing some new approaches, so they're finding new ways, for example, to use online education to save time and money. <p>Some are trying what you're doing right here in Syracuse, creating partnerships between high schools and colleges so students can get an early jump on their degree. They can graduate faster; that means they're paying less in tuition. I want to see more schools and States get in the game so more students can get an education that costs less, but still maintains high quality. And we know it can be done. It's just we got to get everybody doing it, not just a few schools or a few cities around the country. That's the second goal. <p>Somebody screamed, and I got&mdash;I thought somebody fell, but they were just excited. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Number three, we're going to make sure that if you've taken on debt to earn your degree that you can manage and afford it. Nobody wants to take on debt, but even if we do a good job controlling tuition costs, some young people are still going to have to take out some loans. But we think of that as a good investment because it pays off in time, as long as it stays manageable, as long as you can pay it back. <p>And remember, again, Michelle and I, we went through this. It took us a long time to pay off our student loans, but we could always manage it. It didn't get out of hand. And I don't want debt to keep young people, some of who are here today, from going into professions like teaching, for example, that may not pay as much money, but are of huge value to the country. <p>And I sure don't want young people not being able to buy a home or get married or start a business because they're so loaded down with debt. So what we've done is we&mdash;two years ago, I capped loan repayments at 10 percent of a student's income after college. We called it, Pay As You Earn. And so far, this&mdash;along with a few other programs&mdash;has helped more than 2.5 million students. <p>But right now a lot of current and former students aren't eligible, so we want to work with Congress to fix that so that we got a lot more people who are eligible for this program. And then the problem is a lot of young people don't know this program exists. So we're going to do a better job advertising this program so that you will never have to pay more than 10 percent of your yearly income in servicing your debt. <p>And if you're involved in public service or non-for-profits, then at some point that debt gets forgiven because you're giving back to society in other ways. So we're going to launch a campaign to help borrowers learn more about their options. We want every student to have the chance to pay back their loans in a way that doesn't stop them from pursuing their dreams. <p>So if we move forward on these three points&mdash;increasing value, making sure that young people and their parents know what they're getting when they go to college, encouraging innovation so that more colleges are giving better value, and then helping people responsibly manage their debt&mdash;then we're going to help more students afford college. We're going to help more students graduate from college. We'll help more students get rid of their debt so they can get started on their lives. <p>And it's going to take some hard work. But the people of Syracuse know something about hard work. The American people know something about hard work. <p>And we've come a long way together over these past 4 years. I intend to keep us moving forward on this and every other issue. We're going to keep pushing to build a better bargain for the middle class and everybody who's fighting to join the middle class. And we're going to keep fighting to make sure that this country remains a country where hard work and studying and responsibility are rewarded. We're going to make sure that no matter who you are or where you come from or who you love or what your last name is, in the United States, you can make it if you try. <p>Thank you, Syracuse! God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"188" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Lackawanna! Hello, Falcons! Well, it is good to be back in Scranton. <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. <p>Now, first of all, everybody, take a seat. I want everybody to be comfortable. Here are some reasons I'm happy to be back in Scranton. Reason number one is, the first time I came to Scranton I was invited to a St. Patrick's Day party that the ladies were hosting. And I got to say, Michelle got a little jealous, because they were&mdash;I was getting kisses, and I came home and had all this lipstick on my collar&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and Michelle said, \\"What's going on there?\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] I said, \\"No, I was just campaigning.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So that makes me like Scranton. A second reason that I love Scranton is because if it weren't for Scranton, I wouldn't have Joe Biden. And today is a special day for Joe and me because 5 years ago today, on August 23, 2008, I announced in Springfield, Illinois, my home State, that Joe Biden was going to be my running mate. And it was the best decision that I ever made politically, because I love this guy. And he's got heart, and he cares about people, and he's willing to fight for what he believes in, and he's got some Scranton in him. <p>And there's not a day that goes by that Joe doesn't talk about where he comes from and he doesn't talk about all of you. And he understands why he got into public service, because he carries with him the values that you taught him and the friendships that he made. And so I just want all of you to know that I am lucky to have Joe, not just as a running mate, but more importantly, as a friend. And we love his family. And I am so blessed to be here. And thank you, Joe, for saying yes 5 years ago. <p>Third reason I love Scranton is because there are a lot of Caseys around here. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, Joe already talked about Bob Casey's mom, who is gorgeous and wonderful, and we love her dearly. But I've got to admit, Bob Casey is not bad either. [<i>Laughter</i>] He is a great United States Senator, and I'm proud to call him a friend. We love Terese, and we love his family. <p>Back in 2008, when we were campaigning in Pennsylvania and we were having a tough time and getting bad press, Bob Casey was right there with me on a train. And you can judge your friends not by when you're doing well, but when you're having a tough time, and that's the kind of person Bob Casey is. And so I'm grateful for him. <p>We've got&mdash;Mayor Chris Doherty is here. Give him a big round of applause. The State attorney general, Kathleen Kane is here. The president of Lackawanna, Mark Volk is here. <p>I want to say thank you to Urica Carver for the wonderful introduction to Joe. Good job, Urica. And finally, I want to thank all the students who are here. I know that&mdash;looks like we've got the Falcons football team here. When's your first game? <p><i>Audience member.</i> Thirty-first! <p><i>The President.</i> The 31st? You guys going to be ready? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yeah! <p><i>The President.</i> Okay, I just want to make sure. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I know classes don't start again until next week, so I appreciate you being inside when the day is so nice outside, because these last few days of summer vacation I know are precious. But we're here to talk about something important, and that is, are we doing right by, not just this generation, but future generations? <p>I'm on a road trip. It started at the University of Buffalo. Then I&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;there you go. Then I went to Syracuse, talked to some high school students there; then Binghamton University for a town hall earlier today. [<i>Applause</i>] Have you&mdash;all you guys have been following me around everywhere? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And we're ending this bus tour here in Scranton. And I wanted to visit Lackawanna College because of the great work that you're doing here: giving people a first-class education that doesn't cost a fortune, with support in place to make sure that students stay on track. <p>I'm told that many students here are the first in their families to attend college. And I know your families are proud of you, but I'm proud of you, because getting a higher education is one of the best things you can do for yourself and for your country. <p>But we've got to make sure that we're doing right by you. That's what I want to talk about today. Over the past month, I've been visiting towns like Scranton and talking about what we need to do as a country to secure a better bargain for the middle class and everybody who is fighting to get into the middle class. We've got to have a national strategy that grows the economy in a broad-based way so that everybody who works hard has a chance to succeed. That's our goal. That's what we're fighting for. <p>Now, for the past 4&frac12; years, we've been fighting back from a brutal recession, cost Americans their jobs and homes and savings, in some cases. And what happened was that recession showed what had been some longer term trends that were eroding middle class security. Folks at the top had been doing very well. But ordinary Americans hadn't seen their wages go up, hadn't seen their salaries go up. It was getting harder to save, harder to save for your kids' college education. Health care was getting harder to obtain. A lot of manufacturing had gone overseas. <p>And so what Joe and I said was, our focus is not just to fix the problems created by the crisis. We've got to change the fundamentals so that we get back to the day when if you want to work hard, if you are willing to be responsible, you can make it. You can succeed. <p>So we saved an auto industry. We took on a broken health care system. We invested in new technologies to achieve energy independence. We changed our Tax Code that was tilted too much in favor of folks who were doing very well at the expense of working families. We started to crack down on some of the practices we had seen in the financial sector that had got us into this mess in the first place. <p>And because of that work, our businesses today have created 7.3 million new jobs over the last 41 months. We're generating more energy than ever before. We sell more goods made in America to other countries than ever before. Manufacturing is starting to come back and in shore instead of outsource. Health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in 50 years. Our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years. <p>So thanks to the grit and resilience and hard work of the American people&mdash;and some good policies&mdash;we've been able to clear away the rubble of the financial crisis. We're laying the foundation for an economy that works for everybody. But as I'll bet a lot of families in Scranton will tell you, we're not yet where we need to be. We've got a lot of more work to do. <p>Like I said, even before the crisis hit, we were living through a decade where almost all the productivity gains, all the benefits of technology were accruing at the very top. And the average family had seen their incomes and wages flat or actually go down a little bit. Most families were working harder and harder just to get by. Costs of everything else were going up, but your wages and your incomes weren't going up. <p>So reversing that trend, returning to the days when: if you are willing to work hard you can succeed, that should be Washington's highest priority. [<i>Applause</i>] That should be Washington's highest priority. That's Joe's highest priority. That's Bob Casey's highest priority. That's my highest priority. That's what we should be focused on every single day. <p>But we do have a problem, which is we've got some of our friends down in Washington who&mdash;and it's not all Republicans, but there's a strong faction&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;who instead of focusing on what's helping middle class families succeed, they're spending time arguing about whether or not we should be paying the bills for things we already spent money on. They're threatening now to shut down the Government and have another financial crisis unless, for example, we get rid of the health care reform that we fought to pass and that's going to provide millions of people health care security for the first time. <p>That won't create jobs. That's not going to help our economy. That doesn't strengthen the middle class. I have not seen a policy coming out of them that would actually help ordinary folks. And we can't afford the usual Washington circus of distractions and political posturing and special interests and phony scandals. We can't afford that. We've got too much work to do. <p>We've got to build on the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class in America: a good job with good wages, a good education, a home of your own, affordable health care, secure retirements even if you're not rich, more ladders of opportunity for everybody who's willing to work for it. That's what we should be fighting for. <p>And one of the most important things we can do to restore that sense of upward mobility, the ability to achieve the American Dream, the idea that if&mdash;you can make it if you try, one of the most important things we can do is make sure every child is getting a good education. <p>And the students who are studying here, they understand that. That's why they've made sacrifices. That's why their family are making sacrifices. You understand that in the face of global competition&mdash;when the Germans and the Chinese and the Indians are all putting more money into education and putting more money into research and&mdash;that we can't just stand pat. We can't stand by and do nothing. You understand that a great education is more important than ever. <p>And you don't have to take my word for it. Look, the data is clear: If you get some kind of higher education&mdash;whether it's a 2-year degree, a 4-year degree, a technical college&mdash;you're more likely to have a job. You're more likely to see your income goes up&mdash;going up. More than ever before, some form of higher education is the surest path into the middle class and the surest path that you stay there. <p>Now, here's the challenge: The soaring cost of higher education has become an increasing burden and barrier for too many young people. College has never been more necessary, but it's never been more expensive. <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> It's true. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Over the past&mdash;listen to this statistic, because this is important. Over the past three decades, past 30 years, the average tuition at a public 4-year college has risen by more than 250 percent. So it didn't just double, it went up 250 percent. The typical family income has only gone up 16 percent. So you do the math. I'm not a math major, but there are probably some good math people here. If you've got the cost of college going up like this and incomes going up like that, you start getting that bigger and bigger gap, and that means it's harder and harder for young people to afford college. <p>And meanwhile, States have been cutting back on their higher education budgets. And let's face it, here in Pennsylvania there have been brutal cuts to not just higher education, but education generally. Not enough colleges have been able to cut back on their costs. So what happens if costs are going up, incomes are flat, and the State actually reduces its support for higher education? Well, what you end up with is, students have to pick up the tab, families have to pick up the tab, and taxpayers have to pick up the tab in the form of more and more financial assistance. <p>And that's what's happened. The average student who borrows for college now graduates owing more than $26,000, but a lot of folks will owe a lot more than that. I get letters from people who have 100,000 dollars' worth of debt. I've got&mdash;young people who've got 120,000 dollars' worth of debt. And they may be working as teachers. They may be doing really important work. They may be working as researchers. But they can't pay off that kind of debt. <p>So what's ending up happening is students end up facing a choice that they should never have to make: Either they say no to college, which means that they're going to be paying the price the rest of their lifetimes for not getting a degree; or they go to college, but they're taking on so much debt that they're not sure they're ever going to be able to pay it back. <p>And if you come out with huge debt, what does that mean? It means you can't get a mortgage on a house right away because you're paying off your debt. You may put off starting a family because you're worried about paying off the debt. If you've got a good idea for starting a business, you're maybe going to put that off because you're still servicing your debt. And that's bad for the entire economy. That's bad for everybody. <p>That's a choice we should not accept. That's not who we are. Keep in mind, this is a country that gave my grandfather, when he came back from World War II, the chance to go to college for free on the GI bill. All right? My mother was able to go to a public university and get the support she needed so she could go to school even though she was raising two kids and had to work part time to do it. <p>Michelle and I, we're only where we are today because scholarships and student loans gave us a shot at a great education. And by the way, we did have to borrow a lot of money. I didn't pay off all of my student loans until right before I was elected to the U.S. Senate. I was in my forties. I was supposed to be saving for Malia and Sasha; I was still paying off my loans. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I know a little bit about this. <p>The point is, though, in the past, we've done what was required to support the next generation succeeding, because we understood, if they succeed, then we'll all succeed. But we've kind of lost track of that. So when Joe and I came in&mdash;with the help of Bob Casey and others&mdash;we took some steps to help make student loans more affordable. We changed the system where student loans were going through banks and banks were making billions of dollars; we said, let's just give the loans directly to students, save billions of dollars so we can give more help to more students. [<i>Applause</i>] That's what we did. <p>We set up a consumer watchdog to help students and their families navigate through the financial options, make sure that they don't get taken by shady lenders. And we gave more tools and resources to students and families to finance college. And by the way, young people, if you're still trying to figure out how to finance it, go to studentaid.gov&mdash;studentaid.gov&mdash;and it will give you information that you need. <p>And then we took action to cap loan repayments at 10 percent of monthly incomes for a lot of borrowers who were going into public service so that they could responsibly manage their debt. And overall, these things made college more affordable, more accessible for millions of students and families. Using tax credits and grants and student loans, all this helped. And then, just a few weeks ago, working with Bob Casey and others, we worked to make sure that student loan rates didn't double. And that saves the typical undergraduate more than $1,500 for this year's loans. <p>So we've made some progress. But it's not enough. The system is on a trajectory that is unsustainable, because if you keep on seeing the cost of college tuition go up and up and up, then no matter how much money we put in for loans or grants or what have you, it's not going to keep up. And it means students are going to be even deeper in debt. <p>What we have to do is to actually reduce the cost. And that means that State legislatures cannot just keep cutting support for public college and universities. They've got to prioritize the next generation. It means colleges have to work harder to prevent tuition from going up year after year. <p>Our economy cannot afford the trillion dollars in outstanding student loan debt. We can't price the middle class and everybody working to get into the middle class out of a college education. We're going to have to change how we do business. Higher education is not a luxury, it's an economic necessity. And every American should be able to afford it. <p>So yesterday I announced some new reforms to shake up the system. Some will require action from Congress. [<i>Laughter</i>] That will&mdash;that's always challenging. But these are ideas that should have bipartisan support. Of course, so should Obamacare. It's actually a really good idea. It's going to work. Used to be a Republican idea. [<i>Laughter</i>] There was a Governor in Massachusetts who set it up. It's working really well. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But some of the reforms we're proposing we can make on our own. We're going to work with colleges to keep costs down. We're going to work with States to make higher education a bigger priority in the budget. And by the way, students, we're going to also ask a little more from you too, when it comes to you receiving financial aid, because you're going to have responsibilities as well. <p>And these reforms won't be popular with all the institutions out there, because some of them are doing okay with the status quo. Even if their students aren't graduating, they're still getting the money. But I'm not concerned with the institutions. I'm concerned with the students. I want the students to get a good deal. The institutions are there to serve the students and educate the young people. <p>So my plan comes down to three main goals. Number one, I'm directing my administration to come up with a new, more useful rating system for colleges. What we're going to do is not just measure&mdash;right now a lot of these rating systems are based on how selective the school is, how expensive the school is, how nice the dorm rooms are. What I want is for us to measure the kind of value they're giving students and their families. And are they providing the opportunity that we should be providing? Are they helping students from all kinds of backgrounds succeed? Are they graduating students at a good rate? Are students graduating with manageable debt? Do they have strong career potential? Are students getting jobs after they graduate from these places? That's what we want to focus on. <p>So that's information that's useful. That's news you can use. It will help students and parents figure out how much value a college truly offers. <p>And then down the road, using these ratings, we're going to work with Congress to change how we allocate Federal aid for college. Because I said this last year, and I meant it: Colleges that keep their tuition down while providing a high-quality education, we want to see their taxpayer support go up. We should not be subsidizing schools that are not getting good results for the young people who attend them. We've got to do more to reward schools that deliver for students and our future. So that's number one. <p>Number two, we're going to encourage more colleges to innovate, try new things, do things that can provide a great education without breaking the bank. So, for example, a number of colleges across the country are using online education to save time and money for their students. Or they may be, for example, seeing if you can get credits faster. If you can show competency, if you know your subject matter, you shouldn't&mdash;it shouldn't matter how many hours in a classroom you were. Question is, do you know the subject? And if you can accelerate it, you should be able to save money doing it. <p>Some schools are trying what you're doing here in Scranton, and that's creating partnerships between high school and colleges so students in high school can start accruing some credits. They can get a jump on their degree. That saves them money. <p>So the bottom line is, I want to see schools and States get in the game: try new things, figure out how to maintain high quality while reducing costs. And we'll provide incentives to States to do that. <p>And then the third thing: Even if we control costs, some of you are still going to have debt once you graduate. That's okay. I had debt. Joe had debt. I mean, not all of us are&mdash;have parents who, no matter how much they love us and work hard, can afford to pay for all of our college. But the question is can you manage it and afford it responsibly. People don't want to take out debt, but they're making a good investment. Education is something that will pay off in time, but it's got to be managed. I don't want debt to keep you from getting the job that you want or getting married or buying your first home. <p>So that's why we already capped repayments at 10 percent of a student income after college for a lot of students. We call it Pay As You Earn. Right? So far it's helping about 2.5 million students. But there are a lot of students, both current and former students, who aren't eligible. So we want to work with Congress to fix that and make more students eligible for it. <p>And too many students don't know that the program exists. So we're going to launch a campaign to help borrowers learn more about their options. Because we should allow every student the chance to pay back their loans in a way that doesn't stop them from becoming a teacher or becoming a nurse who is working in a needy community. You may have great skills. You may choose a profession that doesn't pay a lot of money. You should be able to do that. And you're giving back to the community; we should help you do it. <p>So if we do these three things&mdash;increase value, encourage innovation, help people manage their debt after graduation&mdash;then we'll help more students afford college. We'll help more students graduate from college. We'll help more students keep their debt low and repay it faster. We can do that. <p><i>Audience member.</i> You need to protect our future by banning fracking. <p><i>The President.</i> Well, there you go. [<i>Laughter</i>] The&mdash;&mdash; <p>Now, this is going to take a lot of work. But the people of Scranton, I think, know something about hard work. The American people know something about hard work. So just because something is hard doesn't mean that we don't do it. We can get this done. We can get college more affordable. We can have the best trained workforce in the world if we keep on moving forward. And Joe and I are going to keep pushing for a better bargain for the middle class, a better bargain for the next generation. And, Scranton, we're going to need your help to get it done. <p>God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"189" "\"Hi, everybody. Over the past month, I've been visiting towns across America, talking about what our country needs to do to secure a better bargain for the middle class. This week, I met with high school and college students in New York and Pennsylvania to discuss the surest path to the middle class: some form of higher education. <p>But at a moment when a higher education has never been more important, it's also never been more expensive. That's why, over the past 4 years, we've helped make college more affordable for millions of students and families with grants and loans that go farther from before. <p>But students and families and taxpayers cannot just keep subsidizing college costs that keep going up and up, not when the average student now graduates more than $26,000 in debt. <p>We cannot price the middle class out of a college education. That's why I proposed major new reforms to make college more affordable and make it easier for folks to pay for their education. <p>First, we're going to start rating colleges based on opportunity&mdash;are they helping students from all kinds of backgrounds succeed&mdash;and on outcomes&mdash;their value to students and parents. In time, we'll use those ratings to make sure that the colleges that keep their tuition down are the ones that will see their taxpayer funding go up. <p>Second, we're going to jump-start competition between colleges over innovations that help more students graduate in less time at less cost, while maintaining quality. A number of schools are already testing new approaches, like putting more courses online or basing course credit on competence, not just hours spent in the classroom. <p>And third, we're going to help more students responsibly manage their debt by making more of them eligible for a loan repayment program called Pay As You Earn, which caps your loan payments at 10 percent of what you make. And we'll reach out directly to students to make sure they know that this program exists. <p>These reforms won't be popular with everybody. But the path we're on now is unsustainable for our students and our economy. Higher education shouldn't be a luxury or a roll of the dice; it's an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"190" "\"<i>The President.</i> Good afternoon, everybody. Please be seated. Welcome to the White House. Actually, I should say welcome back. Many of you joined us earlier this year when we presented the Medal of Honor to Clint Romesha for his actions in the very same battle that we remember today. <p>Clint could not be here. He's engaged in a&mdash;this week in a cause that is very close to all of our hearts, and that's ending homelessness among our veterans. But we are honored to welcome back some of the men who fought that day at Combat Outpost Keating, members of Black Knight Troop, and the Gold Star families of those who gave their lives that day. <p>As these soldiers and families will tell you, they're a family, forged in battle and loss and love. So today is something of a reunion. And we come together again, with gratitude and pride, to bestow the Medal of Honor on a second member of this family, Staff Sergeant Ty Carter. <p>As always, we're joined by many distinguished guests, and we welcome you all. Today I want to focus on our most distinguished guests: more than 40 members of Ty's family; your parents Mark, Paula, and stepmom Barbara; your wife Shannon, who you call the CEO of your family. You're a wise man. I've got the same arrangement. [<i>Laughter</i>] Your beautiful children: 14-year-old Jayden; 8-year-old Madison in her new dress, and she was telling me about her new room as we walked over here, that&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and 9-month-old Sehara, for whom we will try to make this brief because we don't know how long the Cheerios will last. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Before they came, Ty said he was hoping to take his children around Washington to show them the sights and the history. But, Jayden, Madison, if you want to know what makes our country truly great, if you want to know what a true American hero looks like, then you don't have to look too far. You just have to look at your dad. Because today he's the sight we've come to see. Your dad inspires us, just like all those big monuments and memorials do. <p>For this is a historic day: the first time in nearly half a century, since the Vietnam war, that we've been able to present the Medal of Honor to two survivors of the same battle. Indeed, when we paid tribute to Clint Romesha earlier this year, we recalled how he and his team provided the cover that allowed three wounded Americans, pinned down in a Humvee, to make their escape. The medal we present today, the soldier that we honor&mdash;Ty Carter&mdash;is the story of what happened in that Humvee. It's the story of what our troops do for each other. <p>As some of you may recall, COP Keating was not just one of the most remote outposts in Afghanistan, it was also one of the most vulnerable: on low ground, deep in a valley, surrounded by towering mountains. When soldiers like Ty arrived, they couldn't believe it. They said it was like being in a fishbowl, easy targets for enemies in the hills above. And as dawn broke that October morning, with Ty and most of our troops still in their bunks, their worst fears became a reality. <p>Fifty-three American soldiers were suddenly surrounded by more than 300 Taliban fighters. The outpost was being slammed from every direction: machine-gun fire, rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, sniper fire. It was chaos, the blizzard of bullets and steel into which Ty ran, not once or twice or even a few times, but perhaps 10 times. And in doing so, he displayed the essence of true heroism: \\"not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost, but the urge to serve others at whatever cost.\\" <p>Ty jumped out of bed, put on his boots and his helmet and his Kevlar vest, grabbed some ammo, and he ran into bullets coming down like rain, for a hundred meters, to resupply his comrades out in that Humvee. When they needed more, he ran back, blasted the locks off supply rooms and sprinted yet again&mdash;dodging explosions, darting between craters&mdash;back to the Humvee. <p>The ferocious fire forced them inside. And so it was that five American soldiers, including Ty and Specialist Stephan Mace, found themselves trapped in that Humvee, the tires flat, RPGs pouring in, peppering them with shrapnel, threatening to break through the armor of their vehicle. And worst of all, Taliban fighters were penetrating the camp. The choice, it seemed, was simple: stay and die or make a run for it. <p>So once more, Ty stepped out into the barrage and, along with Sergeant Brad Larson, he laid down fire, providing cover for the other three, including Stephan, as they dashed for safety. But in those hellish moments, one man went down and then another. And Stephan disappeared into the dust and smoke. <p>Back in that Humvee, Ty and Brad held out for hours; rolling down the window, just a crack, taking a shot, over and over; holding the line, preventing that outpost from being completely overrun. Ty would later say, \\"We weren't going to surrender, we were going to fight\\" to the last round. And then they saw him&mdash;their buddy, Stephan&mdash;on the ground, wounded, about 30 yards away. <p>When the moment was right, Ty stepped out again and ran to Stephan and, applying a tourniquet to one of his legs, bandaging the other, tending to his wounds, grabbing a tree branch to splint his ankle. And if you are left with just one image from that day, let it be this: Ty Carter bending over, picking up Stephan Mace, cradling him in his arms, and carrying him&mdash;through all those bullets&mdash;and getting him back to that Humvee. <p>And then Ty stepped out again, recovering a radio, finally making contact with the rest of the troop, and they came up with a plan. As Clint Romesha and his team provided cover, these three soldiers made their escape: Ty, Brad carrying Stephan on a stretcher, through the chaos, delivering Stephan to the medics. <p>And the battle was still not over, so Ty returned to the fight. With much of the outpost on fire, the flames bearing down on the aid station, with so many wounded inside, Ty stepped out, one last time, exposing himself to enemy fire, grabbed a chainsaw, cut down a burning tree, saved the aid station, and helped to rally his troop as they fought yard by yard. They pushed the enemy back. Our soldiers retook their camp. <p>Now, Ty says, \\"This award is not mine alone.\\" The battle that day, he will say, was \\"one team in one fight,\\" and everyone \\"did what we could do to keep each other alive.\\" Some of these men are with us again. And I have to repeat this because they're among the most highly decorated units of this entire war: 37 Army Commendation Medals, 27 Purple Hearts, 18 Bronze Stars for their valor, 9 Silver Stars for their gallantry. <p>So, soldiers of COP Keating, please stand. <p>Today we also remember once more the eight extraordinary soldiers who gave their last full measure of devotion, some of whom spent their final moments trying to rescue Ty and the others in that Humvee. And we stand with their families, who remind us how far the heartbreak ripples: five wives, widows, who honor their husbands; seven boys and girls who honor their dad; at least 17 parents&mdash;mothers and fathers, stepmoms, and stepdads&mdash;who honor their son; some 18 siblings who honor their brother. Long after this war is over, these families will still need our love and support for all the years to come. [<i>Applause</i>] <p>And I would ask the COP Keating families to stand and be recognized, please. <p>Finally, as we honor Ty's courage on the battlefield, I want to recognize his courage in the other battle he has fought. Ty has spoken openly&mdash;with honesty and extraordinary eloquence&mdash;about his struggle with posttraumatic stress: the flashbacks, the nightmares, the anxiety, the heartache that makes it sometimes almost impossible to get through a day. And he's urged us to remember another soldier from COP Keating who suffered too, who eventually lost his own life back home and who we remember today for his service in Afghanistan that day: Private Ed Faulkner, Jr. <p>At first, like a lot of troops, Ty resisted seeking help. But with the support of the Army, the encouragement of his commanders, and most importantly, the love of Shannon and the kids, Ty got help. The pain of that day&mdash;I think Ty understands, and we can only imagine&mdash;may never fully go away. But Ty stands before us as a loving husband, a devoted father, an exemplary soldier who even redeployed to Afghanistan. <p>So now he wants to help other troops in their own recovery. And it is absolutely critical for us to work with brave young men like Ty to put an end to any stigma that keeps more folks from seeking help. So let me say it as clearly as I can to any of our troops or veterans who are watching and struggling: Look at this man. Look at this soldier. Look at this warrior. He's as tough as they come. And if he can find the courage and the strength to not only seek help, but also to speak out about it, to take care of himself and to stay strong, then so can you. So can you. <p>And as you summon that strength, our Nation needs to keep summoning the commitment and the resources to make sure we're there when you reach out. Because nobody should ever suffer alone. And no one should ever die waiting for the mental health care that they need. That's unacceptable. And all of us have to do better than we're doing. <p>As Ty knows, part of the healing is facing the sources of pain. As we prepare for the reading of the citation, I will ask you, Ty, to never forget the difference that you made on that day. Because you helped turn back that attack, soldiers are alive today, like your battle buddy in that Humvee, Brad Larson, who told us, \\"I owe Ty my life.\\" Because you urged&mdash;you had the urge to serve others at whatever cost, so many Army families could welcome home their own sons. And because of you, Stephan's mother Vanessa, who joins us again today, is able to say: \\"Ty brought Stephan to safety, which, in the end, gave him many more hours on this Earth. Stephan felt at peace.\\" And she added, in the words that speak for all of us, \\"I'm grateful to Ty more than words can describe.\\" That's something. <p>God bless you, Ty Carter, and the soldiers of the Black Knight Troop. God bless all our men and women in uniform. God bless the United States of America. <p>And with that, I would like to have the citation read. <p>[<i>At this point, Maj. S. Lee Meyer, USMC, Marine Aide to the President, read the citation. The President then presented the medal, assisted by Maj. Michael P. Wagner, USA, Army Aide to the President.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Well, thank you very much, everybody. I hope you all enjoy the reception. I want to not only thank Ty, but once again thank his extraordinary family, thank his unit, and thank all of you for us being able to acknowledge the extraordinary sacrifices that our men and women in uniform make every single day. And Ty is representative of exactly the kind of people and the quality of people who are serving us. We are grateful to them. <p>God bless you all. God bless America. Thank you.\" "
"191" "\"To the King family, who have sacrificed and inspired so much; to President Clinton; President Carter; Vice President Biden, Jill; fellow Americans. <p>Five decades ago today, Americans came to this honored place to lay claim to a promise made at our founding: \\"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\\" <p>In 1963, almost 200 years after those words were set to paper, a full century after a great war was fought and emancipation proclaimed, that promise&mdash;those truths&mdash;remained unmet. And so they came by the thousands from every corner of our country, men and women, young and old, Blacks who longed for freedom and Whites who could no longer accept freedom for themselves while witnessing the subjugation of others. <p>Across the land, congregations sent them off with food and with prayer. In the middle of the night, entire blocks of Harlem came out to wish them well. With the few dollars they scrimped from their labor, some bought tickets and boarded buses, even if they couldn't always sit where they wanted to sit. Those with less money hitchhiked or walked. They were seamstresses and steelworkers, students and teachers, maids and Pullman porters. They shared simple meals and bunked together on floors. And then, on a hot summer day, they assembled here, in our Nation's Capital, under the shadow of the Great Emancipator, to offer testimony of injustice, to petition their Government for redress, and to awaken America's long-slumbering conscience. <p>We rightly and best remember Dr. King's soaring oratory that day, how he gave mighty voice to the quiet hopes of millions, how he offered a salvation path for oppressed and oppressors alike. His words belong to the ages, possessing a power and prophecy unmatched in our time. <p>But we would do well to recall that day itself also belonged to those ordinary people whose names never appeared in the history books, never got on TV. Many had gone to segregated schools and sat at segregated lunch counters. They lived in towns where they couldn't vote and cities where their votes didn't matter. They were couples in love who couldn't marry, soldiers who fought for freedom abroad that they found denied to them at home. They had seen loved ones beaten and children firehosed, and they had every reason to lash out in anger or resign themselves to a bitter fate. <p>And yet they chose a different path. In the face of hatred, they prayed for their tormentors. In the face of violence, they stood up and sat in with the moral force of nonviolence. Willingly, they went to jail to protest unjust laws, their cells swelling with the sound of freedom songs. A lifetime of indignities had taught them that no man can take away the dignity and grace that God grants us. They had learned through hard experience what Frederick Douglass once taught: that freedom is not given, it must be won through struggle and discipline, persistence and faith. <p>That was the spirit they brought here that day. That was the spirit young people like John Lewis brought to that day. That was the spirit that they carried with them, like a torch, back to their cities and their neighborhoods. That steady flame of conscience and courage that would sustain them through the campaigns to come: through boycotts and voter registration drives and smaller marches far from the spotlight; through the loss of four little girls in Birmingham and the carnage of the Edmund Pettus Bridge and the agony of Dallas and California and Memphis. Through setbacks and heartbreaks and gnawing doubt, that flame of justice flickered; it never died. <p>And because they kept marching, America changed. Because they marched, a civil rights law was passed. Because they marched, a voting rights law was signed. Because they marched, doors of opportunity and education swung open so their daughters and sons could finally imagine a life for themselves beyond washing somebody else's laundry or shining somebody else's shoes. Because they marched, city councils changed, and State legislatures changed, and Congress changed, and yes, eventually, the White House changed. <p>Because they marched, America became more free and more fair, not just for African Americans, but for women and Latinos, Asians and Native Americans; for Catholics, Jews, and Muslims; for gays; for Americans with disabilities. America changed for you and for me. And the entire world drew strength from that example, whether the young people who watched from the other side of an Iron Curtain and would eventually tear down that wall or the young people inside South Africa who would eventually end the scourge of apartheid. <p>Those are the victories they won with iron wills and hope in their hearts. That is the transformation that they wrought with each step of their well-worn shoes. That's the debt that I and millions of Americans owe those maids, those laborers, those porters, those secretaries&mdash;folks who could have run a company maybe if they had ever had a chance; those White students who put themselves in harm's way, even though they didn't have to; those Japanese Americans who recalled their own internment; those Jewish Americans who had survived the Holocaust; people who could have given up and given in, but kept on keeping on, knowing that \\"weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\\" <p>On the battlefield of justice, men and women without rank or wealth or title or fame would liberate us all in ways that our children now take for granted, as people of all colors and creeds live together and learn together and walk together and fight alongside one another and love one another and judge one another by the content of our character in this greatest nation on Earth. <p>To dismiss the magnitude of this progress&mdash;to suggest, as some sometimes do, that little has changed&mdash;that dishonors the courage and the sacrifice of those who paid the price to march in those years. Medgar Evers, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner, Martin Luther King, Jr.&mdash;they did not die in vain. Their victory was great. <p>But we would dishonor those heroes as well to suggest that the work of this Nation is somehow complete. The arc of the moral universe may bend towards justice, but it doesn't bend on its own. To secure the gains that this country has made requires constant vigilance, not complacency. Whether by challenging those who erect new barriers to the vote or ensuring that the scales of justice work equally for all and the criminal justice system is not simply a pipeline from underfunded schools to overcrowded jails, it requires vigilance. <p>And we'll suffer the occasional setback. But we will win these fights. This country has changed too much. People of good will, regardless of party, are too plentiful for those with ill will to change history's currents. <p>In some ways, though, the securing of civil rights, voting rights, the eradication of legalized discrimination, the very significance of these victories may have obscured a second goal of the march. For the men and women who gathered 50 years ago were not there in search of some abstract ideal. They were there seeking jobs as well as justice, not just the absence of oppression, but the presence of economic opportunity. <p>For what does it profit a man, Dr. King would ask, to sit at an integrated lunch counter if he can't afford the meal? This idea&mdash;that one's liberty is linked to one's livelihood, that the pursuit of happiness requires the dignity of work, the skills to find work, decent pay, some measure of material security&mdash;this idea was not new. Lincoln himself understood the Declaration of Independence in such terms, as a promise that in due time, \\"the weights should be lifted from the shoulders of all men, and that all should have an equal chance.\\" <p>And Dr. King explained that the goals of African Americans were identical to working people of all races: \\"Decent wages, fair working conditions, livable housing, old-age security, health and welfare measures, conditions in which families can grow, have education for their children, and respect in the community.\\" <p>What King was describing has been the dream of every American. It's what's lured for centuries new arrivals to our shores. And it's along this second dimension&mdash;of economic opportunity, the chance through honest toil to advance one's station in life&mdash;where the goals of 50 years ago have fallen most short. <p>Yes, there have been examples of success within Black America that would have been unimaginable a half century ago. But as has already been noted: Black unemployment has remained almost twice as high as White employment, Latino unemployment close behind. The gap in wealth between races has not lessened, it's grown. And as President Clinton indicated, the position of all working Americans, regardless of color, has eroded, making the dream Dr. King described even more elusive. <p>For over a decade, working Americans of all races have seen their wages and incomes stagnate, even as corporate profits soar, even as the pay of a fortunate few explodes. Inequality has steadily risen over the decades. Upward mobility has become harder. In too many communities across this country, in cities and suburbs and rural hamlets, the shadow of poverty casts a pall over our youth, their lives a fortress of substandard schools and diminished prospects, inadequate health care and perennial violence. <p>And so as we mark this anniversary, we must remind ourselves that the measure of progress for those who marched 50 years ago was not merely how many Blacks could join the ranks of millionaires. It was whether this country would admit all people who are willing to work hard, regardless of race, into the ranks of a middle class life. <p>The test was not and never has been whether the doors of opportunity are cracked a bit wider for a few. It was whether our economic system provides a fair shot for the many: for the Black custodian and the White steelworker, the immigrant dishwasher and the Native American veteran. To win that battle, to answer that call&mdash;this remains our great unfinished business. <p>We shouldn't fool ourselves: The task will not be easy. Since 1963, the economy has changed. The twin forces of technology and global competition have subtracted those jobs that once provided a foothold into the middle class, reduced the bargaining power of American workers. And our politics has suffered. Entrenched interests, those who benefit from an unjust status quo, resisted any government efforts to give working families a fair deal, marshaling an army of lobbyists and opinion makers to argue that minimum wage increases or stronger labor laws or taxes on the wealthy who could afford it just to fund crumbling schools, that all these things violated sound economic principles. We'd be told that growing inequality was a price for a growing economy, a measure of this free market, that greed was good and compassion ineffective, and that those without jobs or health care had only themselves to blame. <p>And then, there were those elected officials who found it useful to practice the old politics of division, doing their best to convince middle class Americans of a great untruth: that government was somehow itself to blame for their growing economic insecurity; that distant bureaucrats were taking their hard-earned dollars to benefit the welfare cheat or the illegal immigrant. <p>And then, if we're honest with ourselves, we'll admit that during the course of 50 years, there were times when some of us claiming to push for change lost our way. The anguish of assassinations set off self-defeating riots. Legitimate grievances against police brutality tipped into excuse-making for criminal behavior. Racial politics could cut both ways, as the transformative message of unity and brotherhood was drowned out by the language of recrimination. And what had once been a call for equality of opportunity&mdash;the chance for all Americans to work hard and get ahead&mdash;was too often framed as a mere desire for government support, as if we had no agency in our own liberation, as if poverty was an excuse for not raising your child and the bigotry of others was reason to give up on yourself. <p>All of that history is how progress stalled. That's how hope was diverted. It's how our country remained divided. But the good news is, just as was true in 1963, we now have a choice. We can continue down our current path, in which the gears of this great democracy grind to a halt and our children accept a life of lower expectations; where politics is a zero-sum game; where a few do very well while struggling families of every race fight over a shrinking economic pie. That's one path. Or we can have the courage to change. <p>The March on Washington teaches us that we are not trapped by the mistakes of history, that we are masters of our fate. But it also teaches us that the promise of this Nation will only be kept when we work together. We'll have to reignite the embers of empathy and fellow feeling, the coalition of conscience that found expression in this place 50 years ago. <p>And I believe that spirit is there, that truth force inside each of us. I see it when a White mother recognizes her own daughter in the face of a poor Black child. I see it when the Black youth thinks of his own grandfather in the dignified steps of an elderly White man. It's there when the native born recognizing that striving spirit of the new immigrant, when the interracial couple connects the pain of a gay couple who are discriminated against and understands it as their own. <p>That's where courage comes from: when we turn not from each other or on each other, but towards one another, and we find that we do not walk alone. That's where courage comes from. And with that courage, we can stand together for good jobs and just wages. With that courage, we can stand together for the right to health care in the richest nation on Earth for every person. With that courage, we can stand together for the right of every child, from the corners of Anacostia to the hills of Appalachia, to get an education that stirs the mind and captures the spirit and prepares them for the world that awaits them. With that courage, we can feed the hungry and house the homeless and transform bleak wastelands of poverty into fields of commerce and promise. <p>America, I know the road will be long, but I know we can get there. Yes, we will stumble, but I know we'll get back up. That's how a movement happens. That's how history bends. That's how, when somebody is faint of heart, somebody else brings them along and says, come on, we're marching. <p>There's a reason why so many who marched that day, and in the days to come, were young. For the young are unconstrained by habits of fear, unconstrained by the conventions of what is. They dared to dream differently, to imagine something better. And I am convinced that same imagination, the same hunger of purpose stirs in this generation. <p>We might not face the same dangers of 1963, but the fierce urgency of now remains. We may never duplicate the swelling crowds and dazzling procession of that day so long ago&mdash;no one can match King's brilliance&mdash;but the same flame that lit the heart of all who are willing to take a first step for justice, I know that flame remains. <p>That tireless teacher who gets to class early and stays late and dips into her own pocket to buy supplies because she believes that every child is her charge, she's marching. <p>That successful businessman who doesn't have to, but pays his workers a fair wage and then offers a shot to a man, maybe an ex-con who is down on his luck, he's marching. <p>The mother who pours her love into her daughter so that she grows up with the confidence to walk through the same doors as anybody's son, she's marching. <p>The father who realizes the most important job he'll ever have is raising his boy right, even if he didn't have a father&mdash;especially if he didn't have a father at home&mdash;he's marching. <p>The battle-scarred veterans who devote themselves not only to helping their fellow warriors stand again and walk again and run again, but to keep serving their country when they come home, they are marching. <p>Everyone who realizes what those glorious patriots knew on that day, that change does not come from Washington, but to Washington; that change has always been built on our willingness, we the people, to take on the mantle of citizenship, you are marching. <p>And that's the lesson of our past. That's the promise of tomorrow: that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it. That when millions of Americans of every race and every region, every faith and every station, can join together in a spirit of brotherhood, then those mountains will be made low and those rough places will be made plain and those crooked places, they straighten out towards grace, and we will vindicate the faith of those who sacrificed so much and live up to the true meaning of our creed, as one Nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\" "
"192" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. Ten days ago, the world watched in horror as men, women and children were massacred in Syria in the worst chemical weapons attack of the 21st century. Yesterday the United States presented a powerful case that the Syrian Government was responsible for this attack on its own people. <p>Our intelligence shows the Asad regime and its forces preparing to use chemical weapons, launching rockets in the highly populated suburbs of Damascus, and acknowledging that a chemical weapons attack took place. And all of this corroborates what the world can plainly see: hospitals overflowing with victims; terrible images of the dead. All told, well over 1,000 people were murdered. Several hundred of them were children: young girls and boys gassed to death by their own Government. <p>Now, this attack is an assault on human dignity. It also presents a serious danger to our national security. It risks making a mockery of the global prohibition on the use of chemical weapons. It endangers our friends and our partners along Syria's borders, including Israel, Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon and Iraq. It could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm. In a world with many dangers, this menace must be confronted. <p>Now, after careful deliberation, I have decided that the United States should take military action against Syrian regime targets. This would not be an open-ended intervention. We would not put boots on the ground. Instead, our action would be designed to be limited in duration and scope. But I'm confident we can hold the Asad regime accountable for their use of chemical weapons, deter this kind of behavior, and degrade their capacity to carry it out. <p>Our military has positioned assets in the region. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs has informed me that we are prepared to strike whenever we choose. Moreover, the Chairman has indicated to me that our capacity to execute this mission is not time sensitive; it will be effective tomorrow or next week or one month from now. And I'm prepared to give that order. <p>But having made my decision as Commander in Chief based on what I am convinced is our national security interests, I'm also mindful that I'm the President of the world's oldest constitutional democracy. I've long believed that our power is rooted not just in our military might, but in our example as a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. And that's why I've made a second decision: I will seek authorization for the use of force from the American people's representatives in Congress. <p>Over the last several days, we've heard from Members of Congress who want their voices to be heard. I absolutely agree. So this morning I spoke with all four congressional leaders, and they've agreed to schedule a debate and then a vote as soon as Congress comes back into session. <p>In the coming days, my administration stands ready to provide every Member with the information they need to understand what happened in Syria and why it has such profound implications for America's national security. And all of us should be accountable as we move forward, and that can only be accomplished with a vote. <p>I'm confident in the case our Government has made without waiting for U.N. inspectors. I'm comfortable going forward without the approval of a United Nations Security Council that, so far, has been completely paralyzed and unwilling to hold Asad accountable. As a consequence, many people have advised against taking this decision to Congress, and undoubtedly, they were impacted by what we saw happen in the United Kingdom this week when the Parliament of our closest ally failed to pass a resolution with a similar goal, even as the Prime Minister supported taking action. <p>Yet while I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective. We should have this debate, because the issues are too big for business as usual. And this morning, John Boehner, Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi, and Mitch McConnell agreed that this is the right thing to do for our democracy. <p>A country faces few decisions as grave as using military force, even when that force is limited. I respect the views of those who call for caution, particularly as our country emerges from a time of war that I was elected, in part, to end. But if we really do want to turn away from taking appropriate action in the face of such an unspeakable outrage, then we must acknowledge the costs of doing nothing. <p>Here's my question for every Member of Congress and every member of the global community: What message will we send if a dictator can gas hundreds of children to death in plain sight and pay no price? What's the purpose of the international system that we've built if a prohibition on the use of chemical weapons that has been agreed to by the governments of 98 percent of the world's people and approved overwhelmingly by the Congress of the United States is not enforced? <p>Make no mistake, this has implications beyond chemical warfare. If we won't enforce accountability in the face of this heinous act, what does it say about our resolve to stand up to others who flout fundamental international rules? To governments who would choose to build nuclear arms? To terrorist who would spread biological weapons? To armies who carry out genocide? We cannot raise our children in a world where we will not follow through on the things we say, the accords we sign, the values that define us. <p>So just as I will take this case to Congress, I will also deliver this message to the world. While the U.N. investigation has some time to report on its findings, we will insist that an atrocity committed with chemical weapons is not simply investigated, it must be confronted. <p>I don't expect every nation to agree with the decision we have made. Privately, we've heard many expressions of support from our friends. But I will ask those who care about the writ of the international community to stand publicly behind our action. <p>And finally, let me say this to the American people: I know well that we are weary of war. We've ended one war in Iraq. We're ending another in Afghanistan. And the American people have the good sense to know we cannot resolve the underlying conflict in Syria with our military. In that part of the world, there are ancient sectarian differences, and the hopes of the Arab Spring have unleashed forces of change that are going to take many years to resolve. And that's why we're not contemplating putting our troops in the middle of someone else's war. <p>Instead, we'll continue to support the Syrian people through our pressure on the Asad regime, our commitment to the opposition, our care for the displaced, and our pursuit of a political resolution that achieves a government that respects the dignity of its people. <p>But we are the United States of America, and we cannot and must not turn a blind eye to what happened in Damascus. Out of the ashes of world war, we built an international order and enforced the rules that gave it meaning. And we did so because we believe that the rights of individuals to live in peace and dignity depends on the responsibilities of nations. We aren't perfect, but this Nation more than any other has been willing to meet those responsibilities. <p>So to all Members of Congress of both parties, I ask you to take this vote for our national security. I am looking forward to the debate. And in doing so, I ask you, Members of Congress, to consider that some things are more important than partisan differences or the politics of the moment. <p>Ultimately, this is not about who occupies this office at any given time, it's about who we are as a country. I believe that the people's representatives must be invested in what America does abroad, and now is the time to show the world that America keeps our commitments. We do what we say. And we lead with the belief that right makes might, not the other way around. <p>We all know there are no easy options. But I wasn't elected to avoid hard decisions. And neither were the Members of the House and the Senate. I've told you what I believe, that our security and our values demand that we cannot turn away from the massacre of countless civilians with chemical weapons. And our democracy is stronger when the President and the people's representatives stand together. <p>I'm ready to act in the face of this outrage. Today I'm asking Congress to send a message to the world that we are ready to move forward together as one Nation. <p>Thanks very much.\" "
"193" "\"Hi, everybody. This Labor Day weekend, as we gather with family and friends, we'll also come together as a nation to honor some of our own: the working men and women of America who, across the generations, built this country up and helped make us who we are today. <p>On Monday, we'll celebrate that proud history. We'll pay tribute to the values working Americans embody: hard work, responsibility, sacrifice, looking out for one another. And we also need to recommit ourselves to their cause; to securing for them a better bargain so that everyone who works hard in America has a chance to get ahead. <p>You see, over the past 4&frac12; years, we've fought our way back from the worst recession of our lifetimes. And thanks to the grit and resilience of the American people, we've begun to lay a foundation for stronger, more durable economic growth. But as any working family will tell you, we're not yet where we need to be. <p>For over a decade, working Americans have seen their wages and incomes stagnate, even as corporate profits soar and the pay of a fortunate few explodes. For even longer than that, inequality has steadily risen; the journey of upward mobility has become harder. And in too many communities across this country, the shadow of poverty continues to cast a pall over our fellow citizens. <p>Reversing that trend needs to be Washington's highest priority. And it sure is mine. That's why, over the past month, I've traveled all across America, laying out my ideas for how we can build on the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class: a good job that pays a good wage; a good education; a home of your own; health care when you get sick; a secure retirement even if you're not rich; and more chances for folks to earn their way into the middle class as long as they're willing to work for it. <p>The truth is, it's not going to be easy to reverse the forces that have conspired for decades against working Americans. But if we take a few bold steps, and if Washington is able to come together with common purpose and common resolve, we'll get there. Our economy will keep getting stronger, and more Americans will be able to join the ranks of the middle class. <p>So this Labor Day, while you're out there grilling in the backyard or taking the final trip for the summer, I hope you'll also take a moment to reflect on the many contributions of our working men and women. For generations, it was the great American middle class that made our economy the envy of the world. And as long as I'm President, I'm going to keep fighting to make sure that happens again. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"194" "\"<i>President Obama.</i> Good afternoon. I want to thank Minister Prime Reinfeldt, Lena Posner-K&ouml;r&ouml;si, and Rabbi Narrowe for welcoming me here to the Great Synagogue, the heart of the Jewish community here in Stockholm. <p>This evening is the first night of the Jewish High Holidays, Rosh Hashanah. For our Jewish friends, it's a time of joy and celebration, to give thanks for our blessings, and to look ahead to the coming year. So to all our Jewish friends here in Sweden, in the United States, and around the world, especially in Israel, I want to wish you and your families a sweet and happy New Year. <i>Shana Tova.</i> <p>Days such as this are a time of reflection, an occasion to consider not just our relationship with God, but our relationship with each other as human beings. We're reminded of our basic obligations: to recognize ourselves in each other, to treat one another with compassion, to reach out to the less fortunate among us, to do our part to help repair our world. These values are at the heart of the great partnership between Sweden and the United States. And these values defined the life of the man we remember today: Raoul Wallenberg. <p>Now, last year we marked the 100th anniversary of Wallenberg's birth, and I was proud to send my greetings to your ceremony here in Stockholm. Today we're honored to be joined by those who loved him and whose lives he touched: members of the Wallenberg family, including his half-sister Nina and the family of his late half-brother Guy; Wallenberg's colleague, Gabriella Kassius; and some of the countless men and women whom Wallenberg saved from the Holocaust. <p>We just had a wonderful visit together. They showed me some incredible artifacts, some of the Swedish passports Wallenberg used to protect Jews in Budapest. I saw his diary, his own passport, including a picture of him as he was and as he will always remain: young and determined and full of energy and an enormous heart. And I'm here today because, as Americans, we cherish our ties to Wallenberg as well. <p>He was a son of Sweden, but he also studied in America. I know he spent most of his time in Ann Arbor, but my understanding is, he spent some time in my hometown of Chicago as well. He could have remained in the comfort of Stockholm, but he went to Nazi-occupied Hungary in partnership with the U.S. War Refugee Board. To this day, schools and streets in America bear his name, and he is one of only a few individuals ever granted honorary U.S. citizenship. So he's beloved in both our countries; he's one of the links that bind us together. <p>Wallenberg's life is a challenge to us all to live those virtues of empathy and compassion, even when it's hard, even when it involves great risk. He came from a prominent family, but he chose to help the most vulnerable. He was a Lutheran, and yet he risked his lives to save Jews. \\"I will never be able to go back to Stockholm,\\" he said, \\"without knowing inside myself I'd done all a man could do to save as many Jews as possible.\\" <p>So when Jews in Budapest were marked with that yellow star, Wallenberg shielded them behind the blue and yellow of the Swedish flag. When they were forced into death marches, he showed up with the food and water that gave them life. When they were loaded on trains for the camps, he climbed on board too and pulled them off. He lived out one of the most important <i>mitzvots</i>&mdash;most important commandments&mdash;in the Jewish tradition: to redeem a captive; to save a life; the belief that when a neighbor is suffering, we cannot stand idly by. <p>And because he refused to stand by, Wallenberg reminds us of our power when we choose not simply to bear witness, but also to act: the tens of thousands he saved from the camps; the estimated 100,000 Jews of Budapest who survived the war, in no small measure because of this man and those like Gabriella who risked their lives as well. It also calls to mind the compassion of Swedes who helped to rescue so many Jews from Denmark 70 years ago this year. And this legacy shines bright in the survivors who are here today and in the family trees that have continued to grow ever since, children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren who owe their very existence to a Swedish hero that they never knew. <p>I cannot think of a better tribute to Raoul Wallenberg than for each of us&mdash;as individuals and as nations&mdash;to reaffirm our determination to live the values that defined his life and to make the same choice in our time. And so today we say that we will make a habit of empathy. We will stand against anti-Semitism and hatred in all its forms. We will choose to recognize the beauty and dignity and worth of every person and every child. And we will choose to instill in the hearts of our own children the love and tolerance and compassion that we seek. <p>One of those whom Wallenberg saved later told this story. He was a young boy in hiding when they came for the women, including his mother. And \\"my mother kissed me,\\" he said, \\"and I cried and she cried. And we knew we were parting forever.\\" But then, \\"2 or 3 hours later, to my amazement, my mother returned with the other women, and it seemed like a mirage, a miracle. My mother was there. She was alive and she was hugging me and kissing me, and she said one word: Wallenberg.\\" <p>Today we stand in awe of the courage of one man who earned his place in the Righteous Among the Nations. And we pray for the day when all peoples and nations find the same strength: to recognize the humanity that we share and to summon in our own lives our capacity for good, to live with tolerance and respect, to treat everyone with dignity, and to provide our children with the peace that they deserve. <p>So thank you very much. It is a great honor to be here today. And on behalf of the American people, we want to say to the Wallenberg family how truly inspired and grateful we are for all that he did. Thank you.\" "
"195" "\"Well, I just want to say thank you to all the participants in this roundtable. This is a incredible and very diverse group of civil society leaders. And this is something that I really enjoy doing at every country that I visit because it is my firm belief that a country's strength ultimately comes from its people and that as important as government is&mdash;and laws&mdash;what makes a country democratic and effective in delivering prosperity and security and hope to people is when they've got an active, thriving civil society. <p>And all of these leaders, ranging from business leaders to youth leaders, to environmental leaders, those who are advocating on behalf of a free press or the rule of law, all of them contribute in one way or another to continuing to strengthen Russian society and helping to make progress on behalf of all people. <p>And the same is true in the United States. I'm now in government, but I got my start as a community organizer, somebody who was working in what would be called an NGO in the international community. And the work I was doing was helping poor communities have a voice in what was happening in their lives. And I got elected as President by engaging people at a grassroots level. <p>So the kinds of activities that are represented here are critically important to Russia's development, and I'm very proud of their work. And I think it is important for us to remember that in every country&mdash;here in Russia, in the United States, around the globe&mdash;that part of good government is making sure that we're creating a space for civil society to function effectively: freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, making sure that people can join together and make common cause around the issues that they care deeply about. <p>So I appreciate taking the time. I'm not going to do all the talking here. I want to spend most of my time listening. But I want to thank you again and hope all of you continue the good work. Good. <p>Thank you, guys.\" "
"196" "\"Almost 3 weeks ago in Syria, more than a thousand innocent people, including hundreds of children, were murdered in the worst chemical weapons attack of the 21st century. And the United States has presented a powerful case to the world that the Syrian Government was responsible for this horrific attack on its own people. <p>This was not only a direct attack on human dignity: It's a serious threat to our national security. There's a reason governments representing 98 percent of the world's people have agreed to ban the use of chemical weapons&mdash;not only because they cause death and destruction in the most indiscriminate and inhumane way possible, but because they can also fall into the hands of terrorist groups who wish to do us harm. <p>That's why, last weekend, I announced that, as Commander in Chief, I decided that the United States should take military action against the Syrian regime. This is not a decision I made lightly. Deciding to use military force is the most solemn decision we can make as a nation. <p>As the leader of the world's oldest constitutional democracy, I also know that our country will be stronger if we act together, and our actions will be more effective. That's why I asked Members of Congress to debate this issue and vote on authorizing the use of force. <p>What we're not talking about is an open-ended intervention. This would not be another Iraq or Afghanistan. There would be no American boots on the ground. Any action we take would be limited, both in time and scope, designed to deter the Syrian Government from gassing its own people again and degrade its ability to do so. <p>I know that the American people are weary after a decade of war, even as the war in Iraq has ended and the war in Afghanistan is winding down. That's why we're not putting our troops in the middle of somebody else's war. <p>But we are the United States of America. We cannot turn a blind eye to images like the ones we've seen out of Syria. Failing to respond to this outrageous attack would increase the risk that chemical weapons could be used again, that they would fall into the hands of terrorists who might use them against us, and it would send a horrible signal to other nations that there would be no consequences for their use of these weapons, all of which would pose a serious threat to our national security. <p>That's why we can't ignore chemical weapons attacks like this one, even if they happen halfway around the world. And that's why I call on Members of Congress from both parties to come together and stand up for the kind of world we want to live in, the kind of world we want to leave our children and future generations. <p>Thank you.\" "
"197" "\"My fellow Americans, tonight I want to talk to you about Syria: why it matters and where we go from here. <p>Over the past 2 years, what began as a series of peaceful protests against the repressive regime of Bashar al-Asad has turned into a brutal civil war. Over 100,000 people have been killed. Millions have fled the country. In that time, America has worked with allies to provide humanitarian support, to help the moderate opposition, and to shape a political settlement. But I have resisted calls for military action because we cannot resolve someone else's civil war through force, particularly after a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. <p>The situation profoundly changed, though, on August 21, when Asad's Government gassed to death over a thousand people, including hundreds of children. The images from this massacre are sickening: men, women, children lying in rows, killed by poison gas; others foaming at the mouth, gasping for breath; a father clutching his dead children, imploring them to get up and walk. On that terrible night, the world saw in gruesome detail the terrible nature of chemical weapons and why the overwhelming majority of humanity has declared them off limits: a crime against humanity and a violation of the laws of war. <p>This was not always the case. In World War I, American GIs were among the many thousands killed by deadly gas in the trenches of Europe. In World War II, the Nazis used gas to inflict the horror of the Holocaust. Because these weapons can kill on a mass scale, with no distinction between soldier and infant, the civilized world has spent a century working to ban them. And in 1997, the United States Senate overwhelmingly approved an international agreement prohibiting the use of chemical weapons, now joined by 189 Governments that represent 98 percent of humanity. <p>On August 21, these basic rules were violated, along with our sense of common humanity. No one disputes that chemical weapons were used in Syria. The world saw thousands of videos, cell phone pictures, and social media accounts from the attack, and humanitarian organizations told stories of hospitals packed with people who had symptoms of poison gas. <p>Moreover, we know the Asad regime was responsible. In the days leading up to August 21, we know that Asad's chemical weapons personnel prepared for an attack near an area where they mix sarin gas. They distributed gasmasks to their troops. Then they fired rockets from a regime-controlled area into 11 neighborhoods that the regime has been trying to wipe clear of opposition forces. Shortly after those rockets landed, the gas spread, and hospitals filled with the dying and the wounded. We know senior figures in Asad's military machine reviewed the results of the attack, and the regime increased their shelling of the same neighborhoods in the days that followed. We've also studied samples of blood and hair from people at the site that tested positive for sarin. <p>When dictators commit atrocities, they depend upon the world to look the other way until those horrifying pictures fade from memory. But these things happened. The facts cannot be denied. The question now is what the United States of America&mdash;and the international community&mdash;is prepared to do about it. Because what happened to those people&mdash;to those children&mdash;is not only a violation of international law, it's also a danger to our security. <p>Let me explain why. If we fail to act, the Asad regime will see no reason to stop using chemical weapons. As the ban against these weapons erodes, other tyrants will have no reason to think twice about acquiring poison gas and using them. Over time, our troops would again face the prospect of chemical warfare on the battlefield. And it could be easier for terrorist organizations to obtain these weapons and to use them to attack civilians. <p>If fighting spills beyond Syria's borders, these weapons could threaten allies like Turkey, Jordan, and Israel. And a failure to stand against the use of chemical weapons would weaken prohibitions against other weapons of mass destruction and embolden Asad's ally Iran, which must decide whether to ignore international law by building a nuclear weapon or to take a more peaceful path. <p>This is not a world we should accept. This is what's at stake. And that is why, after careful deliberation, I determined that it is in the national security interests of the United States to respond to the Asad regime's use of chemical weapons through a targeted military strike. The purpose of this strike would be to deter Asad from using chemical weapons, to degrade his regime's ability to use them, and to make clear to the world that we will not tolerate their use. <p>That's my judgment as Commander in Chief. But I'm also the President of the world's oldest constitutional democracy. So even though I possess the authority to order military strikes, I believed it was right, in the absence of a direct or imminent threat to our security, to take this debate to Congress. I believe our democracy is stronger when the President acts with the support of Congress. And I believe that America acts more effectively abroad when we stand together. <p>This is especially true after a decade that put more and more war-making power in the hands of the President and more and more burdens on the shoulders of our troops, while sidelining the people's representatives from the critical decisions about when we use force. <p>Now, I know that after the terrible toll of Iraq and Afghanistan, the idea of any military action, no matter how limited, is not going to be popular. After all, I've spent 4&frac12; years working to end wars, not to start them. Our troops are out of Iraq. Our troops are coming home from Afghanistan. And I know Americans want all of us in Washington&mdash;especially me&mdash;to concentrate on the task of building our Nation here at home: putting people back to work, educating our kids, growing our middle class. <p>It's no wonder, then, that you're asking hard questions. So let me answer some of the most important questions that I've heard from Members of Congress and that I've read in letters that you've sent to me. <p>First, many of you have asked, won't this put us on a slippery slope to another war? One man wrote to me that we are \\"still recovering from our involvement in Iraq.\\" A veteran put it more bluntly: \\"This nation is sick and tired of war.\\" My answer is simple: I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria. I will not pursue an open-ended action like Iraq or Afghanistan. I will not pursue a prolonged air campaign like Libya or Kosovo. This would be a targeted strike to achieve a clear objective: deterring the use of chemical weapons and degrading Asad's capabilities. <p>Others have asked whether it's worth acting if we don't take out Asad. As some Members of Congress have said, there's no point in simply doing a \\"pinprick\\" strike in Syria. Let me make something clear: The United States military doesn't do pinpricks. Even a limited strike will send a message to Asad that no other nation can deliver. I don't think we should remove another dictator with force; we learned from Iraq that doing so makes us responsible for all that comes next. But a targeted strike can make Asad&mdash;or any other dictator&mdash;think twice before using chemical weapons. <p>Other questions involve the dangers of retaliation. We don't dismiss any threats, but the Asad regime does not have the ability to seriously threaten our military. Any other retaliation they might seek is in line with threats that we face every day. Neither Asad nor his allies have any interest in escalation that would lead to his demise. And our ally Israel can defend itself with overwhelming force, as well as the unshakeable support of the United States of America. <p>Many of you have asked a broader question: Why should we get involved at all in a place that's so complicated and where, as one person wrote to me, \\"those who come after Asad may be enemies of human rights\\"? It's true that some of Asad's opponents are extremists. But Al Qaida will only draw strength in a more chaotic Syria if people there see the world doing nothing to prevent innocent civilians from being gassed to death. The majority of the Syrian people&mdash;and the Syrian opposition we work with&mdash;just want to live in peace, with dignity and freedom. And the day after any military action, we would redouble our efforts to achieve a political solution that strengthens those who reject the forces of tyranny and extremism. <p>Finally, many of you have asked: Why not leave this to other countries or seek solutions short of force? As several people wrote to me, \\"We should not be the world's policeman.\\" I agree, and I have a deeply held preference for peaceful solutions. Over the last 2 years, my administration has tried diplomacy and sanctions, warnings and negotiations, but chemical weapons were still used by the Asad regime. <p>However, over the last few days, we've seen some encouraging signs. In part because of the credible threat of U.S. military action, as well as constructive talks that I had with President Putin, the Russian Government has indicated a willingness to join with the international community in pushing Asad to give up his chemical weapons. The Asad regime has now admitted that it has these weapons and even said they'd join the Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits their use. <p>It's too early to tell whether this offer will succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Asad regime keeps its commitments. But this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force, particularly because Russia is one of Asad's strongest allies. <p>I have therefore asked the leaders of Congress to postpone a vote to authorize the use of force while we pursue this diplomatic path. I'm sending Secretary of State John Kerry to meet his Russian counterpart on Thursday, and I will continue my own discussions with President Putin. I've spoken to the leaders of two of our closest allies, France and the United Kingdom, and we will work together in consultation with Russia and China to put forward a resolution at the U.N. Security Council requiring Asad to give up his chemical weapons and to ultimately destroy them under international control. We'll also give U.N. inspectors the opportunity to report their findings about what happened on August 21. And we will continue to rally support from allies from Europe to the Americas, from Asia to the Middle East, who agree on the need for action. <p>Meanwhile, I've ordered our military to maintain their current posture to keep the pressure on Asad and to be in a position to respond if diplomacy fails. And tonight I give thanks again to our military and their families for their incredible strength and sacrifices. <p>My fellow Americans, for nearly seven decades, the United States has been the anchor of global security. This has meant doing more than forging international agreements. It has meant enforcing them. The burdens of leadership are often heavy, but the world is a better place because we have borne them. <p>And so to my friends on the right, I ask you to reconcile your commitment to America's military might with a failure to act when a cause is so plainly just. To my friends on the left, I ask you to reconcile your belief in freedom and dignity for all people with those images of children writhing in pain and going still on a cold hospital floor. For sometimes, resolutions and statements of condemnation are simply not enough. <p>Indeed, I'd ask every Member of Congress&mdash;and those of you watching at home tonight&mdash;to view those videos of the attack and then ask: What kind of world will we live in if the United States of America sees a dictator brazenly violate international law with poison gas and we choose to look the other way? <p>Franklin Roosevelt once said, \\"Our national determination to keep free of foreign wars and foreign entanglements cannot prevent us from feeling deep concern when ideals and principles that we have cherished are challenged.\\" Our ideals and principles, as well as our national security, are at stake in Syria, along with our leadership of a world where we seek to ensure that the worst weapons will never be used. <p>America is not the world's policeman. Terrible things happen across the globe, and it is beyond our means to right every wrong. But when, with modest effort and risk, we can stop children from being gassed to death&mdash;and thereby make our own children safer over the long run&mdash;I believe we should act. That's what makes America different. That's what makes us exceptional. With humility, but with resolve, let us never lose sight of that essential truth. <p>Thank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\" "
"198" "\"<i>The President.</i> Good morning. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Good morning! <p><i>The President.</i> From Scripture, we learn of the miracle of restoration: \\"You who have made me see many troubles and calamities will revive me again. From the depths of the Earth, you will bring me up again. You will increase my greatness and comfort me again.\\" <p>Secretary Hagel, General Dempsey, members of our Armed Forces, and most of all, the survivors who bear the wounds of that day and the families of those we lost, it is an honor to be with you here again to remember the tragedy of 12 Septembers ago, to honor the greatness of all who responded, and to stand with those who still grieve and to provide them some measure of comfort once more. Together, we pause, and we pray, and we give humble thanks&mdash;as families and as a nation&mdash;for the strength and the grace that, from the depths of our despair, has brought us up again, has revived us again, has given us strength to keep on. <p>We pray for the memory of all those taken from us, nearly 3,000 innocent souls. Our hearts still ache for the futures snatched away, the lives that might have been, the parents who would have known the joys of being grandparents, the fathers and mothers who would have known the pride of a child's graduation, the sons and daughters who would have grown, maybe married and been blessed with children of their own. Those beautiful boys and girls just beginning to find their way, who today would have been teenagers and young men and women looking ahead, imagining the mark they'd make on the world. <p>They left this Earth. They slipped from our grasp. But it was written, \\"What the heart has once owned and had, it shall never lose.\\" What your families lost in the temporal, in the here and now, is now eternal: the pride that you carry in your hearts, the love that will never die, your loved ones' everlasting place in America's heart. <p>We pray for you, their families, who have known the awful depths of loss. And in the quiet moments we have spent together and from the stories that you've shared, I'm amazed at the will that you've summoned in your lives to lift yourselves up and to carry on and to live and love and laugh again. <p>Even more than memorials of stone and water, your lives are the greatest tribute to those that we lost. For their legacy shines on in you: when you smile just like him, when you toss your hair just like her, when you foster scholarships and service projects that bear the name and&mdash;of those we lost and make a better world. When you join the firehouse or you put on the uniform or you devote yourself to a cause greater than yourself, just like they did, that's a testimony to them. And in your resilience, you have taught us all, there is no trouble we cannot endure and there is no calamity we cannot overcome. <p>We pray for all those who have stepped forward in those years of war: diplomats who serve in dangerous posts, as we saw this day last year in Benghazi; intelligence professionals, often unseen and unheralded, who protect us in every way; our men and women in uniform who defend this country that we love. <p>Today we remember not only those who died that September day. We pay solemn tribute to more than 6,700 patriots who have given their full measure since: military and civilians. We see their legacy in the friendships they forged, the attacks they prevented, the innocent lives they saved, and in their comrades in Afghanistan who are completing the mission and who by the end of next year will have helped to end this war. <p>So this is the path that we've traveled together. These are the wounds that continue to heal. And this is the faith in God and each other that carries us through, that restores us, and that we summon once more each time we come to hallowed ground, beside this building or in a Pennsylvania field or where the towers once stood. Here, in such moments of grace, we are renewed. And it is here that we reaffirm the values and virtues that must guide us. <p>Let us have the strength to face the threats that endure, different though they may be from 12 years ago, so that as long as there are those who would strike our citizens, we will stand vigilant and defend our Nation. <p>Let us have the wisdom to know that while force is at times necessary, force alone cannot build the world we seek. So we recommit to the partnerships and progress that builds mutual respect and deepens trust and allows more people to live in dignity, prosperity, and freedom. <p>Let us have the confidence in the values that make us Americans, which we must never lose: the shining liberties that make us a beacon of the world, the rich diversity that makes us stronger, the unity and commitment to one another that we sustain on this National Day of Service and Remembrance. <p>And above all, let us have the courage, like the survivors and families here today, to carry on, no matter how dark the night or how difficult the day. \\"You who have made me see many troubles and calamities will revive me again. And from the depths of the Earth, you will bring me up again. You will increase my greatness and you will comfort me again.\\" <p>May God bless the memory of those that we lost. May He comfort you and your families, and may God bless these United States of America.\" "
"199" "\"Well, obviously, we're missing a few members of our Cabinet here today. In particular, John Kerry is overseas meeting on a topic that we've been spending a lot of time on over the last several weeks: the situation in Syria and how we can make sure that chemical weapons are not used against innocent people. <p>I am hopeful that the discussions that Senator&mdash;Secretary Kerry had with Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as some of the other players in this, can yield a concrete result. And I know that he is going to be working very hard over the next several days to see what the possibilities are there. <p>But even as we have been spending a lot of time on the Syria issue and making sure that international attention is focused on the horrible tragedy that occurred there, it is still important to recognize that we've got a lot more stuff to do here in this Government. <p>The American people are still interested in making sure that our kids are getting the kind of education they deserve; that we're putting people back to work; that we are dealing properly with a Federal budget; that bills are getting paid on time; that the full faith and credit of the United States is preserved; and that the Federal Government itself is, in every single agency, running the way it should and making sure that our constituents and the American people are getting a good deal. <p>So we're going to spend some time here today talking about all the efforts that have been made by many of these Cabinet Secretaries to streamline operations, to cut out waste, to improve performance, to improve customer satisfaction. We're going to focus on some specific issues, including managing some of the budget debates that are going to be taking place over the next several weeks. <p>We're going to be talking about the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, where we've seen some tremendous progress over the last several months and are confident that starting at the beginning of next month, people are going to be able to start signing up for health care, in many cases, for the first time. And we're going to spend some time talking about issues like comprehensive immigration reform that are still of enormous importance to ensure that America grows. <p>So I appreciate all the great work that people have done. Some of the Cabinet members here are still relatively new, but thanks to their confirmations and the great teams they put around them, I know that they're hitting the ground running. All right? <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"200" "\"This week when I addressed the Nation on Syria, I said that, in part because of the credible threat of U.S. military force, there is the possibility of a diplomatic solution. Russia has indicated a new willingness to join with the international community in pushing Syria to give up its chemical weapons, which the Asad regime used in an attack that killed more than a thousand people on August 21. I also asked Congress to postpone a vote on the use of military force while we pursue this diplomatic path. And that's what we're doing. <p>At my direction, Secretary of State Kerry is in discussions with his Russian counterpart. But we're making it clear that this can't be a stalling tactic. Any agreement needs to verify that the Asad regime and Russia are keeping their commitments. That means working to turn Syria's chemical weapons over to international control and ultimately destroying them. This would allow us to achieve our goal: deterring the Syrian regime from using chemical weapons, degrading their ability to use them, and making it clear to the world that we won't tolerate their use. <p>We've seen indications of progress. As recently as a week ago, the Asad regime would not admit that it possessed chemical weapons. Today, it does. Syria has signaled a willingness to join with 189 other nations, representing 98 percent of humanity, in abiding by an international agreement that prohibits the use of chemical weapons. And Russia has staked its own credibility on supporting this outcome. <p>These are all positive developments. We'll keep working with the international community to see that Asad gives up his chemical weapons so that they can be destroyed. We will continue rallying support from allies around the world who agree on the need for action to deter the use of chemical weapons in Syria. And if current discussions produce a serious plan, I'm prepared to move forward with it. <p>But we are not just going to take Russia and Asad's word for it. We need to see concrete actions to demonstrate that Asad is serious about giving up his chemical weapons. And since this plan emerged only with a credible threat of U.S. military action, we will maintain our military posture in the region to keep the pressure on the Asad regime. And if diplomacy fails, the United States and the international community must remain prepared to act. <p>The use of chemical weapons anywhere in the world is an affront to human dignity and a threat to the security of people everywhere. As I have said for weeks, the international community must respond to this outrage. A dictator must not be allowed to gas children in their beds with impunity. And we cannot risk poison gas becoming the new weapon of choice for tyrants and terrorists the world over. <p>We have a duty to preserve a world free from the fear of chemical weapons for our children. But if there is any chance of achieving that goal without resorting to force, then I believe we have a responsibility to pursue that path. Thank you.\" "
"201" "\"<i>Shootings at the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, DC </i><p>Good afternoon, everybody. Please have a seat. Before I begin, let me say a few words about the tragedy that's unfolding not far away from here at the Washington Navy Yard. Now, that's part of why our event today was delayed. <p>I've been briefed by my team on the situation. We still don't know all the facts, but we do know that several people have been shot and some have been killed. So we are confronting yet another mass shooting, and today it happened on a military installation in our Nation's Capital. <p>It's a shooting that targeted our military and civilian personnel. These are men and women who were going to work, doing their job, protecting all of us. They're patriots, and they know the dangers of serving abroad, but today they faced the unimaginable violence that they wouldn't have expected here at home. <p>So we offer our gratitude to the Navy and local law enforcement, Federal authorities, and the doctors who have responded with skill and bravery. I've made it clear to my team that I want the investigation to be seamless so that Federal and local authorities are working together. And as this investigation moves forward, we will do everything in our power to make sure whoever carried out this cowardly act is held responsible. <p>In the meantime, we send our thoughts and prayers to all at the Navy Yard who have been touched by this tragedy. We thank them for their service. We stand with the families of those who have been harmed. They're going to need our love and support. And as we learn more about the courageous Americans who died today&mdash;their lives, their families, their patriotism&mdash;we will honor their service to the Nation they helped to make great. And obviously, we're going to be investigating thoroughly what happened, as we do so many of these shootings, sadly, that have happened, and do everything that we can to try to prevent them. <p><i>Situation in Syria </i><p>Now, in recent weeks, much of our attention has been focused on the events in Syria: the horrible use of chemical weapons on innocent people, including children, the need for a firm response from the international community. And over the weekend, we took an important step in that direction towards moving Syria's chemical weapons under international control so that they can be destroyed. And we're not there yet, but if properly implemented, this agreement could end the threat these weapons pose not only to the Syrian people, but to the world. <p>I want to be clear, though, that even as we've dealt with the situation in Syria, we've continued to focus on my number-one priority since the day I took office: making sure we recover from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes and rebuilding our economy so it works for everybody who is willing to work hard; so that everybody who is willing to take responsibility for their lives has a chance to get ahead. <p>It was 5 years ago this week that the financial crisis rocked Wall Street and sent an economy already into recession into a tailspin. And it's hard sometimes to remember everything that happened during those months, but in a matter of a frightening few days and weeks, some of the largest investment banks in the world failed. Stock markets plunged. Banks stopped lending to families and small businesses. Our auto industry&mdash;the heartbeat of American manufacturing&mdash;was flatlining. <p>By the time I took office, the economy was shrinking by an annual rate of more than 8 percent. Our businesses were shedding 800,000 jobs each month. It was a perfect storm that would rob millions of Americans of jobs and homes and savings that they had worked a lifetime to build. And it also laid bare the long erosion of a middle class that, for more than a decade, has had to work harder and harder just to keep up. <p>In fact, most Americans who've known economic hardship these past several years, they don't think about the collapse of Lehman Brothers when they think about the recession. Instead, they recall the day they got the gut punch of a pink slip or the day a bank took away their home; the day they got sick, but didn't have health insurance or the day they had to sit their daughter or son down and tell him or her that they couldn't afford to send their child back to college the next semester. <p>And so those are the stories that guided everything we've done. It's what in those earliest days of the crisis caused us to act so quickly through the Recovery Act to arrest the downward spiral and put a floor under the fall. We put people to work repairing roads and bridges, to keep teachers in our classrooms, our first responders on the streets. We helped responsible homeowners modify their mortgages so that more of them could keep their homes. We helped jump-start the flow of credit to help more small businesses keep their doors open. We saved the American auto industry. <p>And as we worked to stabilize the economy and get it growing and creating jobs again, we also started pushing back against the trends that have been battering the middle class for decades. So we took on a broken health care system. We invested in new American technologies to end our addiction to foreign oil. We put in place tough new rules on big banks&mdash;rules that we need to finalize before the end of the year, by the way, to make sure that the job is done&mdash;and we put in new protections that cracked down on the worst practices of mortgage lenders and credit card companies. We also changed a Tax Code that was too skewed in favor of the wealthiest Americans. We locked in tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans. We asked those at the top to pay a little bit more. <p>So if you add it all up, over the last 3&frac12; years, our businesses have added 7&frac12; million new jobs. The unemployment rate has come down. Our housing market is healing. Our financial system is safer. We sell more goods made in America to the rest of the world than ever before. We generate more renewable energy than ever before. We produce more natural gas than anybody. <p>Health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in 50 years. And just 2 weeks from now, millions of Americans who have been locked out of buying health insurance just because they had a preexisting condition, just because they had been sick or they couldn't afford it, they're finally going to have a chance to buy quality, affordable health care on the private marketplace. And what all this means is we've cleared away the rubble from the financial crisis and we've begun to lay a new foundation for economic growth and prosperity. <p>And in our personal lives, I think a lot of us understand that people have tightened their belts, shed debt, refocused on the things that really matter. All of this happened because ultimately of the resilience and the grit of the American people. And we should be proud of that. And on this 5-year anniversary, we should take note of how far we've come from where we were 5 years ago. <p>But that's not the end of the story. As any middle class family will tell you, or anybody who's striving to get into the middle class, we are not yet where we need to be. And that's what we've got to focus on: all the remaining work that needs to be done to strengthen this economy. <p>We need to grow faster. We need more good-paying jobs. We need more broad-based prosperity. We need more ladders of opportunity for people who are currently poor, but want to get into the middle class. Because even though our businesses are creating new jobs and have broken record profits, the top 1 percent of Americans took home 20 percent of the Nation's income last year, while the average worker isn't seeing a raise at all. In fact, that understates the problem. Most of the gains have gone to the top one-tenth of 1 percent. <p>So, in many ways, the trends that have taken hold over the past few decades of a winner-take-all economy, where a few do better and better and better while everybody else just treads water or loses ground, those trends have been made worse by the recession. <p>That's what we should be focused on. That's what I'm focused on. That's what I know the Americans standing beside me, as well as all of you out there, are focused on. And as Congress begins another budget debate, that's what Congress should be focused on. How do we grow the economy faster? How do we create better jobs? How do we increase wages and incomes? How do we increase opportunity for those who have been locked out of opportunity? How do we create better retirement security? That's what we should be focused on, because the stakes for our middle class and everybody who's fighting to get into the middle class could not be higher. <p>In today's hypercompetitive world, we have to make the investments necessary to attract good jobs that pay good wages and offer high standards of living. And although ultimately our success will depend on all the innovation and hard work of our private sector&mdash;all that grit and resilience of the American people&mdash;government is going to have a critical role in making sure we have an education system that prepares our children and our workers for a global economy. <p>The budget Congress passes will determine whether we can hire more workers to upgrade our transportation and communications networks or fund the kinds of research and development that have always kept America on the cutting edge. So what happens here in Washington makes a difference. What happens up on Capitol Hill is going to help determine not only the pace of our growth, but also the quality of jobs, the quality of opportunity for this generation and future generations. <p>The problem is, at the moment, Republicans in Congress don't seem to be focused on how to grow the economy and build the middle class. I say \\"at the moment,\\" because I'm still hoping that a light bulb goes off here. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So far, their budget ideas revolve primarily around even deeper cuts to education, even deeper cuts that would gut America's scientific research and development, even deeper cuts to America's infrastructure investment: our roads, our bridges, our schools, our energy grid. These aren't the policies that would grow the economy faster. They're not the policies that would help grow the middle class. In fact, they'd do the opposite. <p>Up until now, Republicans have argued that these cuts are necessary in the name of fiscal responsibility. But our deficits are now falling at the fastest rate since the end of World War II. I want to repeat that. Our deficits are going down faster than any time since before I was born. By the end of this year, we will have cut our deficits by more than half since I took office. <p>Now, that doesn't mean that we don't still have some long-term fiscal challenges, primarily because the population is getting older and they're using more health care services. And so we've still got some changes that we've got to make, and there's not a Government agency or program out there that still can't be streamlined, become more customer friendly, more efficient. So I do believe we should cut out programs that we don't need. We need to fix ones that aren't working the way they're supposed to or have outlived their initial mission. We've got to make Government faster and more efficient. <p>But that's not what is being proposed by the Republican budgets. Instead of making necessary changes with a scalpel, so far at least, Republicans have chosen to leave in place the so-called sequester cuts that have cost jobs, harmed growth, are hurting our military readiness. And top independent economists say this has been a big drag on our recovery this year. Our economy is not growing as fast as it should and we're not creating as many jobs as we should, because the sequester is in place. That's not my opinion, that's the opinion of independent economists. <p>The sequester makes it harder to do what's required to boost wages for American workers, because the economy is still slack. So if Republicans want the economy to grow faster, create more jobs faster, they should want to get rid of it. It's irresponsible to keep it in place. <p>And if Congress is serious about wanting to grow the economy faster and creating jobs faster, the first order of business must be to pass a sensible budget that replaces the sequester with a balanced plan that is both fiscally sound and funds the investments like education and basic research and infrastructure that we need to grow. Now, this is not asking too much. <p>Congress's most fundamental job is passing a budget. And Congress needs to get it done without triggering another crisis, without shutting down our Government or, worse, threatening not to pay this country's bills. After all the progress that we've made over these last 4&frac12; years, the idea of reversing that progress because of an unwillingness to compromise or because of some ideological agenda is the height of irresponsibility. It's not what the American people need right now. <p>These folks standing behind me, these are people who are small-business owners, people who almost lost their home, young people trying to get a college education, and all of them went through some real tough times during the recession. And in part because of the steps we took and primarily because of their courage and determination and hard work, they're in a better place now. <p>But the last thing they're looking for is for us to go back to the same kind of crisis situations that we've had in the past. And the single most important thing we can do to prevent that is for Congress to pass a budget, without drama, that puts us on a sound path for growth, jobs, better wages, better incomes. <p>Now, look, it's never been easy to get 535 people here in Washington to agree on anything. And budget battles and debates, those are as old as the Republic. It's even harder when you have divided Government. And right now you've got Republicans controlling the House of Representatives and Democrats controlling the Senate, Democrat in the White House. So this is always going to be tough. <p>Having said that, I cannot remember a time when one faction of one party promises economic chaos if it can't get a hundred percent of what it wants. That's never happened before. But that's what's happening right now. <p>You have some Republicans in the House of Representatives who are promising to shut down the Government at the end of this month if they can't shut down the Affordable Care Act. And if that scheme doesn't work, some have suggested they won't pay the very bills that Congressmen&mdash;Congress has already run up, which would cause America to default on its debt for the first time in our history and would create massive economic turmoil. Interest rates on ordinary people would shoot up. Those kinds of actions are the kinds of actions that we don't need. <p>The last time this same crew threatened this course of action back in 2011, even the mere suggestion of default slowed our economic growth. Everybody here remembers that. It wasn't that long ago. <p>Now, keep in mind, initially, the whole argument was we're going to do this because we want to reduce our debt. That doesn't seem to be the focus now. Now the focus is on Obamacare. So let's put this in perspective. The Affordable Care Act has been the law for 3&frac12; years now. It passed both Houses of Congress. The Supreme Court ruled it constitutional. It was an issue in last year's election, and the candidate who called for repeal lost. [<i>Laughter</i>] The Republicans in the House have tried to repeal or sabotage it about 40 times. They've failed every time. <p>Meanwhile, the law has already helped millions of Americans: young people who were able to stay on their parent's plan up until the age of 26; seniors who are getting additional discounts on their prescription drugs; ordinary families and small businesses that are getting rebates from insurance companies because now insurance companies have to actually spend money on people's care instead of on administrative costs and CEO bonuses. <p>A lot of the horror stories that were predicted about how this was going to shoot rates way up and there were going to be death panels and all that stuff&mdash;none of that stuff has happened. And in 2 weeks, the Affordable Care Act is going to help millions of more people. And there's no serious evidence that the law&mdash;which has helped to keep down the rise in health care costs to their lowest level in 50 years&mdash;is holding back economic growth. <p>So repealing the Affordable Care Act, making sure that 30 million people don't get health insurance and people with preexisting conditions continue to be locked out of the health insurance market, that's not an agenda for economic growth. You're not going to meet an economist who says that that's the number-one priority in terms of boosting growth and jobs in this country&mdash;at least, not a serious economist. <p>And I understand I will never convince some Republicans about the merits of Obamacare. I understand that. And I'm more than willing to work with them where they've got specific suggestions that they can show will make our health care system work better. Remember, initially, this was, like, repeal and replace, and the replace thing has kind of gone off to the wayside. Now it's just repeal. <p>But the larger point is, after all that we've been through these past 5 years, after all the work Americans like those standing behind me have done to come back from the depths of a crisis, are some of these folks really so beholden to one extreme wing of their party that they're willing to tank the entire economy just because they can't get their way on this issue? Are they really willing to hurt people just to score political points? I hope not. <p>But in case there's any confusion, I will not negotiate over whether or not America keeps its word and meets its obligations. I will not negotiate over the full faith and credit of the United States. This country has worked too hard for too long to dig out of a crisis just to see their elected representatives here in Washington purposely cause another crisis. <p>Let's stop the threats. Let's stop the political posturing. Let's keep our Government open. Let's pay our bills on time. Let's pass a budget. Let's work together to do what the American people sent us here to do: create jobs, grow our economy, expand opportunity. That's what we need to do. <p>And as far as the budget goes, it's time for responsible Republicans who share these goals&mdash;and there are a number of folks out there who, I think, are decent folks, I've got some disagreements with them on some issues, but I think genuinely want to see the economy grow and want what's best for the American people&mdash;it's time for those Republicans to step up, and they've got to decide what they want to prioritize. <p>Originally, they said they wanted deficit reduction. As I said before, our deficits are falling fast. The only way to make further long-term progress on deficit reduction that doesn't slow growth is with a balanced plan that includes closing tax loopholes that benefit corporations and the wealthiest Americans at the expense of the middle class. That's the only way to do it. <p>They said that they wanted entitlement reform, but their leaders haven't put forward serious ideas that wouldn't devastate Medicare or Social Security. And I've put forward ideas for sensible reforms to Medicare and Social Security and haven't gotten a lot of feedback yet. <p>They said that they wanted tax reform. Remember? This was just a few months ago. They said, well, this is going to be one of our top priorities: tax reform. Six weeks ago, I put forward a plan that serious people in both parties should be able to support, a deal that lowers the corporate tax rate for businesses and manufacturers, simplifies it for small-business owners, as long as we use some of the money that we save to invest in the infrastructure our businesses need to create more good jobs and good wages for middle class folks who work at these businesses. My position is, if folks in this town want a grand bargain, how about a grand bargain for middle class jobs? So I put forward ideas for tax reform; haven't heard back from them yet. <p>Now, Congress has a couple of weeks to get this done. If they're focused on what the American people care about&mdash;faster growth, more jobs, better future for our kids&mdash;then I'm confident it will happen. And once we're done with the budget, let's focus on the other things that we know can make a difference for middle class families: lowering the cost of college, finishing the job of immigration reform, taking up the work of tax reform to make the system fairer, and promoting more investment in the United States. <p>If we follow the strategy I'm laying out for our entire economy&mdash;and if Washington will just act with the same urgency and common purpose that we felt 5 years ago&mdash;then our economy will be stronger a year from now, 5 years from now, a decade from now. <p>That's my priority. All these folks standing behind me and everybody out there who's listening, that's my priority. I've run my last election. My only interest at this point is making sure that the economy is moving the way it needs to so that we've got the kind of broad-based growth that has always been the hallmark of this country. <p>And as long as I've got the privilege of serving as your President, I will spend every moment of every day I have left fighting to restore security and opportunity for the middle class and to give everyone who works hard a chance to get ahead. <p>Thank you, everybody. And God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"202" "\"Thank you, everybody. Well, Jim, thank you for the introduction. Thanks to Dave and Andrew and John, all the men and women of the Business Roundtable. I've had a chance to not only present before this body before, but many of you have been doing wonderful work with the administration on a whole range of issues. And the point that Jim just made about the commitment that some of the companies here have made in hiring and promoting our returning veterans is extraordinary. And so we're very, very grateful for that. <p>Last time I was here in December, I told you&mdash;once the mikes were working&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that I'm hugely invested in your success, because this room represents not only an enormous amount of economic output, but also represents the hopes and dreams of people who are working very hard trying to make a living, small businesses who are supplying large companies like yours. When you succeed, when you're doing well, when you're competitive at a global scale, then America can do well also. And so we want to be a consistent partner with you on a whole range of issues, and we have. <p>If you think about where we were 5 years ago&mdash;obviously, we're marking the fifth anniversary of the collapse of Lehman's, and that triggered the worst financial crisis and then, ultimately, worst economic crisis that we've seen in our lifetimes&mdash;I think it's fair to say that we've come a long way. <p>At that point, the auto industry was flatlining. You had the entire financial sector locked up. A number of banks were in deep trouble. And most acutely for ordinary families all across this country, they were losing jobs, losing homes, losing their life savings. And there was a genuine fear across the board that we might not be able to pull out way out of it. <p>And we have. Thanks to the grit and resilience of the American people, thanks to some outstanding work that's been done by many of your companies, we are in a much stronger position now than when we were then. And we've created now 7&frac12; million new jobs in the private sector. Many of your companies have added to your payrolls. And that's made a huge difference. <p>We've seen quarters of consecutive growth that are still too slow, not as fast as we'd like, but relative to other developed countries around the world, as we've actually fared a lot better. The housing market has begun to recover. Exports are at record highs. We are producing more energy than we ever have before. And although in a world energy market, for us to say that we're entirely energy independent is a little bit of a misnomer. What's absolutely true is, is that the geopolitics of energy have shifted, and that's strengthened our manufacturing base here and made it a much more attractive place for us to invest. <p>The deficits have been coming down at the fastest rate since World War II. The deficit has been cut in half since I came into office. Health care costs, which were and continue to be a major source of concern, are increasing at the slowest rate in 50 years. And for many of you in terms of your bottom lines, employer-based health care plans have gone up at about a third of what they were going up when I first took office. <p>And so there's a lot of bright spots in the economy; a lot of progress has been made and a lot of good news to report. But I think what we all recognize is, we're not where we need to be yet. We've still got a lot of work to do. And we know what it is that we need to do. We know that if we implement immigration reform, that that can add potentially a trillion dollars to our economy and that we will continue to attract the best and brightest talent around the world. <p>We know that we can do even more when it comes to exports, which is why I'm out there negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership and now a transatlantic trade partnership that will allow us to create a high standard, enforceable, meaningful trade agreement with essentially two-thirds of the world markets, which is going to be incredibly powerful for American companies who, up until this point, have often been locked out of those markets. <p>We know that we've still got to make a lot of progress when it comes to our education system. And I want to thank the BRT because you've worked with us on issues like creating a common cause&mdash;a common core that ensures that every young person in America has the opportunity to get prepared for the kinds of jobs that are going to exist in the 21st century. And I'm going to be talking to all of you a lot to work with us in making college much more affordable, because just as we've had to take a hard look at what we can do to start bringing down health care costs, we've also got to start taking a hard look at what we're going to do to bring down college costs. We now have over a trillion dollars' worth of student loan debt that is hampering the economy, preventing young people from buying homes, starting families, and spending money buying your products. <p>The good news is that every one of the challenges that we confront, every one of the barriers&mdash;whether it's education, immigration, infrastructure&mdash;that prevent us from being as competitive as we could be, they're all solvable. We have good ideas. There's actually pretty good consensus in terms of how we might move forward. The problem is right now that this town, Washington, is locked up. And we are not seeing the kind of progress that we should on these issues. <p>So immigration is the most obvious example. We have bipartisan agreement; we got a bill passed out of the Senate. It's sitting there in the House, and if Speaker Boehner called that bill today, it would pass. We've got a majority of the House of Representatives that's prepared to vote for it, and we could transform our immigration system in a way that would be really good for your companies and really good for our economy. <p>The reason it's not happening is because there's a small faction that insists that our tradition as a nation of laws, but also a nation of immigrants somehow is un-American, and they oppose it. And that duplicates itself on a whole range of these issues. And now, in the next several weeks, it's going to manifest itself in what is going to be probably the most critical debate about our economy over the next several months, and that is what we do about our budget. So let me just speak very briefly to that issue. <p>As I said before, our deficits are coming down very fast. In fact, the IMF and other international organizations that had cautioned us previously about our deficits are actually now concerned that we're bringing our deficits down too fast. That's the assessment of the economists. On the current trajectory that we're on and if we were to pass the budget that I put forward, our deficits would continue to go down. And we would have a deficit-to-GDP ratio below 3 percent, which is typically the standard at which it's sustainable. <p>Now, in order for us to do that we've got to do a couple of things. Number one, we've got to continue to be tightfisted when it comes to spending on things we don't need. We've got to continue to streamline Government. We've got to continue to cut out waste. And there's waste to be had, and there are programs that don't work or used to work and are now obsolete and we should eliminate. And we've identified a whole range of programs that we want to eliminate and programs that we'd like to consolidate. <p>But what is also true is, is that if we're going to be honest about our debt and our deficits, our real problem is the long term, not the short term. We're not overspending on education. We're not overspending on research and development. We're not overspending on helping the disabled. Those things have all been flat for a long time or are coming down. Our challenge has to do with our long-term entitlement programs and mostly have to do with our health care costs. <p>So the fact that the Affordable Care Act has been put into place and that many of you are taking steps within your own companies, we're seeing health care costs come down. We're still going to have to do a little bit more, because the population is aging and demographics means that people are going to be using more health care costs and the Government is going to have to grapple with that. That's a long term challenge. <p>The budget I put forward actually proposes some smart fixes on Medicare, some smart fixes on Medicaid, and creates a sustainable path where we continue to invest in the things we need to grow&mdash;education, infrastructure, research and development&mdash;deals with our long-term structural deficits that arise out of entitlements, and put us in a strong position for decades to come. <p>The problem we have right now is that, again, that same faction in Congress is no longer talking about debt and deficits when it comes to resolving the budget. Initially, this was an argument about how much we spend on discretionary spending, how much do we spend on defense; you could sit down across the table, try to negotiate some numbers. That's no longer the argument. What we now have is a ideological fight that's been mounted in the House of Representatives that says, we're not going to pass a budget and we will threaten a Government shutdown unless we repeal the Affordable Care Act. <p>We have not seen this in the past that a budget is contingent on us eliminating a program that was voted on, passed by both Chambers of Congress, ruled constitutional by the Supreme Court, is 2 weeks from being fully implemented, and that helps 30 million people finally get health care coverage. We've never seen that become the issue around a budget battle. And so that's a&mdash;right now the primary roadblock to resolving the budget. <p>What's worse, that same faction has said, if we can't succeed in shutting the Government down and leveraging that to eliminate the Affordable Care Act, we may be prepared to let the Government default on our debt. <p>Now, this debt ceiling&mdash;I just want to remind people in case you haven't been keeping up&mdash;raising the debt ceiling, which has been done over a hundred times, does not increase our debt; it does not somehow promote profligacy. All it does is it says you got to pay the bills that you've already racked up, Congress. It's a basic function of making sure that the full faith and credit of the United States is preserved. <p>And I've heard people say, well, in the past, there have been negotiations around raising the debt ceiling. It's always a tough vote, because the average person thinks raising the debt ceiling must mean that we're running up our debt, so people don't like to vote on it, and, typically, there's some gamesmanship in terms of making the President's party shoulder the burden of raising the&mdash;taking the vote. And then there's some political campaign later that smacks him around for saying, Joe Smith voted to raise the debt ceiling by $2 trillion. And it sounds terrible, and it's a fun talking point for politics, but it always gets done. <p>And if there is a budget package that includes the debt ceiling vote, it's not the debt ceiling that is driving the negotiations, it's just, it's stuck into the budget negotiations, because if you're going to take a bunch of tough votes anyway, you might as well go ahead and stick that in there. <p>You have never seen in the history of the United States the debt ceiling or the threat of not raising the debt ceiling being used to extort a President or a governing party, and trying to force issues that have nothing to do with the budget and have nothing to do with the debt. <p>So here's where we are&mdash;and I think this is the bottom line, and I want to make sure everybody is clear here&mdash;I have presented a budget that deals with&mdash;continues to deal with&mdash;our deficit effectively. I am prepared to work with Democrats and Republicans to deal with our long-term entitlement issues. And I am prepared to look at priorities that the Republicans think we should be promoting and priorities that they think we should be&mdash;we shouldn't be promoting. So I'm happy to negotiate with them around the budget, just as I've done in the past. <p>What I will not do is to create a habit, a pattern, whereby the full faith and credit of the United States ends up being a bargaining chip to set policy. It's irresponsible. The last time we did this in 2011, we had negative growth at a time when the recovery was just trying to take off. And it would fundamentally change how American government functions. <p>And if you doubt that, just flip the script for a second and imagine a situation in which a Democratic Speaker said to a Republican President, I'm not going to increase the debt ceiling unless you increase corporate taxes by 20 percent. And if you don't do it, we'll default on the debt and cause a worldwide financial crisis. Even though that Democratic Speaker didn't have the votes to force through that particular piece of legislation, they would simply say, we will blow the whole thing up unless you do what I want. That can't be a recipe for governing. <p>And I have responsibilities at this point not just to the current generation, but to future generations, and we're not going to set up a situation where the full faith and credit of the United States is put on the table every year or every year and a half and we go through some sort of terrifying financial brinksmanship because of some ideological arguments that people are having about some particular issue of the day. We're not going to do that. <p>So the good news is that we can raise the debt ceiling tomorrow just by a simple vote in each Chamber and set that aside, and then we can have a serious argument about the budget. And there are significant differences still between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to the budget. <p>But it is going to be important for all of you, I think, over the next several weeks, to understand what's at stake and to make sure that you are using your influence in whatever way you can to get back to what's&mdash;what used to be called regular order around here: doing things in a way that reflect the genuine, messy negotiations of democracy, but did not promise apocalypse every 3 months. And I think this is the time for us to say once and for all, we can't afford these kinds of plays. <p>I know the American people are tired of it. I'm tired of it, and I suspect you're tired of it, too, because it's pretty hard to plan your businesses when these kinds of things are looming at any given moment. <p>So with that, let me stop and let me open it up for questions.\" "
"203" "\"<i>The President</i>. Everybody, please have a seat. Have a seat. Well, it is good to see all of you. I know that we've got a&mdash;&mdash; <p>[<i>At this point, Export Council Chairman W. James McNerney, Jr., reached over and turned on the President's microphone</i>]. <p><i>The President.</i> &mdash;&mdash;whoops, All right. <p><i>Mr. McNerney</i>. There you go. <p><i>The President</i>. I know that we've got a few new members, in fact, some folks that were just appointed and immediately got to work. And so we're thrilled to see all of you. And then there are the grizzled veterans of the Export Council&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;although you don't look grizzled. You guys look great. <p>Obviously, I want to thank Jim and Ursula at the outset for their outstanding leadership in this entire process. This week marks the fifth anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers and an incredible financial crisis that devastated not just the financial sector, but the entire economy, and people lost jobs and homes and savings. <p>And for the last 5 years, we have worked our way back because of the incredible grit and resilience of the American people, because the outstanding dynamism of our business sectors, because of, I think, some timely work on the part of this administration and other agencies to make sure that we were responsive to the immediate needs of the American people, but also looking at how we can start initiating some structural changes that are going to make a difference over the long term and rebuild our economy. <p>We're not where we need to be yet. But with 7&frac12; million new jobs created in the private sector, with the housing market beginning to recover, with our energy transformation continuing in a way that, I think, many people would not have anticipated 20 years ago, where we're now at a point where domestic production is actually starting to exceed imports&mdash;across all these fronts, there are some very positive pieces of news. But I tell you, one of the biggest bright spots in our economy has been exports: the fact that \\"Made in America\\" means something and has provided a boost to our domestic economy and has reminded the world just how competitive we are. <p>This has been a top priority from the start. Part of the reason we set up this Export Council was to make sure that we were in a position to meet our goal of doubling exports during the course of a fairly short period of time. And we now sell more goods overseas than ever before. <p>Jason, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think our current account deficit and trade deficits have narrowed as significantly as we've seen in a very long time. Now, part of that is because we're importing less foreign oil and increasing domestic production, but a lot of it is because we're selling a lot of great products all around the world. And this Council has done a great job in helping to guide our policies. <p>We've got large businesses; we've got small businesses; we've got medium-sized businesses. We've got services as well as manufacturers. And your input has been enormously important in this entire process. <p>Part of what we've seen is a continued transformation in American business to become more competitive and more productive. And I would be remiss to say, since it's in the news quite a bit&mdash;to note that one of the reasons our businesses are more competitive is because health care costs have actually stabilized relative to what we had been seeing in previous years. Just an interesting statistic here for folks who may be interested. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Thanks in part to the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;the cost of health care is now growing at the slowest rate in 50 years. Employer-based health care costs are growing at about one-third of the rate of a decade ago. And just yesterday CMS estimated that health care spending grew at its second slowest rate ever in 2012, will grow at its third slowest rate ever in 2013, grew at its slowest rate in 2011. So the 3 years since Obamacare passed, we've seen the slowest growth in health care costs on record. <p>Now, I think this is critically important to recognize because one of the huge competitive disadvantages that our businesses have had is that we&mdash;American businesses&mdash;oftentimes are shouldering health care costs that their competitors are not, because they've had a more efficient, more effective system. And so for us&mdash;and when we passed the Affordable Care Act, by the way, there were all kinds of arguments about how all the cost savings weren't very meaningful and weren't going to do a lot and we weren't really bending the cost curve. And well, it turns out actually a lot of what we've done is starting to bear real fruit, and it has an impact on the bottom lines of American businesses as well as the American people. <p>So if the current trends hold&mdash;and all estimates are that, in fact, they will&mdash;this is not just a byproduct of or hangover from the recession&mdash;we're going to see a continuing slowing of increases in health care costs. That's going to boost our exports. <p>Now, we can still do more when it comes to exports, and thanks in part to new trade deals that I've signed as well as obviously really great products and services that you've all designed, America now exports more to the rest of the world than ever before. We're on track to export even more this year. Last year, $1 billion in exports supported nearly 50,000 jobs&mdash;or 5,000 jobs in the United States. So for every billion dollars that we sell, that's 5,000 new jobs right here in the United States. <p>And so we're really focused on how do we keep that momentum going. Our new Trade Rep, our new Ambassador, Michael Froman, who many of you have had a chance to work with when he was in the White House, is in the process of trying to complete negotiations around a Trans-Pacific Partnership. You're talking about the largest, most dynamic, fastest growing market in the world. <p>And because of some incredibly hard work by Michael and the previous Trade Representative, Ron Kirk, we are very far along in trying to get that deal done: raising standards; opening up markets that previously have been closed; getting the kinds of protections, like IPR protections, that are so important to American businesses since we typically are the best innovators; making sure that services are allowed to compete in many of these markets, because we do services better than anybody else and those are markets that oftentimes are the most parochial, most encumbered by regulation and have most frequently been closed. <p>So we're going to be pushing ahead not only on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but we also have now our transatlantic effort, where we can see if we can enhance what is already robust trade with Europe. It amounts to the largest trading relationship in the world by far, and we think we can do even better. And so we're going to be moving on that front as well. <p>We're going to need trade promotion authority through Congress. And this is an area where, so far at least, Mitch McConnell says he's for it, and that's good. And so we may be able to get some good bipartisan support to get that done. <p>But let me just make a couple of closing comments about how important this Export Council has been. One thing that I think a lot of people aren't aware of, at least until they get involved in policymaking around exports, is tourism is an export. When foreign visitors come here and spend money, that is tallied as a U.S. export. And thanks to people like Bob Iger at Walt Disney and others, we have made enormous progress over the last several years in boosting tourism in the United States, making it easier for foreign visitors to get visas, making it easier for them to come here and enjoy the incredible attractions that we have here in the United States. That's making a big difference. A lot of the ideas about how we could do that were generated from, initially, these efforts. <p>So I use that as an example just to say that this is not a&mdash;just a bunch of show horses here, these are some work horses. And I believe it's fair to say&mdash;and I think Jim and Ursula will confirm&mdash;that if any of you have good ideas about how we can further promote exports, put them on the table. You will find an administration that is ready and willing to put their shoulder behind the wheel to actually get it done. <p>And I know that our new Secretary of Commerce, Penny Pritzker, who is coming directly from the business world, understands how important it is for us to be able to execute and not just generate a bunch of white papers that get filed off in some dusty file somewhere. We want to make sure that we're moving on all fronts very aggressively. <p>So with that, I just want to say how much I appreciate all your participation. I want to say a&mdash;make a special note to some of the small businesses that have been represented here, because what we've seen is that when small and medium-sized businesses can cut through the redtape and understand how to export, actually they can compete pretty well. And that's an area where we can make some significant progress. <p>Obviously, big companies like Xerox or Boeing, we want to keep on growing them because small businesses are up and down the supply chain and are&mdash;when we sell a bunch of airplanes, a lot of small businesses and medium-sized businesses are benefiting from that as well. <p>But I am very enthusiastic about this. I think Jim, at least, will confirm that I'm happy to go out and make sales. I'm expecting a gold watch&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;from Boeing at the end of my Presidency because I know that I'm on the list of top salesmen at Boeing. And that applies to all of you. <p>And I also notice that we've got some wonderful elected officials here, folks like Governor Fallin. Part of what we want to do is also coordinate State and Federal and local efforts, because right now our competitors&mdash;the Germanys, a lot of the European countries&mdash;they have a very tight, very aggressive, very well-coordinated effort to make sales around the world. Sometimes, because we're so big and, frankly, we've been such a dominant economy for a long time, that our sales pitches and efforts have been a little more scattered and a little more diffuse. <p>So one of the functions that this Export Council can serve is as a clearinghouse and a coordinating mechanism to make sure that if Oklahoma is trying to pitch something or help one of their businesses that they are in touch with Federal counterparts and they can do a much more effective job. All right? <p>So what I think we're going to do now is we're going to clear out the press. I'm going to have a chance to come around and say hello to everybody and say thank you. And then the conversation will continue. All right?\" "
"204" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Missouri! Everybody give Jordan a big round of applause. <p>I just want to say about Jordan&mdash;third generation Ford employee&mdash;she's going to school during the week, works at the plant on the weekends, getting a degree in business management and will be taking Alan's place running the company in about&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I don't know&mdash;oh, it may take a few years. But we're so proud of her. And congratulations for everything that she represents. When you see young people like that who are working so hard, making something of themselves, and are rooted in a community like this one, it really makes you proud. <p>Before I get started, there are a couple other folks that I want to introduce; they're are working for you day in, day out. First of all, your outstanding Governor, Jay Nixon, and his wife Georganne. The plant might not have been here had it not been for the great work of Jay. So that's important to know. <p>We've got my outstanding Secretary of Health and Human Services, former Governor of Kansas, Kathleen Sebelius is in the house. She basically just came because her son and his fiancee are here. [<i>Laughter</i>] But we're glad she's here. <p>One of my greatest friends and just a tough, smart, dedicated public servant, Senator Claire McCaskill is here. Give Claire a big round of applause. Your former mayor, preacher, can do everything, Emanuel Cleaver is in the house. Current mayor of Kansas City, Sly James is here. Mayor of Kansas City, Kansas, Mark Holland is here. And the mayor right here in Liberty, Lyndell Brenton and his lovely wife Roxann are here. Where are they? There they are. <p>Now, when I said I was flying into Kansas City to see an incredible success story in action, I did not think I was going to be talking about the Chiefs. [<i>Applause</i>] Before you get carried away, I just want to point out that the Bears are 2-0. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> I'm just saying. [<i>Laughter</i>] And we're actually able to pass more than 10 yards. [<i>Laughter</i>] Just a little trash-talking. We'll see how we're looking at the end of the season. <p>I want to give special thanks to Ford's CEO. This is one of our outstanding business leaders, has helped to lead Ford to be the number-one automaker in the United States of America, Alan Mulally is here. And we're very proud of him. <p>It doesn't matter if you've got an outstanding CEO if you don't have outstanding workers. And the President of Local 249, Jeff Wright, is here. Your launch manager, Todd Jaranowski, I really like because he is a Bears and a Sox fan. Come on, give Todd a big round of applause. And I very much appreciate him and some of the other folks showing me around this new stamping plant right here. <p>Now, you may not be aware of this, but you and I have a little history together. I may roll in a Cadillac these days&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;no, no, but it's not my car, it's&mdash;I'm just&mdash;I'm renting, just like my house. [<i>Laughter</i>] The lease runs out in about 3&frac12; years. [<i>Laughter</i>] But before that, I was driving around in a 2008 Ford Escape. It came right off these assembly lines. Some of you might have been involved in building it. It was a great car. Problem is, I got Secret Service about a month after I bought the car, so I've only got 2,000 miles on it. [<i>Laughter</i>] It is in mint condition. <p>So I want to say thank you for building my car. But I also came here to talk about what's got to be the number-one priority in this country, and that is growing our economy, creating new jobs, and making sure that everyone who works hard in America has a chance to get ahead. It's our number-one priority. <p>Now, some of you remember, 5 years ago, a financial crisis hit Wall Street. It then turned into a devastating recession on Main Street, and it came close to being another Great Depression. By the time I took office, the economy was shrinking at a rate of 8 percent a year. Unprecedented. Our businesses were shedding 800,000 jobs a month. And you had this perfect storm, and millions of Americans lost their jobs, their homes, their savings they had been working a lifetime to get. <p>But what the recession also showed was the fact that for decades, middle class families had been working harder and harder just to get by, hadn't seen their incomes go up, hadn't seen their wages go up. Manufacturing was moving overseas. And so what built our middle class had been buckling, had been weakening. <p>And I think if you ask most Americans when the economic crisis hit, they might not date it to Lehman's Brothers collapsing. They'd talk to you about when they got a pink slip that they didn't expect or the bank took away their home or they didn't have health insurance or maybe they were told the plant was shutting down and the assembly line was going quiet. Those were tough times. <p>Five years ago, plants like this one were closing their doors. And the day I stepped into the Oval Office, the American auto industry, which is the heartbeat of American manufacturing&mdash;heartbeat of manufacturing&mdash;the auto industry was flatlining. Ford was standing on its own two feet, had made some smart decisions, but Alan will tell you, if GM and Chrysler had gone down, suppliers would go down; dealers would have gone down. And all of that would have had a profound impact on Ford. <p>I refused to let that happen. So we worked with labor, and we worked with management. Everybody had to make some sacrifices. Everybody put some skin in the game. We bet on the American worker. We bet on you. And today, that bet has paid off because the American auto industry has come roaring back. <p>The Big Three are all profitable, hiring new workers. You're not just building more cars, you're building better cars, better trucks. Look at what's going on right here at the plant. The new F-150 is built tougher than ever, more fuel efficient than ever. You've got trouble making them fast enough. You had to bring on a third shift of 900 workers just to keep up with demand. <p>And because Ford invested $1.1 billion in this plant, pretty soon, 1,100 more new workers will be joining you on these assembly lines in good, union jobs, building Ford Transit. <p>So more jobs building cars, that means more jobs for suppliers. It means more jobs for distributors. It means more jobs for the folks who own the restaurant here in town or the bar, depending on&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. It has an impact on your tax base. It has an impact on the teacher who teaches your kids, the first responder who keeps you safe. All those people are impacted by your success. <p>And that fundamental idea that when everybody is doing&mdash;when some of us are doing well, it's okay, but when everybody has got a stake, that's when things really start rolling, that's at the heart of every decision I've made as President. Because when the middle class does better, we all do better. Shareholders do better. CEOs do better. Workers do better. Everybody does better. <p>So in the depths of the crisis, we passed a Recovery Act to make sure that we put a floor below which this country couldn't fall. We put money in folks' pockets with tax breaks. We made sure that people were rebuilding roads and bridges, keeping things going, helping to keep teachers and firefighters and cops on the job. Today, 3&frac12; years later, our businesses have added 7&frac12; million new jobs&mdash;7&frac12; million new jobs. <p>We helped responsible homeowners stay in their homes, won one of the biggest settlements in history on behalf of people who had wrongfully lost their homes because banks hadn't done things right. Today, our housing market is healing. <p>We took on a Tax Code that was too skewed towards the wealthy. We gave tax cuts, locked them in for 98 percent of families. We asked those in the top 2 percent to pay a little bit more. Today, middle class tax rates are near their alltime low. The deficits are falling at the fastest rate since World War II. That's what we did. <p>We invested in new American technologies to end our addiction to foreign oil. Today, we're generating more renewable energy than ever before, produce more natural gas than anybody in the world. We're about to produce more of our own oil than we buy from overseas for the first time in nearly 20 years. <p>And we took on a broken health care system. And in less than 2 weeks, millions of Americans who have been locked out of the insurance market are finally going to be able to get quality health care. Out of every 10 Americans who are currently uninsured, 6 out of those 10 are going to be able to get covered for less than a hundred dollars a month, less than your cell phone bill. <p>So we've been working, just like you've been working, over these last 4&frac12; years. We've cleared away the rubble from the crisis. We've started to lay a new foundation for economic growth, a new foundation for prosperity. And everybody here, we all had to make some adjustments. I'm assuming some folks had to tighten their belts, get rid of some debt, focus on things that really matter, cut out some things you didn't need. <p>We've shown the world that the American people are tough, they're resilient. The only thing built tougher than Ford trucks are American workers, the American people. That's what we've shown. <p>All right, so that's the good news. But any working person, any middle class family, they'll tell you we're not yet where we need to be. The economy is growing, but it needs to grow faster. We're producing jobs, but we need to create more jobs and more good-paying jobs. We've got to make sure that we're rebuilding an economy that doesn't work from the top down, works from the middle out; that gives ladder of opportunity to folks who still don't have a job. <p>We've got to make sure that workers are sharing in growth and productivity. Right now, even though businesses are creating jobs, the top 1 percent took home 20 percent of the Nation's income last year. The average worker barely saw a raise. <p><i>Audience member.</i> That's not fair. <p><i>The President.</i> It ain't fair; it ain't right. <p>So in many ways, the trends that have taken hold over the past few years of a winner-take-all economy, a few folks at the top doing better and better and better, everybody else treading water or losing ground, that's not a model that we want. And it's been made worse by this recession. <p>So what I've been doing over the last couple months, I've been visiting towns like Liberty, traveling all across the country talking about what we need to do to reverse those trends, make sure, we've got a better bargain for middle class America: good jobs that pay good wages, an education that prepares our kids for a global economy, a home that is secure, affordable health care that is there when you get sick, a secure retirement even if you're not rich&mdash;all those things that make for a secure life so you can raise your kids and have confidence that they're going to do better than you did. That's what I'm focused on. That's what you're focused on. That's what Congress should be focused on. <p>Which brings me to the current situation. [<i>Laughter</i>] Let me talk a little bit about what's going on back in Washington. Right now Congress is in the middle of a budget debate. Now, there's nothing new about that. Every year Congress has got to pass a budget, and it's always a contentious process. But right now our recovery still needs to build more strength, so it's important that we get it right in Washington, because even though our success as a country is ultimately going to depend on great businesses like Ford, hard workers like you, Government has to do some things. <p>Congress has to pass a budget to make sure our education system works and prepares our kids and our workers for the global economy. If we're going to rebuild our roads, our bridges, our airports, our ports, Government's got to be involved in that. If we're going to have scientific research and development&mdash;I was looking at all these newfangled pieces of equipment here&mdash;some of the things that allowed the efficiencies of this plant originated in laboratories and scientists doing work on the Government's dime. That's how we always maintain our cutting edge. These are things that help us grow. These are help&mdash;things that help the private sector succeed. <p>So when people tell you somehow Government is irrelevant, no, everything we do has some connection to making sure that we, collectively, as a democracy, are making some smart investments in the future. That's how it's always been. <p>So what Congress is doing right now is important. Unfortunately, right now the debate that's going on in Congress is not meeting the test of helping middle class families. It's just, they're not focused on you. They're focused on politics. They're focused on trying to mess with me. [<i>Laughter</i>] They're not focused on you. [<i>Applause</i>] They're not focused on you. <p>So there are two deadlines coming up that Congress has to meet. And I want folks to pay attention to this. Congress has to meet two deadlines, and they're coming up pretty quick. <p>The first deadline: The most basic constitutional duty Congress has is to pass a budget. That's Congress 101. If they don't pass a budget by September 30&mdash;what's the date today? The 20th. All right, so if Congress doesn't pass a budget in 10 days, a week from Monday, the Government will shut down. A Government shutdown shuts down many services that the American people rely on. <p>This is not abstract. Hundreds of thousands of Americans will not be allowed to go to work. Our men and women in uniform, even those deployed overseas, won't get their paychecks on time. Small businesses, they won't get their loans processed. Now, none of that has to happen, as long as Congress passes a budget. Number one: passing a budget. <p>Number two, in the next few weeks, Congress must vote to allow the Department of the Treasury to pay America's bills. All right? Our Treasury Department, that's where we take in money and we pay it, right? Real simple. This is usually done with a simple, routine vote to raise what's called the debt ceiling. If you don't raise the debt ceiling, America can't pay its bills. <p>Since the 1950s, Congress has always passed it. Every President has signed it&mdash;Democrats, Republicans, Ronald Reagan&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;Lyndon Johnson&mdash;it doesn't matter. This is just a routine thing that you've got to do so that Treasury can pay the bills. If Congress doesn't pass this debt ceiling in the next few weeks, the United States will default on its obligations. That's never happened in American history. Basically, America becomes a deadbeat. <p>If the world sees America not paying its bills, then they will not buy debt, Treasury bills, from the United States, or if they do, they'll do it at much higher interest rates. That means somebody wanting to buy an F-150 will have to pay much higher interest rates eventually, which means you will sell less cars. That's just one example of how profoundly destructive this could be. This is not some abstract thing. <p>And this is important: Raising the debt ceiling is not the same as approving more spending, any more than making your monthly payment adds to the total cost of your truck. You don't say, well, I'm not going to pay my bill, my note for my truck because I'm going to save money. No, you're not saving money. You already bought the truck, right? [<i>Laughter</i>] You have to pay the bills. You're not saving money. You might have decided at the front end not to buy the truck, but once you've bought the truck, you can't say you're saving money just by not paying the bills. Does that make sense? <p>So raising the debt ceiling, it doesn't cost a dime. It does not add a penny to our deficits. All it says is, you've got to pay for what Congress already said we're spending money on. If you don't do it, we could have another financial crisis. <p>And the fact is&mdash;I know a lot of people are concerned about deficits&mdash;our deficits are now coming down so quickly that by the end of this year, we will have cut them in more than half since I took office&mdash;cut deficits in half. <p>So I just want to break this down one more time. I go into a Ford dealership. I drive off with a new F-150. Unless I paid cash, I've still got to pay for it each month. I can't just say, you know, I'm not going to make my car payment this month. That's what Congress is threatening to do, just saying, I'm not going to pay the bills. There are consequences to that. The bill collector starts calling you, right? Your credit goes south, and you've got all kinds of problems. Same is true for a country. <p>So if we don't raise the debt ceiling, we're deadbeats. \\"If we fail to increase the debt limit, we would send our economy into a tailspin\\"&mdash;that's a quote, by the way, what I just said. You know who said it? The Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner. The Republican Speaker has said if we don't pay our bills, we'll have an economic tailspin. So this is not just my opinion, this is everybody's opinion. <p>All right. Now, why haven't we already gotten it done if it's such a simple thing? Everybody is nodding; they're all, like, yes, why didn't we already get this done? Democrats and some reasonable Republicans in Congress are willing to raise the debt ceiling and pass a sensible budget. And I want to work with Democrats and Republicans to do just that. Claire McCaskill, she's ready to do it. Congressman Cleaver, he's ready to do it. And if we just pass the budget, raise the debt ceiling, we can get back to focusing on growing this economy and creating jobs, educating our kids&mdash;all the things we got to do. <p>Unfortunately, there is a faction on the far right of the Republican Party right now&mdash;it's not everybody, but it's a pretty big faction&mdash;who have convinced their leadership to threaten a Government shutdown and potentially threaten to not raise the debt ceiling if they can't shut off the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. <p>Now, think about this. They're not talking now about spending cuts. They're not talking about entitlement reform. They're not talking about any of that. Now they're talking about something that has nothing to do with the budget. Right? They're actually willing to plunge America into default if we can't defund the Affordable Care Act. <p>Now, let's put this in perspective. The Affordable Care Act has been into law for 3&frac12; years. It passed both Houses of Congress. The Supreme Court ruled it constitutional. It was an issue in last year's elections. The guy who was running against me said he was going to repeal it. We won. The&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. So the voters were pretty clear on this. <p>And then, Republicans in Congress, they've tried to repeal or sabotage this; more than 40 times they've had these repeal votes. Every time they fail. This law that is in place is already providing people benefits. It's not holding back economic growth, it's helping millions of Americans, including some of you or your family members that you may not be aware of. <p>You can keep your kid on your own health insurance plan&mdash;somebody is raising their hand right here&mdash;until they're 26, because of the Affordable Care Act, which is one of the main reasons why the number of uninsured among young people has gone down over the last 3 years. <p>Seniors, they are benefiting right now from discounted prescription drug costs because of the law. If you've got health insurance, insurance companies can't impose lifetime limits on you. They can't use the fine print not to pay if you get sick. Insurance companies have to spend 80 percent of your premiums on your health care, not on administrative costs and CEO bonuses. Those are happening right now. <p>And health care costs have actually increased at the slowest rate in 50 years. So this is helping to reduce health care costs across the economy. <p>Finally, starting on October 1, it's going to help millions of more people. People who don't have health insurance right now, what it's going to do is, we're going to set up pools so that just like a worker at Ford can benefit from good insurance rates because you got a lot of workers in one big pool; now people who don't have the good fortune to work at a big company like Ford, they can also get a good deal. <p>Now, that's what&mdash;so that's what they're fighting for. They want to repeal all that, and they're saying, we're going to hold our breath, and if you don't repeal it&mdash;which, I've already said, I'm not going to do&mdash;we're going to send the economy into default. They will send our economy into a tailspin, just like Speaker Boehner said. They want to threaten default just to make sure that tens of millions of Americans continue not to have health care. <p>Defunding Affordable Health Care would rob 25 million Americans of the chance to get health care coverage. It would cut basic health care services for tens of millions of seniors on Medicare already. That's what House Republicans are fighting for. <p>And now they've gone beyond just holding Congress hostage, they're holding the whole country hostage. One Republican Senator called shutting down the Government over the Affordable Care Act \\"the dumbest idea I've ever heard.\\" I agree with him. But that's the strategy they're pursuing. House of Representatives just voted on it today. <p>Now, I tell you what, Missouri: The American people have worked too hard for too long, digging out of a real crisis just to let politicians in Washington cause another crisis. <p>This is the United States of America. We're not some banana republic. This is not a deadbeat nation. We don't run out on our tab. We're the world's bedrock investment. The entire world looks to us to make sure the world economy is stable. We can't just not pay our bills. And even threatening something like that is the height of irresponsibility. <p>So what I've said is I will not negotiate over the full faith and credit of the United States. I am not going to allow anyone to harm this country's reputation&mdash;I'm not going to allow them to inflict economic pain on millions of our own people&mdash;just so they can make an ideological point. <p>But I need you to help. I need you to help tell Congress, pay our bills on time. Pass a budget on time. Stop governing from crisis to crisis. Put our focus back on where it should be: on you, the American people; on creating new jobs; on growing our economy; on restoring security for middle class families. That's what you deserve. <p>I mean, I don't know, it's like they do this every 6 months. [<i>Laughter</i>] Isn't it? I mean, I don't mind them disagreeing with me. They don't like the Affordable Care Act, they'd rather have people not have health insurance, I'm happy to have that debate with them. But you don't have to threaten to blow the whole thing up just because you don't get you way. [<i>Laughter</i>] Right? <p>I think about something that Jordan said. Her grandfather worked in this plant; uncle, stepmom worked in this plant. Now she and her brother work in this plant, punching in as part of the next generation of American workers at a great, iconic American company. Our economy is coming back because of the resilience and determination of American workers like Jordan and her family. <p>And every day, all over this country, there are men and women just like Jordan, just like her brother, they wake up, maybe pack a lunch for their kids, kiss them goodbye, go to work, live up to their responsibilities, do their jobs, pay their bills. <p>Shouldn't you expect the same thing from people in Washington? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes! <p><i>The President.</i> Shouldn't you expect the same thing from Members of Congress? <p>Just do your job. Don't be the other guy, be the guy who's doing your job. No obstruction. No games. No holding the economic hostage&mdash;the economy hostage if you don't get 100 percent of what you want. <p>Nobody gets 100 percent of what you want. You guys know that in your own lives, in your own families. I don't know how many people are married here, but you know you better learn not to expect getting 100 percent of what you want. Otherwise, you'll be divorced real quick. [<i>Laughter</i>] Especially you men, I'm telling you. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So you should expect the same thing, same common sense, out of Congress. You should expect some compassion. You should expect some compromise. You should expect the conviction of leaders who wake up and go to work every day, not to tear something down, but to build something better; not just for today, but for the world we want to leave our kids. <p>That's my conviction. That's my commitment to you. If we start thinking about you instead of politics and how you can get your base stirred up, then we're going to be able to get back to the point where this country is what we want it to be. If Washington will act with the same decency and common purpose that you and Americans all across the country do every single day, the economy will be stronger not just a year from now or 5 years from now or 10 years from now, but 20 and 30 and 50 years from now. <p>And as long as I have the privilege of serving you as your President, that's what I'm going to be focused on. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless.\" "
"205" "\"Hello, CBC! Thank you so much, everybody. Please, have a seat, have a seat. Michelle and I are happy to be here with such a good-looking crowd. Everybody's cleaning up nice. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Thank you to Chaka Fattah for not just the great introduction, but more importantly, your leadership, especially on the issues of brain research that have the potential to change so many lives. I want to thank Shuanise Washington and everybody at the CBC Foundation for doing so much to help all our young people achieve their God-given potential. <p>I see so many friends here tonight. And obviously, these last several weeks have been momentous in a lot of ways. Many of you I had an opportunity to see both hosting at the White House, but then at the actual anniversary, the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington. And it was a little rainy that day, we didn't have a nice roof over our heads, but that wasn't enough to keep all of you away. It wasn't enough to keep me away. It wasn't enough to keep folks from all across the country from coming out to pay tribute to not only Dr. King, not only John Lewis, not only the well-known heroes of the civil rights movement, but to all the ordinary Americans who made it possible for so many of us to stand here today. <p>And as I looked out on that crowd, listening to Christine King Farris or Reverend Lowery and Congressman Lewis, it was impossible not to appreciate just how much progress we've made. It was impossible not to think of all the hearts that have been opened, all the laws that have been changed, all thanks to the quiet heroes who refused to give up or give in. <p>And as I said on that day, to dismiss the magnitude of that progress, to somehow suggest that little has changed, dishonors the courage and the sacrifice of all those who paid the price to march in those years. But what I also said&mdash;and I think there wasn't a speaker there that day or on Saturday in the other commemoration of the March who didn't make this point&mdash;we would also dishonor those heroes to suggest that the work of this Nation is somehow complete. And that's something that the CBC has always understood. <p>It wasn't until 1969&mdash;6 years after the March on Washington&mdash;that African Americans in Congress formed a caucus. And by then, the Civil Rights Act had been passed. The Voting Rights Act had been signed. The civil rights movement had been successful in many ways. <p>But the men and women who founded this caucus recognized what Dr. King understood: that equality is not just an abstraction&mdash;it's not just a formality&mdash;it has to go hand in hand with economic opportunity; that in order to address the enduring legacy of slavery and Jim Crow, we've got to make it easier for every American to earn their piece of the American Dream. <p>So fast forward to today, 50 years later. We all understand we have to be vigilant against any attempt to roll back our hard-won civil rights, whether that means tearing down barriers put up by those who seek to restrict the right to vote or making sure our criminal justice system works equally well for everybody, not just for some. <p>But at a time when Black unemployment remains twice as high as White unemployment, at a time when working Americans of all races have seen their incomes and wages stagnate even as corporate profits and the incomes of folks at the very top are soaring, we've got to pick up the torch of economic justice. We have to make this a country where anybody who works hard can earn their way into the middle class. And until we do, we will not let up, and we will not rest, no matter how much resistance we get. We will keep on pressing forward because it's good for America. It's the right thing to do. <p>We can't rest until every American knows the security of quality, affordable health care. In just over a week, thanks to the Affordable Care Act and the leadership shown by the CBC and others in Congress&mdash;so many of you fought to pass this law&mdash;thanks to your efforts, 6 in 10 uninsured Americans will finally be able to get covered for less than a hundred dollars a month. Everybody is going to be able to get coverage; 6 in 10 will be able to get coverage for less than a hundred bucks a month. And by the way, the only reason it's 6 in 10 is because we've got some Governors who&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;haven't seen the light yet. If every Governor chose to join this project rather than to fight it just to score some political points, that number would be nearly 8 in 10. <p>So just think about that. Knowing you can offer your family the security of health care, that's priceless. And now you can do it for less than your cell phone bill. That's what change looks like. <p>We won't rest until every American has access to a good education. And we've got to make sure every child gets the best start in life. We want to give every 4-year-old in America access to quality preschool. There's no better investment. We should be making it right now. We can afford it. It's the right vision. It's the right time. <p>We should make college more affordable for every family. There's no better ticket to the middle class in this country. And we've already made college&mdash;including HBCUs&mdash;more affordable for millions of students and their families through tax credits and grants and student loans that are going further than ever before. But we've got more to do. And so I've been talking to colleges, telling them they need to do their part by bringing costs down. Because in a 21st-century economy, a higher education is not a luxury, it is an economic imperative, and everybody should be able to afford it, not just a few. <p>We can't rest until we offer new ladders of opportunity for anyone willing to climb them. When you think about America, when you think about the ideal of this country, a big part of it is the idea of upward mobility, the idea that if you work hard you can get ahead. Well, over the last 30 years, upward mobility in this country has slipped out of reach for too many people. And that's especially true in communities with large African American populations. <p>So we've got to do more to rebuild neighborhoods, help some of the hardest hit towns in America get back on their feet. We've got to raise the minimum wage. Nobody who works full time in the wealthiest nation on Earth should have to raise their children in poverty. Those are fights we need to win. <p>And finally, we can't rest until all of our children can go to school or walk down the street free from the fear that they will be struck down by a stray bullet. Just 2 days ago, in my hometown Chicago, 13 people were shot during a pickup basketball game, including a 3-year-old girl. Tomorrow night I'll be meeting and mourning with families in this city who now know the same unspeakable grief of families in Newtown and Aurora and Tucson and Chicago and New Orleans and all across the country, people whose loved ones were torn from them without headlines sometimes or public outcry, but it's happening every single day. <p>And we fought a good fight earlier this year, but we came up short. And that means we've got to get back up and go back at it. Because as long as there are those who fight to make it as easy as possible for dangerous people to get their hands on a gun, then we've got to work as hard as possible for the sake of our children. We've got to be ones who are willing to do more work to make it harder. <p>These are the tasks before us. These are the challenges we face. It's a tall order, all of it. I know the odds sometimes seem long. I was taking photos with the CBC folks&mdash;every one of them came up, said, oh, you hang in there&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;you hang in there, man. And I said, don't worry about me. [<i>Laughter</i>] I am still fired up because I still see the work that needs to be done. The work didn't go away. <p>And part of the reason that I don't get tired is because I've seen people who are in this audience and what you've done, the odds that you've overcome. And I know sometimes the climb seems steep at any given moment. Sometimes, it seems like the pettiness of our politics just is making things worse and worse. <p>You look at it right now: The other day, the House Republicans voted to cut $40 billion in nutritional aid for struggling families at the same time as some of the same folks who took that vote are receiving subsidies themselves. So farm subsidies for folks at the top are okay; help feeding your child is somehow not. <p>I know the CBC, led by outstanding chairwoman Marcia Fudge, fought hard to protect those programs that keep so many children from going hungry. And now we're seeing an extreme faction of these folks convincing their leadership to threaten to shut down the Government if we don't shut down the Affordable Care Act. Some of them are actually willing to see the United States default on its obligations and plunge this country back into a painful recession if they can't deny the basic security of health care to millions of Americans. <p>Now, I think this is an interesting thing to ponder: that your top agenda is making sure 20 million people don't have health insurance. And you'd be willing to shut down the Government and potentially default for the first time in United States history because it bothers you so much that we're actually going to make sure that everybody has affordable health care.<B> <p></B>So let me say as clearly as I can: It is not going to happen. We have come too far. We've overcome far darker threats than those. We will not negotiate over whether or not America should keep its word and meet its obligations. We're not going to allow anyone to inflict economic pain on millions of our own people just to make an ideological point. And those folks are going to get some health care in this country; we've been waiting 50 years for it. <p>It's time for these folks to stop governing by crisis and start focusing on what really matters: creating new jobs, growing our economy, expanding opportunity for ourselves, looking after our children, doing something about the violence out there. As we've got all of these battles we have to face, we've got to remember what brought us here in the first place. <p>And as I was preparing my speech for the anniversary last month, I was doing some research, reading some stories about people who had come to the March 50 years ago, and I came across the story of a young man named Robert Avery. And Robert was 15 years old in 1963, so he and two friends decided to hitchhike from Gadsden, Alabama, to the March on Washington. And together, they traveled through some of the most segregated counties in America, sleeping in bus terminals, eating from vending machines, sometimes not eating. Sometimes, they walked. Sometimes, passer-bys, Black and White, offered them rides, worried that they might not make it on their own. <p>Seven hundred miles later, the boys from Gadsden reached their destination. They marched with Dr. King. And it left a mark on them. And afterwards, Robert went back home to Alabama, and he's now spent the last three decades on the Gadsden City Council. And Robert Avery is here tonight. <p>And in some ways, Robert's story is duplicated all across this room. Dr. King talked about how we're inextricably linked. Robert Kennedy talked about how, if you toss a pebble in a pond, the ripples emanate from that center. And the same is true in our own lives, how those ripples of hope, we don't know sometimes how they're going to have an impact on folks later, but all those tiny ripples build up and end up changing the world. <p>So when I think about Robert Avery in the city council&mdash;and I'm sure he's got his struggles and frustrations just like a President of the United States has struggles and frustrations sometimes&mdash;but he's still coming to work every day. He's still working to bring about change every single day, just like our Attorney General comes to work every single day. Just like John Lewis every single day gets up. It doesn't matter whether he's in the majority or the minority, he's going to speak the truth. He's going to tell everybody what he believes. <p>And those stories should remind us what brought us here. Why did we seek a life of public service? Why did we get involved? It wasn't just to come to a gala. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, it's nice; everybody looks nice. [<i>Laughter</i>] But it wasn't to cash in after service. We may not have hitchhiked across the country, but everybody, at some point, we felt that same tug, that same voice in our heads telling us: Stand up, speak out, try to make a difference, remember what you know to be true, what you know to be just, what you know to be fair, and be willing to fight for it, and don't be timid about it. And maybe sometimes, it's not going to work out right away, but if you stay at it again and again and again and you do not waver, eventually we make a difference. That's important. <p>Because while all our challenges are different from the ones faced by previous generations, we're going to need the same courage of a Robert Avery or a Bayard Rustin or a Joyce Ladner, all those marchers from 50 years ago; the same desire to get involved; the same courage to make our voices heard, to stand up for&mdash;whether it's quality health care or good education or our children's safety or equal opportunity. <p>We're going to have to keep marching. And I'm proud that I'll be&mdash;at least for the next 3&frac12; years here in Washington and then a whole lot of years after that&mdash;I'm going to be marching with you. <p>God bless you, everybody. Thank you. God bless America.\" "
"206" "\"Hi, everybody. It was 5 years ago this week that a financial crisis on Wall Street spread to Main Street and very nearly turned a recession into a depression. In a matter of months, millions of Americans were robbed of their jobs, their homes, their savings, after a decade in which they'd already been working harder and harder to just get by. It was a crisis from which we're still trying to recover. But thanks to the grit and determination of the American people, we are steadily recovering. <p>Over the past 3&frac12; years, our businesses have created 7&frac12; million new jobs. Our housing market is healing. We've become less dependent on foreign oil. Health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in 50 years. And in just over a week, millions of Americans without health care will be able to get covered for less than a hundred dollars a month. <p>So our economy is gaining traction. And we're finally tackling threats to middle class prosperity that Washington neglected for far too long. But as any middle class family listening right now knows, we've got a long way to go to get to where we need to be. And after 5 years spent digging out of crisis, the last thing we need is for Washington to manufacture another one. But that's what will happen in the next few weeks if Congress doesn't meet two deadlines. <p>First, the most basic constitutional duty Congress has is passing a budget. But if it doesn't pass one before September 30&mdash;a week from Monday&mdash;the Government will shut down. And so will many services the American people expect. Military personnel, including those deployed overseas, won't get their paychecks on time. Federal loans for rural communities, small-business owners, and new home buyers will be frozen. Critical research into lifesaving discoveries and renewable energy will be halted. All of this will be prevented if Congress just passes a budget.<B> <p></B>Second, Congress must authorize the Treasury to pay America's bills. This is done with a simple, usually routine, vote to raise what's called the debt ceiling. Since the 1950s, Congress has always passed it, and every President has signed it: Democrats and Republicans, including President Reagan. And if this Congress doesn't do it within the next few weeks, the United States will default on its obligations and put our entire economy at risk. <p>This is important. Raising the debt ceiling is not the same as approving more spending, it lets us pay for what Congress already spent. It doesn't cost a dime or add a penny to our deficit. In fact, right now our deficits are already falling at the fastest rate since the end of World War II. And by the end of this year, we'll have cut our deficits by more than half since I took office. <p>But reducing our deficits and debt isn't even what the current standoff in Congress seems to be all about. The fact is, Democrats and some reasonable Republicans are willing to raise the debt ceiling and pass a sensible budget, one that cuts spending on what we don't need so we can invest in what we do. And I want to work with those Democrats and Republicans on a better bargain for the middle class. <p>But there's also a faction on the far right of the Republican Party who've convinced their leadership to threaten a Government shutdown if they can't shut off the Affordable Care Act. Some are actually willing to plunge America into default if they can't defund the Affordable Care Act. <p>Think about that. They'd actually plunge this country back into recession, all to deny the basic security of health care to millions of Americans. That's not happening. And they know it's not happening. <p>The United States of America is not a deadbeat nation. We are a compassionate nation. We are the world's bedrock investment. And doing anything to threaten that is the height of irresponsibility. That's why I will not negotiate over the full faith and credit of the United States. I will not allow anyone to harm this country's reputation or threaten to inflict economic pain on millions of our own people just to make an ideological point. <p>So we're running out of time to fix this. But we could fix it tomorrow. Both Houses of Congress can take a simple vote to pay our bills on time, then work together to pass a budget on time. <p>Then we can declare an end to governing by crisis and govern responsibly, by putting our focus back where it should always be: on creating new jobs, growing our economy, and expanding opportunity not just for ourselves, but for future generations. <p>Thanks.\" "
"207" "\"Secretary Hagel, Secretary Mabus, Admirals Greenert and Hilarides, Mayor Gray, leaders from across this city and our Armed Forces, to all the outstanding first responders, and most of all, the families whose hearts have been broken: We cannot begin to comprehend your loss. We know that no words we offer today are equal to the magnitude, to the depths of that loss. But we come together as a grateful nation to honor your loved ones, to grieve with you, and to offer, as best we can, some solace and some comfort. <p>On the night that we lost Martin Luther King, Jr., to a gunman's bullet, Robert Kennedy stood before a stunned and angry crowd in Indianapolis, and he broke the terrible news. And in the anguish of that moment, he turned to the words of a ancient Greek poet, Aeschylus: \\"Even in our sleep, pain which we cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.\\" Pain which cannot forget, drop by drop upon the heart. <p>The tragedy and the pain that brings us here today is extraordinary. It is unique. The lives that were taken from us were unique. The memories their loved ones carry are unique, and they will carry them and endure long after the news cameras are gone. But part of what wears on as well is the sense that this has happened before. Part of what wears on us, what troubles us so deeply as we gather here today, is how this senseless violence that took place in the Navy Yard echoes other recent tragedies. <p>As President, I have now grieved with five American communities ripped apart by mass violence: Fort Hood, Tucson, Aurora, Sandy Hook, and now the Washington Navy Yard. And these mass shootings occur against a backdrop of daily tragedies, as an epidemic of gun violence tears apart communities across America, from the streets of Chicago to neighborhoods not far from here. <p>And so, once again, we remember our fellow Americans who were just going about their day, doing their jobs, doing what they loved, in this case, the unheralded work that keeps our country strong and our Navy the finest fleet in the world&mdash;these patriots doing their work that they were so proud of&mdash;and who have now been taken away from us by unspeakable violence. <p>Once more, we come together to mourn the lives of beauty and to comfort the wonderful families who cherished them. Once more, we pay tribute to all who rushed towards the danger, who risked their lives so others might live, and who are in our prayers today, including Officer Scott Williams. Once more, our hearts are broken. Once more, we ask why. Once more, we seek strength and wisdom through God's grace. <p>You and your families, this Navy family, are still in the early hour of your grief. And I'm here today to say that there is nothing routine about this tragedy. There is nothing routine about your loss. Your loved ones will not be forgotten. They will endure in the hearts of the American people and in the hearts of the Navy that they helped to keep strong and the hearts of their coworkers and their friends and their neighbors. <p>\\"I want them to know how she lived,\\" Jessica Gaarde said of her mother Kathy. \\"She is not a number or some statistic.\\" None of these 12 fellow Americans are statistics. Today I want every American to see how these men and women lived. You may have never met them, but you know them. They're your neighbors, like Arthur Daniels, out there on the weekend, polishing his white Crown Victoria and Kenneth Proctor, with his beloved yellow Mustang, who, if you asked, would fix your car too. <p>She was the friendly face at the store. Sylvia Frasier, with her unforgettable gold hair, who took a second job at Wal-Mart because, she said, she just loved working with people. She was the diehard fan you sat next to at the game. Kathy Gaarde loved her hockey and her Caps, a season ticket holder for 25 years. <p>They were the volunteers who made your community better: Frank Kohler, giving dictionaries to every third-grader in his county; Marty Bodrog, leading the children's Bible study at church. They lived the American Dream, like \\"Kisan Pandit, who left everything he knew in India for this land of opportunity and raised a wonderful family and dedicated himself to the United States Navy. They were proud veterans, like Gerald Read, who wore the Army uniform for more than 25 years, and Michael Arnold, who became one of the Navy's leading architects, of whom a colleague said, \\"Nobody knew those ships like him.\\" <p>They were dedicated fathers, like Mike Ridgell, coaching his daughter's softball teams, joining Facebook just to keep up with his girls, one of whom said, \\"He was always the cool dad.\\" They were loving mothers, like Mary Frances Knight, devoted to her daughters, and who had just recently watched with joy as her older daughter got married. They were doting grandparents, like John Johnson, always smiling, giving bear hugs to his 10 grandchildren and who would have welcomed his 11th grandchild this fall. <p>These are not statistics. They are the lives that have been taken from us. This is how far a single act of violence can ripple. A husband has lost his wife. Wives have lost their husbands. Sons and daughters have lost their moms and their dads. Little children have lost their grandparents. Hundreds in our communities have lost a neighbor, and thousands here have lost a friend. <p>As has been mentioned, for one family, the Daniels family, old wounds are ripped open again. Priscilla has lost Arthur, her husband of 30 years. Only a few years ago, as Mayor Gray indicated, another shooting took the life of their son, just 14 years old. \\"I can't believe this is happening again,\\" Priscilla says. <p>So these families have endured a shattering tragedy. It ought to be a shock to us all as a nation and as a people. It ought to obsess us. It ought to lead to some sort of transformation. That's what happened in other countries when they experienced similar tragedies. In the United Kingdom, in Australia, when just a single mass shooting occurred in those countries, they understood that there was nothing ordinary about this kind of carnage. They endured great heartbreak, but they also mobilized, and they changed, and mass shootings became a great rarity. <p>And yet, here in the United States, after the round-of-clock coverage on cable news, after the heartbreaking interviews with families, after all the speeches and all the punditry and all the commentary, nothing happens. Alongside the anguish of these American families, alongside the accumulated outrage so many of us feel, sometimes, I fear there's a creeping resignation that these tragedies are just somehow the way it is, that this is somehow the new normal. <p>We can't accept this. As Americans bound in grief and love, we must insist here today, there is nothing normal about innocent men and women being gunned down where they work. There is nothing normal about our children being gunned down in their classrooms. There is nothing normal about children dying in our streets from stray bullets. <p>No other advanced nation endures this kind of violence, none. Here in America, the murder rate is three times what it is in other developed nations. The murder rate with guns is ten times what it is in other developed nations. And there is nothing inevitable about it. It comes about because of decisions we make or fail to make. And it falls upon us to make it different. <p>Sometimes, it takes an unexpected voice to break through, to help remind us what we know to be true. And we heard one of those voices last week. Dr. Janis Orlowski's team at MedStar Washington Hospital Center treated the wounded. And in the midst of one of her briefings, she spoke with heartbreaking honesty as somebody who sees, daily and nightly, the awful carnage of so much violence. We are a great country, she said, but \\"there's something wrong.\\" All these shootings, all these victims, she said, \\"this is not America.\\" \\"It is a challenge to all of us,\\" she said, and \\"we have to work together to get rid of this.\\" <p>And that's the wisdom we should be taking away from this tragedy and so many others: not accepting these shootings as inevitable, but asking what can we do to prevent them from happening again and again and again. I've said before, we cannot stop every act of senseless violence. We cannot know every evil that lurks in troubled minds. But if we can prevent even one tragedy like this, save even one life, spare other families what these families are going through, surely we've got an obligation to try. <p>It's true that each of the tragedies I've mentioned is different. And in this case, it's clear we need to do a better job of securing our military facilities, deciding who gets access to them. And as Commander in Chief, I have ordered a review of procedures up and down the chain, and I know that Secretary Hagel is moving aggressively on that. As a society, it's clear we've got to do a better job of ensuring that those who need mental health care actually get it and that in those efforts, we don't stigmatize those who need help. Those things are clear, and we've got to move to address them. <p>But we Americans are not an inherently more violent people than folks in other countries. We're not inherently more prone to mental health problems. The main difference that sets our Nation apart, what makes us so susceptible to so many mass shootings, is that we don't do enough, we don't take the basic, commonsense actions to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and dangerous people. What's different in America is, it's easy to get your hands on a gun. And a lot of us know this. But the politics are difficult, as we saw again this spring. And that's sometimes where the resignation comes from: the sense that our politics are frozen and that nothing will change. <p>Well, I cannot accept that. I do not accept that we cannot find a commonsense way to preserve our traditions, including our basic Second Amendment freedoms and the rights of law-abiding gun owners, while at the same time reducing the gun violence that unleashes so much mayhem on a regular basis. And it may not happen tomorrow, and it may not happen next week, it may not happen next month, but it will happen. Because it's the change that we need, and it's a change overwhelmingly supported by the majority of Americans. <p>By now, though, it should be clear that the change we need will not come from Washington, even when tragedy strikes Washington. Change will come the only way it ever has come, and that's from the American people. So the question now is not whether, as Americans, we care in moments of tragedy. Clearly, we care. Our hearts are broken again. And we care so deeply about these families. But the question is, do we care enough? <p>Do we care enough to keep standing up for the country that we know is possible, even if it's hard and even if it's politically uncomfortable? Do we care enough to sustain the passion and the pressure to make our communities safer and our country safer? Do we care enough to do everything we can to spare other families the pain that is felt here today? <p>Our tears are not enough. Our words and our prayers are not enough. If we really want to honor these 12 men and women, if we really want to be a country where we can go to work and go to school and walk our streets free from senseless violence, without so many lives being stolen by a bullet from a gun, then we're going to have to change. We're going to have to change. <p>On Monday morning, these 12 men and women woke up like they did every day. They left home, and they headed off to work. And Gerald Read's wife Cathy said, \\"See you tonight for dinner.\\" And John Johnson looked at his wife Judy and said what he always said whenever they parted: \\"Goodbye beautiful. I love you so much.\\" <p>\\"Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart, until in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.\\" <p>What Robert Kennedy understood, what Dr. King understood, what all our great leaders have always understood, is that wisdom does not come from tragedy alone or from some sense of resignation in the fallibility of man. Wisdom comes through the recognition that tragedies such as this are not inevitable and that we possess the ability to act and to change and to spare others the pain that drops upon our hearts. So in our grief, let us seek that grace. Let us find that wisdom. And in doing so, let us truly honor these 12 American patriots. <p>May God hold close the souls taken from us and grant them eternal peace. May He comfort and watch over these families. And may God grant us the strength and wisdom to keep safe our United States of America.\" "
"208" "\"Ladies and gentlemen, as is always the case with these lunches, I exceeded my time this morning, and so you've heard enough from me. [<i>Laughter</i>] But as President of the host country, I do simply want to say thank you to all of you and express my appreciation for Secretary Ban for his principled leadership as well as the extraordinary hard work of his team. <p>Mr. Secretary-General, you continue to provide the moral vision that we seek from the United Nations as well as a practical sense of how we can achieve that vision. And so on behalf of all of us, we want to say thank you very much. <p>I also want to salute all who help sustain our United Nations, often unseen and unheralded. This includes the dedicated U.N. inspectors in Damascus who set out into battlefield conditions. They braved sniper fire. They worked diligently with great professionalism. They uncovered the truth, and they have the thanks of the world. Meanwhile, we see thousands of peacekeepers in blue helmets standing watch around the world from Haiti to the D.R.C. to Cyprus so that people in countries recovering from conflict and strife can have the chance to build a more hopeful life. <p>After the Yalta Conference, shortly before the United Nations was founded, President Roosevelt spoke of what it would take to achieve a lasting and durable peace. \\"The structure of world peace,\\" he said, \\"cannot be the work of one man or one party or one nation. It cannot be an American peace or a British, a Russian, a French, or a Chinese peace. It cannot be a peace of large nations or of small nations. It must be a peace which rests on the cooperative effort of the whole world.\\" These words are more true today than ever, whether it's preventing the spread of deadly weapons, promoting democratic governance, or fighting daily battles against poverty and hunger and deprivation. International peace, development, and security will not be achieved by one nation or one group of nations. It must be the work of all of us. <p>So I want to propose a toast to our host and great friend, Secretary-General Ban, to all those here in New York and around the world who help sustain the United Nations, and to the spirit that we need: the cooperative effort of the whole world. Cheers. <i>Salud. </i>\" "
"209" "\"<i>Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.</i> Good afternoon, everyone. Well, thank you. Thank you very much. I have the great pleasure to introduce our next two speakers, who are about to have a conversation concerning health care. And I thought hard about how to introduce these two men. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And the more I thought about it, the more I realized how much they have in common. They are both left handed. [<i>Laughter</i>] They both love golf, a game that does not often reciprocate the love they put into it. [<i>Laughter</i>] They both are fanatic sports fans and go to great lengths to be in front of the TV or on the side of the court or the field. They both are master politicians. Each of them has only lost one election. They are both Democrats. They have fabulous daughters. They each married far above themselves. [<i>Laughter</i>] And they each love our country. <p>And so please join me in welcoming number 42 and number 44, Bill Clinton and President Barack Obama. <p><i>President Obama.</i> Mr. President. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Former President William J. Clinton.</i> Are you interviewing me? You&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>President Obama.</i> That would be bad. I've been talking a lot today. <p><i>Former President Clinton.</i> I want to thank you for giving Hillary a job. That was a good thing you did. [<i>Laughter</i>] Thank you for coming. <p><i>President Obama.</i> Well, it is wonderful to be back. And let me start just by saying to all the people who have for years now supported the incredible efforts of CGI, thank you. Because wherever we travel, all across the globe, we see the impact that it's making every single day. And we're very proud of what you all do. <p>And let me say that we still miss our former Secretary of State. And I should add that there's nothing she said that was not true, particularly the part about us marrying up. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Former President Clinton.</i> Well, that brings me to my first health care comment. This is going to be a conversation about domestic and international health, and America's role in it. But I want to begin by telling you that I think the First Lady has done a great job in this fight against childhood obesity. <p>We have been honored at our foundation to be asked to represent her effort in 18,000 schools where we've lowered the calories in drinks being served in schools by 90 percent. But she's been great on that. The other thing, I think, is that I was a little upset&mdash;and as you know, called one of your administration members when you got to Africa&mdash;when I read an article that said that you didn't have a big initiative in Africa. And I said&mdash;I can't say exactly what I said&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but I said, that is inaccurate. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's the sanitized version of what I said. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Because when the President took office, our programs&mdash;begun under President Bush, PEPFAR&mdash;was giving antiretroviral medicine to 1.7 million people. Because of an agreement that I made with President Bush to use generic drugs that were approved by the FDA, about half our drugs were being purchased in that way. Under President Obama, we've gone to 99 percent. We are treating more than 5.1 million people, three times as many for less money. <p>That is a stunning legacy&mdash;so that more money has been put into malaria medicine, bed nets, so you saved a lot of money and saved more lives while doing it. And I'm very proud of that. And I want to thank you for it. It's important. <p>I&mdash;now, maybe at the end of this conversation we can get back to some of your current global health initiatives. But let's talk a little about the health care law, because we're about to begin, on October the 1st, open enrollment for 6 months. And I'd like to give you a chance, first of all, to tell them why&mdash;when you took office, we were teetering on the brink of a depression. You had to avert it. You had to start the recovery again. Why in the midst of all this grief did you also take on this complex issue? Many people were saying, why didn't he just focus on the economy and leave this alone? So tell us why you did it. <p><i>President Obama.</i> Well, first of all, I think it's important to remember that health care is the economy, a massive part of our economy. And so the idea that somehow we can separate out the two is a fallacy. <p>Second of all, the effort for us to deal with a multifaceted health care crisis has been going on for decades. And the person who just introduced us, as well as you, early in your Presidency, had as much to do with helping to shape the conversation as anybody. <p>The fact is that we have been, up until recently, the only advanced industrialized nation on Earth that permits large numbers of its people to languish without health insurance. Not only is there the cruelty of people who are unable to get health insurance having to use the emergency room as their doctor or their health service, but we're also more efficient than anybody else. And so when we talk about, for example, our deficit&mdash;you know this better than anybody&mdash;the reason that we have not only current deficits, but also projected long-term deficits&mdash;the structural deficit that we have&mdash;is primarily based on the fact that we have a hugely inefficient, wildly expensive health care system that does not produce better outcomes. <p>And if we spent the same amount of money on health care that Canada or France or Great Britain did, or Japan, or any other industrialized country, with the same outcomes or better outcomes, that essentially would remove our structural deficit, which would then free up dollars for us to invest in early childhood education and infrastructure and medical research and all the other things that can make sure that we're competitive and growing rapidly over the long term. <p>So my view when I came into office was, we've got an immediate crisis, we've got to get the economy growing. But what we also have to do is to start tackling some of these structural problems that had been building up for years. And one of the biggest structural problems was health care. It's what accounts for our deficit. It's what accounts for our debt. It causes pain and misery to millions of people all across the country. It is a huge burden on our businesses. <p>I was out at a Ford plant out in Missouri&mdash;and making the F series out there, and this is a big stamping plant. Ford is now the biggest seller in the United States. We took that lead back from the Japanese automakers. But we are still burdened by the fact that every U.S. automobile that is manufactured requires a couple of thousand dollars in added health care costs that our foreign competitors don't have to pay. <p>So this is&mdash;has everything to do with the economy, in addition to what I consider to be the moral imperative that a mom should not have to go bankrupt if her son or daughter gets sick, that a family who's dealing with a layoff and is already struggling to pay the bills shouldn't also be wondering whether they're one illness away from losing their home. And I think most Americans agree with that. <p><i>Former President Clinton.</i> So, first of all, folks, for those of you who are from the United States, I&mdash;that's about as good an overview as you're ever going to hear of what this economic issue is. But you remember the President said our structural deficit would disappear if we had a comparable health care system in terms of cost to the French and Germans that are consistently rated the highest? It's about a trillion dollars a year, and somewhere around 44 percent of that money is Government-funded money. So you just run the numbers. Think&mdash;over half of our deficit has already disappeared because of economic growth and the revenues you raised and the spending we cut. And you pretty much get rid of the rest of it if we just had a comparably expensive system to any other country. <p>Before you took office, we lost a car company that wanted to locate in Michigan that went instead to Canada, and they announced&mdash;they said, look, we're a car company that provides health care benefits to our employees, we're not a health care company that sells cars to cover our bills. We have to go to Canada. So I think this is&mdash;and it was one of the few companies willing to go on record and say this. So thank you for doing it. <p>So let's talk about this. What does this open enrollment mean? How are people going to get involved? When you have universal enrollment, you can manage your costs better and cut inflation down. <p>I'll give the President a chance to talk about all the good stuff that's happened, but I just want you to know one thing. In the last 3 years, just as we started doing this, inflation in health care costs has dropped to 4 percent for 3 years in a row for the first time in 50 years. Fifty years. For the&mdash;before that, the costs were going up at three times the rate of inflation for a decade. <p>So now what? What are you going to do on October 1? Tell them how this has got to work. <p><i>President Obama.</i> Well, let me give folks just a little bit of background about what's already in place and then what happens on October 1. <p>When we passed the Affordable Care Act, there were a number of components to it. A big part of it was essentially providing a Patient's Bill of Rights that Americans and advocates had been fighting for for decades. So what we wanted to do was make sure if you already have health insurance that you get a fair deal, that you're being treated well by your insurers. <p>So we eliminated&mdash;prohibited insurance companies from imposing lifetime limits, which oftentimes if a family member really got sick, they thought they were covered until suddenly, they hit that limit and now they're out hundreds of thousands of dollars with no way of paying. <p>We said to insurance companies, you've got to use at least 80 percent of your premium that you're receiving on actual health care, not on administrative costs and CEO bonuses. And if you don't, you've got to rebate anything that you spent back to the consumer. So there are millions of Americans who have received rebates. They may not know that they got it because of the Affordable Care Act or quote, unquote, Obamacare, but I&mdash;but they're pretty happy to get those rebates back, because it made sure that the insurance companies were treating folks fairly. <p>We said that any young person who doesn't have health insurance can stay on their parent's health insurance until they're 26 years old. And as a consequence, what we've seen is steadily the rate of uninsured for young people dropping over the last 3 years since the bill passed and obviously providing a lot of relief to a lot of parents out there. Because a lot of young people, as they've been entering into the job market at a time when jobs are tough to get and oftentimes benefits are slim, this is providing enormous security until they get more firmly established in the labor market. <p>We provided additional discounts for prescription drugs for seniors under the Medicare program. And so seniors have saved billions of dollars when it comes to their prescription drugs. <p>So there have been, over the last 3 years, a whole array of consumer protections and savings for consumers that result directly from the law that we passed. And for those who say that they want to repeal it, typically when you ask them about, what are all these various benefits, they say, well, that one is good, and that one is pretty good, and we'd keep that. And you pretty much go down the list, and there's not too much people object to. <p>You will recall also at the time that part of the way that we paid for the health care bill was, we said Medicare is wasting a lot of money without making seniors healthier. And there was a lot of hue and cry about how we were taking money out of Medicare. Well, it turns out that we were right: that we could change how doctors and hospitals and providers were operating, rewarding them for outcomes, as opposed to simply how many procedures that they did. You started seeing practices change among millions of providers across the country. Medicare rates have actually slowed in terms of inflation. Seniors have saved money. Folks are healthier. And some of those savings we've been able to use to make sure that people who don't have health insurance get health insurance. <p>Now, this brings me to October 1. The one part of the Affordable Care Act that required several years to set up, but a critical part, was how do we provide health insurance for individuals who don't get health insurance through the job? It's a historical accident that in this country, health care is attached to employers. And part of the problem is, if you're out there shopping for health insurance on your own, you're not part of a big pool, well, there's no aggregation of risk taking place for the insurers. So they're basically going to say, let's see, you're 50 years old. You got high blood pressure. And we just look at the actuarial tables, and we figure you're going to get sick, so we're going to charge you $1,500 a month for health insurance, which the average person has no way of affording. Because there's no pooling of risk. <p>So what we said was, we need to set up a mechanism to pool people who currently don't have health insurance so that they have the same purchasing power, the same leverage, that a big company does when they're negotiating with the insurance company. <p>And essentially, what we've done is, we've created what we're calling marketplaces in every State across the country where consumers are now able to be part of a big pool. Insurers have to bid&mdash;essentially compete&mdash;for the business of that pool. And what we now have set up are these marketplaces that provide high-quality health care at affordable prices, giving people choices so that they can get the health insurance that they need and they want. And the premiums are significantly lower than what they were able to previously get. <p>I'll take the example of New York State. The insurers put in their bids to participate in these marketplaces. It turns out that their rates are up to 50 percent lower than what was available previously if you just went on the open market and you tried to get health insurance. Fifty percent lower in this State. California, it's about 33 percent lower. In my home State of Illinois&mdash;they just announced&mdash;it's about 25 percent lower. <p>So just by pooling and creating competition so that insurers have to go after people's business the way they go after a group plan, we have drastically reduced premiums and costs. On top of that, what we're now doing is we're saying, if with the better deal that you got you still can't afford it, we're going to give you tax credits to essentially subsidize your purchase of health insurance. <p>And here's the net result. We'll be continuing to roll out what the actual prices are going to end up being, but I can tell you right now that in many States across the country, if you're, say, a 27-year-old young woman, don't have health insurance, you get on that exchange, you're going to be able to purchase high-quality health insurance for less than the cost of your cell phone bill. And because all the insurers who participate are required to, for example, provide free preventive care, free contraceptive care, that young woman, she may make up what she's spending on premiums just on her monthly use of health care. <p>So this is going to be a good deal for those who don't have health insurance. Those who already have health insurance get better health insurance. And the best part of the whole thing is, because of these changes we initiated in terms of how we're paying providers, health care costs have grown, as you've pointed out, Mr. President, at the slowest rate in 50 years. We are bending the cost curve and getting at the problems that are creating our deficits in Medicare and Medicaid. <p><i>Former President Clinton.</i> I should point out that, so far, in most States, one of the good things that at least I didn't know whether it would happen is that when we began this in the United States, more than 80 percent of the American States had only one or two companies writing health insurance who had more than 80 percent of the market. So there was, in effect, no price competition. So what I was terrified of was, we'd open these things, and there would only be one company show up and bid, and this whole thing, we'd be having an academic conversation. Instead, it's actually led to the establishment of more companies doing more bidding. <p>And I think part of it is, they have greater confidence that they can deliver health care at a more modest cost. So, so far, it's good. But I think it's important for you to the tell the people why we're doing all this outreach, because this only works, for example, if young people show up. And even if they buy the cheapest plan, then they claim their tax credits, so it won't cost them much, 100 bucks a month or so. We got to have them in the pools, because otherwise, all these projected low costs cannot be held if older people with preexisting conditions are disproportionately represented in any given State. You've got to have everybody lined up. <p>So explain what kind of&mdash;all the work you've been doing on the outreach for the opening on October. <p><i>President Obama.</i> Well, I think President Clinton makes a really important point. And the way pools work, any pool, is essentially those of us who are healthy subsidize somebody who is sick at any given time. We do that because we anticipate, well, at some point we'll get sick, and we hope the healthy person is in our pool, so those costs and those risks get spread. That's what insurance is all about. <p>And what happens is, if you don't have pools that are a cross-section of society, then people who are already sick or more likely to get sick, they'll all rush out and buy insurance. People who are healthy, they say, you know what, I won't bother. And you get what's called adverse selection. Essentially, what happens is, is that the premiums start going higher and higher because the risks aren't spread broadly enough across the population. <p>So you want to get a good cross-section in every pool. That's why big companies have an easier time getting good rates for their employees than small companies, because if you only have five employees, one person is stricken with breast cancer, let's say, your rates potentially shoot up. But if it's a thousand employees, then it gets spread out. <p>So on October 1, open enrollment begins. All these folks can start signing up for the marketplace. And what we want to make sure of is that everybody, in every category, every age group, understands why health insurance is important, understands why they should sign up, understands the choices that are going to be available to them. They're going to be able to go to a computer, tap on the web page, and they're going to be able to shop just like you shop for an airline ticket or a flat-screen TV and see what's the best price for you, what's the plan that's best suited for you, and go ahead and sign up right there and then. <p>And that open enrollment period will last from October 1 until the end of March, and so there will be 6 months for folks to sign up. Normally, this would be pretty straightforward. A lot of people don't have health insurance. A lot of people realize they should get health insurance. But let's face it, it's been a little political, this whole Obamacare thing. [<i>Laughter</i>] And so what you've had is an unprecedented effort that you've seen ramp up over the last month or so in which those who have opposed the idea of universal health care in the first place and have fought this thing tooth and nail through Congress and through the courts and so forth are&mdash;have been trying to scare and discourage people from getting a good deal. And some of you may have seen some of the commercials out there that are a little whacky. <p>And the main message we have&mdash;and we're using social media, we're talking to churches, we're talking to various civic groups&mdash;and what we're saying to people is, look, just go to the web site yourself. Go to healthcare.gov, take a look at whether this is a good deal or not, make your own decision about whether this is good for you. Because what we are confident about is that when people look and see that they can get high-quality, affordable health care for less than their cell phone bill, they're going to sign up. They are going to sign up. <p>And part of what, I think, the resistance that we've seen ramp up particularly over the last couple of months is all about is the opponents of health care reform know they're going to sign up. In fact, one of the major opponents, when asked, well, why is it that you'd potentially shut down the Government at this point just to block Obamacare, he basically fessed up. He said, well, once consumers get hooked on having health insurance and subsidies, then they won't want to give it up. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, that's&mdash;you can look at the transcript. This is one of the major opponents of health care reform. It is an odd logic. Essentially, they're saying people will like this thing too much, and then it will be really hard to roll back. <p>So it is very important that people just know what's out there, what's available to them, and let people make up their own minds as to whether it makes sense or not. <p>Now, one last thing I want to say, because I do think sometimes&mdash;people come up to me, and they say, well, if this is such a good deal, how come the polls show that it's not popular? Well, one of the things you and I both know is that when you come to health care, there's no more personal and intimate decision for people. I mean, this is something that people really care about. And frankly, the devil you know is always the better&mdash;better than the devil you don't know. And that's what \\"Harry and Louise\\" was all about back in the nineties, right? It was scaring people with the prospect of change. <p>And so part of our goal here is just to make sure people have good information. And there has been billions of dollars spent making people scared and worried about this stuff. And rather than trying to disabuse people of every single bit of misinformation that's been out there, what we're saying is just look for yourself. Take a look at it, and you will discover that this is a good deal for you. <p><i>Former President Clinton.</i> Well, let's&mdash;first of all, I completely agree with that. I think what&mdash;we've got to just drive people to the web sites. The States that are participating&mdash;the Supreme Court decision would&mdash;upheld the health care law said that States didn't have to set up these marketplaces if they didn't want to, but if they didn't the Federal Government would set it up. They also said that States didn't have to expand Medicaid coverage to help people whose incomes are up to 138 percent of the Federal poverty level buy health insurance. <p>There are some States, believe it or not, that want the marketplace, but don't want the Medicaid. And that's going to lead to a cruel result, and there's nothing the President can do, and it's not his fault. That's what the Supreme Court said. So we can have this bizarre situation where, let's say, a business with 60 employees can&mdash;or an individual going into the individual market will get the benefit of tax credits for everybody with incomes of 138 percent of the Federal poverty level or above, but they won't get it for people who are between 100 and 138 percent. So lower income people who desperately need the health insurance, we would have the cruelest of all situations in those States. And there's nothing the President can do about it because of the Supreme Court decision. So we have to persuade the States to come on. But more and more States with Republican Governors, Republican legislatures, are doing it. <p><i>President Obama</i>. Well&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>President Clinton</i>. Tell them about Arkansas, because we're doing well down there. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>President Obama.</i> No, no, no. A little hometown bias here, there's nothing wrong with that. [<i>Laughter</i>] A couple of things that are happening that I think are very interesting. First of all, look, I'm sympathetic to some of these Republican Governors who are under a lot of pressure because the whole issue of whether you're for Obamacare or not has become a litmus test in the other party. So some of them, politically have&mdash;it's been tough; sometimes, State legislatures that refuse to allow Governors to go ahead and implement. <p>But as you indicated, what we've seen is that when Republican Governors take a look at the deal they're getting where, in addition to these exchanges, we're also providing a much more significant match, much more Federal money to provide health insurance&mdash;from the State's perspective, they're not paying; the Federal Government is picking up the tab&mdash;and this is helping them because people are no longer going to the emergency room and they now have good health care, they're now getting preventive care. You're seeing some Republican Governors step up and saying, I may not like Obamacare, but I'm going to go ahead and make sure that my people are benefiting from this plan. So that's one good thing that's happening. <p>The second thing that's happening is, there are a couple of States&mdash;Arkansas is a good example; Kentucky is another good example; Idaho, interesting example&mdash;now, these are States where I just got beat. I mean, I do not have a big constituency in these States. [<i>Laughter</i>] Well, I take that back. You know what, I mean, 40 percent is still a lot of people. But I'm losing by 20 percent in these States. But the Governors were still able to say, we're going to set up our own State exchanges, their own marketplaces. And each State is just using their own name for it. <p>So I had a meeting&mdash;I had a conference, a video conference with all the State directors of all the marketplaces, and I'm talking to the director in Kentucky and Idaho. And in Kentucky, it's called, like, Kentucky Connect. And in Idaho, it's called the Idaho Health Care Exchange. And there's a story that came out of Kentucky where some folks were signing people up at a county fair somewhere. Some guy goes up, and he starts looking at the rates and decides he's going to sign up. And he turns to his friend and said, this is a great deal. This is a lot better than Obamacare. [<i>Laughter</i>] Right? Which is fine. [<i>Laughter</i>] Because we&mdash;I don't have pride of authorship on this thing. I just want the thing to work. <p>And Arkansas just came out with its rates, and as has been true in virtually every single State, not only are premiums lower than they were, they're a lot lower than even the most optimistic predictions were about how low they would be. <p>And once these marketplaces are up and running, it turns out that what has traditionally been a pretty conservative principle, which is, competition and choice work, well, in the insurance market, competition and choice work. And what we're seeing is that people are going to be able to get the kind of health care that they have never been able to get before. States are going to benefit from it because they're going to save money. <p>And one thing that all of you&mdash;there are probably very few people in this room who don't have health insurance, although if you don't, you should sign up starting on October 1. [<i>Laughter</i>] One of the things that many people don't realize is that the subsidy that all of you provide for the uninsured is about a thousand dollars per family. You pay a thousand dollars &mdash;everybody here who has got health insurance pays about a thousand dollars more for your family's insurance than you otherwise would have, because hospitals are mandated, they are required to provide service to anybody who shows up. And so what happens is when you've got 15 percent of the population without health insurance, they end up showing up at the emergency room, typically at a point when they're much sicker than if they had been getting regular checkups and preventive care. So you pay for the most expensive care there is, because hospitals have got to recoup that money someway. <p>And the way they do it is to charge higher prices. And people who have health insurance end up picking it up. So part of what will&mdash;helps reduce the increase in health care costs is making sure that that hidden subsidy no longer exists. <p><i>Former President Clinton.</i> Let's talk a little bit about business, because we're out of time, but I think it's really important. When I&mdash;as you pointed out, most people who have insurance work for a living, or somebody in their family does, and they get their insurance through their workplace. The law says that all employers have to participate if they have 50 employees or more. Many employers with fewer than 50 employees already voluntarily provide some health insurance. <p>Both the companies with 50 or more and the companies with fewer than 50 are somewhat concerned. And the employees that have to be insured are those who work 30 hours a week or more. So there were many people who speculated that when this law came into place that it would add to the cost and there would be a lot more part-time workers instead of full-time workers. I'll save the President the time and the energy on this: So far, that's not true. The overwhelming number of people who have been hired coming out of this recession have been&mdash;they have been hired at lower wages, but they have been full-time employees. <p>There has not been an increase in the percentage of our employment in part-time work. There has been an increase in relatively lower wage new jobs. But that means they need health insurance even more. So explain very briefly to them how this is going to work, how private employers are helped to buy their insurance and the requirements. <p><i>President Obama.</i> Good. Well, first of all, if you're a large employer or an employer with more than 50 employees, you're already providing health insurance, you don't have to do anything other than just make sure that you can show that you're providing health insurance. <p>And there was a lot of news recently about how we delayed the so-called employer mandate for a year. Because under the law, what it says is, if you have more than 50 employees, you're not providing health insurance to your employees, then you're going to pay a penalty to help subsidize&mdash;to help pay for&mdash;the fact that some&mdash;we, the taxpayers, are going to have to provide your employees with health insurance, which, by the way, is only fair. <p>A lot of the controversy around the Affordable Care Act had to do with these so-called mandates, both an employer mandate and an individual mandate. And the employer mandate says, if you don't meet your responsibilities by your employees, and they end up getting Medicaid or they're ending up in the emergency room, you're basically dumping those costs onto society. That's not fair. So we're going to charge you a couple thousand dollars to help pay for health care for those employees. <p>To the individuals, what we said was, we're going to make health insurance so affordable, so cheap for you, so heavily subsidized if you're not making a lot of money, that if you're not getting health insurance, then it's because you just decided you don't want to, you don't need to. And in that circumstance, what happens when you get hit by a bus, heaven forbid, or somebody in your family gets sick and you hadn't had them covered? Well, we're going to end up having to pay for you anyway because we're not going to just let somebody bleed in front of the emergency room. So what we've said is, you've got to take responsibility, and so there's a small penalty if you don't get health insurance. <p>This is where a lot of the controversy and unpopularity came in, because people generally don't like to be told, \\"You've got to get health insurance,\\" and employers don't like be told, \\"You've got to give your employees health insurance.\\" But as a society, what we cannot do is to say, you have no responsibilities whatsoever, but you've got guaranteed coverage. <p>And this raises the whole issue of preexisting conditions, which we haven't talked a lot about, but is really important. One of the central components of this law&mdash;one of the main perversities of the health care system before this law passed was there were millions of people around the country who, if you had gotten sick before, if you had had a heart attack, if you had had cancer, if you had diabetes; and let's say, when it first happened you had a job, you got cured; then you lose your job or you're trying to change jobs or you're trying to start a business, you try to go out and get health insurance, the health insurance company not only could deny you, but had every incentive to deny you. Because, basically, they'd rather have healthy people who are paying premiums and never asking for a payout. They don't want somebody who, actuarially, they can anticipate might get sick. <p>And so keep in mind that a huge percentage of our society has some sort of preexisting condition, and they can be locked out. You can do everything right, work hard, build a strong middle class life, but if you've been sick and then you lose your job or something happens, you may suddenly be locked out of the insurance market or the premiums may be so high that only somebody fabulously rich could afford them. <p>So what we said is, all right, you know what, insurance companies, you can no longer bar somebody from getting health insurance just because they've got a preexisting condition. But the only way that works is if everybody has a requirement to get health insurance. Because think about what happens if you don't have that rule. Well, all of us&mdash;not all of us, but a lot of us who were trying to figure out how to save some money would say, well, I'm not going to worry about it until I get sick, and then right when I'm diagnosed with something that's going to be expensive, I'll go to the insurance company and say, you can't prevent me from getting health insurance just because I've got a preexisting condition. So they could potentially game the system, and it wouldn't work. <p>So now what we've done is said you've got to provide health insurance to anybody, all comers, that's the deal. The flipside of it is everybody has got some responsibility, and we'll help you pay for it, to get health insurance. And that's where a lot of the misunderstandings, the frustrations, about health care reform came in. <p>I should add, by the way, that this was the same proposition that was set up in Massachusetts under a Governor named Mitt Romney that's working really well. Ninety-nine percent of people in Massachusetts have coverage. And that same principle was, ironically, considered a very smart Republican, conservative principle. But it was the right one. The economics of it are true. <p>So, just to finish up the question, when it comes to businesses, if you're already providing health insurance for your employees, that's great. You don't have to do much other than just make sure that you show us that you've got health insurance for your employees. <p>If you have more than 50 employees, and you're not providing health insurance for them, you now have the opportunity to join a pool of small businesses to get a better price and a better deal on health insurance. You're eligible for tax credits in providing health insurance to your employees. Up to 35 percent of the premiums for each employee will be a tax benefit&mdash;a tax credit&mdash;from the Federal Government. But if you still aren't providing health insurance for your employees after that, then we're going to go ahead and penalize you for it. <p>And I can understand why some businesses wouldn't want to pay for it. If they're not currently providing health insurance for their employees, what that means is that they'd rather have those additional profits than make sure that their employees are getting a fair deal. <p>In some cases, they may be operating under some very small margins. But keep in mind, since people are&mdash;companies are exempted, the average small business with five employees, mom-and-pop shop, 10 employees, they're not under that requirement. So I'm not that sympathetic to a company, typically, if it's got more than 50 employees and generating some significant revenue, we're making it affordable for them to provide health insurance for their employees. They should do the right thing. <p><i>Former President Clinton.</i> I agree with that. We have to close, but I think there's one last issue we ought to deal with. The most important thing obviously is just to get people enrolled in this. We'll work through it as we go along. <p>But the&mdash;you just heard the President say that so far in virtually every State, the actual prices of the insurance are coming in quite a bit lower than they were originally estimated to. With the original price estimates and with the Government obligated to provide subsidies&mdash;which costs money on the budget, right?&mdash;it was, nonetheless, estimated that in the first 10 years, this would keep the national debt $110 billion lower than it otherwise would have been, which means if we come in at even less, we can bring the debt down more, or we can subsidize more small businesses and get more small businesses into this loop. <p>A lot of people come to me and say, now, you sound like the people you used to criticize who say we could cut taxes all day long, increase spending and balance the budget. Don't give me that; this sounds too good to be true. So I think on your&mdash;before you leave, you should tell people how we can spend more&mdash;not so much in direct spending, but in tax credits&mdash;and still wind up reducing overall Federal spending by $110 billion during this decade. <p><i>President Obama.</i> Well, a couple of things just in terms of how this whole thing got paid for. First of all, I think it's really important to point out here that the total cost of the Affordable Care Act to provide health insurance for every American out there at an affordable rate is costing about the same amount over the course of 10 years as the costs of the prescription drug bill that President Bush passed; except that wasn't paid for. We felt obliged to actually pay for it and not just add to the deficit. <p>So what we did, it's paid for by a combination of things. We did raise taxes on some things. We, for example, said that for high-income individuals, you can pay a slightly higher Medicare rate&mdash;Medicare tax. So we bumped that up a little bit. We said that for employers who are currently providing a so-called Cadillac health care plan, where there are so many bells and whistles, there's no incentive to actually spend wisely when it comes to health care, we're actually going to penalize you for that, not only to raise a little bit of money, but also to say you're encouraging the worst aspects of a health care system where you spend a lot of money, you don't get better outcomes. <p>I mentioned to you Medicare. We basically said, there's a program in Medicare called Medicare Advantage that provides some additional options for Medicare recipients above and beyond standard Medicare. And it's very popular with a lot of seniors. You get eyeglasses and other benefits. But it turned out that it was so uncompetitive that we were providing tens of billions of dollars of subsidies to the insurance companies under this Medicare Advantage Plan without getting better outcomes, health outcomes, for seniors. <p>So what we said was we'll keep Medicare Advantage and we'll give them a small premium if they're providing better services for seniors, but we're going to make you compete for it a little bit. And we're going to save tens of billions of dollars in the process, and that will go into paying for the Affordable Care Act. <p>So the bottom line is, through these various mechanisms, we raised enough money to pay for providing health insurance for those who don't have it, to provide these health&mdash;or these tax credits in the marketplace, and at the same time, because we're driving down costs, we actually end up saving a little money. It is a net reduction of our deficit. <p>The irony of those who are talking about repealing Obamacare because it's so wildly expensive is, if they actually repealed the law, it would add to the deficit. It would add to the deficit. <p>Now, there have been a couple of Republicans in the House who have been smart enough to say, we're going to repeal all the benefits so that people&mdash;25, 30 million people&mdash;don't get health insurance, but we're going to keep the taxes that Obama raised, we just won't talk about that. And then, that way we can say we reduced the deficit. But obviously, you're doing some funny business there with the budget. <p>But look, nothing is free. The bottom line, though, is, do we want to continue to live in a society where we've got the most inefficient health care system on Earth, leaving millions of people exposed to the possibilities that they could lose everything because they get sick? Or we've got little children and families going to the emergency room once a week because they've got asthma and other preventable diseases, because their families aren't linked up with a primary care physician who is providing them regular care? Where the costs to society for reduced productivity, illnesses, et cetera, all burden our businesses? Is that the kind of society we aspire to? <p>And I think the answer is no. And the notion that we would resist, or at least some would resist as fiercely as they would&mdash;or as they have, make this their number-one agenda, is perpetuating a system in which millions of people across the country, hard-working Americans don't have access to health care, I think, is wrong. <p><i>Former President Clinton.</i> The&mdash;we have to close. But I will close with a story. I told you all this morning that the employee that our health access program lost in the Kenyan mall shooting was a Dutch nurse. And I spend&mdash;we spend a lot of time in the Netherlands; they&mdash;we get a lot of support there. Oxi is one of the biggest insurance companies in Europe. They're one of our partners here. I went to celebrate their 200th anniversary with them. They had been&mdash;they started as a fire insurance company with 39 farmers, 200 years ago. <p>And we were out there in this big farm field with a&mdash;in a tent in the shadow of a 13th-century church and a big Dutch windmill. And I asked the chairman of the company, I said, do you write health insurance? Because in the Netherlands there's no Medicare and no Medicaid, everybody is on an individual mandate, and you just subsidize people based on their incomes. <p>He said, yes, I write it; we all do. And he looked at me, and he said, but we don't make any money on it. And he said, we shouldn't. This guy is running a huge insurance&mdash;can you imagine somebody saying that in America? [<i>Laughter</i>] He said, we shouldn't. If I can't make money on this business doing traditional insurance business, I've got no business in the work. He said, look, health care is a public good, and you've got to find a way to finance it for everybody. And he said, it's just an intermediary function that somebody has to handle. But in the end, it's how it's delivered, how it's priced, and how healthy you can keep your people. <p>So the First Lady is trying to keep us all healthier, and you're trying to change the delivery and the pricing. And you have to cover everybody to do it. I think this is a big step forward for America. This will, over the next decade, not only make us healthier, but it will free up in the private sector largely funds that can then be reinvested in other areas of economic growth and give us a much more well-balanced economy. But first, we've got to get everybody to sign up. <p><i>President Obama.</i> Everybody, sign up. Go to healthcare.gov. Thank you very much. <p><i>President Clinton</i>. Thank you.\" "
"210" "\"Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, fellow delegates, ladies and gentlemen: Each year, we come together to reaffirm the founding vision of this institution. For most of recorded history, individual aspirations were subject to the whims of tyrants and empires. Divisions of race and religion and tribe were settled through the sword and the clash of armies. The idea that nations and peoples could come together in peace to solve their disputes and advance a common prosperity seemed unimaginable. <p>It took the awful carnage of two world wars to shift our thinking. The leaders who built the United Nations were not naive; they did not think this body could eradicate all wars. But in the wake of millions dead and continents in rubble, and with the development of nuclear weapons that could annihilate a planet, they understood that humanity could not survive the course it was on. And so they gave us this institution, believing that it could allow us to resolve conflicts, enforce rules of behavior, and build habits of cooperation that would grow stronger over time. <p>Now, for decades, the United Nations has in fact made a difference, from helping to eradicate disease to educating children, to brokering peace. But like every generation of leaders, we face new and profound challenges, and this body continues to be tested. The question is whether we possess the wisdom and the courage, as nation-states and members of an international community, to squarely meet those challenges, whether the United Nations can meet the tests of our time. <p>For much of my tenure as President, some of our most urgent challenges have revolved around an increasingly integrated global economy and our efforts to recover from the worst economic crisis of our lifetime. Now, 5 years after the global economy collapsed and thanks to coordinated efforts by the countries here today, jobs are being created, global financial systems have stabilized, and people are once again being lifted out of poverty. But this progress is fragile and unequal, and we still have work to do together to assure that our citizens can access the opportunities that they need to thrive in the 21st century. <p>Together, we've also worked to end a decade of war. Five years ago, nearly 180,000 Americans were serving in harm's way, and the war in Iraq was the dominant issue in our relationship with the rest of the world. Today, all of our troops have left Iraq. Next year, an international coalition will end its war in Afghanistan, having achieved its mission of dismantling the core of Al Qaida that attacked us on 9/11. <p>For the United States, these new circumstances have also meant shifting away from a perpetual war footing. Beyond bringing our troops home, we have limited the use of drones so they target only those who pose a continuing, imminent threat to the United States where capture is not feasible and there is a near certainty of no civilian casualties. We're transferring detainees to other countries and trying terrorists in courts of law, while working diligently to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. And just as we reviewed how we deploy our extraordinary military capabilities in a way that lives up to our ideals, we've begun to review the way that we gather intelligence so that we properly balance the legitimate security concerns of our citizens and allies with the privacy concerns that all people share. <p>As a result of this work and cooperation with allies and partners, the world is more stable than it was 5 years ago. But even a glance at today's headlines indicates that dangers remain. In Kenya, we've seen terrorists target innocent civilians in a crowded shopping mall, and our hearts go out to the families of those who have been affected. In Pakistan, nearly 100 people were recently killed by suicide bombers outside a church. In Iraq, killings and car bombs continue to be a terrible part of life. And meanwhile, Al Qaida has splintered into regional networks and militias, which doesn't give them the capacity at this point to carry out attacks like 9/11, but does pose serious threats to governments and diplomats, businesses and civilians, all across the globe. <p>Just as significantly, the convulsions in the Middle East and North Africa have laid bare deep divisions within societies, as an old order is upended and people grapple with what comes next. Peaceful movements have too often been answered by violence, from those resisting change and from extremists trying to hijack change. Sectarian conflict has reemerged. And the potential spread of weapons of mass destruction continues to cast a shadow over the pursuit of peace. <p>Nowhere have we seen these trends converge more powerfully than in Syria. There, peaceful protests against an authoritarian regime were met with repression and slaughter. In the face of such carnage, many retreated to their sectarian identity&mdash;Alawite and Sunni, Christian and Kurd&mdash;and the situation spiraled into civil war. <p>The international community recognized the stakes early on, but our response has not matched the scale of the challenge. Aid cannot keep pace with the suffering of the wounded and displaced. A peace process is stillborn. America and others have worked to bolster the moderate opposition, but extremist groups have still taken root to exploit the crisis. Asad's traditional allies have propped him up, citing principles of sovereignty to shield his regime. And on August 21, the regime used chemical weapons in an attack that killed more than 1,000 people, including hundreds of children. <p>Now, the crisis in Syria, and the destabilization of the region, goes to the heart of broader challenges that the international community must now confront. How should we respond to conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa&mdash;conflicts between countries, but also conflicts within them? How do we address the choice of standing callously by while children are subjected to nerve gas or embroiling ourselves in someone else's civil war? What's the role of force in resolving disputes that threaten the stability of the region and undermine all basic standards of civilized conduct? And what's the role of the United Nations and international law in meeting cries for justice? <p>Today I want to outline where the United States of America stands on these issues. With respect to Syria, we believe that as a starting point, the international community must enforce the ban on chemical weapons. When I stated my willingness to order a limited strike against the Asad regime in response to the brazen use of chemical weapons, I did not do so lightly. I did so because I believe it is in the security interest of the United States and in the interests of the world to meaningfully enforce a prohibition whose origins are older than the United Nations itself. The ban against the use of chemical weapons, even in war, has been agreed to by 98 percent of humanity. It is strengthened by the searing memories of soldiers suffocating in the trenches, Jews slaughtered in gas chambers, Iranians poisoned in the many tens of thousands. <p>The evidence is overwhelming that the Asad regime used such weapons on August 21. U.N. inspectors gave a clear accounting that advanced rockets fired large quantities of sarin gas at civilians. These rockets were fired from a regime-controlled neighborhood and landed in opposition neighborhoods. It's an insult to human reason&mdash;and to the legitimacy of this institution&mdash;to suggest that anyone other than the regime carried out this attack. <p>Now, I know that in the immediate aftermath of the attack, there were those who questioned the legitimacy of even a limited strike in the absence of a clear mandate from the Security Council. But without a credible military threat, the Security Council had demonstrated no inclination to act at all. However, as I've discussed with President Putin for over a year, most recently in St. Petersburg, my preference has always been a diplomatic resolution to this issue. And in the past several weeks, the United States, Russia, and our allies have reached an agreement to place Syria's chemical weapons under international control and then to destroy them. <p>The Syrian Government took a first step by giving an accounting of its stockpiles. Now there must be a strong Security Council resolution to verify that the Asad regime is keeping its commitments, and there must be consequences if they fail to do so. If we cannot agree even on this, then it will show that the United Nations is incapable of enforcing the most basic of international laws. On the other hand, if we succeed, it will send a powerful message that the use of chemical weapons has no place in the 21st century and that this body means what it says. <p>Now, agreement on chemical weapons should energize a larger diplomatic effort to reach a political settlement within Syria. I do not believe that military action&mdash;by those within Syria, or by external powers&mdash;can achieve a lasting peace. Nor do I believe that America or any nation should determine who will lead Syria; that is for the Syrian people to decide. Nevertheless, a leader who slaughtered his citizens and gassed children to death cannot regain the legitimacy to lead a badly fractured country. The notion that Syria can somehow return to a prewar status quo is a fantasy. <p>So it's time for Russia and Iran to realize that insisting on Asad's rule will lead directly to the outcome that they fear: an increasingly violent space for extremists to operate. In turn, those of us who continue to support the moderate opposition must persuade them that the Syrian people cannot afford a collapse of state institutions and that a political settlement cannot be reached without addressing the legitimate fears and concerns of Alawites and other minorities. <p>We are committed to working this political track. And as we pursue a settlement, let's remember, this is not a zero-sum endeavor. We're no longer in a cold war. There's no great game to be won, nor does America have any interest in Syria beyond the well-being of its people, the stability of its neighbors, the elimination of chemical weapons, and ensuring that it does not become a safe haven for terrorists. <p>I welcome the influence of all nations that can help bring about a peaceful resolution of Syria's civil war. And as we move the Geneva process forward, I urge all nations here to step up to meet humanitarian needs in Syria and surrounding countries. America has committed over a billion dollars to this effort, and today I can announce that we will be providing an additional $340 million. No aid can take the place of a political resolution that gives the Syrian people the chance to rebuild their country, but it can help desperate people to survive. <p>What broader conclusions can be drawn from America's policy towards Syria? I know there are those who have been frustrated by our unwillingness to use our military might to depose Asad and believe that a failure to do so indicates a weakening of American resolve in the region. Others have suggested that my willingness to direct even limited military strikes to deter the further use of chemical weapons shows we've learned nothing from Iraq and that America continues to seek control over the Middle East for our own purposes. In this way, the situation in Syria mirrors a contradiction that has persisted in the region for decades: the United States is chastised for meddling in the region, accused of having a hand in all manner of conspiracy; at the same time, the United States is blamed for failing to do enough to solve the region's problems and for showing indifference toward suffering Muslim populations. <p>I realize some of this is inevitable, given America's role in the world. But these contradictory attitudes have a practical impact on the American people's support for our involvement in the region and allow leaders in the region&mdash;as well as the international community sometimes&mdash;to avoid addressing difficult problems themselves. <p>So let me take this opportunity to outline what has been U.S. policy towards the Middle East and North Africa and what will be my policy during the remainder of my Presidency. <p>The United States of America is prepared to use all elements of our power, including military force, to secure our core interests in the region. We will confront external aggression against our allies and partners, as we did in the Gulf war. <p>We will ensure the free flow of energy from the region to the world. Although America is steadily reducing our own dependence on imported oil, the world still depends on the region's energy supply, and a severe disruption could destabilize the entire global economy. <p>We will dismantle terrorist networks that threaten our people. Wherever possible, we will build the capacity of our partners, respect the sovereignty of nations, and work to address the root causes of terror. But when it's necessary to defend the United States against terrorist attack, we will take direct action. <p>And finally, we will not tolerate the development or use of weapons of mass destruction. Just as we consider the use of chemical weapons in Syria to be a threat to our own national security, we reject the development of nuclear weapons that could trigger a nuclear arms race in the region and undermine the global nonproliferation regime. <p>Now, to say that these are America's core interests is not to say that they are our only interests. We deeply believe it is in our interests to see a Middle East and North Africa that is peaceful and prosperous, and we'll continue to promote democracy and human rights and open markets, because we believe these practices achieve peace and prosperity. But I also believe that we can rarely achieve these objectives through unilateral American action, particularly through military action. Iraq shows us that democracy cannot simply be imposed by force. Rather, these objectives are best achieved when we partner with the international community and with the countries and peoples of the region. <p>So what does this mean going forward? In the near term, America's diplomatic efforts will focus on two particular issues: Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons and the Arab-Israeli conflict. While these issues are not the cause of all the region's problems, they have been a major source of instability for far too long, and resolving them can help serve as a foundation for a broader peace. <p>The United States and Iran have been isolated from one another since the Islamic Revolution of 1979. This mistrust has deep roots. Iranians have long complained of a history of U.S. interference in their affairs and of America's role in overthrowing an Iranian Government during the cold war. On the other hand, Americans see an Iranian Government that has declared the United States an enemy and directly&mdash;or through proxies&mdash;taken American hostages, killed U.S. troops and civilians, and threatened our ally Israel with destruction. <p>I don't believe this difficult history can be overcome overnight; the suspicions run too deep. But I do believe that if we can resolve the issue of Iran's nuclear program, that can serve as a major step down a long road towards a different relationship, one based on mutual interests and mutual respect. <p>Now, since I took office, I've made it clear in letters to the Supreme Leader in Iran and more recently to President Rouhani that America prefers to resolve our concerns over Iran's nuclear program peacefully, although we are determined to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. We are not seeking regime change, and we respect the right of the Iranian people to access peaceful nuclear energy. Instead, we insist that the Iranian Government meet its responsibilities under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and U.N. Security Council resolutions. <p>Now, meanwhile, the Supreme Leader has issued a fatwa against the development of nuclear weapons, and President Rouhani has just recently reiterated that the Islamic Republic will never develop a nuclear weapon. <p>So these statements made by our respective Governments should offer the basis for a meaningful agreement. We should be able to achieve a resolution that respects the rights of the Iranian people, while giving the world confidence that the Iranian program is peaceful. But to succeed, conciliatory words will have to be matched by actions that are transparent and verifiable. After all, it's the Iranian Government's choices that have led to the comprehensive sanctions that are currently in place. And this not&mdash;this is not simply an issue between the United States and Iran. The world has seen Iran evade its responsibilities in the past and has an abiding interest in making sure that Iran meets its obligations in the future. <p>But I want to be clear: We are encouraged that President Rouhani received from the Iranian people a mandate to pursue a more moderate course. And given President Rouhani's stated commitment to reach an agreement, I am directing John Kerry to pursue this effort with the Iranian Government, in close cooperation with the European Union, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China. <p>The roadblocks may prove to be too great, but I firmly believe the diplomatic path must be tested. For while the status quo will only deepen Iran's isolation, Iran's genuine commitment to go down a different path will be good for the region and the world and will help the Iranian people meet their extraordinary potential: in commerce and culture, in science and education. <p>We are also determined to resolve a conflict that goes back even further than our differences with Iran, and that is the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis. I've made it clear that the United States will never compromise our commitment to Israel's security, nor our support for its existence as a Jewish state. Earlier this year, in Jerusalem, I was inspired by young Israelis who stood up for the belief that peace was necessary, just, and possible. And I believe there is a growing recognition within Israel that the occupation of the West Bank is tearing at the democratic fabric of the Jewish State. But the children of Israel have the right to live in a world where the nations assembled in this body fully recognize their country and where we unequivocally reject those who fire rockets at their homes or incite others to hate them. <p>Likewise, the United States remains committed to the belief that the Palestinian people have a right to live with security and dignity in their own sovereign state. On the same trip, I had the opportunity to meet with young Palestinians in Ramallah whose ambition and incredible potential are matched by the pain they feel in having no firm place in the community of nations. They are understandably cynical that real progress will ever be made, and they're frustrated by their families enduring the daily indignity of occupation. But they, too, recognize that two states is the only real path to peace, because just as the Palestinian people must not be displaced, the State of Israel is here to stay. <p>So the time is now ripe for the entire international community to get behind the pursuit of peace. Already, Israeli and Palestinian leaders have demonstrated a willingness to take significant political risks. President Abbas has put aside efforts to short-cut the pursuit of peace and come to the negotiating table. Prime Minister Netanyahu has released Palestinian prisoners and reaffirmed his commitment to a Palestinian state. Current talks are focused on final status issues of borders and security, refugees and Jerusalem. <p>So now the rest of us must be willing to take risks as well. Friends of Israel, including the United States, must recognize that Israel's security as a Jewish and democratic state depend on the realization of a Palestinian state, and we should say so clearly. Arab States, and those who have supported the Palestinians, must recognize that stability will only be served through a two-state solution and a secure Israel. <p>All of us must recognize that peace will be a powerful tool to defeat extremists throughout the region and embolden those who are prepared to build a better future. And moreover, ties of trade and commerce between Israelis and Arabs could be an engine of growth and opportunity at a time when too many young people in the region are languishing without work. So let's emerge from the familiar corners of blame and prejudice. Let's support Israeli and Palestinian leaders who are prepared to walk the difficult road to peace. <p>Now, real breakthroughs on these two issues&mdash;Iran's nuclear program, and Israeli-Palestinian peace&mdash;would have a profound and positive impact on the entire Middle East and North Africa. But the current convulsions arising out of the Arab Spring remind us that a just and lasting peace cannot be measured only by agreements between nations. It must also be measured by our ability to resolve conflict and promote justice within nations. And by that measure, it's clear that all of us have a lot more work to do. <p>When peaceful transitions began in Tunisia and Egypt, the entire world was filled with hope. And although the United States&mdash;like others&mdash;was struck by the speed of transition, and although we did not&mdash;and in fact could not&mdash;dictate events, we chose to support those who called for change. And we did so based on the belief that while these transitions will be hard and take time, societies based upon democracy and openness and the dignity of the individual will ultimately be more stable, more prosperous, and more peaceful. <p>Over the last few years, particularly in Egypt, we've seen just how hard this transition will be. Muhammad Mursi was democratically elected, but proved unwilling or unable to govern in a way that was fully inclusive. The Interim Government that replaced him responded to the desires of millions of Egyptians who believed the revolution had taken a wrong turn, but it, too, has made decisions inconsistent with inclusive democracy, through an emergency law and restrictions on the press and civil society and opposition parties. <p>Of course, America has been attacked by all sides of this internal conflict, simultaneously accused of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and engineering their removal of power. In fact, the United States has purposely avoided choosing sides. Our overriding interest throughout these past few years has been to encourage a government that legitimately reflects the will of the Egyptian people and recognizes true democracy as requiring a respect for minority rights and the rule of law, freedom of speech and assembly, and a strong civil society. <p>That remains our interest today. And so, going forward, the United States will maintain a constructive relationship with the Interim Government that promotes core interests like the Camp David Accords and counterterrorism. We'll continue support in areas like education that directly benefit the Egyptian people. But we have not proceeded with the delivery of certain military systems, and our support will depend upon Egypt's progress in pursuing a more democratic path. <p>And our approach to Egypt reflects a larger point: The United States will at times work with Governments that do not meet, at least in our view, the highest international expectations, but who work with us on our core interests. Nevertheless, we will not stop asserting principles that are consistent with our ideals, whether that means opposing the use of violence as a means of suppressing dissent or supporting the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. <p>We will reject the notion that these principles are simply Western exports, incompatible with Islam or the Arab World. We believe they are the birthright of every person. And while we recognize that our influence will at times be limited, although we will be wary of efforts to impose democracy through military force, and although we will at times be accused of hypocrisy and inconsistency, we will be engaged in the region for the long haul. For the hard work of forging freedom and democracy is the task of a generation. <p>And this includes efforts to resolve sectarian tensions that continue to surface in places like Iraq, Bahrain, and Syria. We understand such longstanding issues cannot be solved by outsiders; they must be addressed by Muslim communities themselves. But we've seen grinding conflicts come to an end before&mdash;most recently in Northern Ireland, where Catholics and Protestants finally recognized that an endless cycle of conflict was causing both communities to fall behind a fast-moving world. And so we believe those same sectarian conflicts can be overcome in the Middle East and North Africa. <p>To summarize, the United States has a hard-earned humility when it comes to our ability to determine events inside other countries. The notion of American empire may be useful propaganda, but it isn't borne out by America's current policy or by public opinion. Indeed, as recent debates within the United States over Syria clearly showed, the danger for the world is not an America that is too eager to immerse itself in the affairs of other countries or to take on every problem in the region as its own. The danger for the world is that the United States, after a decade of war&mdash;rightly concerned about issues back home, aware of the hostility that our engagement in the region has engendered throughout the Muslim world&mdash;may disengage, creating a vacuum of leadership that no other nation is ready to fill. <p>Now, I believe such disengagement would be a mistake. I believe America must remain engaged for our own security. But I also believe the world is better for it. Some may disagree, but I believe America is exceptional, in part because we have shown a willingness through the sacrifice of blood and treasure to stand up not only for our own narrow self-interests, but for the interests of all. <p>I must be honest though. We're far more likely to invest our energy in those countries that want to work with us, that invest in their people instead of a corrupt few, that embrace a vision of society where everyone can contribute: men and women; Shia or Sunni; Muslim, Christian or Jew. Because from Europe to Asia, from Africa to the Americas, nations that have persevered on a democratic path have emerged more prosperous, more peaceful, and more invested in upholding our common security and our common humanity. And I believe that the same will hold true for the Arab world. <p>And this leads me to a final point. There will be times when the breakdown of societies is so great, the violence against civilians so substantial, that the international community will be called upon to act. This will require new thinking and some very tough choices. While the United Nations was designed to prevent wars between states, increasingly we face the challenge of preventing slaughter within states. And these challenges will grow more pronounced as we are confronted with states that are fragile or failing, places where horrendous violence can put innocent men, women, and children at risk, with no hope of protection from their national institutions. <p>I have made it clear that even when America's core interests are not directly threatened, we stand ready to do our part to prevent mass atrocities and protect basic human rights. But we cannot and should not bear that burden alone. In Mali, we supported both the French intervention that successfully pushed back Al Qaida and the African forces who are keeping the peace. In Eastern Africa, we are working with partners to bring the Lord's Resistance Army to an end. And in Libya, when the Security Council provided a mandate to protect civilians, America joined a coalition that took action. And because of what we did there, countless lives were saved, and a tyrant could not kill his way back to power. <p>I know that some now criticize the action in Libya as an object lesson. They point to the problems that the country now confronts: a democratically elected Government struggling to provide security; armed groups, in some places extremists, ruling parts of a fractured land. And so these critics argue that any intervention to protect civilians is doomed to fail: \\"Look at Libya.\\" Now, no one is more mindful of these problems than I am, for they resulted in the death of four outstanding U.S. citizens who were committed to the Libyan people, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, a man whose courageous efforts helped save the city of Benghazi. But does anyone truly believe that the situation in Libya would be better if Qadhafi had been allowed to kill, imprison, or brutalize his people into submission? It's far more likely that without international action, Libya would now be engulfed in civil war and bloodshed. <p>So we live in a world of imperfect choices. Different nations will not agree on the need for action in every instance, and the principle of sovereignty is at the center of our international order. But sovereignty cannot be a shield for tyrants to commit wanton murder or an excuse for the international community to turn a blind eye. While we need to be modest in our belief that we can remedy every evil, while we need to be mindful that the world is full of unintended consequences, should we really accept the notion that the world is powerless in the face of a Rwanda or Srebrenica? If that's the world that people want to live in, they should say so and reckon with the cold logic of mass graves. <p>But I believe we can embrace a different future. And if we don't want to choose between inaction and war, we must get better&mdash;all of us&mdash;at the policies that prevent the breakdown of basic order: through respect for the responsibilities of nations and the rights of individuals; through meaningful sanctions for those who break the rules; through dogged diplomacy that resolves the root causes of conflict, not merely its aftermath; through development assistance that brings hope to the marginalized. And yes, sometimes&mdash;although this will not be enough&mdash;there are going to be moments where the international community will need to acknowledge that the multilateral use of military force may be required to prevent the very worst from occurring. <p>Ultimately, this is the international community that America seeks, one where nations do not covet the land or resources of other nations, but one in which we carry out the founding purpose of this institution and where we all take responsibility; a world in which the rules established out of the horrors of war can help us resolve conflicts peacefully and prevent the kinds of wars that our forefathers fought; a world where human beings can live with dignity and meet their basic needs, whether they live in New York or Nairobi, in Peshawar or Damascus. <p>These are extraordinary times, with extraordinary opportunities. Thanks to human progress, a child born anywhere on Earth today can do things today that 60 years ago would have been out of reach for the mass of humanity. I saw this in Africa, where nations moving beyond conflict are now poised to take off. And America is with them, partnering to feed the hungry and care for the sick and to bring power to places off the grid. <p>I see it across the Pacific region, where hundreds of millions have been lifted out of poverty in a single generation. I see it in the faces of young people everywhere who can access the entire world with the click of a button and who are eager to join the cause of eradicating extreme poverty and combating climate change, starting businesses, expanding freedom, and leaving behind the old ideological battles of the past. That's what's happening in Asia and Africa. It's happening in Europe and across the Americas. That's the future that the people of the Middle East and North Africa deserve as well, one where they can focus on opportunity, instead of whether they'll be killed or repressed because of who they are or what they believe. <p>Time and again, nations and people have shown our capacity to change&mdash;to live up to humanity's highest ideals, to choose our better history. Last month, I stood where, 50 years ago, Martin Luther King, Jr., told America about his dream, at a time when many people of my race could not even vote for President. Earlier this year, I stood in the small cell where Nelson Mandela endured decades cut off from his own people and the world. Who are we to believe that today's challenges cannot be overcome, when we've seen what changes the human spirit can bring? Who in this hall can argue that the future belongs to those who seek to repress that spirit rather than those who seek to liberate it? <p>I know what side of history I want to the United States of America to be on. We're ready to meet tomorrow's challenges with you, firm in the belief that all men and women are in fact created equal, each individual possessed with a dignity and inalienable rights that cannot be denied. That is why we look to the future not with fear, but with hope. And that's why we remain convinced that this community of nations can deliver a more peaceful, prosperous, and just world to the next generation. <p>Thank you very much.\" "
"211" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Maryland! Hello, PGCC! Well, it's good to be back in PG County. <p>Give it up for one of the hardest working, most effective Governors in the country, Governor Martin O'Malley. <p>Well, it is great to be with all of you here today&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> I love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. It's wonderful being here. Wonderful. <p>We also have a few folks who work so hard on behalf of the people of Maryland every single day: Senator Ben Cardin is here. Congressman Steny Hoyer is here. And Congresswoman Donna Edwards is here. <p>And all of you are here. Sometimes, you just need to escape Beltway politics for a little bit, even if you're just a mile or two outside the Beltway. <p>Now, I know that a lot of you have seen some of the antics going on in Congress right now. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I wanted to take a little bit of time today to speak with you&mdash;the people who send us to serve&mdash;about something that is critical to our families, critical to our businesses, critical to our economy. And that is the reforms that we are making to our health care system. <p>There's been a lot of things said, a lot of misinformation, a lot of confusion. But there are few things more fundamental to the economic security of the middle class and everybody who's trying to get into the middle class than health care. <p>For a long time, America was the only advanced economy in the world where health care was not a right, but a privilege. We spent more; we got less. We left tens of millions of Americans without the security of health insurance. By the time the financial crisis hit, most folks' premiums had more than doubled in about a decade. About one in 10 Americans who got their health care through their employer lost that coverage. So the health care system was not working. And the rising costs of health care burdened businesses and became the biggest driver of our long-term deficits. <p>But this has always been about more than just statistics. Everywhere I went as I ran for President back in 2007, 2008, everyplace I've gone as President, I would hear stories from folks just like you of insurers that denied a child coverage because he had a preexisting condition like asthma, of cancer survivors that had to choose between their home or their health care, of small businesses who wanted to do the right thing by their employees, but had seen their insurance premiums go up so high that they just couldn't do it anymore. <p>And these stories were personal for me because I remember my mom worrying about how she was going to deal with her finances when she got very sick. I remember the fear Michelle and I felt when Sasha was a few months old and she got meningitis. And we raced to the hospital, and they had to give her a spinal tap. And we didn't know what was wrong, and we were terrified, never felt so scared or helpless in all of my life. But we were fortunate enough to have good health insurance. <p>And I remember looking around that emergency room and thinking, what about the parents who aren't that lucky? What about the parents who get hit with a bill of 20,000 or $30,000 and they've got no idea how to pay for it? What about those parents whose kids have a chronic illness like asthma and have to keep on going back to the emergency room because they don't have a regular doctor and the bills never stop coming? Who is going to stand up for them? <p>In the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one should go broke just because they get sick. In the United States of America, health care is not a privilege for the fortunate few, it is a right. And I knew that if we didn't do something about our unfair and inefficient health care system, it would keep driving up our deficits, it would keep burdening our businesses, it would keep hurting our families, and it would keep holding back economic growth. <p>That's why we took on a broken health care system. That's why, with the help of folks like Steny and Ben and Donna, we got it through Congress. That's why we've been implementing it. That's why we are going to see it through. The Affordable Care Act is here. <p>I don't have to tell you, it was a challenge to get it done. [<i>Laughter</i>] A lot of special interests who liked the system just the way it was fought us tooth and nail. Then Republicans decided it was good politics to fight it, even though the plan we proposed drew on a lot of Republican ideas. <p>But despite all the obstacles, the Affordable Care Act passed both Houses of Congress. I signed it into law. The Supreme Court ruled it constitutional. Republicans in Congress have now voted more than 40 times to undermine or repeal it. Their candidate for President ran on a platform to repeal it. And at every step, they've been unsuccessful. <p>Now, 5 days from now&mdash;5 days from now&mdash;on October 1, millions of Americans who don't have health insurance because they've been priced out of the market or because they've&mdash;denied access because of a preexisting condition, they will finally be able to buy quality, affordable health insurance. In 5 days. <p>Preexisting conditions, whether it's back pain or allergies that were sticking you with sky-high premiums, those no longer will prevent you from getting affordable coverage that you need. That's going to happen in 5 days. <p>Now, of course, the closer we've gotten to this date, the more irresponsible folks who are opposed to this law have become. Some of the same Republicans who warned 3 years ago that this law would be \\"Armageddon\\"&mdash;that's what they said, \\"Armageddon\\"&mdash;now they're threatening steps that actually would badly hurt our entire economy, not because of the Affordable Care Act, but because of what they're threatening to do. <p>Some have threatened a Government shutdown if they can't shut down this law. Others have actually threatened an economic shutdown by refusing to pay America's bills if they can't delay the law. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> That's not going to happen as long as I'm President. The Affordable Care Act is here to stay. And so today I want to speak plainly, clearly, honestly, about what it means for you and for the people you care about. <p>Now, let's start with the fact that even before the Affordable Care Act fully takes effect, about 85 percent of Americans already have health insurance, either through their job or through Medicare or through the individual market. So if you're one of these folks, it's reasonable that you might worry whether health care reform is going to create changes that are a problem for you, especially when you're bombarded with all sorts of fear-mongering. <p>So the first thing you need to know is this: If you already have health care, you don't have to do anything. In fact, for the past few years, since I signed the Affordable Care Act, a lot of you have been enjoying new benefits and protections that you didn't before even if you didn't know they were coming from Obamacare. <p>Let me just give you a few examples. Because of the Affordable Care Act, more than 100 million Americans have gotten free preventive care like mammograms and contraceptive care with no copays. Because of the Affordable Care Act, 3 million young adults under age 26 have gained coverage by staying on their parent's plan. Because of the Affordable Care Act, millions of seniors on Medicare have saved hundreds of dollars on their prescription medicine. They've been getting their prescription drugs cheaper. <p>Because of the Affordable Care Act, just this year, 8.5 million families actually got an average of a hundred dollars back from their insurance companies because the insurance companies spent too much on things like overhead and not enough on actual Medicare&mdash;medical care. Because of the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies can no longer put lifetime limits on the care your family needs or discriminate against children with preexisting conditions. And starting on January 1, they won't be able to charge women more for their insurance just because they're women. [<i>Applause</i>] That's a good thing. <p>So tens of millions of Americans are already better off because of the benefits and protections provided by the Affordable Care Act. Like I said, they may not know why that rebate check came in the mail. [<i>Laughter</i>] They may not notice that they're not having to copay for some preventive care that they received. But they're getting those benefits. That's already happening. That's already in place today. It's been going on for several years. <p>Those are the benefits of Obamacare, the law that Republicans want to repeal. Although it's interesting, when you ask Republicans whether they'd repeal the benefits I just mentioned, when you say to them, well, do you think it's the right thing to do to let young people stay on their parents' plans so they can keep insurance? Or do you want to prevent seniors from getting more discounts on their prescription drugs? Then, they'll say, no, no, no, we like those. Those things are okay. [<i>Laughter</i>] So they don't like Obamacare in theory, but some of the component parts, at least those that poll well, they don't mind. <p>But that's already in place. Now, here's the second thing you need to know. If you're one of over 40 million Americans who don't have health insurance&mdash;including hundreds of thousands of folks right here in Maryland&mdash;starting on Tuesday, 5 days from now, you'll finally have the same chance to buy quality, affordable health care as everybody else. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Thanks, Mr. President! <p><i>The President.</i> And I want to break this down for you. I want you to know exactly how it works. The major reason why people don't have health insurance is either they don't have a job; or they do have a job, but their employer doesn't offer health insurance; or they're self-employed. If you've ever tried to buy health insurance on your own, you know it is really, really expensive. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes! <p><i>The President.</i> It's even worse if you have a preexisting condition, and up to half of all Americans have a preexisting condition. See, the reason it's really expensive if you're buying it on your own is because you're not part of a big group, you're not part of a group plan. And what groups do is they spread risk between sick and healthy people, between older and younger people. And groups&mdash;because insurance companies want the business of groups; that's a lot of customers&mdash;they'll negotiate a better deal with a group than they will with an individual. <p>So if you're on your own, you're out there trying to negotiate with an insurance company, they're looking, and they're saying, well, you take it or leave it, I'm going to charge you a whole lot of money. And if you've got a preexisting condition, they'll say, we don't even want to insure you because we think you might get sick later on and we don't really want to pay, we just want to take in premiums. <p>So if you're not part of a group, you're either uninsurable, or you need to spend a small fortune on insurance that oftentimes is not very good. That's what's happening right now. The Affordable Care Act was designed to solve that problem. And here's how we do it. <p>Starting on Tuesday, every American can visit healthcare.gov to find out what's called the insurance marketplace for your State. Here in Maryland, I actually think it's called marylandhealthconnection.gov&mdash;marylandhealthconnection.gov. But if you go to healthcare.gov, you can look and they'll tell you where to go. They'll link to your State. <p>Now, this is real simple. It's a web site where you can compare and purchase affordable health insurance plans side by side, the same way you shop for a plane ticket on Kayak&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;same way you shop for a TV on Amazon. You just go on, and you start looking, and here are all the options. <p>It's buying insurance on the private market, but because now you're part of a big group plan&mdash;right, everybody in Maryland is all logging in and taking a look at the prices&mdash;you've got new choices. Now you've got new competition, because insurers want your business. And that means you will have cheaper prices. <p>So you enter in some basic information about yourself, what level of coverage you're looking for. After that, you'll be presented with a list of quality, affordable plans that are available in your area. It will say clearly what each plan covers, what each plan costs. The price will be right there. It will be fully transparent. <p>Before this law, only a handful of States required insurance companies to offer you instant price quotes, but because of this law, insurers in all 50 States will have to offer you instant price quotes. And so if you've ever tried to buy insurance on your own, I promise you, this is a lot easier. It's like booking a hotel or a plane ticket. <p>And here's another thing about these new plans. If you're one of those folks who have a preexisting condition, these plans have to offer you coverage. They can't use your medical history to charge you more than anybody else. If you couldn't afford coverage for your child because he had asthma, he's covered. If you couldn't afford coverage because you were told heartburn was a preexisting condition, you're covered. [<i>Laughter</i>] If you're one of the 45 million Americans with a mental illness, you are covered. <p>If you're a young adult or entrepreneur striking out on your own, you're covered. If you're a young couple who previously had insurance that didn't include maternity benefits and now suddenly you need some maternity benefits, you're covered. If you lose your job and your health care with it, you're covered. <p>So all those things that would deny you coverage in the past, that were the cruelties of a broken health care system, on January 1, when these plans take effect&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> October 1! <p><i>The President.</i> No, no, no, hold on. [<i>Laughter</i>] Hold on. I know what I'm talking about. You sign up starting on Tuesday. [<i>Laughter</i>] The plan will take effect on January 1. And when these plans take effect, all those things change forever. <p>Now, what about choice and cost? In States where the Federal Government helps run these marketplaces, the average American will have more than 50 different plans to choose from, with different levels of coverage. And because insurance companies are competing against one another for your business, a lot of Americans will pay significantly less for their insurance than they do now. Premiums are going to be different in different parts of the country, depending on how much coverage you buy. But 95 percent of uninsured Americans will see their premiums cost less than was expected. And many families, including more than two-thirds of all young adults who buy health care through these online marketplaces, are also going to be eligible for tax credits that bring down the cost down even further. <p>So let me be specific. Right here in Maryland, average 25-year-old&mdash;have we got any 25-year-olds here? All right, so we've got a few. Some of you raised your hand, I'm not sure you're&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. All right. <p>Here in Maryland, average 25-year-old making $25,000 a year could end up getting covered for as little as $80 a month&mdash;$80 a month. Here in Maryland, a family of four making $60,000 a year could get covered for as little as $164 a month. <p>It's the same story across the country. In Texas, average 27-year-old making $25,000 could get covered for as little as $83 a month. In Florida, a family of four making $50,000 could get covered for as little as $104 a month. <p>And keep in mind the Government didn't set these prices. The insurance companies, they proposed these prices because they want to get in with these big groups, with all these new customers. The insurance companies are saying these marketplaces, this law, will work. They're putting money on the line because they think it will work. Competition, choice, transparency&mdash;all these things are keeping costs down. <p>Now, knowing you can offer your family the security of health care, that's priceless. Now you can do it for the cost of your cable bill, probably less than your cell phone bill. [<i>Laughter</i>] Think about that. Good health insurance for the price of your cell phone bill or less. <p>And let's say you're a young woman, you just turned&mdash;I'm interested in this, because I got two daughters, right? Let's say you just turned 26. Let's say you can't stay on your parent's plan anymore. If you buy health care through the marketplace, your plan has to cover free checkups, flu shots, contraceptive care. So you might end up getting more health care each month than you're paying for the premiums. <p>All told, nearly 6 in 10 Americans without health insurance today will be able to get covered for a hundred dollars or less. It would actually be 8 in 10 if every Governor were working as hard as Governor O'Malley to make the Affordable Care Act work for their citizens. <p>Unfortunately, we've still got a few Republican Governors who are so opposed to the very idea of the law&mdash;or at least they're doing it for the politics&mdash;that they haven't lifted a finger to help cover more people. Some of them have actually tried to harm the law before it takes effect. <p>But a lot of Republican Governors are putting politics aside and doing the right thing. You've got&mdash;and they deserve congratulations for that. It wasn't easy for them. But you've got conservative Governors in Ohio, in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, and Arizona&mdash;about eight Republican Governors in all, they've decided to expand Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act to cover more people in their States. And millions of Americans without insurance will get coverage through these programs. <p>So that's what the Affordable Care Act is. That's what all the fuss is about. We're giving more benefits and protections for folks who already have health insurance, and we created a new market&mdash;basically, a big group plan&mdash;for folks without health insurance so that they get a better deal, and then we're providing tax credits to help folks afford it. <p>You would think that would not be so controversial. [<i>Laughter</i>] You would think people would say, okay, let's go ahead and let's do this so everybody has health insurance coverage. The result is more choice, more competition, real health care security. <p>And one question people ask: How is it possible to do all this and keep costs down? Well, part of what we did was build into the law all sorts of measures to assure that the growth of health care costs would start slowing down. And it has. See, under the old system, doctors and hospitals, they were rewarded not for the quality of care, but for the quantity of care. They'd get paid for the number of procedures they did instead of whether they were working or not. Now there are penalties for hospitals with high readmission rates. And last year, surprisingly enough, for the first time ever, hospital readmission rates for Medicare patients actually fell. Right? That means fewer taxpayer dollars go to providers that don't serve their patients well. <p>Over the past 5 years, we've more than doubled the adoption of electronic health records for physicians. So that means they can track what's going on better and make fewer mistakes. New technology startup companies are coming up with new inventions to monitor patient health, prevent infections. There's innovation going on all across the country. As a consequence, today, Medicare costs per enrollee are rising at the slowest rate in years. Employer-based health care costs are growing at about one-third the rate of a decade ago. <p>All told, since I signed the Affordable Care Act into law, we have seen the slowest growth in health care costs on record. <p>All right, so let's think about this. If you've got health insurance, you're getting better protections, better benefits. If you don't have health insurance, you're now getting to be part of a group plan. And health care costs overall are rising much more slowly than they did before we signed the law. So far, so good. So what's all the fuss about? What is it that everybody&mdash;what is that these Republicans are just so mad about? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> No, no, no, look, I want to be honest. There are parts of the bill that some folks don't like. To help pay for the program, the wealthiest Americans&mdash;families who make more than $250,000 a year&mdash;will have to pay a little bit more. Extremely costly health insurance plans will no longer qualify for unlimited tax breaks. And most people who can afford health insurance now have to take responsibility to buy health insurance or pay a penalty. <p>Right? Now, the reason we do that is, when uninsured people who can afford to get health insurance don't, and then they get sick or they get hit by a car, and they show up at the emergency room, who do you think pays for that? <p><i>Audience members.</i> We do. <p><i>The President.</i> You do, in the form of higher premiums. Because the hospitals, they've got to get their money back somehow. So if they're treating somebody who doesn't have health insurance, they jack up premiums for everybody who does have health insurance. It's like a hidden tax of a thousand dollars per family every year who has got health insurance. So we're saying, well, that's not fair. If you can afford to get health insurance, don't dump the costs on us. The law also requires employers with more than 50 employees to either provide health insurance for your workers or pay a penalty. <p>Now, some folks say, well, that's not fair. But if you are an employer, you can afford to provide health insurance, you don't, your employees get sick, they go to the emergency room or they end up on Medicaid because you're not doing what you're doing&mdash;you should be doing, why is it everybody else should be bearing those costs? <p>Now, there are some folks who disagree with me on this. They say that violates people's liberty, telling them they've got to get health insurance. Well, I disagree. So did Congress when it passed this bill into law. It is unfair for folks to game the system and make the rest of us pay for it. It's unfair for responsible employers who are doing the right thing, giving their employees health insurance, to get undercut by some operator that's not providing health insurance for their employees. That puts the employer who's doing the right thing at a disadvantage, right? <p>So this idea that you've got responsibilities&mdash;everybody&mdash;that's what Massachusetts did when they passed their health care plan a few years ago. And by the way, today, in Massachusetts, almost everybody is covered, and the system works pretty well. So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>All right, let me just wrap up by saying this: Like any law, like any big product launch, there are going to be some glitches as this thing unfolds. Folks in different parts of the country will have different experiences. It's going to be smoother in places like Maryland where Governors are working to implement it rather than fight it. But somewhere around the country, there's going to be a computer glitch, and the web site's not working quite the way it's supposed to, or something happens where there's some error made somewhere; that will happen. That happens whenever you roll out a new program. And I guarantee you, the opponents of the law, they'll have their cameras ready to document anything that doesn't go completely right, and they'll send it to the news folks, and they'll say, look at this, this thing's not working. <p>But most of the stories you'll hear about how Obamacare just can't work, it's just not based on facts. Every time they have predicted something not working, it's worked. I mean, they said that these rates would come in real high and everybody's premiums would be sky high. And it turns out, lo and behold, actually, the prices came in lower than we expected, lower than I predicted. That's how well competition and choice work. <p>They said this would be a disaster in terms of jobs. There's no widespread evidence that the Affordable Care Act is hurting jobs. One of John McCain's former economic advisers admitted just this week&mdash;and I'm quoting here&mdash;\\"I was expecting to see it. I was looking for it,\\" but \\"it's not there.\\" It's not there. <p>So the reason is reforming health care is going to help the economy over the long term. Not only will it help lower costs for businesses, not only will it help families, it will free up entrepreneurship in this country. Because if you've got a great idea for your own business, but you've never tried it because your spouse had a preexisting condition and you didn't want to lose your employer-based coverage, you've got the ability now to get your own coverage. That's security. That's freedom. <p>So we're now only 5 days away from finishing the job. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Five days away. <p><i>The President.</i> Five days. Starting on Tuesday, you can sign up. But you don't have to sign up on Tuesday; you've got 6 months to enroll in these new plans. You can go to the web site; you can check it out; you can see if what I'm saying is true. [<i>Laughter</i>] You can sign up next week. You can sign up next month. You can sign up 2 months from now, 3 months from now. But you can sign up. <p>Tell your friends, tell your classmates, tell your family members about the new health care choices. Talk to folks at your church, in your classroom. You're going to a football game, basketball game, talk to them. Tell them what the law means. <p>And over the next few months, State and local leaders from across the country are going to hold events to help get the word out. Go out there and join them. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius is in Texas right now, working with folks on the ground to make sure this law works for Texas families. All across the country, people are getting ready. All kinds of people are working hand in hand because we're all in this together. That's when America is at its best. That's what this country is all about. <p>But we need you to spread the word. But you don't have to take my word for it. If you talk to somebody who says, well, I don't know, I was watching FOX News, and they said this was horrible&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;you can say, you know what, don't take my word for it, go on the web site. See for yourself what the prices are, see for yourself what the choices are, then make up your own mind. <p>Just make&mdash;that's all I'm asking. Make up your own mind. I promise you, if you go on the web site and it turns out you're going to save 100, 200, $300 a month on your insurance, or you'll be able to buy insurance for the first time, even if you didn't vote for me&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I'll bet you'll sign up for that health care plan. <p>So you don't need to listen to the politicians. You don't need to listen to me. Just go check it out for yourself. Make up your own mind whether this works for you. <p>And part of&mdash;look, part of the reason I need your help to make this law work is because there are so many people out there working to make it fail. One of the biggest newspapers in the country recently published an editorial, I thought, was pretty good. They said, the Republicans in Congress are poisoning Obamacare, then trying to claim it's sick. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's exactly what's been happening. <p>I mean, they have tried to put up every conceivable roadblock. They cut funding for efforts to educate people about what's in the law. Some of them said if their constituents called them, we won't even try to explain to them what's in the law. They actually opened up an investigation into people who try to help churches and charities understand how to help people sign up for the law. <p>Some of the Tea Party's biggest donors&mdash;some of the wealthiest men in America&mdash;are funding a cynical ad campaign trying to convince young people not to buy health care at all. I mean, think about it. These are billionaires several times over. You know they've got good health care. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Right! <p><i>The President.</i> But they are actually spending money on television, trying to convince young people that if you've got the choice between getting affordable health care or going without health care, you should choose not having any health care. Now, do you think if you get sick or you get hurt and you get stuck with a massive bill, these same folks, they're going to help you out? <p><i>Audience members.</i> No! <p><i>The President.</i> Are they going to pay for your health care? <p><i>Audience members.</i> No! <p><i>The President.</i> It is interesting, though, how over the last couple years, I'm&mdash;the Republican Party has just spun itself up around this issue. And the fact is the Republicans' biggest fear at this point is not that the Affordable Care Act will fail. What they're worried about is, it's going to succeed. I mean, think about it: If it was as bad as they said it was going to be, then they could just go ahead and let it happen, and then everybody would hate it so much, and then everybody would vote to repeal it, and that would be the end of it. <p>So what is it that they're so scared about? <p><i>Audience member.</i> You! <p><i>The President.</i> [<i>Laughter</i>] They have made such a big political issue out of this, trying to scare everybody with lies about \\"death panels\\" and \\"killing granny\\"&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;right? I mean that's&mdash;\\"Armageddon.\\" So if it actually works, they'll look pretty bad. If it actually works, that will mean that everything they were saying really wasn't true and they were just playing politics. <p><i>Audience members.</i> That's right! <p><i>The President.</i> Just the other day, one Republican in Congress said we need to shut this thing down before the marketplaces open and people get to see that they'll be getting coverage and getting these subsidies because&mdash;and I'm going to quote him here&mdash;he said, \\"It's going to prove almost impossible to undo Obamacare.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Right? So, in other words, we've got to shut this thing down before people find out that they like it. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's a strange argument. Don't you think that's a strange argument? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes! <p><i>The President.</i> And the closer we get, the more desperate they get. I mean, over the last few weeks, the rhetoric has just been cranked up to a place I've never seen before. One Congressman said that Obamacare is \\"the most dangerous piece of legislation ever passed.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Ever. In the history of America, this is the most dangerous piece of legislation. [<i>Laughter</i>] Providing&mdash;creating a marketplace so people can buy group insurance plans, the most dangerous ever. <p>You had a State representative somewhere say that it's \\"as destructive to personal and individual liberty as the Fugitive Slave Act.\\" <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> Think about that. Affordable health care is worse than a law that let slave owners get their runaway slaves back. <p><i>Audience members.</i> No! <p><i>The President.</i> I mean, these are quotes. I'm not making this stuff up. And here's one more that I've heard&mdash;I like this one: \\"We have to\\"&mdash;and I'm quoting here. \\"We have to repeal this failure before it literally kills women, kills children, kills senior citizens.\\" Now, I have to say&mdash;that one was from 6 months ago&mdash;I just want to point out we still have women&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;we still have children, we still have senior citizens. <p>All this would be funny if it wasn't so crazy. And a lot of it is just hot air. A lot of it is just politics. I understand that. But now the Tea Party Republicans have taken it to a whole new level, because they're threatening either to shut down the Government or shut down the entire economy by refusing to let America pay its bills for the first time in history unless I agree to gut a law that will help millions of people. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> Think about this. Shutting down the Government just because you don't like a law that was passed and found constitutional and because you don't like the idea of giving people new access to affordable health care, what kind of idea is that? <p>I mean, think about how that would impact Maryland. This is an area where lots of people would be badly hurt by a Government shutdown. A lot of people around here wake up and go to serve their country every single day in the Federal Government: civilians who work at military bases, analysts, scientists, janitors, people who process new veterans' and survivors' benefit claims. They'd all have to stay home and not get paid. And it&mdash;we all know it would badly damage the economy. <p>I mean, whatever effect Obamacare might have on the economy is far less than even a few days of Government shutdown. I mean, even if you believed that Obamacare somehow was going to hurt the economy, it won't hurt the economy as bad as a Government shutdown. And by the way, the evidence is that it's not going to hurt the economy. Obamacare is going to help the economy. And it's going to help families and help businesses. <p>As for not letting America pay its bills, I have to say, no Congress before this one has ever&mdash;ever&mdash;in history been irresponsible enough to threaten default, to threaten an economic shutdown, to suggest America not pay its bills, just to try to blackmail a President into giving them some concessions on issues that have nothing to do with a budget. <p>I mean, this is the United States of America. We're not a deadbeat nation. We don't run out on our tab. We don't not pay our note. We are the world's bedrock economy, the world's currency of choice. The entire world looks to us to make sure that the world economy is stable. You don't mess with that. [<i>Applause</i>] You don't mess with that. <p>And that's why I will not negotiate on anything when it comes to the full faith and credit of the United States of America. <p>We're not going to submit to this kind of total irresponsibility. Congress needs to pay our bills on time. Congress needs to pass a budget on time. Congress needs to put an end to governing from crisis to crisis. Our focus as a country should be on creating new jobs and growing our economy and helping young people learn and restoring security for hard-working, middle class families. <p>This is not about the fortunes of any one party. This is not about politics. This is about the future of our country. If Republicans do not like the law, they can go through the regular channels and processes to try to change it. That's why we have elections. So they can go through the normal processes and procedures of a democracy, but you do not threaten the full faith and credit of the United States of America. <p>And meanwhile, we're going to keep implementing the law. <p><i>Audience member.</i> It's the law! <p><i>The President.</i> It's the law. And like I said, there are going to be some glitches along the way. Every law has hiccups when it's first starting off. People forget, by the way, Medicare Part D&mdash;passed by my predecessor, George Bush, passed by a Republican House of Representatives&mdash;the prescription drug bill passed into law 10 years ago was even more unpopular than the Affordable Care Act before it took into effect. Everybody was saying what a disaster it was going to be. The difference was Democrats worked with Republicans to make it work even better. Steny remembers this. Even though Democrats weren't happy that the law wasn't paid for and was going to add hundreds of billions of dollars to the deficit and we weren't negotiating a better deal with the drug companies, everybody worked&mdash;once it was the law&mdash;to try to make it work. And today, about 90 percent of seniors like their prescription drug coverage. <p>So we may not get that same level of cooperation from Republicans right now. But the good news is, I believe eventually they'll come around. Because Medicare and Social Security faced the same kind of criticism. Before Medicare came into law, one Republican warned that \\"one of these days, you and I are going to spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it once was like in America when men were free.\\" That was Ronald Reagan. And eventually, Ronald Reagan came around to Medicare and thought it was pretty good and actually helped make it better. <p>So that's what's going to happen with the Affordable Care Act. And once it's working really well, I guarantee you, they will not call it Obamacare. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Here is a prediction for you: A few years from now, when people are using this to get coverage and everybody is feeling pretty good about all the choices and competition that they've got, there are going to be a whole bunch of folks who say, yes, I always thought this provision was excellent. [<i>Laughter</i>] I voted for that thing. You watch. [<i>Laughter</i>] It will not be called Obamacare. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But I'm always willing to work with anybody from either party. If you've got a serious idea for making the Affordable Care Act better or making our broader health care system better, I'm happy to work with you, because that's what the majority of the American people want. They don't want posturing, they want governing. They don't want politics, they want us to work together to make the lives of ordinary Americans a little bit better, a little bit more secure. <p>So, Maryland, I'm asking for your help. I need your help. We may have some very well-funded opponents. We may have some very talkative opponents. But you're going to be the best, most credible messengers to spread the word about this law and all the benefits that the American people stand to get and have earned. <p>So tell your friends, tell your family. Get covered. Get on that web site. Answer the questions of folks who don't know what this is all about. Point them to healthcare.gov. Teach them how to use the web site. Make sure they sign up. Let's help our fellow Americans get covered. <p>Then, let's keep on working to rebuild the middle class. Let's go and focus on creating more good-paying jobs. Let's build more ladders of opportunity for everybody willing to work hard. Let's make sure the United States of America keeps being a place where you can make it if you try. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"212" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. Before I discuss the situation in Congress, let me say a few things about two important opportunities in our foreign policy. <p><i>Iran/President Hassan Rouhani of Iran </i><p>Just now I spoke on the phone with President Rouhani of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The two of us discussed our ongoing efforts to reach an agreement over Iran's nuclear program. I reiterated to President Rouhani what I said in New York: While there will surely be important obstacles to moving forward and success is by no means guaranteed, I believe we can reach a comprehensive solution. <p>I've directed Secretary Kerry to continue pursuing this diplomatic effort with the Iranian Government. We had constructive discussions yesterday in New York with our partners, the European Union, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China, together with the Iranian Foreign Minister. Going forward, President Rouhani and I have directed our teams to continue working expeditiously, in cooperation with the P-5-plus-1, to pursue an agreement. And throughout this process, we'll stay in close touch with our friends and allies in the region, including Israel. <p>Now, we're mindful of all the challenges ahead. The very fact that this was the first communication between an American and Iranian President since 1979 underscores the deep mistrust between our countries, but it also indicates the prospect of moving beyond that difficult history. <p>I do believe that there is a basis for a resolution. Iran's Supreme Leader has issued a fatwa against the development of nuclear weapons. President Rouhani has indicated that Iran will never develop nuclear weapons. I've made clear that we respect the right of the Iranian people to access peaceful nuclear energy in the context of Iran meeting its obligations. So the test will be meaningful, transparent, and verifiable actions, which can also bring relief from the comprehensive international sanctions that are currently in place. <p>Resolving this issue, obviously, could also serve as a major step forward in a new relationship between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran, one based on mutual interest and mutual respect. It would also help facilitate a better relationship between Iran and the international community, as well as others in the region, one that would help the Iranian people fulfill their extraordinary potential, but also help us address other concerns that could bring greater peace and stability to the Middle East. <p>A path to a meaningful agreement will be difficult, and at this point, both sides have significant concerns that will have to be overcome. But I believe we've got a responsibility to pursue diplomacy and that we have a unique opportunity to make progress with the new leadership in Tehran. I also communicated to President Rouhani my deep respect for the Iranian people. <p><i>Syria/United Nations Security Council Resolution </i><p>Now, as I said before, this comes on the same day that we can accomplish a major diplomatic breakthrough on Syria, as the United Nations Security Council will vote on a resolution that would require the Asad regime to put its chemical weapons under international control so they can ultimately be destroyed. This binding resolution will ensure that the Asad regime must keep its commitments or face consequences. We'll have to be vigilant about following through, but this could be a significant victory for the international community and demonstrate how strong diplomacy can allow us to secure our country and pursue a better world. <p><i>Federal Budget </i><p>Now, America's security and leadership don't just depend on our military strength or our alliances or our diplomacy. First and foremost, America's strength depends on a strong economy where our middle class is growing and everyone who works hard has a chance to get ahead. So let me say a few words about the situation that's developed over the past few weeks on Capitol Hill. <p>Here at home, the United States Congress has two pressing responsibilities: pass a budget on time and pay our bills on time. <p>If Congress chooses not to pass a budget by Monday&mdash;the end of the fiscal year&mdash;they will shut down the Government, along with many vital services that the American people depend on. The good news is, within the past couple of hours, the United States Senate, Democrats and Republicans, acted responsibly by voting to keep our Government open and delivering the services the American people expect. Now it's up to Republicans in the House of Representatives to do the same. I say that because obviously Democrats have a great interest in making sure that these vital services continue to help the American people. <p>So far, the Republicans in the House of Representatives have refused to move forward. And here's the thing: Unlike the last time they threatened this course of action, this debate isn't really about deficits. In fact, our deficits are falling at the fastest pace that they have in 60 years. By the end of this year, we will have cut our deficits by more than half since I took office. So that's not what this is about. And in fact, if you've been following the discussion, the Republicans in the House don't even make a pretense that that's what this is about. <p>Instead, the House Republicans are so concerned with appeasing the Tea Party that they've threatened a Government shutdown or worse unless I gut or repeal the Affordable Care Act. <p>I said this yesterday; let me repeat it: That's not going to happen. More than a hundred million Americans currently, already have new benefits and protections under the law. On Tuesday, about 40 million more Americans will be able to finally buy quality, affordable health care, just like anybody else. Those marketplaces will be open for business on Tuesday no matter what, even if there's a Government shutdown. That's a done deal. <p>As I've said before, if Republicans have specific ideas on how to genuinely improve the law, rather than gut it, rather than delay it, rather than repeal it, I'm happy to work with them on that through the normal democratic processes. But that will not happen under the threat of a shutdown. <p>So, over the next 3 days, House Republicans will have to decide whether to join the Senate and keep the Government open or shut it down because they can't get their way on an issue that has nothing to do with the deficit. <p>I realize that a lot of what's taking place right now is political grandstanding. But this grandstanding has real effects on real people. If the Government shuts down on Tuesday, military personnel, including those risking their lives overseas for us right now, will not get paid on time. Federal loans for rural communities&mdash;small-business owners, families buying a home&mdash;will be frozen. I'm already starting to get letters from people worried that this will have an impact on them directly. Critical research into lifesaving discoveries will be immediately halted. <p>The Federal Government has a large role across the country and touches the lives of millions of people, and those people will be harmed. And even the threat of a shutdown already is probably having a dampening effect on our economy; we saw that the last time these kinds of shenanigans were happening up on Capitol Hill. <p>So to any Republican in Congress who's currently watching, I'd encourage you to think about who you're hurting. There are probably young people in your office right now who came to work for you, without much pay, because they believed that public service was noble. You're preparing to send them home without a paycheck. You've got families with kids back in your districts who serve their country in the Federal Government, and now they might have to plan how they're going to get by if you shut the Government down. <p>Past shutdowns have disrupted the economy, and this shutdown would as well. It would throw a wrench into the gears of our economy at a time when those gears have gained some traction. And that's why many Republican Senators and many Republican Governors have urged Republicans to knock it off, pass a budget, and move on. Let's get this done. <p>This brings me to Congress's second responsibility. Once they vote to keep the Government open, they also have to vote within the next couple of weeks to allow the Treasury to pay the bills for the money that Congress has already spent. I want to repeat: Raising the debt ceiling is simply authorizing the Treasury to pay for what Congress has already authorized. <p>Failure to meet this responsibility would be far more dangerous than a Government shutdown. It would effectively be an economic shutdown, with impacts not just here, but around the world. We don't fully understand what might happen, the dangers involved, because no Congress has ever actually threatened default. But we know it would have a profound destabilizing effect on the entire economy, on the world economy, because America is the bedrock of world investment. The dollar is the reserve currency. The debt that is issued by the Treasury is the foundation for our capital markets. That's why you don't fool with it. <p>Now, some Republicans have suggested that unless I agree to an even longer list of demands&mdash;not just gutting the health care law, but cutting taxes for millionaires or rolling back rules on big banks and polluters or other pet projects that they'd like to see and they've been trying to get passed over the last couple of years&mdash;that they would push the button, throw America into default for the first time in history, and risk throwing us back into a recession. <p>Now, I am willing to work with anybody who wants to have a serious conversation about our fiscal future. I've demonstrated that by putting forward serious reforms to tax and entitlement programs that would bring down our long-term deficits. I have said in the past&mdash;and I will continue to say&mdash;that I'm willing to make a whole bunch of tough decisions, ones that may not be entirely welcomed by my own party. <p>But we're not going to do this under the threat of blowing up the entire economy. I will not negotiate over Congress's responsibility to pay the bills that have already been racked up. Voting for the Treasury to pay America's bills is not a concession to me. That's not doing me a favor. That's simply carrying out the solemn responsibilities that come with holding office up there. I don't know how I can be more clear about this. Nobody gets to threaten the full faith and credit of the United States just to extract political concessions. No one gets to hurt our economy and millions of innocent people just because there are a couple of laws that you do not like. <p>It has not been done in the past; we're not going to start doing it now. I'm not going to start setting a precedent&mdash;not just for me, but for future Presidents&mdash;where one Chamber in Congress can basically say, each time there needs to be a vote to make sure Treasury pays its bills, we're not going to sign it unless our particular hobbyhorse gets advanced. <p>Imagine if you had a Republican President and a Democratic Speaker, and the Democratic Speaker said, well, we're not going to pass a debt ceiling unless we raise corporate taxes by 40 percent or unless we pass background checks on guns or whatever other list of agenda items Democrats were interested in. Does anybody actually think that we would be hearing from Republicans that that was acceptable behavior? <p>That's not how our constitutional system is designed. We are not going to do it. The American people have worked too hard to recover from a bunch of crises&mdash;several of them now over the last couple of years inflicted by some of the same folks in Congress that we're talking about now&mdash;to see extremists in Congress cause another crisis. <p>And keep in mind, by the way, this whole thing has to do with keeping the Government open for a few months. The continuing resolution, the bill that's designed to avert a Government shutdown, basically just funds the Government for another couple months, so we could be doing this all over again. I'm sure the American people are thrilled about that. <p>And that's why we've got to break this cycle. My message to Congress is this: Do not shut down the Government; do not shut down the economy. Pass a budget on time; pay our bills on time. Refocus on the everyday concerns of the American people. <p>There will be differences between Democrats and Republicans. We can have all kinds of conversations about how to resolve those differences. There will be areas where we can work together. There will be areas where we disagree. But do not threaten to burn the house down simply because you haven't gotten a hundred percent of your way. That's not how our democracy is supposed to work. <p>Every day that this goes on is another day that we're not focused on doing what we need to be focused on, which is rebuilding this great country of ours so that our middle class is growing and everybody has got opportunity if they're willing to work hard. That's what I'm focused on. That's what Congress should be focused on as well. All right? <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"213" "\"Hi, everybody. This Tuesday is an important day for families, businesses, and our economy. It's the day a big part of the Affordable Care Act kicks in and tens of millions of Americans will finally have the same chance to buy quality, affordable health care as everybody else. <p>It's also the day that a group of far-right Republicans in Congress might choose to shut down the Government and potentially damage the economy just because they don't like this law. I'll get to that in a second. <p>But first, here's what the Affordable Care Act means for you. If you're one of the vast majority of Americans who already have health care, you already have new benefits you didn't before, like free mammograms and contraceptive care with no copay and discounts on prescription medicine for seniors. You've already got new protections in place too, like no more lifetime limits on your care, no more discriminating against children with preexisting conditions like asthma, or being able to stay on your parent's plan until you turn 26. That's all in place and available to Americans with health insurance right now. <p>If you don't have health insurance, or if you buy it on the individual market, then starting this Tuesday, October 1, you can visit healthcare.gov to find what's called the health insurance marketplace in your State. <p>This is a web site where you can compare insurance plans side by side, the same way you'd shop for a TV or a plane ticket. You'll see new choices and new competition. Many of you will see cheaper prices, and many of you will be eligible for tax credits that bring down your costs even more. Nearly 6 in 10 uninsured Americans will be able to get coverage for a hundred dollars or less. <p>If you're one of the up to half of Americans with a preexisting condition, these new plans mean your insurer can no longer charge you more than anybody else. They can't charge women more than men for the same coverage. And they take effect on January 1. <p>So get covered at healthcare.gov and spread the word. These marketplaces will be open for business on Tuesday, no matter what. The Affordable Care Act is one of the most important things we've done as a country in decades to strengthen economic security for the middle class and all who strive to join the middle class. And it is going to work. <p>That's also one of the reasons it's so disturbing that Republicans in Congress are threatening to shut down the Government&mdash;or worse&mdash;if I don't agree to gut this law. <p>Congress has two responsibilities right now: pass a budget on time, and pay our bills on time. If Congress doesn't pass a budget by Monday, the end of the fiscal year, the Government shuts down, along with many vital services the American people depend on. On Friday, the Senate passed a bill to keep the Government open. But Republicans in the House have been more concerned with appeasing an extreme faction of their party than working to pass a budget that creates new jobs or strengthens the middle class. And in the next couple of days, these Republicans will have to decide whether to join the Senate and keep the Government open or create a crisis that will hurt people for the sole purpose of advancing their ideological agenda. <p>Past Government shutdowns have disrupted the economy. This shutdown would too. At a moment when our economy has steadily gained traction and our deficits have been falling faster than at any time in 60 years, a shutdown would be a purely self-inflicted wound. And that's why many Republican Senators and Republican Governors have urged Republicans in the House of Representatives to knock it off, pass a budget, and move on. <p>This brings me to a second responsibility that Congress has. Once they vote to keep the Government open, they also have to vote within the next couple weeks to allow the Treasury to pay the bills for the money that Congress has already spent. Failure to meet this responsibility would be far more dangerous than a Government shutdown, it would be an economic shutdown, with impacts not just here, but around the world. <p>Unfortunately, some Republicans have suggested that unless I agree to an even longer list of demands&mdash;not just gutting the health care law, but things like cutting taxes for millionaires or rolling back rules on big banks and polluters&mdash;they'll push the button, throwing America into default for the first time in history, and risk throwing all of us back in a recession. <p>I will work with anyone who wants to have a serious conservation about our economic future. But I will not negotiate over Congress's responsibility to pay the bills it has already racked up. I don't know how to be more clear about this: no one gets to threaten the full faith and credit of the United States of America just to extract ideological concessions. No one gets to hurt our economy and millions of innocent people just because there are a couple laws that you don't like. It hasn't been done in the past, and we're not going to start doing it now. <p>The American people have worked too hard to recover from crises to see extremists in their Congress cause another one. And every day this goes on is another day that we can't continue the work of rebuilding the American middle class. Congress needs to pass a budget in time, pay its bills on time, and refocus on the everyday concerns of the people who sent them there. <p>That's what I'm focused on. That's what I'll keep fighting for. <p>Thanks so much.\" "
"214" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. Of all the responsibilities the Constitution endows to Congress, two should be fairly simple: pass a budget and pay America's bills. <p>But if the United States Congress does not fulfill its responsibility to pass a budget today, much of the United States Government will be forced to shut down tomorrow. And I want to be very clear about what that shutdown would mean: what will remain open and what will not. <p>With regard to operations that will continue: If you're on Social Security, you will keep receiving your checks. If you're on Medicare, your doctor will still see you. Everyone's mail will still be delivered. And Government operations related to national security or public safety will go on. Our troops will continue to serve with skill, honor, and courage. Air traffic controllers, prison guards, those who are with border control&mdash;our Border Patrol will remain on their posts, but their paychecks will be delayed until the Government reopens. NASA will shut down almost entirely, but Mission Control will remain open to support the astronauts serving on the Space Station. <p>I also want to be very clear about what would change. Office buildings would close. Paychecks would be delayed. Vital services that seniors and veterans, women and children, businesses and our economy depend on would be hamstrung. Business owners would see delays in raising capital, seeking infrastructure permits, or rebuilding after Hurricane Sandy. Veterans who have sacrificed for their country will find their support centers unstaffed. Tourists will find every one of America's national parks and monuments&mdash;from Yosemite to the Smithsonian, to the Statue of Liberty&mdash;immediately closed. And of course, the communities and small businesses that rely on these national treasures for their livelihoods will be out of customers and out of luck. <p>And in keeping with the broad ramifications of a shutdown, I think it's important that everybody understand, the Federal Government is America's largest employer. More than 2 million civilian workers and 1.4 million Active Duty military serve in all 50 States and all around the world. In the event of a Government shutdown, hundreds of thousands of these dedicated public servants who stay on the job will do so without pay, and several hundred thousand more will be immediately and indefinitely furloughed without pay. <p>What, of course, will not be furloughed are the bills that they have to pay: their mortgages, their tuition payments, their car notes. These Americans are our neighbors. Their kids go to our schools. They worship where we do. They serve their country with pride. They are the customers of every business in this country. And they would be hurt greatly&mdash;and as a consequence, all of us will be hurt greatly&mdash;should Congress choose to shut the people's Government down. <p>So a shutdown will have a very real economic impact on real people right away. Past shutdowns have disrupted the economy significantly. This one would too. It would throw a wrench into the gears of our economy at a time when those gears have gained some traction. <p>Five years ago right now, our economy was in meltdown. Today, our businesses have created 7&frac12; million new jobs over the past 3&frac12; years, the housing market is healing, and our deficits are falling fast. The idea of putting the American people's hard-earned progress at risk is the height of irresponsibility. <p>And it doesn't have to happen. Let me repeat this: It does not have to happen. All of this is entirely preventable if the House chooses to do what the Senate has already done, and that's the simple act of funding our Government without making extraneous and controversial demands in the process, the same way other Congresses have for more than 200 years. <p>Unfortunately, right now House Republicans continue to tie funding of the Government to ideological demands, like limiting a woman's access to contraception or delaying the Affordable Care Act, all to save face after making some impossible promises to the extreme right wing of their party. <p>So let me be clear about this: An important part of the Affordable Care Act takes effect tomorrow no matter what Congress decides to do today. The Affordable Care Act is moving forward. That funding is already in place. You can't shut it down. This is a law that passed both Houses of Congress, a law that bears my signature, a law that the Supreme Court upheld as constitutional, a law that voters chose not to repeal last November, a law that is already providing benefits to millions of Americans in the form of young people staying on their parent's plan until they're 26; seniors getting cheaper prescription drugs; making sure that insurance companies aren't imposing lifetime limits when you already have health insurance; providing rebates for consumers when insurance companies are spending too much money on overhead instead of health care. Those things are already happening. <p>Starting tomorrow, tens of millions of Americans will be able to visit healthcare.gov to shop for affordable health care coverage. So Americans who've lived&mdash;for years in some cases&mdash;with the fear that one illness could send them into bankruptcy, Americans who've been priced out of the market just because they've been sick once, they'll finally be able to afford coverage, quality coverage, many of them for the first time in their lives. <p>Some of them may be sick as we speak. And this is their best opportunity to get some security and some relief. Tens of thousands of Americans die every single year because they don't have access to affordable health care. Despite this, Republicans have said that if we lock these Americans out of affordable health care for one more year&mdash;if we sacrifice the health care of millions of Americans&mdash;then they'll fund the Government for a couple of more months. Does anybody truly believe that we won't have this fight again in a couple more months? Even at Christmas? <p>So here's the bottom line: I'm always willing to work with anyone of either party to make sure the Affordable Care Act works better, to make sure our Government works better. I'm always willing to work with anyone to grow our economy faster or to create new jobs faster, to get our fiscal house in order for the long run. I've demonstrated this time and time again, oftentimes to the consternation of my own party. But one faction of one party in one House of Congress in one branch of Government doesn't get to shut down the entire Government just to refight the results of an election. <p>Keeping the people's Government open is not a concession to me. Keeping vital services running and hundreds of thousands of Americans on the job is not something you give to the other side. It's our basic responsibility. It's something that we're doing for our military and our businesses and our economy and all the hard-working people out there: the person working for the Agricultural Department out in some rural community who's out there helping some farmers make sure that they're making some modest profit for all the hard work they're putting in. They're the person working for HUD who's helping somebody buy a house for the first time. They're somebody in a VA office who's counseling one of our vets who's got PTSD. <p>That's who we're here to serve. That's why we're supposed to be carrying out these responsibilities. It's why we should be avoiding these kinds of constant brinksmanship. It's something that we do in the ordinary process of this extraordinary system of Government that we have. You don't get to extract a ransom for doing your job, for doing what you're supposed to be doing anyway, or just because there's a law there that you don't like. <p>The American people sent us here to govern. They sent us here to make sure that we're doing everything we can to make their lives a little bit better: to create new jobs, to restore economic security, to rebuild the prospects of upward mobility. That's what they expect. <p>And they understand that there are differences between the parties, and we're going to be having some tough fights around those differences. And I respect the fact that the other party is not supposed to agree with me a hundred percent of the time, just like I don't agree with them. But they do also expect that we don't bring the entire Government to a halt or the entire economy to a halt just because of those differences. <p>And that's what they deserve. They've worked too hard, for too long to recover from previous crises just to have folks here in Washington manufacture yet another one that they have to dig themselves out of. <p>So Congress needs to keep our Government open, needs to pay our bills on time, and never, ever threaten the full faith and credit of the United States of America. And time is running out. My hope and expectation is that in the 11th hour, once again, that Congress will choose to do the right thing and that the House of Representatives, in particular, will choose the right thing. <p>Thank you very much.\" "
"215" "\"This is my Cabinet. And we're going to be discussing the impacts, potentially, of the shutdown and how all these various agencies will be managing to make sure the core essential functions continue, but also, obviously, to help try to manage what's going to be a very difficult potential situation for the employees of all these agencies, who are doing outstanding and very difficult work all across the country. <p>So I appreciate all the members of the Cabinet who are here. They have been doing a lot of planning. I wish they were spending more time focusing on how to grow jobs and the economy as opposed to having to spend time figuring out how they manage a Government shutdown. But as always, they're prepared. And we'll be getting a full briefing from the entire crew during the course of this meeting. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"216" "\"Good morning, everybody. At midnight last night, for the first time in 17 years, Republicans in Congress chose to shut down the Federal Government. Let me be more specific: One faction of one party in one House of Congress in one branch of Government shut down major parts of the Government, all because they didn't like one law. <p>This Republican shutdown did not have to happen. But I want every American to understand why it did happen. Republicans in the House of Representatives refused to fund the Government unless we defunded or dismantled the Affordable Care Act. They've shut down the Government over an ideological crusade to deny affordable health insurance to millions of Americans. In other words, they demanded ransom just for doing their job. <p>And many Representatives, including an increasing number of Republicans, have made it clear that had they been allowed by Speaker Boehner to take a simple up-or-down vote on keeping the Government open, with no partisan strings attached, enough votes from both parties would have kept the American people's Government open and operating. <p>Now, we may not know the full impact of this Republican shutdown for some time. It will depend on how long it lasts. But we do know a couple of things. We know that the last time Republicans shut down the Government in 1996, it hurt our economy. And unlike 1996, our economy is still recovering from the worst recession in generations. <p>We know that certain services and benefits that America's seniors and veterans and business owners depend on must be put on hold. Certain offices, along with every national park and monument, must be closed. And while last night, I signed legislation to make sure our 1.4 million Active Duty military are paid through the shutdown, hundreds of thousands of civilian workers&mdash;many still on the job, many forced to stay home&mdash;aren't being paid, even if they have families to support and local businesses that rely on them. And we know that the longer this shutdown continues, the worse the effects will be. More families will be hurt. More businesses will be harmed. <p>So, once again, I urge House Republicans to reopen the Government, restart the services Americans depend on, and allow the public servants who have been sent home to return to work. This is only going to happen when Republicans realize they don't get to hold the entire economy hostage over ideological demands. <p>As I've said repeatedly, I am prepared to work with Democrats and Republicans to do the things we need to do to grow the economy and create jobs and get our fiscal house in order over the long run. Although I should add, this shutdown isn't about deficits or spending or budgets. After all, our deficits are falling at the fastest pace in 50 years. We've cut them in half since I took office. In fact, many of the demands the Republicans are now making would actually raise our deficits. <p>So no, this shutdown is not about deficits. It's not about budgets. This shutdown is about rolling back our efforts to provide health insurance to folks who don't have it. It's all about rolling back the Affordable Care Act. This, more than anything else, seems to be what the Republican Party stands for these days. I know it's strange that one party would make keeping people uninsured the centerpiece of their agenda, but that apparently is what it is. <p>And of course, what's stranger still is that shutting down our Government doesn't accomplish their stated goal. The Affordable Care Act is a law that passed the House; it passed the Senate. The Supreme Court ruled it constitutional. It was a central issue in last year's election. It is settled, and it is here to stay. And because of its funding sources, it's not impacted by a Government shutdown. <p>And these Americans are here with me today because, even though the Government is closed, a big part of the Affordable Care Act is now open for business. And for them, and millions like them, this is a historic day for a good reason. It's been a long time coming, but today, Americans who have been forced to go without insurance can now visit healthcare.gov and enroll in affordable new plans that offer quality coverage. That starts today. <p>And people will have 6 months to sign up. So over the next 6 months, people are going to have the opportunity&mdash;many times&mdash;in many cases, for the first time in their lives&mdash;to get affordable coverage that they desperately need. <p>Now, of course, if you're one of the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance, you don't need to do a thing. You're already benefiting from new benefits and protections that have been in place for some time under this law. But for the 15 percent of Americans who don't have health insurance, this opportunity is life changing. <p>Now, let me just tell folks a few stories that are represented here today. A few years ago, Amanda Barrett left her job in New York to take care of her parents. And for a while, she had temporary insurance that covered her multiple sclerosis. But when it expired, many insurers wouldn't cover her because of her MS. And she ended up paying $1,200 a month. That's nowhere near affordable. So starting today, she can get covered for much less, because today's new plan can't use your medical history to charge you more than anybody else. <p>Sky-high premiums once forced Nancy Beigel to choose between paying her rent or paying for health insurance. She's been uninsured ever since. So she pays all of her medical bills out of pocket, puts some on her credit card, making them even harder to pay. Nancy says: \\"They talk about those who fall through the cracks. I fell through the cracks 10 years ago, and I've been stuck there ever since.\\" Well, starting today, Nancy can get covered just like everybody else. <p>Trinace Edwards was laid off from her job a year ago today. Six months ago, she was diagnosed with a brain tumor. She couldn't afford insurance on the individual market, so she hasn't received treatment yet. Her daughter Lenace, a student at the University of Maryland, is considering dropping out of school to help pay her mom's bills. Well, starting today, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, Trinace can get covered without forcing her daughter to give up on her dreams. <p>So if these stories of hard-working Americans sound familiar to you, well, starting today, you and your friends and your family and your coworkers can get covered too. Just visit healthcare.gov, and there you can compare insurance plans, side by side, the same way you'd shop for a plane ticket on Kayak or a TV on Amazon. You enter some basic information; you'll be presented with a list of quality, affordable plans that are available in your area, with clear descriptions of what each plan covers and what it will cost. You'll find more choices, more competition, and in many cases, lower prices. Most uninsured Americans will find that they can get covered for a hundred dollars or less. <p>And you don't have to take my word for it. Go on the web site, healthcare.gov, check it out for yourself. And then show it to your family and your friends and help them get covered, just like mayors and churches and community groups and companies are already fanning out to do across the country. <p>And there's a hotline where you can apply over the phone and get help with the application or just get questions that you have answered by real people in 150 different languages. So let me give you that number. The number is 1-800-318-2596. 1-800-318-2596. Check out healthcare.gov. Call that number. Show your family and friends how to use it. And we can get America covered, once and for all, so that the struggles that these folks have gone through and millions around the country have gone through for years finally get addressed. <p>And let me just remind people why I think this is so important. I heard a striking statistic yesterday. If you get cancer, you are 70 percent more likely to live another 5 years if you have insurance than if you don't. Think about that. That is what it means to have health insurance. <p>Set aside the issues of security and finances and how you're impacted by that, the stress involved in not knowing whether or not you're going to have health care. This is life-or-death stuff. Tens of thousands of Americans die each year just because they don't have health insurance. Millions more live with the fear that they'll go broke if they get sick. And today we begin to free millions of our fellow Americans from that fear. <p>Already, millions of young adults have been able to stay on their parents' plans until they turn 26. Millions of seniors already have gotten a discount on their prescription medicines. Already, millions of families have actually received rebates from insurance companies that didn't spend enough on their health care. So this law means more choice, more competition, lower costs for millions of Americans. <p>And this law doesn't just mean economic security for our families. It means we're finally addressing the biggest drivers of our long-term deficits. It means a stronger economy. <p>Remember, most Republicans have made a whole bunch of predictions about this law that haven't come true. There are no \\"death panels.\\" Costs haven't skyrocketed, they're growing at the slowest rate in 50 years. The last 3 years since I signed the Affordable Care Act into law are the three slowest rates of health spending growth on record. <p>And contrary to Republican claims, this law hasn't destroyed our economy. Over the past 3&frac12; years, our businesses have created 7&frac12; million new jobs. Just today we learned that our manufacturers are growing at the fastest rate in 2&frac12; years. They have factored in the Affordable Care Act. They don't think it's a problem. What's weighing on the economy is not the Affordable Care Act, but the constant series of crises and the unwillingness to pass a reasonable budget by a faction of the Republican Party. <p>Now, like every new law, every new product rollout, there are going to be some glitches in the signup process along the way that we will fix. I've been saying this from the start. For example, we found out that there have been times this morning where the site has been running more slowly than it normally will. The reason is because more than 1 million people visited healthcare.gov before 7 in the morning. <p>To put that in context, there were five times more users in the marketplace this morning than have ever been on medicare.gov at one time. That gives you a sense of how important this is to millions of Americans around the country, and that's a good thing. And we're going to be speeding things up in the next few hours to handle all this demand that exceeds anything that we had expected. <p>Consider that just a couple of weeks ago, Apple rolled out a new mobile operating system. And within days, they found a glitch, so they fixed it. I don't remember anybody suggesting Apple should stop selling iPhones or iPads or threatening to shut down the company if they didn't. That's not how we do things in America. We don't actively root for failure. We get to work, we make things happen, we make them better, we keep going. <p>So in that context, I'll work with anybody who's got a serious idea to make the Affordable Care Act work better. I've said that repeatedly. But as long as I am President, I will not give in to reckless demands by some in the Republican Party to deny affordable health insurance to millions of hard-working Americans. <p>I want Republicans in Congress to know: These are the Americans you'd hurt if we're&mdash;you were allowed to dismantle this law. Americans like Amanda, Nancy, and Trinace, who now finally have the opportunity for basic security and peace of mind of health care just like everybody else, including Members of Congress. The notion that you'd make a condition for reopening the Government that I make sure these folks don't have health care, that doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make any sense. <p>Now, let me make one closing point. This Republican shutdown threatens our economy at a time when millions of Americans are still looking for work and businesses are starting to get some traction. So the timing is not good. Of course, a lot of the Republicans in the House ran for office 2 years ago promising to shut down the Government, and so, apparently, they've now gotten their wish. But as I've said before, the irony that the House Republicans have to contend with is, they've shut down a whole bunch of parts of the Government, but the Affordable Care Act is still open for business. <p>And this may be why you've got many Republican Governors and Senators and even a growing number of reasonable Republican Congressmen who are telling the extreme right of their party to knock it off, pass a budget, move on. <p>And I want to underscore the fact that Congress doesn't just have to end this shutdown and reopen the Government, Congress generally has to stop governing by crisis. They have to break this habit. It is a drag on the economy. It is not worthy of this country. <p>For example, one of the most important things Congress has to do in the next couple weeks is to raise what's called the debt ceiling. And it's important to understand what this is. This is a routine vote. Congress has taken this vote 45 times to raise the debt ceiling since Ronald Reagan took office. It does not cost taxpayers a single dime. It does not grow our deficits by a single dime. It does not authorize anybody to spend any new money whatsoever. All it does is authorize the Treasury to pay the bills on what Congress has already spent. <p>Think about that. If you buy a car and you've got a car note, you do not save money by not paying your car note. You're just a deadbeat. If you buy a house, you don't save money by not authorizing yourself to pay the mortgage. You're just going to be foreclosed on your home. That's what this is about. <p>It is routine. It is what they're supposed to do. This is not a concession to me. It is not some demand that's unreasonable that I'm making. This is what Congress is supposed to do as a routine matter. And they shouldn't wait until the last minute to do it. The last time Republicans even threatened this course of action&mdash;many of you remember, back in 2011&mdash;our economy staggered, our credit rating was downgraded for the first time. If they go through with it this time and force the United States to default on its obligations for the first time in history, it would be far more dangerous than a Government shutdown, as bad as a shutdown is. It would be an economic shutdown. <p>So I'll speak more on this in the coming days, but let me repeat: I will not negotiate over Congress's responsibility to pay bills it's already racked up. I'm not going to allow anybody to drag the good name of the United States of America through the mud just to refight a settled election or extract ideological demands. Nobody gets to hurt our economy and millions of hard-working families over a law you don't like. <p>There are a whole bunch of things that I'd like to see passed through Congress that the House Republicans haven't passed yet, and I'm not out there saying, well, I'm not&mdash;I'm going to let America default unless Congress does something that they don't want to do. That's not how adults operate. Certainly, that's not how our Government should operate. And that's true whether there's a Democrat in this office or a Republican in this office. Doesn't matter whether it's a Democratic House of Representatives or a Republican-controlled House of Representatives. There are certain rules that everybody abides by because we don't want to hurt other people just because we have a political disagreement. <p>So my main&mdash;my basic message to Congress is this: Pass a budget. End the Government shutdown. Pay your bills. Prevent an economic shutdown. Don't wait. Don't delay. Don't put our economy or our people through this any longer. <p>I am more than happy to work with them on all kinds of issues. I want to get back to work on the things that the American people sent us here to work on: creating new jobs, new growth, new security for our middle class. <p>We're better than this. Certainly, the American people are a lot better than this. And I believe that what we've accomplished for Amanda and Nancy and Trinace and tens of millions of their fellow citizens on this day proves that even when the odds are long and the obstacles are many, we are and always will be a country that can do great things together. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. Thank you, all of you, for the great work that you're doing. And thank you, Kathleen Sebelius, for the outstanding work that she's doing making sure that millions of Americans can get health insurance. <p>Thank you.\" "
"217" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! Good to see all of you. Please, please have a seat. Well, hello, Rockville! <p>Let me start by recognizing three public servants who fight hard every day for Maryland families and businesses. Now, first of all, Congressman Chris Van Hollen is here. Yay, Chris! Congressman John Delaney is here. And we have the acting head of the Small Business Administration, Jeanne Hulit is here. <p>And I also want to give a big thanks to your bosses, Cidalia and Natalia, for being such gracious hosts. I had a chance to meet them at the White House, and&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. Thank you. Now I know where they got their good looks from, because I had a chance to meet mom and dad, and their beautiful families. So I'm so glad to be here. And I had a chance to learn a little bit about their story. So when their parents brought them from Portugal to America almost 40 years ago, no one in the family spoke a word of English. But that didn't stop their father Manuel and their mother Albertina from having a big dream, believing that if they worked hard, they could get ahead and that even though they'd never had any schooling, maybe their daughters could go to college. Maybe in America you could make it if you tried. That's what they believed. <p>So they started their own construction company with a pickup truck and a wheelbarrow. And when Cidalia and Natalia turned 14, they began to help: cleaning tools, translating documents. And they became the first in their family to go to college. And after graduation, they started their own business, and later, they bought the family business from their parents. So today, M. Luis Construction is a $60 million company with about 250 employees. And I understand you're opening your fourth office at the end of this month. So this story is what America is all about. You start off, maybe you don't have a lot, but you're willing to work hard, you put in the time, opportunities out there, and you're able to pass on an even better life to your family, your children, your grandchildren. <p>And it's good news that after how hard the construction industry got hit during the recession, things are starting to get a little better. Remember, it was just 5 years ago that our economy was in a free fall. Businesses were shedding hundreds of thousands of jobs every single month, and the recession ultimately cost millions of Americans their jobs, their homes, their savings&mdash;everything they had worked hard to build. <p>Today, over the last 3&frac12; , years, our businesses have added 7&frac12; million new jobs. Our deficits are falling. Our housing market is healing, which means construction is improving. Manufacturing is growing. The auto industry is back. America is on pace to become the number-one energy producer in the world this year. More small businesses have gotten loans so they can grow and they can hire, just like M. Luis did with the help of the Small Business Jobs Act that I signed 3 years ago. So that's part of what allowed this company to grow. <p>So we still have a long way to go. We've still got a lot of work to do, especially to rebuild the middle class. But we're making steady progress. And the reason I'm here is, we can't afford to threaten that progress right now. Right now hundreds of thousands of Americans, hard-working Americans, suddenly aren't receiving their paycheck. Right now they're worrying about missing the rent or their mortgage or even making ends meet. We can all relate to that. Imagine if suddenly you weren't sure whether you were going to get your next paycheck, with all the bills that might be mounting up. Well, that's what's happening right now to hundreds of thousands of Americans across the country. <p>Companies like this one worry that their businesses are going to be disrupted, because obviously&mdash;particularly in an area like Maryland, Virginia, where there are a lot of Federal workers&mdash;you don't know how that's going to impact the economy. Veterans, seniors, women&mdash;they're all worrying that the services they depend on will be disrupted too. <p>And the worst part is, this time it's not because of a once-in-a-lifetime recession. This isn't happening because of some financial crisis. It's happening because of a reckless Republican shutdown in Washington. <p><i>Audience member.</i> That's right! <p><i>The President.</i> Now, we've all seen the offices locked down, the monuments closed. We've heard about services denied; we've heard about benefits that are delayed. But the impacts of the shutdown go way beyond those things that you're seeing on television. Those hundreds of thousands of Americans&mdash;a lot of whom live around here&mdash;don't know when they're going to get their next paycheck, and that means stores and restaurants around here don't know if they'll have as many customers. <p>Across the country, you've got farmers in rural areas and small-business owners who deserve a loan, but they're being left in the lurch right now. They might have an application pending as we speak, but there's nobody in the office to process the loan. The SBA gives a billion dollars of loans a month to small businesses. A billion dollars a month goes to small businesses all across the country. Right now those can't be processed because there's nobody there to process them. <p>Veterans who deserve our support are getting less help. Little kids who deserve a Head Start have been sent home from the safe places where they learn and grow every single day. And of course, their families then have to scramble to figure out what to do. And the longer this goes on, the worse it will be. And it makes no sense. <p>The American people elected their representatives to make their lives easier, not harder. And there is one way out of this reckless and damaging Republican shutdown: Congress has to pass a budget that funds our Government with no partisan strings attached. <p>Now, I want everybody to understand what's happened, because sometimes when this gets reported on, everybody kind of thinks, well, you know, both sides are just squabbling; Democrats and Republicans, they're always arguing, so neither side is behaving properly. I want everybody to understand what's happened here. The Republicans passed a temporary budget for 2 months at a funding level that we, as Democrats, actually think is way too low because we're not providing help for more small businesses, doing more for early childhood education, doing more to rebuild our infrastructure. But we said, okay, while we're still trying to figure out this budget, we're prepared to go ahead and take the Republican budget levels that they proposed. <p>So the Senate passed that with no strings attached, not because it had everything the Democrats wanted. In fact, it had very little that the Democrats wanted. But we said, let's go ahead and just make sure that other people aren't hurt while negotiations are still taking place. <p>So that's already passed the Senate. And we know there are enough Republicans and Democrats to vote in the House of Representatives for the same thing. So I want everybody to understand this: There are enough Republicans and Democrats in the House of Representatives today that, if the Speaker of the House, John Boehner, simply let the bill get on the floor for an up-or-down vote&mdash;every Congressman could vote their conscience&mdash;the shutdown would end today. <p>The only thing that is keeping the Government shut down, the only thing preventing people from going back to work and basic research starting back up and farmers and small business owners getting their loans&mdash;the only thing that's preventing all that from happening, right now, today, in the next 5 minutes&mdash;is that Speaker John Boehner won't even let the bill get a yes-or-no vote, because he doesn't want to anger the extremists in his party. That's all. That's what this whole thing is about. <p>We've heard a lot from congressional Republicans in the past couple of days saying they don't want this shutdown. Well, there's a simple way to prove it. Send the bill to the floor. Let everybody vote. It will pass. Send me the bill. I will sign it. The shutdown will be over, and we can get back to the business of governing and helping the American people. <p>It could happen in the next half hour. National parks, monuments, offices would all reopen immediately. Benefits and services would resume again. Hundreds of thousands of dedicated public servants who are worrying about whether they're going to be able to pay the mortgage or pay the car note, they'd start going back to work right away. So my simple message today is: Call a vote. Call a vote. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Call a vote! <p><i>The President.</i> Put it on the floor, and let every individual Member of Congress make up their own minds. And they can show the American people, are you for a shutdown or not? If you're not for a shutdown, you'll vote for the bill; if you're for a shutdown, you won't vote for a bill. We don't have to twist anybody's arms. But that way, the American people will be clear about who is responsible for the shutdown. Or alternatively, more hopefully, they'd be clear that this is something that doesn't make sense and we should go ahead and make sure that we're looking out for the American people. It should be that simple. <p>But as I said, the problem we've got is that there's one faction of one party in one half of one branch of Government that so far has refused to allow that yes-or-no vote unless they get some massive partisan concessions in exchange for doing what they're supposed to be doing anyway, in exchange for doing what everybody else agrees is necessary. And they won't agree to end the shutdown until they get their way. And you may think I'm exaggerating, but just the other day, one Tea Party Republican called the idea of a shutdown \\"wonderful.\\" Another said that a shutdown is \\"exactly what we wanted.\\" Well, they got exactly what they wanted. Now they're trying to figure out how to get out of it. <p>Just yesterday one House Republican said&mdash;I'm quoting here, all right, because I want to make sure people understand I didn't make this up. One House Republican said: \\"We're not going to be disrespected. We have to get something out of this. And I don't know what that even is.\\" That was a quote. \\"We're not going to be disrespected. We've got to get something out of this. And I don't know what that even is.\\" Think about that. <p>You have already gotten the opportunity to serve the American people. There is no higher honor than that. You've already gotten the opportunity to help businesses like this one, workers like these. So the American people aren't in the mood to give you a goodie bag to go with it. What you get is our intelligence professionals being back on the job. What you get is our medical researchers back on the job. What you get are little kids back into Head Start. What you get are our national parks and monuments open again. What you get is the economy not stalling, but continuing to grow. What you get are workers continuing to be hired. That's what you get. That's what you should be asking for. Take a vote, stop this farce, and end this shutdown right now. <p>If you're being disrespected, it's because of that attitude you got: that you deserve to get something for doing your job. Everybody here just does their job, right? You don't&mdash;if you're working here and in the middle of the day you just stopped and said, you know what, I want to get something, but I don't know exactly what I'm going to get. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I'm just going to stop working until I get something. I'm going to try&mdash;I'm going to shut down the whole plant until I get something. <p><i>Audience member.</i> You'd get fired. <p><i>The President.</i> You'd get fired. [<i>Applause</i>] Right? Because the deal is you've already gotten hired. You've got a job. You're getting a paycheck. And so you also are getting the pride of doing a good job and contributing to a business and looking out for your fellow workers. That's what you're getting. Well, it shouldn't be any different for a Member of Congress. <p>Now, unlike past shutdowns&mdash;I want to make sure everybody understands this because, again, sometimes, the tendency is to say, well, both sides are at fault&mdash;this one has nothing to do with deficits or spending or budgets. Our deficits are falling at the fastest pace in 60 years. We've cut the deficits in half since I took office. And some of the things that the Republicans are asking for right now would actually add to our deficits. Seriously. <p>So this is not about spending. And this isn't about fiscal responsibility. This whole thing is about one thing: the Republican obsession with dismantling the Affordable Care Act and denying affordable health insurance to millions of Americans. That's all this has become about. That seems to be the only thing that unites the Republican Party these days. <p>Through this whole fight, they've said the American people don't want Obamacare, so we should shut down the Government to repeal it or delay it. But here's the problem: The Government is now shut down, but the Affordable Care Act is still open for business. So they're not even accomplishing what they say they want to accomplish. And by the way, in the first 2 days since the new marketplaces&mdash;basically, big group plans that we've set up&mdash;the first two 2 that they opened, web sites where you can compare and purchase new affordable insurance plans and maybe get tax credits to reduce your costs, millions of Americans have made it clear, they do want health insurance. <p>More than 6 million people visited the web site healthcare.gov the day it opened. Nearly 200,000 people picked up the phone and called the call center. In Kentucky alone&mdash;this is a State where I didn't&mdash;I didn't win Kentucky. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I know they weren't doing it for me. In Kentucky, nearly 11,000 people applied for new insurance plans in the first 2 days. Just in one State, Kentucky. And many Americans are finding out when they go on the web site that they'll save a lot of money or get health insurance for the first time. <p>So my&mdash;I would think that if, in fact, this was going to be such a disaster that the Republicans say it's going to be, that it was going to be so unpopular, they wouldn't have to shut down the Government. They could wait, nobody would show any interest, there'd be, like, two people on the web site&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and everybody would then vote for candidates who want to repeal it. <p>It's not as if Republicans haven't had a chance to debate the health care law. It passed the House of Representatives. It passed the Senate. The Supreme Court ruled it constitutional. You remember all this. Last November, voters rejected the Presidential candidate that ran on a platform to repeal it. So the Affordable Care Act has gone through every single democratic process, all three branches of Government. It's the law of the land. It's here to stay. <p>I've said to Republicans, if there are specific things you think can improve the law to make it even better for people as opposed to just gutting it and leaving 25 million people without health insurance, I'm happy to talk to you about that. But a Republican shutdown won't change the fact that millions of people need health insurance and that the Affordable Care Act is being implemented. The shutdown does not change that. All the shutdown is doing is making it harder for ordinary Americans to get by and harder for businesses to create jobs at a time when our economy is just starting to gain traction again. <p>You've heard Republicans say that Obamacare will hurt the economy, but the economy has been growing and creating jobs. The single greatest threat to our economy and to our businesses like this one is not the Affordable Care Act, it's the unwillingness of Republicans in Congress to stop refighting a settled election or making the demands that have nothing to do with the budget. They need to move on to the actual business of governing. That's what will help the economy. That's what will grow the economy. That's what will put people back to work. <p>And more than that, House Republicans need to stop careening from one crisis to another in everything they do. Have you noticed that? Since they've taken over the House of Representatives, we have one of these crises every 3 months. Have you noticed? And you keep on thinking, all right, well, this is going to be the last one; they're not going to do this again. And then they do it again. <p>I know you're tired of it. I'm tired of it. It doesn't mean that they're wrong on every single issue. I've said I'm happy to negotiate with you on anything. I don't think any one party has a monopoly on wisdom. But you don't negotiate by putting a gun to the other person's head or, worse yet, by putting a gun to the American people's head by threatening a shutdown. <p>And by the way, even after Congress reopens your Government, it's going to have to turn around very quickly and do something else, and that's pay America's bills. I want to spend a little time on this. It's called&mdash;it's something called raising the debt ceiling. And it's got a lousy name, so a lot of people end up thinking, I don't know, I don't think we should raise our debt ceiling, because it sounds like we're raising our debt. But that's not what this is about. <p>It doesn't cost taxpayers a single dime. It doesn't grow our deficits by a single dime. It doesn't allow anybody to spend any new money whatsoever. So it's not something that raises our debt. What it does is allow the U.S. Treasury, the U.S. Government to pay the bills that Congress has already racked up. I want you to think about this. <p>If you go to a restaurant, you order a meal, you eat it. Maybe you have some wine. Maybe you have two glasses of wine, great meal. And then you look at the tab&mdash;it's pretty expensive&mdash;and you decide, I'm not going to pay the bill. Well, you're not saving money. You're not being frugal. You're just a deadbeat, right? [<i>Laughter</i>] If you buy a house and you decide, man, this month, I'd rather go on vacation somewhere, so I'm not going to pay my mortgage, you didn't just save yourself some money. You're just going to get foreclosed on. <p>So you don't save money by not paying your bills. You don't reduce your debt by not paying your bills. All you're doing is making yourself unreliable and hurting your credit rating. And you'll start getting those phone calls and those notices in the mail. And the next time you try to borrow, somebody is going to say, uh-uh, because you don't pay your bills; you're a deadbeat. Well, the same is true for countries. <p>The only thing that the debt ceiling does is to let the U.S. Treasury pay for what Congress has already bought. That's why it's something that has been routine. Traditionally, it's not a big deal. Congress has raised it 45 times since Ronald Reagan took office. This is just kind of a routine part of keeping the Government running. The last time the House Republicans flirted with not raising the debt ceiling, back in 2011&mdash;some of you remember this&mdash;our economy took a bad hit. Our country's credit rating was downgraded for the first time, just like you'd be downgraded if you didn't pay your mortgage. <p>This time, they are threatening to actually force the United States to default on its obligations for the very first time in history. Now, you'll hear John Boehner and Mitch McConnell and these other Republicans say, we don't want to default. But everybody knows&mdash;it's written about in all the papers&mdash;that their basic theory is, okay, if the shutdown doesn't work, then we are going to try to get some extra concessions out of the President. We'll put, like a long laundry list, all the things that we want that we can't get passed on our own. And if we don't get it, we'll tell them we don't&mdash;we won't vote to pay the country's bills. We'll let the country default. <p>I'm not just making this up. I mean, it's common knowledge. Every reporter here knows it. And I want you to understand the consequences of this. As reckless as a Government shutdown is, as many people as being&mdash;as are being hurt by a Government shutdown, an economic shutdown that results from default would be dramatically worse. In a Government shutdown, Social Security checks still go out on time. In an economic shutdown, if we don't raise the debt ceiling, they don't go out on time. <p>In a Government shutdown, disability benefits still arrive on time. In an economic shutdown, they don't. In a Government shutdown, millions of Americans&mdash;not just Federal workers&mdash;everybody faces real economic hardship. In an economic shutdown, falling pensions and home values and rising interest rates on things like mortgages and student loans&mdash;all those things risk putting us back into a bad recession, which will affect this company and those workers and all of you. And that's not my analysis. That's&mdash;every economist out there is saying the same thing. We've never done it before. <p>And the United States is the center of the world economy. So if we screw up, everybody gets screwed up. The whole world will have problems, which is why generally nobody has ever thought to actually threaten not to pay our bills. It would be the height of irresponsibility. And that's why I've said this before; I'm going to repeat it: There will be no negotiations over this. The American people are not pawns in some political game. You don't get to demand some ransom in exchange for keeping the Government running. You don't get to demand ransom in exchange for keeping the economy running. You don't get to demand ransom for doing your most basic job. <p>And the sooner that the Republicans in Congress heed the warnings not just of me or Democrats like Chris and John, but heed the warnings of the Chamber of Commerce and CEOs and economists and a whole lot of Republicans outside of Congress; they're all saying, do not do this. They're all saying to Congress, do your job. And the sooner you do your job, the less damage you'll do to our economy and to businesses like this one. <p>So pass a budget, end the Government shutdown. Pay our bills. Prevent a economic shutdown. Just vote and end this shutdown. And you should do it today so we can get back to growing this economy, creating jobs, and strengthening our middle class. <p>Let me close just by sharing a story I heard as I was getting ready to come here today. Many of you already know it. Two years ago, a mulch factory next to M. Luis's main equipment storage facility caught fire, and most of the company's equipment was destroyed, causing millions of dollars in damage. But even while the fire was still burning, dozens of employees rushed over to the facility and tried to save as much as they could. Some of you were probably there. And when they finished cutting fire lines and spraying down the perimeter of their own property, they went over to help their neighbors. <p>And afterwards, even though all the employees here at M. Luis are on salary, even though the company had just taken a big financial hit, Cidalia and Natalia paid everyone overtime, and along with each check, they included a personalized note saying just how much they had appreciated the efforts of the workers. And Cidalia said, everybody says the biggest asset to a business is employees. Some people mean it; some people don't. We actually do. <p>So this company right here is full of folks who do right by each other. They don't try to see if they can work every angle. They don't lie about each other. They don't try to undermine each other. They understand they're supposed to be on the same team. You pitch in, you look out for one another. When somebody gets knocked down, you help them back up. You don't ask what can you get out of this, because you know that success doesn't depend on one of you, it depends on all of you working together. <p>Well, America is no different. I see that same spirit in so many cities and towns that I visit all across the country. It is alive and well all across the country. It's alive and well in this community where restaurants and businesses are rallying around their regulars, and they're looking out for all the dedicated public servants who have been furloughed. You've been reading stories about restaurants who are saying, you know what, while you're on furlough, come on, we'll give you a burger, we'll give you a meal, we'll help you out. <p>That's the American ideal. It says, we're working together, looking out for one another, meeting our responsibilities, doing our jobs, thinking about future generations. And that's why I believe, ultimately, reason and common sense will prevail. That spirit, at some point, will infiltrate Washington as well. Because I think the American people are so good and so decent, they're going to get better behavior from their Government than this. And we'll once again make sure this is a country where you can make it if you try. <p>So thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"218" "\"Good morning. Earlier this week, the Republican House of Representatives chose to shut down a Government they don't like over a health care law that they don't like. Now, I've talked a lot about the real-world consequences of this shutdown in recent days: the services disrupted, the benefits delayed, the public servants kicked off the job without pay. <p>But today I want to let the Americans dealing with those real-world consequences have their say. And these are just a few of the many heartbreaking letters I've gotten from them in the past couple weeks, including more than 30,000 over the past few days. <p>Kelly Mumper lives in rural Alabama. She works in early education, and she has three kids of her own in the Marines. Here's what she wrote to me on Wednesday: <p>\\"Our Head Start agency was forced to stop providing services on October 1 for over 770 children, and 175 staff were furloughed. I'm extremely concerned for the welfare of these children. There are parents who work and who attend school. Where are they leaving their children? Is it a safe environment? Are [they] getting the food that they receive at their Head Start program?\\" <p>On the day Julia Pruden's application to buy a home for her and her special needs children was approved by the USDA's rural development direct loan program, she wrote me from Minot, North Dakota: <p>\\"We put in an offer to purchase a home this weekend, and it was accepted. If funding does not go through, our chances of the American Dream [are] down the drain. We've worked really hard to get our credit to be acceptable to purchase a home. If it weren't for the direct lending program provided by the USDA, we would not qualify to buy the home we found.\\" <p>These are just two of the many letters I've received from people who work hard, try to make ends meet, try to do right by their families. They're military or military spouses who've seen commissaries closed on their bases. They're veterans worried the services they've earned won't be there. They're business owners who've seen their contracts with the Government put on hold, worried they'll have to let people go. I want them to know, I read the stories you share with me. <p>These are our fellow Americans. These are the people who sent us here to serve. And I know that Republicans in the House of Representatives are hearing the same kinds of stories too. <p>As I made clear to them this week, there's only one way out of this reckless and damaging shutdown: pass a budget that funds our Government with no partisan strings attached. The Senate's already done this. And there are enough Republican and Democratic votes in the House of Representatives willing to do the same and end this shutdown immediately. Unfortunately, the far right of the Republican Party won't let Speaker Boehner give that bill a yes-or-no vote. Take that vote. Stop this farce. End this shutdown now. <p>The American people don't get to demand ransom in exchange for doing their job. Neither does Congress. They don't get to hold our democracy or our economy hostage over a settled law. They don't get to kick a child out of Head Start if they don't agree to take her parent's health insurance away. That's not how our democracy is supposed to work. <p>That's why I won't pay a ransom in exchange for reopening the Government. And I certainly won't pay a ransom in exchange for raising the debt ceiling. For as reckless as a Government shutdown is, an economic shutdown that comes with default&mdash;with America not paying its bills&mdash;would be dramatically worse. <p>I'll always work with anyone of either party on ways to grow this economy, create new jobs, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul. But not under the shadow of these threats to our economy. So my message is simple: Pass a budget. End this Government shutdown. Pay our bills. Prevent an economic shutdown. <p>These Americans and millions of others are counting on Congress to do the right thing. And I will do everything I can to make sure they do. <p>Thanks.\" "
"219" "\"Okay. I'm here at FEMA for a couple of reasons. First of all, I want to thank Craig Fugate, his entire team, and the incredible workers who are here at FEMA. They are having to, under less than optimal situations, still respond to Mother Nature, which doesn't stop just because the Government has shut down. <p>I wanted to get initially a briefing on what had happened with Hurricane Karen, became Tropical Storm Karen, and then fortunately dissipated, so we dodged a bullet there. In the meantime, we're on tornado watch here in the Mid-Atlantic States because of severe weather patterns. And we've got blizzards up north; we've got some weather patterns in the middle of the country that we're still monitoring. And so I just want to say thank you to all of you for the incredible work that you're doing. <p>I think it's important to understand that the people here at FEMA have been doing everything they can to respond to potential events. Here at FEMA, they're in touch with their State and local partners in case resources are needed. FEMA remains prepared for natural disasters year around, with supplies prepositioned in distribution centers across the country. <p>But their job has been made more difficult. Thanks to the folks at FEMA, we were prepared for what might have happened down in Florida. Nevertheless, the Government is still shut down, services are still interrupted, and hundreds of thousands of hard-working public servants, including many FEMA professionals, are still furloughed without pay, or they're not allowed to work at all. <p>So Craig was just explaining to me, here at FEMA, about 86 percent of the FEMA workforce is furloughed. In response to the potential event that might have happened down in Florida and along the coasts, Craig called back 200 of those workers. Keep in mind, calling them back doesn't mean they were getting paid, it just means they had the privilege of working without pay to make sure that they were doing everything they can to respond to the potential needs of their fellow citizens. <p>Now that this particular storm has dissipated, Craig is going to have to refurlough at least a hundred of those folks who were called back. So think about that. Here you are, somebody who's a FEMA professional dedicated to doing your job; at a moment's notice, you're willing to show up here in case people got in trouble and respond to them, even though you're not getting paid, even though you don't have certainty. And now you're being put back on furlough because the Government is shut down. That's no way of doing business. <p>That, by the way, just speaks to the day-to-day emergencies that may come up and that is FEMA's job to respond to. Craig was also explaining the fact that when it comes to training first responders, for example, we have on a weekly basis already scheduled training for first responders that now have to be rescheduled. It will probably end up ultimately costing the Government more money for us to put those things back together again. And so not only is this shutdown hurting FEMA workers, not only is it making it more difficult for us to respond to potential natural disasters, but it may actually end up costing taxpayers more than it should. <p>Right now Congress should do what's in the best interests of the economy and the American people, and that's move beyond this manufactured crisis and work together to focus on growth, jobs, and providing the vital services that Americans all across the country depend on, including the services that FEMA provides. <p>I heard a lot of talk over the weekend that the real problem is, is that the President will not negotiate. Well, let me tell you something: I have said from the start of the year that I'm happy to talk to Republicans about anything related to the budget. There's not a subject that I am not willing to engage in, work on, negotiate, and come up with commonsense compromises on. <p>What I've said is that I cannot do that under the threat that if Republicans don't get a hundred percent of their way, they're going to either shut down the Government or they are going to default on America's debt, so that America for the first time in history does not pay its bills. That is not something I will do. We're not going to establish that pattern. <p>We're not going to negotiate under the threat of further harm to our economy and middle class families. We're not going to negotiate under the threat of a prolonged shutdown until Republicans get a hundred percent of what they want. We're not going to negotiate under the threat of economic catastrophe that economists and CEOs increasingly warn would result if Congress chose to default on America's obligations. <p>Now, the other thing I heard over the weekend was this notion that Congress doesn't have the capacity to end this shutdown. The truth of the matter is, there are enough Republican and Democratic votes in the House of Representatives right now to end this shutdown immediately with no partisan strings attached. The House should hold that vote today. If Republicans and Speaker Boehner are saying there are not enough votes, then they should prove it. Let the bill go to the floor and let's see what happens. Just vote. Let every Member of Congress vote their conscience, and they can determine whether or not they want to shut the Government down. <p>My suspicion is&mdash;my very strong suspicion is&mdash;that there are enough votes there. And the reason that Speaker Boehner hasn't called a vote on it is because he doesn't, apparently, want to see the Government shutdown end at the moment unless he's able to extract concessions that don't have anything to do with the budget. Well, I think the American people simply want Government to work. And there's no reason that there has to be a shutdown in order for the kinds of negotiations Speaker Boehner says he wants to proceed. Hold a vote. Call a vote right now, and let's see what happens. <p>The second thing Congress needs to do is to raise the debt ceiling next week so the Treasury can pay the bills that Congress has already spent. That's what most Americans do if they buy something. If they buy a car or if they buy a house, if they put something on a credit card, they understand they've got to pay the bills. <p>This is something routine. It's been done more than 40 times since Ronald Reagan was President. It has never before been used in the kind of ways that the Republicans are talking about using it right now. We can't threaten economic catastrophe in the midst of budget negotiations. <p>So authorize the Treasury to pay America's bills. Pass a budget, end the Government shutdown, pay our bills, and prevent an economic shutdown. <p>And as soon as that happens, I am eager and ready to sit down and negotiate with Republicans on a whole range of issues: How do we create more jobs? How do we grow the economy? How do we boost manufacturing? How do we make sure our kids are getting a first-class education? All those things will be on the table. I'm happy to talk about health care, happy to talk about energy policy, how do we deal with our long-term fiscal situation. <p>All those things I've been eager and anxious to talk to Republicans about for the last 7 months, and I've put out a budget that specifically lays out my vision for how we're going to grow this economy. And I expect the Republicans should do the same, and we can negotiate it. But we shouldn't hurt a whole bunch of people in order for one side to think that they're going to have a little more leverage in those negotiations. <p>Last point I'm going to make: The bill that is being presented to end the Government shutdown reflects Republican priorities. It's the Republican budget. The funding levels of this short-term funding bill, called the CR, is far lower than what Democrats think it should be. Nevertheless, Democrats are prepared to put the majority of votes on to reopen the Government. So when you hear this notion that Democrats aren't compromising, we're compromising so much we're willing to reopen the Government at funding levels that reflect Republican wishes, don't at all reflect our wishes. <p>For example, here at FEMA, they're still subject to the sequester, so even before the shutdown, they were having trouble making sure that everybody was staying on the job and fulfilling all of their various functions. <p>We need to get that sequester lifted that's been hanging over the head of the economy and Federal agencies during the course of this entire year. This short-term legislation to reopen the Government doesn't even address that. That has to be done in a broader budget framework. <p>So Democrats have said we are willing to pass a bill that reflects the Republicans' priorities in terms of funding levels. That's a pretty significant compromise. What we're not willing to do is to create a permanent pattern in which unless you get your way, the Government is shut down or America defaults. That's not how we do business in this country, and we're not going to start now. <p>So again, I want to thank everybody at FEMA here for the extraordinary work that we're&mdash;that you're doing. You show each and every day that you take your responsibilities seriously. You do your jobs with consummate professionalism. And hopefully, you're setting a good example for Members of Congress. They need to be doing the same thing. And if they do, then there's no reason why we all can't move forward and make sure that we're taking care of America's business. All right? <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"220" "\"Good morning. Over the past few days, I've met with Republicans and Democrats from both Houses of Congress in an effort to reopen your Government and remove the dangers of default from our economy. <p>It's a positive development that House Republicans have agreed on the need to avoid the economic consequences of not meeting our country's commitments. Because once the debt ceiling is raised and the shutdown is over, there's a lot we can accomplish together. <p>We've created 7&frac12; million new jobs in the past 3&frac12; years. Now let's create more. We've cut our deficits in half over the past 4 years. Now let's do it in a smarter, balanced way that lets us afford to invest in the things we need to grow. <p>The truth is, there's a lot we can agree on. But one thing we have to agree on is that there is no good reason anyone should keep suffering through this shutdown. I met with some really innovative small-business owners on Friday who've already lost contracts, lost customers, and put hiring on hold because the pain of this Republican shutdown has trickled down to their bottom lines. It's hurting the very citizens that our Government exists to serve. That's why a growing number of reasonable Republicans say it should end now. <p>And it wouldn't be wise, as some suggest, to just kick the debt ceiling can down the road for a couple months and flirt with a first-ever intentional default right in the middle of the holiday shopping season, because damage to America's sterling credit rating wouldn't just cause global markets to go haywire. It would become more expensive for everyone in America to borrow money: students paying for college, newlyweds buying a home. It would amount to a new tax&mdash;a Republican default tax&mdash;on every family and business in America. <p>It doesn't have to be this way; it's not supposed to be this way. Manufacturing crises to extract massive concessions isn't how our democracy works, and we have to stop it. Politics is a battle of ideas, but you advance those ideas through elections and legislation, not extortion. <p>I know you're frustrated by what you see in your Nation's Capital right now. But because it's easy to get lost in or give up on the political back-and-forth, I want you to remember: This is not normal. Our Government is closed for the first time in 17 years. A political party is risking default for the first time since the 1700s. This is not normal, and that's why we have to put a stop to it. Not only because it's dangerous, but because it saps everyone's faith in our extraordinary system of self-government. And that hurts us all. <p>Whether it's the work of creating jobs, growing the economy, or getting our fiscal house in order for the long haul, we've got a lot of work to do, and constant brinksmanship doesn't let us do it. It inflicts real pain on real people. It creates spasms of uncertainty for business owners. It threatens our Nation's credit and standing in the world. And the longer it goes on, the more frequently this brinksmanship is inflicted, the more we'll see markets react, businesses put off plans to spend and hire, and unemployment claims tick up. The hundreds of thousands of hard-working civil servants who go even longer without pay will worry that they won't be able to cover their bills and that their own creditworthiness will be ruined for no good reason at all. <p>And I want to thank all the neighbors and local business owners who've shown acts of kindness to these Americans who serve their country. I ask that same spirit of citizenship from lenders who do business with these folks because they're being punished enough through no fault of their own. <p>So let's pass a budget, put people back to work, and end this Republican shutdown. Let's pay our bills and prevent an economic shutdown. Then, let's get back to the work of the American people because there is so much else we should be focusing our energies on right now. We've got to create more jobs. We've got kids to educate; we've got an immigration system to fix. We've got more troops to bring home and a middle class to rebuild and opportunity to restore. There's so much America has going for it in this new century. And as always, this country works better when we work together. <p>Thank you, and have a great weekend.\" "
"221" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. Please have a seat. On behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the White House. <p>Last month, the United States Army released a remarkable piece of video. It's from the combat helmet cameras of a medevac helicopter crew in Afghanistan. And it's shaky, and it's grainy, but it takes us to the front lines that our troops face every single day, and it's useful to remember that there is still a whole lot of our troops in Afghanistan in harm's way. In that video, as the helicopter touches down by a remote village, you see, out of a cloud of dust, an American soldier. He's without his helmet, standing in the open, exposing himself to enemy fire, standing watch over a severely wounded soldier. <p>He helps carry that wounded soldier to the helicopter and places him inside. And then, amidst the whipping wind and the deafening roar of the helicopter blades, he does something unexpected. He leans in and kisses the wounded soldier on the head, a simple act of compassion and loyalty to a brother in arms. And as the door closes and the helicopter takes off, he turns and goes back the way he came, back into the heat of battle. <p>In our Nation's history, we have presented our highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor, nearly 3,500 times for actions above and beyond the call of duty. But this may be the first time that we can actually bear witness to a small fraction of those actions for ourselves. And today we honor the American in that video&mdash;the soldier who went back in&mdash;Captain William Swenson. <p>And not far away that day was then-Corporal Dakota Meyer, to whom we presented the Medal of Honor 2 years ago. Today is only the second time in nearly half a century that the Medal of Honor has been awarded to two survivors of the same battle. Dakota is not here today, but I wanted to welcome some of the soldiers and marines who fought alongside both these men&mdash;and the families of those who gave their lives that day. <p>I want to welcome all of our distinguished guests, including members of the Medal of Honor Society, whose ranks today grow by one more. Most of all, I want to welcome Will's wonderful parents Julia and Carl and Will's girlfriend Kelsey. Had a chance to visit with them. Both Carl and Julia are former college professors, so instead of a house full of GI Joes, Will grew up in Seattle surrounded by educational games. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm told that even when Will was little, his mom was always a stickler for grammar, always making sure he said \\"to whom\\" instead of \\"to who.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] So I'm going to be very careful today. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I just had a chance to spend some time with them, and I have to say, Will is a pretty low-key guy. His idea of a good time isn't a big ceremony like this one. He'd rather be somewhere up in the mountains or on a trail, surrounded by cedar trees instead of cameras. But I think our Nation needs this ceremony today. Moments like this, Americans like Will, remind us of what our country can be at its best: a nation of citizens who look out for one another, who meet our obligations to one another, not just when it's easy, but also when it's hard. Maybe especially when it's hard. <p>Will, you're an example to everyone in this city and to our whole country of the professionalism and patriotism that we should strive for&mdash;whether we wear uniform or not&mdash;not just on particular occasions, but all the time. <p>For those who aren't familiar with the story of the battle that led Will to be here today, I want to take you back to that September morning 4 years ago. It's around sunrise. A column of Afghan soldiers and their American advisers are winding their way up a narrow trail towards a village to meet with elders. But just as the first soldier reaches the outskirts of the village, all hell breaks loose. <p>Almost instantly, four Americans&mdash;three marines, one Navy&mdash;at the front of the column are surrounded. Will and the soldiers in the center of the column are pinned down. Rocket-propelled grenades, mortar, machine gun fire&mdash;all of this is pouring in from three sides. <p>As he returns fire, Will calls for air support. But his initial requests are denied; Will and his team are too close to the village. And then Will learns that his noncommissioned officer, Sergeant First Class Kenneth Westbrook, has been shot in the neck. So Will breaks across 50 meters of open space, bullets biting all around. Lying on his back, he presses a bandage to Kenneth's wounds with one hand and calls for a medevac with the other, trying to keep his buddy calm. <p>By this time, the enemy has gotten even closer, just 20 or 30 meters away, and over the radio, they're demanding the Americans to surrender. So Will stops treating Kenneth long enough to respond by lobbing a grenade. <p>And finally, after more than an hour and a half of fighting, air support arrives. Will directs them to nearby targets. Then, it's time to move, so exposing himself again to enemy fire, Will helps carry Kenneth the length of more than two football fields, down steep terraces, to that helicopter. And then, in the moment captured by those cameras, Will leans in to say goodbye. <p>But more Americans and more Afghans are still out there. So Will does something incredible. He jumps behind the wheel of an unarmored Ford Ranger pickup truck. A marine gets in the passenger seat. And they drive that truck&mdash;this is a vehicle designed for the highway&mdash;straight into the battle. <p>Twice they pick up injured Afghan soldiers, bullets whizzing past them, slamming into the pickup truck. Twice they bring them back. When the truck gives out, they grab a Humvee. The marine by Will's side has no idea how they survived. But, he says: \\"By that time it didn't matter. We weren't going to leave any soldiers behind.\\" <p>Finally, a helicopter spots those four missing Americans, hours after they were trapped in the open ambush. So Will gets in another Humvee, with a crew that includes Dakota Meyer. And together, they drive. Past enemy fighters, up through the valley, exposed once more. And when they reach the village, Will jumps out, drawing even more fire, dodging even more bullets. But they reach those Americans, lying where they fell. Will and the others carry them out, one by one. They bring their fallen brothers home. <p>Scripture tells us, \\"The greatest among you shall be your servant.\\" Captain Will Swenson was a leader on that September morning. But like all great leaders, he was also a servant: to the men he commanded, to the more than a dozen Afghans and Americans whose lives he saved, to the families of those who gave their last full measure of devotion on that faraway field. As one of his fellow soldiers later said, \\"Will did things that nobody else would ever do, and he did it for his guys and for everybody on the ground, to get them out.\\" <p>And that's why, after I called Will to tell him he'd be receiving this medal, one of the first things he did was to invite to this ceremony those who fought alongside him. And I'd like all of those who served with such valor alongside Will, both Army and Marines, who fought for each other, please stand and be recognized. [<i>Applause</i>] Thank you. <p>Will also reached out to the families of the four Americans who gave their lives that day. To them he wrote&mdash;and I'm quoting Will now&mdash;\\"We have never met. We have never spoken. But I would like to believe that I know something about each of you through the actions of your loved ones on that day. They were part of a team. And you are now part of that team.\\" <p>So I would ask the members of this team&mdash;the families of First Lieutenant Michael Johnson, Gunnery Sergeant Edwin Johnson, Gunnery Sergeant Aaron Kenefick, and Hospitalman Third Class James Layton, as well as the family of Kenneth Westbrook&mdash;to please stand. <p>Kenneth was the soldier Will delivered to the safety of that helicopter. And after being airlifted out, he made it to Walter Reed. He started rehab and spent time with his wife Charlene, who joins us here today. She still remembers the first time she spoke to Will, when he called from Afghanistan to check in on Kenneth. <p>Soon after that phone call, however, Kenneth took a turn for the worse. He succumbed to complications from his treatment. But I think it's fair to say that Charlene will always be grateful for the final days she was able to spend with her husband. And even now, a month rarely goes by when Will doesn't call or text, checking in with Charlene and her three boys. \\"That's the kind of man he is,\\" Charlene says about Will. \\"You don't have to ask Will for help. He just knows when to be there for you.\\" <p>So Will Swenson was there for his brothers. He was there for their families. As a nation, we thank God that patriots like him are there for us all. <p>So, Will, God bless you and all the men that you fought alongside and everything that you've done for us. God bless all our men and women in uniform. And God bless the United States of America. <p>With that, I'd like my Military Aide to read the citation, please. <p>[<i>At this point, Lt. Cmdr. Tiffany F. Hill, USN, Navy Aide to the President, read the citation. The President then presented the medal, assisted by Maj. Michael P. Wagner, USA, Army Aide to the President. Following the presentation, Maj. Gen. Donald L. Rutherford, USA, Army Chief of Chaplains, said a prayer.</i>] <p>Well, let me say once again, not only to Will, but all our men and women in uniform who have served us with such incredible courage and professionalism, that America is grateful for you. To the families of those we've lost, we will never forget. <p>And, Will, you are a remarkable role model for all of us, and we're very grateful for your service. <p>We are going to have a reception after this. I hear the food's pretty good around here. [<i>Laughter</i>] And so I hope all of you have a chance to stay, and those of you who have a chance to say thank you to Will, personally, obviously, that's very welcome. <p>I'm going to be exiting with Will and Michelle first. We'll take a couple of pictures. But enjoy yourselves this afternoon. <p>God bless America.\" "
"222" "\"<i>The President.</i> Good evening, everybody. Tonight the Republicans and Democrats in Congress have come together around an agreement that will reopen our Government and remove the threat of default from our economy. <p>The Senate has now voted to approve this agreement, and Democrats and Republicans in the House still have an important vote to take, but I want to thank the leaders of both parties for getting us to this point. Once this agreement arrives on my desk, I will sign it immediately. We'll begin reopening our Government immediately, and we can begin to lift this cloud of uncertainty and unease from our businesses and from the American people. <p>I'll have more to say about this tomorrow. And I've got some thoughts about how we can move forward in the remainder of the year and stay focused on the job at hand, because there's a lot of work ahead of us, including our need to earn back the trust of the American people that's been lost over the last few weeks. And we can begin to do that by addressing the real issues that they care about. <p>I've said it before; I'll say it again: I am willing to work with anybody, I am eager to work with anybody&mdash;Democrat or Republican, House or Senate Members&mdash;on any idea that will grow our economy, create new jobs, strengthen the middle class, and get our fiscal house in order for the long term. I've never believed that Democrats have a monopoly on good ideas. And despite the differences over the issue of shutting down our Government, I'm convinced that Democrats and Republicans can work together to make progress for America. <p>In fact, there are things that we know will help strengthen our economy that we could get done before this year is out. We still need to pass a law to fix our broken immigration system. We still need to pass a farm bill. And with the shutdown behind us and budget committees forming, we now have an opportunity to focus on a sensible budget that is responsible, that is fair, and that helps hard-working people all across this country. <p>And we could get all these things done even this year if everybody comes together in a spirit of how are we going to move this country forward and put the last 3 weeks behind us. That's what I believe the American people are looking for, not a focus on politics, not a focus on elections, but a focus on the concrete steps that can improve their lives. That's going to be my focus. I'm looking forward to Congress doing the same. <p>But once again, I want to thank the leadership for coming together and getting this done. Hopefully, next time, it won't be in the 11th hour. One of the things that I said throughout this process is, we've got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis. And my hope and expectation is, everybody has learned that there's no reason why we can't work on the issues at hand, why we can't disagree between the parties while still being agreeable and make sure that we're not inflicting harm on the American people when we do have disagreements. <p>So, hopefully, that's a lesson that will be internalized&mdash;and not just by me, but also by Democrats and Republicans; not only the leaders, but also the rank and file. <p>Thanks very much, everybody. <p><i>Federal Budget </i><p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, isn't this going to happen all over again in a few months? <p><i>The President.</i> No. [<i>Laughter</i>]\" "
"223" "\"<i>The President.</i> Good morning, everybody. Please have a seat. <p>Last night I signed legislation to reopen our Government and pay America's bills. Because Democrats and responsible Republicans came together, the first Government shutdown in 17 years is now over. The first default in more than 200 years will not happen. These twin threats to our economy have now been lifted. And I want to thank those Democrats and Republicans for getting together and ultimately getting this job done. <p>Now, there's been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown. But let's be clear: There are no winners here. These last few weeks have inflicted completely unnecessary damage on our economy. We don't know yet the full scope of the damage, but every analyst out there believes it slowed our growth. <p>We know that families have gone without paychecks or services they depend on. We know that potential home buyers have gotten fewer mortgages and small-business loans have been put on hold. We know that consumers have cut back on spending and that half of all CEOs say that the shutdown and the threat of shutdown set back their plans to hire over the next 6 months. We know that just the threat of default, of America not paying all the bills that we owe on time, increased our borrowing costs, which adds to our deficit. <p>And of course, we know that the American people's frustration with what goes on in this town has never been higher. That's not a surprise that the American people are completely fed up with Washington. At a moment when our economic recovery demands more jobs, more momentum, we've got yet another self-inflicted crisis that set our economy back. And for what? <p>There was no economic rationale for all of this. Over the past 4 years, our economy has been growing, our businesses have been creating jobs, and our deficits have been cut in half. We hear some Members who pushed for the shutdown say they were doing it to save the American economy, but nothing has done more to undermine our economy these past 3 years than the kind of tactics that create these manufactured crises. <p>And you don't have to take my word for it. The agency that put America's credit rating on watch the other day explicitly cited all of this, saying that our economy \\"remains more dynamic and resilient\\" than other advanced economies and that the only thing putting us at risk is&mdash;and I'm quoting here&mdash;\\"repeated brinksmanship.\\" That's what the credit rating agency said; that wasn't a political statement; that was an analysis of what's hurting our economy by people whose job it is to analyze these things. <p>That also happens to be the view of our diplomats who've been hearing from their counterparts internationally. Some of the same folks who pushed for the shutdown and threatened default claim their actions were needed to get America back on the right track, to make sure we're strong. But probably nothing has done more damage to America's credibility in the world, our standing with other countries, than the spectacle that we've seen these past several weeks. It's encouraged our enemies, it's emboldened our competitors, and it's depressed our friends, who look to us for steady leadership. <p>Now, the good news is we'll bounce back from this. We always do. America is the bedrock of the global economy for a reason. We are the indispensable nation that the rest of the world looks to as the safest and most reliable place to invest, something that's made it easier for generations of Americans to invest in their own futures. We have earned that responsibility over more than two centuries because of the dynamism of our economy and our entrepreneurs, the productivity of our workers, but also because we keep our word and we meet our obligations. That's what full faith and credit means: You can count on us. <p>And today I want our people and our businesses and the rest of the world to know that the full faith and credit of the United States remains unquestioned. But to all my friends in Congress, understand that how business is done in this town has to change, because we've all got a lot of work to do on behalf of the American people. And that includes the hard work of regaining their trust. Our system of self-government doesn't function without it. And now that the Government is reopened and this threat to our economy is removed, all of us need to stop focusing on the lobbyists and the bloggers and the talking heads on radio and the professional activists, who profit from conflict, and focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do. And that's, grow this economy, create good jobs, strengthen the middle class, educate our kids, lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul. That's why we're here; that should be our focus. <p>Now, that won't be easy. We all know that we have divided Government right now. There's a lot of noise out there, and the pressure from the extremes affect how a lot of Members of Congress see the day-to-day work that's supposed to be done here. And let's face it: The American people don't see every issue the same way. But that doesn't mean we can't make progress. And when we disagree, we don't have to suggest that the other side doesn't love this country or believe in free enterprise&mdash;or all the other rhetoric that seems to get worse every single year. If we disagree on something, we can move on and focus on the things we agree on and get some stuff done. <p>Let me be specific about three places where I believe we can make progress right now. First, in the coming days and weeks, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, a budget that grows our economy faster and shrinks our long-term deficits further. <p>At the beginning of this year, that's what both Democrats and Republicans committed to doing. The Senate passed a budget; House passed a budget; they were supposed to come together and negotiate. And had one side not decided to pursue a strategy of brinksmanship, each side could have gotten together and figured out, how do we shape a budget that provides certainty to businesses and people who rely on Government, provides certainty to investors in our economy? And we'd be growing faster right now. <p>Now, the good news is the legislation I signed yesterday now requires Congress to do exactly that, what it could have been doing all along. And we shouldn't approach this process of creating a budget as an ideological exercise, just cutting for the sake of cutting. The issue is not growth versus fiscal responsibility: We need both. We need a budget that deals with the issues that most Americans are focused on, creating more good jobs that pay better wages. <p>And remember, the deficit is getting smaller, not bigger. It's going down faster than it has in the last 50 years. The challenge we have right now are not short-term deficits, it's the long-term obligations that we have around things like Medicare and Social Security. And we want to make sure those are there for future generations. <p>So the key now is a budget that cuts out the things that we don't need, closes corporate tax loopholes that don't help create jobs, and frees up resources for the things that do help us grow, like education and infrastructure and research. And these things historically have not been partisan. And this shouldn't be as difficult as it's been in past years because we already spend less than we did a few years ago. Our deficits are half of what they were a few years ago. The debt problems we have now are long term, and we can address them without shortchanging our kids or shortchanging our grandkids or weakening the security that current generations have earned from their hard work. So that's number one. <p>Number two, we should finish fixing the job of our&mdash;let me say that again. Number two, we should finish the job of fixing a broken immigration system. There's already a broad coalition across America that's behind this effort of comprehensive immigration reform, from business leaders to faith leaders, to law enforcement. In fact, the Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support that would make the biggest commitment to border security in our history; would modernize our legal immigration system; make sure everyone plays by the same rules; make sure that folks who came here illegally have to pay a fine, pay back taxes, meet their responsibilities. That bill has already passed the Senate. And economists estimate that if that bill becomes law, our economy would be 5 percent larger two decades from now. That's $1.4 trillion in new economic growth. <p>The majority of Americans think this is the right thing to do. And it's sitting there waiting for the House to pass it. Now, if the House has ideas on how to improve the Senate bill, let's hear them. Let's start the negotiations. But let's not leave this problem to keep festering for another year or 2 years or 3 years. This can and should get done by the end of this year. <p>Number three, we should pass a farm bill, one that American farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need, one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the long-term certainty that they deserve. <p>Again, the Senate's already passed a solid bipartisan bill. It's got support from Democrats and Republicans. It's sitting in the House waiting for passage. If House Republicans have ideas that they think would improve the farm bill, let's see them. Let's negotiate. What are we waiting for? Let's get this done. <p>So passing a budget, immigration reform, farm bill&mdash;those are three specific things that would make a huge difference in our economy right now. And we could get them done by the end of the year if our focus is on what's good for the American people. And that's just the big stuff. There are all kinds of other things that we could be doing that don't get as much attention. <p>I understand we will not suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. Democrats and Republicans are far apart on a lot of issues. And I recognize there are folks on the other side who think that my policies are misguided&mdash;that's putting it mildly. That's okay; that's democracy; that's how it works. We can debate those differences vigorously, passionately, in good faith, through the normal democratic process. <p>And sometimes, we'll be just too far apart to forge an agreement. But that should not hold back our efforts in areas where we do agree. We shouldn't fail to act on areas that we do agree or could agree just because we don't think it's good politics, just because the extremes in our party don't like the word compromise. <p>I will look for willing partners wherever I can to get important work done. And there's no good reason why we can't govern responsibly, despite our differences, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. In fact, one of the things that I hope all of us have learned these past few weeks is that it turns out, smart, effective Government is important. It matters. I think the American people during this shutdown had a chance to get some idea of all the things, large and small, that Government does that make a difference in people's lives. <p>We hear all the time about how Government is the problem. Well, it turns out we rely on it in a whole lot of ways. Not only does it keep us strong through our military and our law enforcement, it plays a vital role in caring for our seniors and our veterans, educating our kids, making sure our workers are trained for the jobs that are being created, arming our businesses with the best science and technology so they can compete with companies from other countries. It plays a key role in keeping our food and our toys and our workplaces safe. It helps folks rebuild after a storm. It conserves our natural resources. It finances startups. It helps to sell our products overseas. It provides security to our diplomats abroad. <p>So let's work together to make Government work better, instead of treating it like an enemy or purposely making it work worse. That's not what the Founders of this Nation envisioned when they gave us the gift of self-government. You don't like a particular policy or a particular President? Then argue for your position, go out there and win an election, push to change it, but don't break it. Don't break what our predecessors spent over two centuries building. That's not being faithful to what this country is about. <p>And that brings me to one last point. I've got a simple message for all the dedicated and patriotic Federal workers who've either worked without pay or been forced off the job without pay these past few weeks, including most of my own staff: Thank you. Thanks for your service. Welcome back. What you do is important. It matters. <p>You defend our country overseas. You deliver benefits to our troops who've earned them when they come home. You guard our borders. You protect our civil rights. You help businesses grow and gain footholds in overseas markets. You protect the air we breathe and the water our children drink. And you push the boundaries of science and space, and you guide hundreds of thousands of people each day through the glories of this country. Thank you. What you do is important. And don't let anybody else tell you different. Especially the young people who come to this city to serve believe that it matters. Well, you know what, you're right. It does. <p>And those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job as best we can. And we come from different parties, but we are Americans first. And that's why disagreement cannot mean dysfunction. It can't degenerate into hatred. The American people's hopes and dreams are what matters, not ours. Our obligations are to them. Our regard for them compels us all, Democrats and Republicans, to cooperate and compromise and act in the best interests of our Nation&mdash;\\"one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\\" <p>Thanks very much.\" "
"224" "\"Hi, everybody. This week, because Democrats and responsible Republicans came together, the Government was reopened, and the threat of default was removed from our economy. <p>There's been a lot of discussion lately of the politics of this shutdown. But the truth is, there were no winners in this. At a time when our economy needs more growth and more jobs, the manufactured crisis of these last few weeks actually harmed jobs and growth. And it's understandable that your frustration with what goes on in Washington has never been higher. <p>The way business is done in Washington has to change. Now that these clouds of crisis and uncertainty have lifted, we need to focus on what the majority of Americans sent us here to do: grow the economy, create good jobs, strengthen the middle class, lay the foundation for broad-based prosperity, and get our fiscal house in order for the long haul. <p>It won't be easy. But we can make progress. Specifically, there are three places where I believe that Democrats and Republicans can work together right away. <p>First, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, one that grows our economy faster and shrinks our long-term deficits further. There's no choice between growth and fiscal responsibility; we need both. So we're making a serious mistake if a budget doesn't focus on what you're focused on: creating more good jobs that pay better wages. If we're going to free up resources for the things that help us grow&mdash;education, infrastructure, research&mdash;we should cut what we don't need and close corporate tax loopholes that don't help create jobs. This shouldn't be as difficult as it's been in past years. Remember, our deficits are shrinking, not growing. <p>Second, we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. There's already a broad coalition across America that's behind this effort, from business leaders to faith leaders, to law enforcement. It would grow our economy. It would secure our borders. The Senate has already passed a bill with strong bipartisan support. Now the House should too. The majority of Americans thinks this is the right thing to do. It can and should get done by the end of this year. <p>Third, we should pass a farm bill, one that America's farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need, and one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the longer term certainty they deserve. <p>We won't suddenly agree on everything now that the cloud of crisis has passed. But we shouldn't hold back on places where we do agree just because we don't think it's good politics or just because the extremes in our parties don't like compromise. I'll look for willing partners from either party to get important work done. There's no good reason why we can't govern responsibly, without lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. Because that isn't governing, it's just hurting the people we were sent here to serve. <p>Those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job the best we can. We come from different parties, but we're Americans first. And our obligations to you must compel all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to cooperate and compromise and act in the best interests of this country that we love. <p>Thanks everybody, and have a great weekend.\" "
"225" "\"<i>The President.</i> Everybody, have a seat. <p>[<i>At this point, Shelbyville, DE, resident Janice Baker, a beneficiary of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, made brief remarks, concluding as follows.</i>] <p><i>Ms. Baker. </i>Thank you all. And I am now honored to introduce the President of the United States. <p><i>The President.</i> Great job. <p><i>Ms. Baker. </i>Thank you. Thank you. <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Well, thank you, Janice. And thanks to everybody here for coming on this beautiful day. Welcome to the White House. <p>About 3 weeks ago, as the Federal Government shut down, the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplaces opened for business across the country. Well, we've now gotten the Government back open for the American people, and today I want to talk about how we're going to get the marketplaces running at full steam as well. And I'm joined today by folks who have either benefited from the Affordable Care Act already or who are helping their fellow citizens learn about what this law means for them and how they can get covered. <p>Of course, you've probably heard that healthcare.gov&mdash;the new web site where people can apply for health insurance and browse and buy affordable plans in most States&mdash;hasn't worked as smoothly as it was supposed to work. And the number of people who have visited the site has been overwhelming, which has aggravated some of these underlying problems. <p>Despite all that, thousands of people are signing up and saving money as we speak. Many Americans with a preexisting condition, like Janice, are discovering that they can finally get health insurance like everybody else. <p>So today I want to speak to every American who's looking to get affordable health insurance. I want you to know what's available to you and why it may be a good deal for you. And for those who've had some problems with the web site, I want to tell you what we're doing to make it work better and how you can sign up to get covered in other ways. <p>But before I do that, let me remind everybody that the Affordable Care Act is not just a web site. It's much more. For the vast majority of Americans&mdash;for 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance through your employer or Medicare or Medicaid&mdash;you don't need to sign up for coverage through a web site at all. You've already got coverage. What the Affordable Care Act does for you is to provide you with new benefits and protections that have been in place for some time. You may not know it, but you're already benefiting from these provisions in the law. <p>For example, because of the Affordable Care Act, young people like Jasmine Jennings and Jessica Ugalde and Ezra Salop&mdash;all of whom are here today&mdash;they've been able to stay on their parents' plans until they're 26. Millions of other young people are currently benefiting from that part of the law. Another part of the Affordable Care Act is providing seniors with deeper discounts on their prescription medicine. Billions of dollars have been saved by seniors already. That's part of the law. It's already in place. It's happening right now. <p>Already, because of the Affordable Care Act, preventive care like mammograms and birth control are free through your employers. That's part of this law. So there are a wide range of consumer protections and benefits that you already have if you've got health insurance. You may not have noticed them, but you've got them, and they're not going anywhere. And they're not dependent on a web site. <p>Here's another thing that the Affordable Care Act does. In States where Governors and legislatures have wisely allowed it, the Affordable Care Act provides the opportunity for many Americans to get covered under Medicaid for the first time. So in Oregon, for example, that's helped cut the number of uninsured people by 10 percent just in the last 3 weeks. Think about that. That's 56,000 more Americans who now have health care. That doesn't depend on a web site. <p>Now, if you're one of the 15 percent of Americans who don't have health insurance&mdash;either because you can't afford it or because your employer doesn't offer it or because you're a small-businessperson and you have to go out on the individual market and buy it on your own and it's just too expensive&mdash;October 1 was an important date. That's when we opened the new marketplaces where people without health insurance or who can't afford health insurance or who aren't part of a group plan can finally start getting affordable coverage. <p>And the idea is simple. By enrolling in what we're calling these marketplaces, you become part of a big group plan, as if you were working for a big employer: a Statewide group plan that spreads risk between sick people and healthy people, between young and old, and then bargains on your behalf for the best deal on health care. What we've done is essentially created competition where there wasn't competition before. We created these big group plans, and now insurers are really interested in getting your business. And so insurers have created new health care plans with more choices to be made available through these marketplaces. <p>And as a result of this choice and this competition, prices have come down. When you add the new tax credits that many people are eligible for through the law, then the prices come down even further. So one study shows that through new options created by the Affordable Care Act, nearly 6 in 10 uninsured Americans will find that they can get covered for less than a hundred dollars a month. Think about that. Through the marketplaces, you can get health insurance for what may be the equivalent of your cell phone bill or your cable bill, and that's a good deal. <p>So the fact is, the product of the Affordable Care Act for people without health insurance is quality health insurance that's affordable. And that product is working. It's really good. And it turns out, there's a massive demand for it. So far, the national web site, healthcare.gov, has been visited nearly 20 million times. [<i>Applause</i>] Twenty million times. And there's great demand at the State level as well, because a lot&mdash;there are a bunch of States that are running their own marketplaces. <p>We know that nearly one-third of the people applying in Connecticut and Maryland, for example, are under 35 years old. They understand that they can get a good deal at low costs, have the security of health care, and this is not just for old folks like me, that everybody needs good quality health insurance. And all told, more than half a million consumers across the country have successfully submitted applications through Federal and State marketplaces. And many of those applications aren't just for individuals, it's for their entire families. So even more people are already looking to potentially take advantage of the high quality, affordable insurance that is provided through the Affordable Care Act. <p>So let me just recap here. The product is good. The health insurance that's being provided is good. It's high quality, and it's affordable. People can save money, significant money, by getting insurance that's being provided through these marketplaces. And we know that the demand is there. People are rushing to see what's available. And those who've already had a chance to enroll are thrilled with the result. Every day, people who were stuck with sky-high premiums because of preexisting conditions are getting affordable insurance for the first time or finding, like Janice did, that they're saving a lot of money. Every day, women are finally buying coverage that doesn't charge them higher premiums than men for the same care. Every day, people are discovering that new health insurance plans have to cover maternity care, mental health care, free preventive care. <p>So you just heard Janice's story. She owns her own small business. She recently became the first woman to enroll in coverage through Delaware's exchange. And it's true, it took her a few tries, but it was worth it after being turned down for insurance three times due to minor preexisting conditions. So now she'll be covered, she'll save 150 bucks a month, and she won't have to worry that one illness or accident will cost her her business that she's worked so hard to build. <p>And Janice is not alone. I recently received a letter from a woman named Jessica Sanford in Washington State. And here's what she wrote: \\"I am a single mom, no child support, self-employed, and I haven't had insurance for 15 years because it's too expensive. My son has ADHD and requires regular doctor visits, and his meds alone cost $250 per month. I have had an ongoing tendinitis problem due to my line of work that I haven't had treated. Now, finally, we get to have coverage because of the ACA for $169 per month. I was crying the other day when I signed up. So much stress lifted.\\" <p>Now, that is not untypical for a lot of folks like Jessica who have been struggling without health insurance. That's what the Affordable Care Act is all about. The point is, the essence of the law&mdash;the health insurance that's available to people&mdash;is working just fine. In some cases, actually, it's exceeding expectations: The prices are lower than we expected, the choice is greater than we expected. <p>But the problem has been that the web site that's supposed to make it easy to apply for and purchase the insurance is not working the way it should for everybody. And there's no sugarcoating it. The web site has been too slow, people have been getting stuck during the application process. And I think it's fair to say that nobody is more frustrated by that than I am. Because&mdash;precisely because the product is good, I want the cash registers to work. I want the checkout lines to be smooth. So I want people to be able to get this great product. And there's no excuse for the problems, and it's&mdash;these problems are getting fixed. <p>But while we're working out the kinks in the system, I want everybody to understand the nature of the problem. First of all, even with all the problems at healthcare.gov, the web site is still working for a lot of people, just not as quick or efficient or consistent as we want. And although many of these folks have found that they had to wait longer than they wanted, once they complete the process, they're very happy with the deal that's available to them, just like Janice is. <p>Second, I want everybody to remember that we're only 3 weeks into a 6-month open enrollment period, when you can buy these new plans. Keep in mind, the insurance doesn't start until January 1; that's the earliest that the insurance can kick in. No one who decides to purchase a plan has to pay their first premium until December 15. And unlike the day after Thanksgiving sales for the latest PlayStation or flat-screen TVs, the insurance plans don't run out. They're not going to sell out. They'll be available through the marketplace throughout the open enrollment period. The prices that insurers have set will not change. So everybody who wants insurance through the marketplace will get insurance, period. [<i>Applause</i>] Everybody who wants insurance through the marketplace will get insurance. <p>Third, we are doing everything we can possibly do to get the web sites working better, faster, sooner. We've got people working overtime, 24/7, to boost capacity and address the problems. Experts from some of America's top private sector tech companies who, by the way, have seen things like this happen before, they want it to work. They're reaching out. They're offering to send help. We've had some of the best IT talent in the entire country join the team. And we're well into a tech surge to fix the problem. And we are confident that we will get all the problems fixed. <p>Number four, while the web site will ultimately be the easiest way to buy insurance through the marketplace, it isn't the only way. And I want to emphasize this. Even as we redouble our efforts to get the site working as well as it's supposed to, we're also redoubling our efforts to make sure you can still buy the same quality, affordable insurance plans available on the marketplace the old-fashioned way: offline, either over the phone or in person. <p>And by the way, there are a lot of people who want to take advantage of this who are more comfortable working on the phone anyway or in person. So let me go through the specifics as to how you can do that if you're having problems with the web site or you just prefer dealing with a person. <p>Yesterday we updated the web site's home page to offer more information about the other avenues to enroll in affordable health care until the online option works for everybody. So you'll find information about how to talk to a specialist who can help you apply over the phone or to receive a downloadable application you can fill out yourself and mail in. <p>We've also added more staff to the call centers where you can apply for insurance over the phone. Those are already&mdash;they've been working. But a lot of people have decided first to go to the web site. But keep in mind, these call centers are already up and running. And you can get your questions answered by real people, 24 hours a day, in 150 different languages. The phone number for these call centers is 1-800-318-2596. I want to repeat that: 1-800-318-2596. Wait times have averaged less than 1 minute so far on the call centers, although I admit that the wait times probably might go up a little bit now that I've read the number out loud on national television. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But the point is, the call centers are available. You can talk to somebody directly, and they can walk you through the application process. And I guarantee you, if one thing is worth the wait, it's the safety and security of health care that you can afford or the amount of money that you can save by buying health insurance through the marketplaces. <p>Once you get on the phone with a trained representative, it usually takes about 25 minutes for an individual to apply for coverage, about 45 minutes for a family. Once you apply for coverage, you will be contacted by mail&mdash;by e-mail or postal mail about your coverage status. <p>But you don't have to just go through the phone. You can also apply in person with the help of local navigators. These are people specially trained to help you sign up for health care, and they exist all across the country. Or you can go to community health centers and hospitals. Just visit localhelp.healthcare.gov to find out where in your area you can get help and apply for insurance in person. <p>And finally, if you've already tried to apply through the web site and you've been stuck somewhere along the way, do not worry. In the coming weeks, we will contact you directly, personally, with a concrete recommendation for how you can complete your application, shop for coverage, pick a plan that meets your needs, and get covered once and for all. <p>So here's the bottom line. The product, the health insurance, is good. The prices are good. It is a good deal. People don't just want it, they're showing up to buy it. Nobody is madder than me about the fact that the web site isn't working as well as it should, which means it's going to get fixed. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And in the meantime, you can bypass the web site and apply by phone or in person. So don't let problems with the web site deter you from signing up or signing your family up or showing your friends how to sign up, because it is worth it. It will save you money. If you don't have health insurance, if you've got a preexisting condition, it will save you money, and it will give you the security that your family needs. <p>In fact, even with the web site issues, we've actually made the overall process of buying insurance through the marketplace a lot smoother and easier than the old way of buying insurance on your own. Part of the challenge here is that a lot of people may not remember what it's like to buy insurance the traditional way. <p>The way we've set it up, there are no more absurdly long application forms. There's no medical history questionnaire that goes on for pages and pages. There's no more getting denied because you've had a preexisting condition. Instead of contacting a bunch of different insurers once&mdash;one at a time, which is what Janice and a lot of people who are shopping on the individual market for health insurance had to do, there's one single place you can go shop and compare plans that have to compete for your business. There's one single phone number you can call for help. And once the kinks in the web site have been ironed out, it will be even smoother and even easier. But in the meantime, we will help you sign up, because consumers want to buy this product and insurance companies want to sell it to you. <p>Now, let me close by addressing some of the politics that have swirled around the Affordable Care Act. I recognize that the Republican Party has made blocking the Affordable Care Act its signature policy idea. Sometimes, it seems to be the one thing that unifies the party these days. [<i>Laughter</i>] In fact, they were willing to shut down the Government and potentially harm the global economy to try to get it repealed. And I'm sure that given the problems with the web site so far, they're going to be looking to go after it even harder. And let's admit it, with the web site not working as well as it needs to work, that makes a lot of supporters nervous because they know how it's been subject to so much attack, the Affordable Care Act generally. <p>But I just want to remind everybody, we did not wage this long and contentious battle just around a web site. That's not what this was about. We waged this battle to make sure that millions of Americans in the wealthiest nation on Earth finally have the same chance to get the same security of affordable quality health care as anybody else. That's what this is about. And the Affordable Care Act has done that. <p>People can now get good insurance. People with preexisting conditions can now afford insurance. And if the launch of this web site proves anything, it's that people across the country don't just need that security, they want that security. They want it. And in the meantime&mdash;I've said many times&mdash;I am willing to work with anyone on any idea to make this law perform even better. But it's time for folks to stop rooting for its failure, because hard-working, middle class families are rooting for its success. And if the product is good, they're willing to be patient. <p>Now, I got a letter last week from a self-employed man named John Mier in Leetsdale, Pennsylvania. He used the new marketplace to get himself and his wife covered and save a lot of money. And here's what he said, because it pretty much sums up my message today: \\"Yes, the web site really stank for the first week.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"But instead of paying $1,600 per month for a group insurance plan, we have a plan that will only cost us $692 a month, a savings of $900 per month.\\" John said that while he saw&mdash;when he saw what they'd be paying, he turned to his wife and told her: \\"We might just pull through. We can afford this.\\" And John eventually predicted that \\"the web site will work like a champ.\\" <p>So John's&mdash;he was frustrated by the web site, but he's feeling a little less frustrated once he found out that he was saving 900 bucks a month on his health insurance. And John is right, the web site is going to get fixed and the law works. That's why we fought so hard to pass this law: to save folks like John money; to give people who don't have health insurance the chance to get it for the first time; to lift from the American people the crushing burden of unaffordable health care; to free families from the pervasive fear that one illness&mdash;&mdash; <p>[<i>An event participant standing behind the President began to faint.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> There you go, you're okay. I'm right here. I got you. [<i>Laughter</i>] No, no, you're okay. This happens when I talk too long. [<i>Laughter</i>] You'll be okay. Here, why don't you go. You got her? <p>[<i>The participant was escorted into the White House.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Good catch, by the way, whoever was here. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But that's always our goal, to free families from the pervasive fear that one illness or one injury might cost you everything that you dedicated a lifetime to build. Our goal has always been to declare that in this country the security of health care is not a privilege for a fortunate few, it's a right for all to enjoy. That's what the Affordable Care Act is all about. That's its promise. And I intend to deliver on that promise. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you.\" "
"226" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you very much. Well, please have a seat, everybody. Good morning, and welcome to the White House. Today I'm here with leaders from business, from labor, from faith communities who are united around one goal: finishing the job of fixing a broken immigration system. <p>This is not just an idea whose time has come, this is an idea whose time has been around for years now. Leaders like all of you have worked together with Republicans and Democrats in this town in good faith for years to try to get this done. And this is the moment when we should be able to finally get the job done. <p>Now, it's no secret that the American people haven't seen much out of Washington that they like these days. The shutdown and the threat of the first default in more than 200 years inflicted real pain on our businesses and on families across the country. And it was a completely unnecessary, self-inflicted wound, with real costs to real people, and it can never happen again. <p>But even with the shutdown over and the threat of default eliminated, Democrats and Republicans still have some really big disagreements; there are some just fundamentally different views about how we should move forward on certain issues. On the other hand, as I said the day after the shutdown ended, that's no reason that we shouldn't be able to work together on the things that we do agree on. <p>We should be able to work together on a responsible budget that invests in the things that we need to grow our economy and create jobs even while we maintain fiscal discipline. We should be able to pass a farm bill that helps rural communities grow and protects vulnerable Americans in hard times. <p>And we should pass immigration reform. [<i>Applause</i>] We should pass immigration reform. It's good for our economy. It's good for our national security. It's good for our people. And we should do it this year. <p>Everybody knows that our current immigration system is broken. Across the political spectrum, people understand that. We've known it for years. It's not smart to invite some of the brightest minds from around the world to study here and then not let them start businesses here; we send them back to their home countries to start businesses and create jobs and invent new products someplace else. <p>It's not fair to businesses and middle class families who play by the rules when we allow companies that are trying to undercut the rules work in the shadow economy, to hire folks at lower wages or no benefits, no overtime, so that somehow they get a competitive edge from breaking the rules. That doesn't make sense. <p>It doesn't make sense to have 11 million people who are in this country illegally without any incentive or any way for them to come out of the shadows, get right with the law, meet their responsibilities, and permit their families then to move ahead. It's not smart. It's not fair. It doesn't make sense. We have kicked this particular can down the road for too long. <p>Now, the good news is, this year, the Senate has already passed an immigration reform bill by a wide, bipartisan majority that addressed all of these issues. It's a bill that would continue to strengthen our borders. It would level the playing field by holding unscrupulous employers accountable if they knowingly hire undocumented workers. <p>It would modernize our legal immigration system so that even as we train American workers for the jobs of the future, we're also attracting highly skilled entrepreneurs from beyond our borders to join with us to create jobs here in the United States. <p>It would make sure that everybody plays by the same rules by providing a pathway to earned citizenship for those who are here illegally: one that includes passing a background check, learning English, paying taxes, paying a penalty, getting in line behind everyone who is trying to come here the right way. <p>So it had all the component parts. It didn't have everything that I wanted, it didn't have anything&mdash;everything that anybody wanted, but it addressed the core challenges of how we create a immigration system that is fair, that's just, that is true to our traditions as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. And that's passed the Senate by a bipartisan majority. <p>So here's what we also know: that the bill would grow the economy and shrink our deficits. Independent economists have shown that if the Senate bill became law, over the next two decades, our economy would grow by $1.4 trillion more than it would if we don't pass the law. It would reduce our deficits by nearly a trillion dollars. <p>So this isn't just the right thing to do, it's the smart thing to do. Securing our borders, modernizing our legal immigration system, providing a pathway to earned, legalized citizenship, growing our economy, strengthening our middle class, reducing our deficits&mdash;that's what commonsense immigration reform will do. <p>Now, obviously, just because something is smart and fair and good for the economy and fiscally responsible and supported by business and labor&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and the evangelical community and many Democrats and many Republicans, that does not mean that it will actually get done. [<i>Laughter</i>] This is Washington, after all. <p>So everything tends to be viewed through a political prism, and everybody has been looking at the politics of this. And I know that there are some folks in this town who are primed to think, \\"Well, if Obama is for it, then I'm against it.\\" But I'd remind everybody that my Republican predecessor was also for it when he proposed reforms like this almost a decade ago, and I joined with 23 Senate Republicans back then to support that reform. I'd remind you that this reform won more than a dozen Republican votes in the Senate in June. <p>I'm not running for office again. I just believe this is the right thing to do. [<i>Applause</i>] I just believe this is the right thing to do. And I also believe that good policy is good politics in this instance. And if folks are really that consumed with the politics of fixing our broken immigration system, they should look&mdash;take a closer look at the polls, because the American people support this. It's not something they reject; they support it. Everybody wins here if we work together to get this done. In fact, if there's a good reason not to pass this commonsense reform, I haven't heard it. <p>So anyone still standing in the way of this bipartisan reform should at least have to explain why. A clear majority of the American people think it's the right thing to do. <p>Now, how do we move forward? Democrats&mdash;Democratic leaders have introduced a bill in the House that is similar to the bipartisan Senate bill. So now it's up to Republicans in the House to decide whether reform becomes a reality or not. <p>I do know&mdash;and this is good news&mdash;that many of them agree that we need to fix our broken immigration system across these areas that we've just discussed. And what I've said to them, and I'll repeat today, is if House Republicans have new and different, additional ideas for how we should move forward, then we want to hear them. I'll be listening. I know that Democrats and Republicans in the Senate, those who voted for immigration reform already, are eager to hear those additional ideas. But what we can't do is just sweep the problem under the rug one more time, leave it for somebody else to solve sometime in the future. <p>Rather than create problems, let's prove to the American people that Washington can actually solve some problems. This reform comes as close to anything we've got to a law that will benefit everybody now and far into the future. So let's see if we can get this done. And let's see if we can get it done this year. <p>Now, the&mdash;we've got the time to do it. Republicans in the House, including the Speaker, have said we should act. So let's not wait. It doesn't get easier to just put it off. Let's do it now. Let's not delay. Let's get this done, and let's do it in a bipartisan fashion. <p>To those of you who are here today, I want to just say one last thing, and that is, thank you. I want to thank you for your persistence. I want to thank you for your activism. I want to thank you for your passion and your heart when it comes to this issue. And I want to tell you, you've got to keep it up. Keep putting the pressure on all of us to get this done. There are going to be moments&mdash;and there are always moments like this in big efforts at reform&mdash;where you meet resistance and the press will declare something dead, it's not going to happen, but that can be overcome. <p>And I have to say, Joe, as I look out at this room, these don't look like people who are easily deterred. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Vice President Joe Biden</i>. No, I don't think so. <p><i>The President.</i> They don't look like folks who are going to give up. You look fired up to make the next push. And whether you're a Republican or a Democrat or an Independent, I want you to keep working&mdash;and I'm going to be right next to you&mdash;to make sure we get immigration reform done. It is time. Let's go get it done. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. All right.\" "
"227" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Brooklyn! How you doing? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Good! <p><i>The President.</i> Well, it is good to be back in Brooklyn. Good to be in New York City. And it is good to see some friends who stick up for students and teachers and education every day. We've got your Governor; Andrew Cuomo is in the house. Give him a big round of applause. We've got your Senator, Chuck Schumer. Outstanding Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan. We've got a&mdash;your outstanding congressional delegation is here. Give them a big round of applause. We've got your Public Advocate and my friend, Bill de Blasio is here. We've got the outstanding leader of one of America's iconic companies, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty. And I want to give a special shout-out to a man who's been an extraordinary mayor for this city; he's been a leader throughout the country for the past 12 years. Mr. Michael Bloomberg is here. <p>And I want to thank your principal here at P-TECH, Rashid Davis, who, I am pretty confident, is the coolest looking principal in America. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, there just are not that many principals with dreadlocks and yellow kicks. There aren't that many of them. I mean, there may be some, but there aren't that many. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And I had a wonderful time visiting with one of your teachers, Ms. Seiluffah&mdash;Seifullah, Seifullah? Ms. Seifullah. She was outstanding. She welcomed me into her classroom. She showed me around. I want to thank all of you for letting me spend some time here. In return, you got out of class a little early on Friday, which I know always gets a little applause, although, in this school maybe not, because you guys are enjoying learning so much. [<i>Applause</i>] That's worth applauding, that you're enjoying learning so much. <p>Now, part of the reason I'm glad to be here is because I used to live in Brooklyn, and I actually landed Marine One in Prospect Park; I used to live across the street from Prospect Park and&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. But mainly, I'm here because I wanted to talk&mdash;I wanted to come here ever since I talked about you in my State of the Union Address this year because what's going on here at P-TECH is outstanding, and I'm excited to see it for myself. <p>I know Brooklyn in general is blowing up right now. It&mdash;when I was living here, Brooklyn was cool, but not this cool. [<i>Laughter</i>] Barclays Center hadn't been built yet. I know the Nets just picked up Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett offseason, which is a lesson to all the young people: Old people can still play. [<i>Laughter</i>] We've still got some gas in the tank. <p>But this whole borough is where generations of hopeful, striving immigrants came in search of opportunity: a chance to build better lives for themselves and for their kids. And that's been true for decades. And I'm here today to talk about what we need to do as a country to build the same kind of opportunity for your generation, for the next generation, and for your kids and for future immigrants. <p>This country should be doing everything in our power to give more kids the chance to go to schools just like this one. We should be doing everything we can to put college within the reach of more young people. We should be doing everything we can to keep your streets safe and protect you from gun violence. We should be doing everything we can to keep families from falling into poverty and build more ladders of opportunity to help people who are willing to work hard climb out of poverty. We should be doing everything we can to welcome new generations of hopeful, striving immigrants. <p>I want to&mdash;I want us to do everything we can to give every single young person the same kind of opportunity that this country gave me and gave Chuck and gave Governor Cuomo and gave Mayor Bloomberg and gave your principal. That's what I'm focused on. <p>Yes, by the way, if you have chairs, go ahead and sit down. [<i>Laughter</i>] If you don't have chairs, then don't sit down because you'll fall. [<i>Laughter</i>] I didn't realize everybody had chairs there. I would have told you to sit down earlier. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So that's what we can achieve together. It's possible. We know we can do it. P-TECH is proof of what can be accomplished, but we've got to have the courage to do it. The American people work hard, and they try to do right, day in and day out. And that resilience and that toughness helped to turn our economy around after one of the hardest periods that we've ever faced as a country. But what we also need is some political courage in Washington. We don't always see that. <p>Right now we need to all pull together. We need to work together to grow the economy, not shrink it; to create good jobs, not eliminate jobs. We've got to finish building a new foundation for shared and lasting prosperity so that everybody who works hard, everybody who studies hard at a school like this one or schools all across the country have a chance to get ahead. That's what we need to do. That's what I'm focused on. <p>And that all begins with the education that we give young people. Because all of you are growing up in changing times, especially for the economy. The world you're growing up in is different than the one that previous generations here in Brooklyn knew and here&mdash;and all across the country knew. <p>In the old days, a young person, they might have just followed their parents' footsteps and gotten a job in their parents' line of work, keep that job for 30, 40 years. If you were willing to work hard, you didn't necessarily need a great education. If you'd just gone to high school, you might get a job at a factory or in the garment district. Or you might be able to just get a job that allowed you to earn your wages, keep pace with people who had a chance to go to college. But those days are over, and those days are not coming back. <p>We live in a 21st-century global economy. And in a global economy, jobs can go anywhere. Companies, they're looking for the best educated people, wherever they live, and they'll reward them with good jobs and good pay. And if you don't have a well-educated workforce, you're going to be left behind. If you don't have a good education, then it is going to be hard for you to find a job that pays a living wage. <p>And by the way, other countries know this. In previous generations, America's standing economically was so much higher than everybody else's that we didn't have a lot of competition. Now you've got billions of people from Beijing to Bangalore to Moscow, all of whom are competing with you directly. And they're&mdash;those countries are working every day to outeducate and outcompete us. <p>And every year brings more research showing them pulling ahead, especially in some of the subject matter that this school specializes in: math and science and technology. So we've got a choice to make. We can just kind of shrug our shoulders and settle for something less, or we can do what America has always done, which is adapt. We pull together, we up our game, we hustle, we fight back, we work hard, and we win. <p>We have to educate our young people&mdash;every single person here, but also all the young people all across Brooklyn, all across New York City, all across New York State, and all across this country&mdash;so that you're ready for this global economy. And schools like P-TECH will help us do that. <p>Here at P-TECH, you've got folks from IBM, City Tech, City University of New York, City Department of Education; everybody is pulling together to make sure a high school education puts young people on a path to a good job. So you guys have opportunities here that you don't find in most high schools yet. You can take college-level courses in math and science. You can work with mentors from IBM so you're learning specific skills that you know leads to a good job. And most important, you'll graduate with a high school diploma and an associate's degree in computer systems or electromechanical engineering. And that means you'll be in demand. Companies will want to hire you. IBM has even said that P-TECH graduates will be first in line when you apply for jobs once you graduate. <p>And at a moment when the cost of higher education's&mdash;keeps going up&mdash;and Arne and I are working hard to make sure that we're doing everything we can to reduce the burden of student loans on young people&mdash;here's how much 2 years of college will cost P-TECH students and their families: Zero. Nothing. [<i>Applause</i>] Nothing. I noticed some of the parents were the first to clap. They're all, like, \\"Yes.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] They like that. <p>But that's a huge burden. I mean, that's thousands of dollars that you're saving, and that means when you start working, you're going to have that much less of a burden in terms of debt, which means you can afford to buy a house sooner, you can afford to start your business sooner. Radcliffe was saying how he's thinking about starting his own business. And that kind of attitude is a lot easier when you're not burdened with a lot of student loans. <p>So this is a ticket into the middle class, and it's available to everybody who's willing to work for it. And that's the way it should be. That's what public education is supposed to do. And the great thing is that what started small is now growing. So Governor Cuomo, he's opening up P-TECH model schools in districts throughout the State&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;throughout the State. So all those schools together, they're going to prepare more than 6,000 high school students for good, high-skilled jobs. <p>Back in my hometown of Chicago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel is opening up schools like this one. He's opening up a school, for example, called Sarah E. Goode STEM Academy. And&mdash;you got a little Chicago person here. [<i>Applause</i>] Yes, there you go. [<i>Laughter</i>] Across the country, companies like Verizon and Microsoft and ConEd and Cisco, they saw what IBM was doing, and they said, well, this is a good idea, we can do this too. So they're working with educators and States to replicate what you're already doing here. And you guys should feel good about that. You're starting something all across the country. <p>So as a country, we should all want what all of you are receiving right now, the same chance for a great education. Here's what I think we should do as a country to make sure they've got the same opportunities you do. First of all, we've got to give every child an earlier start at success by making high-quality preschool available to every 4-year-old in America. <p>We should give every student access to the world's information. When I went into the classroom today, young people were working off computers, and the problem is, a lot of places, even if they've got computers, they're not hooked up to wireless. So what we're doing is having the Federal agencies moving forward on a plan to connect 99 percent of America's students to high-speed Internet within 5 years. We were already moving on that front. <p>We need to bring down the cost of college and give more young people the chance to go to college. So a couple of months ago, I put forward an ambitious new plan to do that, to reduce the cost of college. <p>We need to redesign more of our high schools so that they teach young people the skills required for a high-tech economy. So I've been meeting with business leaders and innovative educators to spread the best ideas. <p>And I also want to congratulate Governor Cuomo and all of you in New York for having the courage to raise your standards for teaching and learning to make sure that more students graduate from high school ready for college and a career. It's not easy, but it's the right thing to do. It's going to prepare more young people for today's economy. We should stay at it. <p>And here's one more thing we should do, and that is just remember, none of this works unless we've got outstanding teachers, which means we've got to make sure that we're funding education so that teachers have the support that they need so that they can support their own families so that they're not having to dig into their pockets for school supplies. And we've got to show them the respect and provide pathways of excellence for teachers so that they're treated like the professionals that they are. It is a hard job, and we've got to make sure we're investing in them. <p>Now, some of these ideas I've laid out before; some of them I'm just going ahead and doing on my own. Some of them do require Congress to do something. [<i>Laughter</i>] And one way we can start is by Congress passing a budget that reflects our need to invest in our young people. I know that budgets aren't the most interesting topic for a Friday afternoon, even at a school where young people like math. And by the way, I just sat in on a lesson called real-world math, which got me thinking whether it's too late to send Congress here&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;for a remedial course. <p>But a budget is important, because what a budget does is, it sets our priorities. It tells us what we think is important, what our priorities are. And the stakes for our middle class could not be higher. If we don't set the right priorities now, then many of you will be put at a competitive disadvantage compared to other countries. If you think education is expensive, wait until you see how much ignorance costs. So we've got to invest. <p>So we need a budget that is responsible, that is fiscally prudent, but a budget that cuts what we don't need, closes wasteful tax loopholes that don't create jobs, freeing up resources to invest in the things that actually do help us grow: things like education and scientific research, and infrastructure, roads, bridges, airports. This should not be an ideological exercise. We should use some common sense. <p>What's going to help us grow, what's going to create jobs, what is going to expand our middle class, what's going to give more opportunity to young people&mdash;those are the things we should be putting money into. That's what we need to do. <p>And we've got enough resources to do it if we stop spending on things that don't work and don't make sense, or if we make sure that people aren't wiggling out of their taxes through these corporate loopholes that only a few people at the very top can take advantage of. If we just do everything in a fair, commonsense way, we've got the resources to be fiscally responsible and invest in our future. <p>And this obsession with cutting just for the sake of cutting hasn't helped our economy grow, it's held it back. It won't help us build a better society for your generation. And by the way, it's important to remember&mdash;for those who are following the news&mdash;our deficits are getting smaller. They've been cut in half since I took office. All right? So that gives us room to fix longer term debt problems without sticking it to your generation. We don't have to choose between growth and fiscal responsibility; we've got to do both. And the question can't just be how much more we can cut, it's got to be how many more schools like P-TECH we can create. That should be our priority. <p>And after the manufactured crisis that Congress&mdash;actually, a small group in the House of Representatives just put us through, shutting down the Government and threatening to potentially default on our debt&mdash;I don't want to hear the same old stuff about how America can't afford to invest in the things that have always made us strong. Don't tell me we can afford to shut down the Government, which cost our economy billions of dollars, but we can't afford to invest in our education systems. Because there's nothing more important than this. <p>In fact, what I'd like to do is have every Member of Congress&mdash;maybe Chuck can arrange, and the congressional delegation can arrange, some tours for some of their colleagues. Come here. Come to Brooklyn. Meet some of these young people. They ought to meet some of the young people here. <p>Meet somebody like Leslieanne John, young woman who sang the national anthem this afternoon. Leslieanne is in the 11th grade, she's already taken eight college classes, which is about as many as I took when I was in college. [<i>Laughter</i>] She knows she has a great opportunity here; she's working hard to make the most of it. Eventually, she plans to become a lawyer. <p>And Leslieanne is clear eyed about the challenges that the students here face. She put it in a way that a lot of people can relate to; she said, \\"We see a whole bunch of craziness going on in the streets of Crown Heights sometimes.\\" That's what she said. But she also said that being here at P-TECH taught her something important: \\"There's more for us than just the streets.\\" And she said that \\"At the end of the day, we've got to make something of ourselves.\\" And that's important, that's important. <p>It's not just what the government or adults can do for you, it's also what you can do for yourselves. And that sense of responsibility, that sense that you set the bar high for yourself, that's what America is all about. That's been the history of New York: people working hard, but also working together to make sure that everybody has got a fair shot; to make sure you don't have to be born wealthy, you don't have to be born famous; that if you've got some drive and some energy, then you can go to a school that teaches you what you need to know. You can go to college even if you don't have a lot of money. You can start your own business even if you didn't inherit a business. <p>Making something of ourselves, that's what we do in this country. That's a message worth sending to Washington. No more games, no more gridlock, no more gutting the things that help America grow and give people the tools to make something of themselves. That's what this is about. That's what P-TECH represents; that's what Brooklyn represents. <p>And as long as I have the privilege to be your President, I'm going to keep fighting to make sure that no matter who you are, where you come from, what you look like, this country will always be a place where you can make it if you try. <p>So thank you, Brooklyn. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"228" "\"Hi, everybody. A few weeks ago, we launched an important new part of the Affordable Care Act. It's called the Marketplace. And for Americans without health insurance and Americans who buy insurance on their own because they can't get it at work, it's a very big deal. <p>If you're one of those people, the Affordable Care Act makes you part of a big group plan for the first time. The Marketplace is where you can apply and shop for affordable new health insurance choices. It gathers insurers under one system to compete for your business. And that choice and competition have actually helped bring prices down. <p>Ultimately, the easiest way to buy insurance in this marketplace will be a new web site, healthcare.gov. But as you may have heard, the site isn't working the way it's supposed to yet. It's frustrating for all of us who have worked so hard to make sure everyone who needs it gets health care. And it's especially frustrating for the Americans who have been trying to get covered. The site has been visited more than 20 million times so far. Nearly 700,000 people have applied for coverage already. And that proves just how much demand there is for these new, quality, affordable health care choices. And that's why, in the coming weeks, we are going to get it working as smoothly as it's supposed to. We've got people working overtime, 24/7, to boost capacity and address these problems, every single day. <p>But even as we improve the web site, remember that the web site isn't the only way to apply for coverage under these new plans. We've updated healthcare.gov to offer more information about enrolling over the phone, by mail, or in person with a specially trained navigator who can help answer your questions. Just call 1-800-318-2596 or visit localhelp.healthcare.gov. And don't worry: These plans will not sell out. We're only a few weeks into a 6-month open enrollment period, and everyone who wants insurance through the Marketplace will get it. <p>Now, some people have poked fun at me this week for sounding like an insurance salesman. And that's okay. I'd still be out there championing this law even if the web site were perfect. I'll never stop fighting to help more hard-working Americans know the economic security of health care. That's something we should all want. <p>That's why it's also interesting to see Republicans in Congress expressing so much concern that people are having trouble buying health insurance through the new web site, especially considering they've spent the last few years so obsessed with denying those same people access to health insurance that they just shut down the Government and threatened default over it. <p>As I've said many times before, I'm willing to work with anyone, on any idea, who's actually willing to make this law perform better. But it's well past the time for folks to stop rooting for its failure, because hard-working, middle class families are rooting for its success. <p>The Affordable Care Act gives people who have been stuck with sky-high premiums because of preexisting conditions the chance to get affordable insurance for the first time. This law means that women can finally buy coverage that doesn't charge them higher premiums than men for the same care. <p>And everyone who already has health insurance&mdash;whether through your employer, Medicare, or Medicaid&mdash;will keep the benefits and protections this law already has put in place. Three million more young adults have health insurance on their parents' plans because of the Affordable Care Act. More than 6 million people on Medicare have saved an average of a thousand dollars on their prescription medicine because of the Affordable Care Act. <p>Last year, more than 8 million Americans received half a billion dollars in refunds from their insurers because of the Affordable Care Act. And for tens of millions of women, preventive care like mammograms and birth control are free because of the Affordable Care Act. That's all part of this law, and it's here to stay. <p>We did not fight so hard for this reform for so many years just to build a web site. We did it to free millions of American families from the awful fear that one illness or injury&mdash;to yourself or your child&mdash;might cost you everything you'd worked so hard to build. We did it to cement the principle that in this country, the security of health care is not a privilege for a fortunate few, but a right for every one of us to enjoy. We've already delivered on part of that promise, and we will not rest until the work is done. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"229" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. Thank you, FBI. Thank you so much. Please, everybody, be seated, those of you who have seats. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Well, good afternoon, everybody. I am so proud to be here and to stand once again with so many dedicated men and women of the FBI. You are the best of the best. Day in and day out, you work tirelessly to confront the most dangerous threats our Nation faces. You serve with courage; you serve with integrity. You protect Americans at home and abroad. You lock up criminals. You secure the homeland against the threat of terrorism. Without a lot of fanfare, without seeking the spotlight, you do your jobs, all the while upholding our most cherished values and the rule of law. <p>Fidelity, Bravery, Integrity: That's your motto. And today we're here to welcome a remarkable new leader for this remarkable institution, one who lives those principles out every single day: Mr. Jim Comey. <p>Before I get to Jim, I want to thank all the predecessors who are here today. We are grateful for your service. I have to give a special shout-out to Bob Mueller, who served longer than he was supposed to, but he was such an extraordinary leader through some of the most difficult times that we've had in national security. And he&mdash;I consider him a friend, and I'm so grateful for him and Ann being here today. Thank you very much. <p>Now, Jim has dedicated his life to defending our laws, to making sure that all Americans can trust our justice system to protect their rights and their well-being. He's the grandson of a beat cop. He's the prosecutor who helped bring down the Gambinos. He's the relentless attorney who fought to stem the bloody tide of gun violence, rub out white-collar crime, deliver justice to terrorists. It's just about impossible to find a matter of justice he has not tackled, and it's hard to imagine somebody who is not more uniquely qualified to lead a bureau that covers all of it: traditional threats like violent and organized crime to the constantly changing threats like terrorism and cybersecurity. So he's got the r&eacute;sum&eacute;. <p>But of course, Jim is also a famously cool character; he's the calmest in the room during a crisis. Here's what a fellow former prosecutor said about him. He said, \\"You know that Rudyard Kipling line&mdash;'If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs'&mdash;that's Jim.\\" <p>There's also a story from the time during his prosecution of the Gambino crime family. One of the defendants was an alleged hit man named Lorenzo. And during the trial, Jim won an award from the New York City Bar Association. When the court convened the next morning, everybody was buzzing about it, and suddenly, a note was passed down from the defendant's table across the aisle to the prosecutor's table. It was handed to Jim, and it read: \\"Dear Jim, congratulations on your award. No one deserves it more than you. You're a true professional. Sincerely, Lorenzo.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>\\"Sincerely, Lorenzo.\\" Now, we don't know how sincere he was. [<i>Laughter</i>] We don't know whether this was a veiled threat or a plea for leniency or an honest compliment. But I think it is fair to say that Jim has won the respect of folks across the spectrum, including Lorenzo. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>He's the perfect leader for an organization whose walls are graced by the words of a legendary former Director: \\"The most effective weapon against crime is cooperation.\\" Jim has worked with many of the more than 35,000 men and women of the FBI over the course of his long and distinguished career. And it's his admiration and respect for all of you, individually, his recognition of the hard work that you do every day, sometimes under extraordinarily difficult circumstances&mdash;not just the folks out in the field, but also folks working the back rooms, doing the hard work, out of sight&mdash;his recognition that your mission is important is what compelled him to answer the call to serve his country again. <p>The FBI joins forces with our intelligence, our military, and homeland security professionals to break up all manner of threats, from taking down drug rings to stopping those who prey on children, to breaking up Al Qaida cells, to disrupting their activities, thwarting their plots. And your mission keeps expanding because the nature of the threats are always changing. <p>Unfortunately, the resources allotted to that mission has been reduced by sequestration. I'll keep fighting for those resources because our country asks and expects a lot from you, and we should make sure you've got the resources you need to do the job. Especially when many of your colleagues put their lives on the line on a daily basis, all to serve and protect our fellow citizens, the least we can do is make sure you've got the resources for it and that your operations are not disrupted because of politics in this town. <p>Now, the good news is, things like courage, leadership, judgment, and compassion, those resources are&mdash;potentially, at least&mdash;inexhaustible. That's why it's critical that we seek out the best people to serve: folks who have earned the public trust, who have excellent judgment, even in the most difficult circumstances; those who possess not just a keen knowledge of the law, but also a moral compass that they&mdash;and we&mdash;can always count on. <p>And that's who we've got in Jim Comey. I'll tell you, I interviewed a number of extraordinary candidates for this job, all with sterling credentials. But what gave me confidence that this was the right man for the job wasn't his degrees and it wasn't his r&eacute;sum&eacute;, it was in talking to him and seeing his amazing family, a sense that this is somebody who knows what's right and what's wrong and is willing to act on that basis every single day. And that's why I'm so grateful that he's signed up to serve again. <p>I will spare you yet another joke about how today no one stands taller. [<i>Laughter</i>] I simply want to thank Jim for accepting this role. I want to thank Patrice and the five remarkable children that they've got, because jobs like this are a team effort, as you well know. <p>And I want to thank most all the men and women of the FBI. I'm proud of your work. I'm grateful for your service. I'm absolutely confident that this agency will continue to flourish with Jim at the helm. And if it&mdash;if he gets lost in the building, I want you guys to help him out. [<i>Laughter</i>] Because I guarantee you that he's going to have your back, make sure you've got his back as well. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. <p>[<i>At this point, FBI Deputy Director Sean M. Joyce introduced Director Comey, who made brief remarks.</i>]\" "
"230" "\"To Heather and the Foley family; to Tom's colleagues and friends; President Clinton; Vice President Mondale; former Speakers; and those who preceded me: I am honored to join you today to remember a man who embodied the virtues of devotion and respect for the institution that he led, for the colleagues that he served alongside, and most importantly, for the citizens that he had the honor to represent. <p>Unlike so many of you, I did not have the privilege of knowing Tom personally; I admired him from afar. But like millions of Americans, I benefit from his legacy. Thanks to Tom, more children get a Head Start on success in school and in life. More seniors receive better health care. More families breathe easier because they know their country will be there for them in times of need. And all of them&mdash;all of us&mdash;are indebted to that towering man from Spokane. <p>I think, in listening to the wonderful memories that have been shared, we get a sense of this man, and we recognize his humility. He often attributed much of his success to good luck, and he may have had a point. Leader McConnell told the story about his first race; there were a couple of details that got left out. On the way to Olympia to file the paperwork for his first congressional campaign, apparently, Tom blew out a tire. [<i>Laughter</i>] So he and some friends hitchhiked to a service station to get it fixed. And then, as they approached the outskirts of the city, they ran out of gas. So they pushed the car up the hill, coasting into town just before the deadline. And Tom went on to win that race by a resounding 54 votes. <p>So there's no question that there may have been some luck of the Irish operating when it came to Tom Foley, as well as incredible stamina. But what led him to make history as the first Speaker of the House from west of the Rockies was not luck. It was his hard work and his deep integrity and his powerful intellect, and as Bob Michel so eloquently and movingly stated, his ability to find common ground with his colleagues across the aisle. And it was his personal decency that helped him bring civility and order to a Congress that demanded both and still does. <p>Which brings me to a final point: At a time when our political system can seem more polarized and more divided than ever before, it can be tempting to see the possibility of bipartisan progress as a thing of the past, \\"old school,\\" as Bob said. It can be tempting to wonder if we still have room for leaders like Tom, whether the environment, the media, the way that districts are drawn, and the pressures that those of us in elected office are under somehow preclude the possibility of that brand of leadership. Well, I believe we have to find our way back there. <p>Now more than ever, America needs public servants who are willing to place problem-solving ahead of politics, as the letter that President Clinton held up indicates, as the history of the crime bill shows. We are sent here to do what's right, and sometimes, doing what's right is hard. And it's not free. And yet that's the measure of leadership. <p>It's important for us who feel a responsibility to fight for a cause to recognize that our cause is not advanced if we can't also try to achieve compromise, the same way our Founders saw it: as a vital part of our democracy, the very thing that makes our system of self-government possible. That's what Tom Foley believed. That's what he embodied. That's the legacy that shines brightly today. <p>Now, on the last day that he presided as Speaker, Tom described what it should feel like to serve the American people in this city. He spoke about coming to work in the morning and catching a glimpse of the Capitol. And he said that it ought to give anyone a thrill, a sense not only of personal satisfaction, \\"but very deep gratitude to our constituents for the honor of letting us represent them.\\" And Tom never lost that sense of wonder. <p>It's interesting&mdash;as I read that passage, what he wrote&mdash;the first time I visited Capitol Hill, Tom Foley was Speaker. I was a very young man and I was doing community work, and I remember seeing that Capitol and having that same sense of wonder. And I think now about Tom Foley being here doing that work and inspiring what might have ultimately led me to be interested in public service as well. <p>When we're standing outside these magnificent buildings, we have that sense of wonder and that sense of hope. And sometimes, the longer you're here, the harder it is to hang on to that. And yet Tom Foley never lost it&mdash;never lost that sense of wonder, never lost the sense of gratitude. What a privilege, he felt it was, to serve. And he never forgot why he came here: on behalf of this Nation and his State and the citizens that he loved and respected so much. <p>And so, as a country, we have to be grateful to him. And to Heather and to the people of the great State of Washington, thank you so much for sharing Tom with us. <p>God bless Tom Foley. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"231" "\"[<i>At this point, Gov. Deval L. Patrick of Massachusetts made brief opening remarks, which concluded as follows.</i>] <p><i>Governor Patrick</i>. So, Mr. President, welcome to the capital of Red Sox Nation. And welcome also to the future of affordable, accessible health care for everybody. <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. <p><i>The President.</i> Hello, Boston! It's good to be back in Boston. It's good to be back in Boston, because one of America's best Governors introduced me, Deval Patrick. Give him a big round of applause. It's good to see Congressman Bill Keating here. Give Bill a big round of applause. I want to praise somebody who's not here&mdash;I just left him&mdash;but he wears his heart on his sleeve. He loves this city so much, and it shows in what he's been doing for years now: one of America's best mayors, Tom Menino. [<i>Applause</i>] Couldn't be prouder of him. <p>And it's good to see all of you. I was just at the airport&mdash;Deval was kind enough to meet me, along with Mayor Menino. And Mayor Menino went back to City Hall to work so he could wrap up in time for the first pitch. I understand that. [<i>Laughter</i>] I am well aware that a Presidential visit is not the biggest thing going on today in Boston. [<i>Laughter</i>] I understand that. I tried to grow a beard, but Michelle, she wasn't having it. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I am also old enough to remember a time when the Red Sox were not in the World Series three times in 10 years. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I know the chance to win one at home for the first time since 1918 is a pretty special thing. So I promise we will be done here in time&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;for everybody to head over to Fenway and maybe see Big Papi blast another homer. <p>And maybe the other Sox will do better next year. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm just&mdash;you know, you can hope. You can dream. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>The reason I'm here, though, is because this is the hall where, 7 years ago, Democrats and Republicans came together to make health reform a reality for the people of Massachusetts. It's where then-Governor Mitt Romney, Democratic legislators, Senator Ted Kennedy, many of the folks who are here today joined forces to connect the progressive vision of health care for all with some ideas about markets and competition that had long been championed by conservatives. <p>And as Deval just said, it worked. It worked. Health care&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience members.</i> Mr. President, reject Keystone XL. Stop climate change. For our generation, stop the pipeline! Mr. President&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The President.</i> Okay. We're talking about health care today, but we will&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience members.</i> &mdash;&mdash;reject Keystone XL. Stop climate change. Stop climate change. For our generation&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> No, no, no, that's okay. The&mdash;that is the wrong rally. [<i>Laughter</i>] We've got&mdash;we had the climate change rally back in the summer. [<i>Laughter</i>] This is the health care rally. [<i>Applause</i>] Now&mdash;&mdash; <p>So health care reform in this State was a success. That doesn't mean it was perfect right away. There were early problems to solve. There were changes that had to be made. Anybody here who was involved in it can tell you that. As Deval just said, enrollment was extremely slow. Within a month, only about a hundred people had signed up&mdash;a hundred. But then 2,000 had signed up and then a few more thousand after that. And by the end of the year, 36,000 people had signed up. <p>And the community all came together. You even had the Red Sox help enlist people to get them covered. And pretty soon, the number of young uninsured people had plummeted. When recession struck, the financial security of health care sheltered families from deeper hardship. And today, there is nearly universal coverage in Massachusetts, and the vast majority of its citizens are happy with their coverage. <p>And by the way, all the parade of horribles, the worst predictions about health care reform in Massachusetts never came true. They're the same arguments that you're hearing now. Businesses didn't stop covering workers, the share of employers who offered insurance increased. People didn't get left behind, racial disparities decreased. Care didn't become unaffordable, costs tracked what was happening in other places that wasn't covering everybody. <p>Now, Mitt Romney and I ran a long and spirited campaign against one another, but I've always believed that when he was Governor here in Massachusetts, he did the right thing on health care. And then Deval did the right thing by picking up the torch and working to make the law work even better. And it's because you guys had a proven model that we built the Affordable Care Act on this template of proven, bipartisan success. Your law was the model for the Nation's law. <p>So let's look at what's happened. Today, the Affordable Care Act requires insurance companies to abide by some of the strongest consumer protections this country has ever known: a true patient's bill of rights. No more discriminating against kids with preexisting conditions. No more dropping your policy when you get sick and need it most. No more lifetime limits or restrictive annual limits. Most plans now have to cover free preventive care like mammograms and birth control. Young people can stay on their parents' plans until they turn 26. All of this is in place right now. It is working right now. <p>Now, the last element of this began on October 1. It's when the Affordable Care Act created a new marketplace for quality, private insurance plans for the 15 percent or so of Americans who don't have health care and for the 5 percent of Americans who have to buy it on their own and they're not part of a group, which means they don't get as good a deal. <p>And this new marketplace was built on the Massachusetts model. It allows these Americans who have been locked out to get a better deal from insurers; they're pooling their purchasing power as one big group. And insurers want their business, which means they give them a better deal, and they compete for that business. And as a result, insurers in the marketplace, they can't use your medical history to charge you more. If you've been sick, you finally have the same chance to buy quality, affordable health care as everybody else. <p>A lot of people will qualify for new tax credits under this law that will bring down costs even further, so that if you lose your job or you start a new business or you're self-employed or you're a young person trying several jobs until you find that one that sticks, you're going to be able to be insured: insurance that goes with you and gives you freedom to pursue whatever you want, without fear that accident or illness will derail your dreams. <p>Now, this marketplace is open now. Insurance companies are competing for that business. The deal is good; the prices are low. But let's face it, we've had a problem. The web site hasn't worked the way it's supposed to over these last couple of weeks. And as a consequence, a lot of people haven't had a chance to see just how good the prices for quality health insurance through these marketplaces really are. <p>Now, ultimately, this web site, healthcare.gov, will be the easiest way to shop for and buy these new plans, because you can see all these plans right next to each other and compare prices and see what kind of coverage it provides. But look, it's&mdash;there's no denying it, right now, the website is too slow, too many people have gotten stuck. And I am not happy about it. And neither are a lot of Americans who need health care, and they're trying to figure out how they can sign up as quickly as possible. So there's no excuse for it. And I take full responsibility for making sure it gets fixed ASAP. We are working overtime to improve it every day. Every day. <p>And more people are successfully buying these new plans online than they were a couple of weeks ago, and I expect more people will be able to buy conveniently online every single day as we move forward. We're going to get these problems resolved. <p>Now, in the meantime, you can still apply for coverage over the phone or by mail or in person, because those plans are waiting and you're still able to get the kind of affordable, reliable health insurance that's been out of reach for too many people for too long. <p>So I am old enough to remember when there was not such a thing as a web site. [<i>Laughter</i>] I know that's shocking to people. [<i>Laughter</i>] But the point is, I'm confident these marketplaces will work, because Massachusetts has shown that the model works, and we know what's being offered by these insurers. [<i>Applause</i>] We know it's going to work. <p>And so far, choice and competition in the new national marketplaces have helped keep costs lower than even we projected. In fact, nearly half of all single, uninsured 18-to-34-year-olds may be able to buy insurance for 50 bucks a month or less. Less than your cell phone bill, less than your cable bill. And one study shows that nearly 6 in 10 uninsured Americans may find coverage for a hundred bucks a month or less, even if they're older than 34. <p>And frankly, if every Governor was working as hard as Deval&mdash;or Governor O'Malley in Maryland or Governor Cuomo in New York&mdash;to make this law work for their citizens, as opposed to thinking politically, about 8 in 10 Americans would be getting health insurance for less than a hundred bucks a month. <p>And by the way, it's not just in Massachusetts. Look at Kentucky. Governor Steve Beshear, who's a Democrat, is like a man possessed with helping more people get covered. He thinks it's the right thing to do. Keep in mind, I did not win in Kentucky. [<i>Laughter</i>] But there are a lot of uninsured people in Kentucky, and they're signing up. <p>Oregon has covered 10 percent of its uninsured citizens already because of the Affordable Care Act. Ten percent of the uninsured have already gotten coverage. Arkansas&mdash;I didn't win that State either&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;has covered almost 14 percent of its uninsured already. That's already happened. And that&mdash;you've got some Republican Governors, like Governor Kasich of Ohio, who've put politics aside, and they're expanding Medicaid through this law to cover millions of people. <p>Now, unfortunately, there are others that are so locked in to the politics of this thing that they won't lift a finger to help their own people, and that's leaving millions of Americans uninsured unnecessarily. That's a shame. Because if they put as much energy into making this law work as they do in attacking the law, Americans would be better off. [<i>Applause</i>] Americans would be better off. <p>So that's the Affordable Care Act: better protections for Americans with insurance; a new marketplace for Americans without insurance; new tax credits to help folks afford it; more choice, more competition; real health care security not just for the uninsured or underinsured, but for all of us, because we pay more in premiums and taxes when Americans without good insurance visit the emergency room. We get taxed. <p>And since we all benefit, there are parts of this law that also require everybody to contribute, that require everybody to take some measure of responsibility. So to help pay for the law, the wealthiest Americans&mdash;families who make more than $250,000 a year&mdash;they've got to pay a little bit more. The most expensive employer health insurance plans no longer qualify for unlimited tax breaks. Some folks aren't happy about that, but it's the right thing to do. <p>Just like in Massachusetts, most people who can afford health insurance have to take responsibility to buy health insurance or pay a penalty. And employers with more than 50 employees are required to either provide health insurance to their workers or pay a penalty, again, because they shouldn't just dump off those costs onto the rest of us. Everybody has got some responsibilities. <p>Now, it is also true that some Americans who have health insurance plans that they bought on their own through the old individual market are getting notices from their insurance companies suggesting that somehow because of the Affordable Care Act, they may be losing their existing health insurance plans. This has been the latest flurry in the news. There&mdash;because there's been a lot of confusion and misinformation about this, I want to explain just what's going on. <p>One of the things health reform was designed to do was to help not only the uninsured, but also the underinsured. And there are a number of Americans&mdash;fewer than 5 percent of Americans&mdash;who've got cut-rate plans that don't offer real financial protection in the event of a serious illness or an accident. Remember, before the Affordable Care Act, these bad-apple insurers had free rein every single year to limit the care that you received or use minor preexisting conditions to jack up your premiums or bill you into bankruptcy. So a lot of people thought they were buying coverage, and it turned out not to be so good. <p>Before the Affordable Care Act, the worst of these plans routinely dropped thousands of Americans every single year. And on average, premiums for folks who stayed in their plans for more than a year shot up about 15 percent a year. This wasn't just bad for those folks who were&mdash;who had these policies, it was bad for all of us, because, again, when tragedy strikes and folks can't pay their medical bills, everybody else picks up the tab. <p>Now, if you had one of these substandard plans before the Affordable Care Act became law and you really liked that plan, you were able to keep it. That's what I said when I was running for office. That was part of the promise we made. But ever since the law was passed, if insurers decided to downgrade or cancel these substandard plans, what we said under the law is, you've got to replace them with quality, comprehensive coverage, because that, too, was a central premise of the Affordable Care Act from the very beginning. <p>And today, that promise means that every plan in the marketplace covers a core set of minimum benefits, like maternity care and preventive care and mental health care and prescription drug benefits and hospitalization. And they can't use allergies or pregnancy or a sports injury or the fact that you're a woman to charge you more. They can't do that anymore. [<i>Applause</i>] They can't do that anymore. <p>If you couldn't afford coverage because your child had asthma, well, he's now covered. If you're one of the 45 million Americans with a mental illness, you're now covered. If you're a young couple expecting a baby, you're covered. You're safer. The system is more secure for you, and it's more secure for everybody. <p>So if you're getting one of these letters, just shop around in the new marketplace. That's what it's for. Because of the tax credits we're offering&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member</i>. Mr. President&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The President</i>. &mdash;&mdash;and the competition&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member</i>. &mdash;&mdash;reject the Keystone Pipeline! For our generation&mdash;[<i>inaudible</i>]&mdash;and the students. <p><i>The President.</i> The&mdash;because of the tax credits that we're offering and the competition between insurers, most people are going to be able to get better, comprehensive health care plans for the same price or even cheaper than projected. You're going to get a better deal. <p>Now, there's a fraction of Americans with higher incomes who will pay more on the front end for better insurance with better benefits and protections like the patient's bill of rights. And that will actually save them from financial ruin if they get sick. But nobody is losing their right to health care coverage. And no insurance company will ever be able to deny you coverage or drop you as a customer altogether. Those days are over. And that's the truth. [<i>Applause</i>] That is the truth. <p>So for people without health insurance, they're finally going to be able to get it. For the vast majority of people who have health insurance that works, you can keep it. For the fewer than 5 percent of Americans who buy insurance on your own, you will be getting a better deal. <p>So anyone peddling the notion that insurers are canceling people's plan without mentioning that almost all the insurers are encouraging people to join better plans with the same carrier and stronger benefits and stronger protections, while others will be able to get better plans with new carriers through the marketplace, and then, many will get new help to pay for these better plans and make them actually cheaper&mdash;if you leave that stuff out, you're being grossly misleading, to say the least. <p>But frankly, look, you saw this in Massachusetts&mdash;this is one of the challenges of health care form&mdash;health care is complicated, and it's very personal, and it's easy to scare folks. And it's no surprise that some of the same folks trying to scare people now are the same folks who've been trying to sink the Affordable Care Act from the beginning. And frankly, I don't understand it. Providing people with health care, that should be a no-brainer. Giving people a chance to get health care should be a no-brainer. <p>And I've said before, if folks had actually good ideas&mdash;better ideas than what's happening in Massachusetts or what we've proposed for providing people with health insurance&mdash;I'd be happy to listen. But that's not what's happening. And anyone defending the remnants of the old, broken system as if it was working for people, anybody who thinks we shouldn't finish the job of making the health care system work for everybody&mdash;especially when these folks offer no plan for the uninsured or the underinsured or folks who lose their insurance each year&mdash;those folks should have to explain themselves. <p>Because I don't think we should go back to discriminating against kids with preexisting conditions. I don't think we should go back to dropping coverage for people when they get sick or because they make a mistake on their application. I don't think we should go back to the daily cruelties and indignancies&mdash;indignities and constant insecurity of a broken health care system. And I'm confident most Americans agree with me. <p>So yes, this is hard, because the health care system is a big system, and it's complicated. And if it was hard doing it just in one State, it's harder to do it in all 50 States, especially when the Governors of a bunch of States and half of the Congress aren't trying to help. Yes, it's hard. But it's worth it. It is the right thing to do, and we're going to keep moving forward. We are going to keep working to improve the law, just like you did here in Massachusetts. <p>We are just going to keep on working at it. We're going to grind it out, just like you did here in Massachusetts, and by the way, just like we did when the prescription drug program for seniors known as Medicare Part D was passed by a Republican President a decade ago. That health care law had some early challenges as well. There were even problems with the web site. [<i>Laughter</i>] And Democrats weren't happy with a lot of the aspects of the law because, in part, it added hundreds of billions of dollars to the deficit; it wasn't paid for, unlike the Affordable Care Act, which will actually help lower the deficit. <p>Now&mdash;but you know what, once it was the law, everybody pitched in to try to make it work. Democrats weren't about to punish millions of seniors just to try to make a point or settle a score. So Democrats worked with Republicans to make it work. And I'm proud of Democrats for having done that. It was the right thing to do. Because now about 90 percent of seniors like what they have. They've gotten a better deal. <p>Both parties working together to get the job done, that's what we need in Washington right now. [<i>Applause</i>] That's what we need in Washington right now. <p>You know, if Republicans in Congress were as eager to help Americans get covered as some Republican Governors have shown themselves to be, we'd make a lot of progress. I'm not asking them to agree with me on everything, but if they'd work with us like Mitt Romney did, working with Democrats in Massachusetts&mdash;or like Ted Kennedy often did with Republicans in Congress, including on the prescription drug bill&mdash;we'd be a lot further along. <p>So the point is, we may have political disagreements; we do, deep ones. In some cases, we've got fundamentally different visions about where we should take the country. But the people who elect us to serve, they shouldn't pay the price for those disagreements. Most Americans don't see things through a political lens or an ideological lens. This debate has never been about right or left. It's been about the helplessness that a parent feels when she can't cover a sick child or the impossible choices a small business faces between covering his employees or keeping his doors open. <p>I want to give you just&mdash;I want to close with an example. So a person named Alan Schaeffer, Prattsburgh, New York, and he's got a story to tell about sacrifice, about giving up his own health care to save the woman he loves. So Alan wrote to me last week, and he told me his story. <p>Four years ago, his wife Jan, who happens to be a nurse, was struck with cancer, and she had to stop working. And then halfway through her chemo, her employer dropped coverage for both of them. And Alan is self-employed; he's got an antique business. So he had to make sure his wife had coverage, obviously, in the middle of cancer treatments, so he went without insurance. <p>Now, the great news is, today, Jan is cancer-free. She's on Medicare, but Alan's been uninsured ever since. Until last week, when he sat down at a computer and&mdash;I'm sure after multiple tries&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;signed up for a new plan under the Affordable Care Act, coverage that can never be taken away if he gets sick. <p>So I just want to read you what he said in this letter. He says, \\"I've got to tell you, I've never been so happy to pay a bill in my entire life.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"When you don't have insurance at my age, [it can] really feel like a time bomb waiting to go off. The sense of relief from knowing I can live out my days longer and healthier, that's just a tremendous weight off my shoulders.\\" <p>So, 2 days later, Alan goes over to his buddy Bill's house. He sits Bill down, and his wife Diana, at their computer. And after several tries&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;Alan helped lift that weight from their shoulders by helping them to sign up for a new plan also. And compared to their current plan, it costs less than half as much and covers more. <p>See, that's why we committed ourselves to this cause: for Alan and Jan; for Bill, Diana. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Annie. <p><i>The President.</i> For Annie. For anyone who wrote letters and shared stories and knocked on doors because they believed, what could happen here in Massachusetts could happen all across the country. And for them and for you, we are going to see this through. [<i>Applause</i>] We're going to see this through. We are going to see this through. <p>This hall is home to some of the earliest debates over the nature of our Government, the appropriate size, the appropriate role of our Government. And those debates continue today, and that's healthy. They're debates about the role of the individual and society and our rugged individualism and our sense of self-reliance, our devotion to the kind of freedoms whose first shot rang out not far from here. But they are also debates tempered by a recognition that we're all in this together; and that when hardship strikes&mdash;and it could strike any of us at any moment&mdash;we're there for one another; and that as a country, we can accomplish great things that we can't accomplish alone. We believe that. [<i>Applause</i>] We believe that. <p>And those sentiments are expressed in a painting right here in this very hall: \\"Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable.\\" That's the value statement Deval was talking about. That's what health care reform is about. That's what America is about. We are in this together, and we are going to see it through. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"232" "\"Thank you. Well, please have a seat. <p>To my great friend Penny Pritzker, thank you for the kind words, but more importantly, thank you for your outstanding leadership, for bringing us all together today, and being such a strong voice for America's workers and America's businesses. <p>I want to acknowledge Acting Deputy Secretary Patrick Gallagher, Under Secretary Francisco Sanchez, and Vinai Thummalapally and their team at SelectUSA. And I want to especially thank all of you, State and local officials from across the country, and business leaders from around the world. <p>As President, I have gone all over the world to go to bat for American exports and American workers. I've been to many of your countries, and I've said that when we do business together, and when we trade and forge new partnerships, it's good for all of us. I want more American products being sold in your countries and I want your companies investing more here in the United States of America because it advances my top priority as President: creating good-paying American jobs and strengthening and broadening our middle class. There's nothing more important right now. <p>And I'm here because I want your companies to know&mdash;I want companies around the world to know&mdash;that I believe there is no better place in the world to do business than the United States of America. Think about it: Globalization and technology means you can go just about anywhere. But there are a whole lot of reasons you ought to come here. <p>We're not just the world's largest market, we're growing. Thanks to the grit and resilience of the American people, we've cleared away the rubble from the financial crisis, and over the past 3&frac12; years, our businesses have created more than 7&frac12; million new jobs. Thanks to tough decisions we've made to tackle our long-term challenges, America is becoming more competitive from a business standpoint. We're reforming a broken health care system, and as a consequence, health care costs are rising at their slowest rate in 50 years. We've cut our deficits by more than half since I took office, and they keep going down. We've pursued an all-of-the-above energy strategy, and we are producing more traditional energy, more renewable energy than ever before, more natural gas than anyone in the world, and we have cut our carbon pollution in the process. <p>So while the case for doing business in America has always been strong, we've made it stronger. And of course, you will find no better workers than American workers. Our productivity is rising. We have the world's best universities, its most innovative entrepreneurs. We have its strongest intellectual property protections to go along with a rule of law that matches up with anyone. And thanks in part to a new initiative focused on exports and the new trade agreements that I've signed, we sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before. <p>So as you've heard repeatedly today and you will hear undoubtedly after I leave this stage, America is open for business. And businesses have responded. After a decade in which many jobs left the United States to go overseas, now we're seeing companies starting to bring jobs back because they're seeing the advantages of being located here. Caterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan. Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico. After locating plants in other countries like China, Intel is opening its most advanced plant right here in the United States. <p>And there are a whole range of factors involved. People are looking at lower energy costs here. They're looking at stability. They're looking at the increased productivity of our workers. All these things are adding up. And people are saying, why would we want to be outside the world's largest market when we can get our products made effectively here and this is a great platform from which we can export all around the world? <p>And it's not just companies based in the United States. Honda is betting on America by expanding production operations in Ohio, in Alabama, and Indiana. And today, more Hondas are made in America than anyplace else in the world. Samsung is betting on America by revamping their plant in Austin, Texas, a $4 billion investment. Siemens is betting on America by hiring hundreds of new workers in North Carolina and putting $50 million a year into training its U.S workforce. <p>And that's the kind of investment we've always welcomed as a nation, but the reason for SelectUSA is we know we can do more. We know we can be better. So, 2 years ago, I acted on a recommendation from the CEOs on my Jobs Council, and we created SelectUSA to encourage more foreign companies to invest and create jobs right here in the United States. And we've shown that this works. <p>As Penny mentioned earlier this morning, with help from SelectUSA, the Austrian company Voestalpine is creating 220 jobs at an auto parts plant in Cartersville, Georgia. The Canadian company Bombardier is investing more than 600 million to expand its Learjet facility in Wichita, Kansas. ASCO, a Belgian company that makes high-tech aircraft parts, reopened a shuttered factory in Stillwater, Oklahoma, and they're expected to create 380 good jobs by the end of 2015. And the list goes on. <p>And I want to see even more of these success stories told across this country, which means I want to make sure we are doing everything we can so that companies like yours want to set up shop here in the United States. And for all the U.S. States and cities who are represented here today, we want to provide you with the tools you need to close those deals and create those jobs. <p>So that's why today I'm proud to announce that I'm expanding and enhancing SelectUSA to create the first-ever fully coordinated U.S. Government effort to recruit businesses to invest and create new jobs in the United States. To do that, I'm taking four new steps to bring more good jobs to our shores. <p>First, building on the great work that our diplomats and Embassies do every day, I'm making attracting foreign investment a formal part of the portfolio for our Ambassadors and their teams around the world. Now, I meet with our dedicated Embassy staffs wherever I go. All of them are great ambassadors for America, and they're building bridges and connections every day. Well, I want them doing even more to help foreign companies cross those bridges and come here. And as they take on this expanded economic mission overseas, we'll make sure that they've got the support that they need here at home. <p>Which brings me to the second point: Officials at the highest levels, up to and including me, are going to do even more to make the case for investing in America. Now, I already do this everywhere I go around the world, in public and private. I joked with a few American companies that I will deserve at least a gold watch at the end of my tenure from them. [<i>Laughter</i>] I've racked up some pretty good sales. But as a country, we don't always make our case in a coordinated way that links our teams overseas to the right senior officials in Washington. And we're going to change that, make our advocacy more efficient, more effective, and more connected so that businesses who are making decisions about where to invest are getting timely answers and know that they're going to have all the help that they need. <p>Number three, we'll make sure that for the first times, companies who want to do business in America have a single point of contact at the Federal level to cut through redtape. So we're going to help you navigate national, State, local rules and regulations so that you can invest faster, open facilities faster, create jobs faster. <p>And finally, we'll help States, cities, regions across America up their game by giving them more tools they need to compete, from the latest research and analysis to events that link them directly with potential investors. This is a big country, and for a lot of foreign investors, it may be sometimes hard to navigate and figure out what exactly is going to fit the needs of your company. Well, we can help you do that, and we can help make sure that State and local governments and regional offices, they're best equipped to make their case, and we can get a good fit that's good for the company and good for those communities. <p>So a new focus at our Embassies on attracting investment, more outreach from Washington, coordinated advocacy to bring more jobs here, new ways to cut through redtape, and new tools for State and local leaders&mdash;that's what an expanded SelectUSA will mean for businesses and for our partners in U.S. States and cities. And ultimately, I believe that will translate into more good middle class jobs for America, my number-one priority. <p>I will be asking Congress to do its part. A lot of this is coordination. It's not necessary to spend a lot of money, it's important for us to do what we do more wisely. But making America even more attractive to investment should be something that everybody can agree on, Democrats and Republicans. And we've got to work together to get that done. <p>At the macro level, that means getting beyond gridlock and some of the manufactured crises that we've seen come out of Washington, because I assume if you ask any CEO here if shutting down the Government makes them more confident about wanting to bring jobs to America, the answer will probably be no. The notion of not paying our bills on time doesn't inspire confidence. So it's time for Congress to focus on what the American people are focused on and what I'm focused on, which is creating good jobs that pay good wages and creating a good environment for investment. <p>We do need to fully fund the SelectUSA program so that more middle class folks have a chance to earn a decent living. We need to make sure that we are resourcing the efforts to make sure that our workers can earn the skills that they need to compete in the global economy. We've got&mdash;one of the crown jewels of our education system is our community college system. Not everybody is going to be training at MIT or Stanford, but these community colleges means that we can partner with businesses, help defray some of the training costs, help design with businesses what exactly they're going to need in terms of people getting hired. And we've got the resources to do it. We know how to do it. But we've got to make sure Congress is supportive of that. <p>We've got to fix a broken immigration system so that we are welcoming more talented workers and entrepreneurs from around the world, and so if companies are coming here to locate and they've got a key individual that they need to bring over to make sure that the company is doing what it needs to do, that it's not a tangle of redtape. And the good news is, we know we've got bipartisan support for immigration reform, we just have to make sure we get it done this year. <p>We've got to continue to make smart investments in research and development, education, infrastructure, all the things that historically have made America the most attractive place on the planet for businesses to invest. We've got to build on that success. That's who we are as a country. And we have a tradition here of tackling new challenges, adapting to new circumstances, seizing new opportunities. And that's one of the reasons that history shows over the last two centuries that when you bet on America, that bet pays off. <p>So to all the business leaders here today and around the world: We want to be your partner in helping to write the next chapter in our history. We want you to join the generations of immigrants and entrepreneurs and foreign investors who have discovered exactly what it means when we say we are the land of opportunity. That is not a myth, it's a proven fact. <p>There are a lot of wonderful countries out there. But this is a place where you can do business, create great products, deliver great services, make money, and do good at the same time. So you should find out why there's no substitute for those proud words: Made in America. And here's three more words: Select the USA. When you do, you'll find some of the world's best workers, some of the world's most innovative entrepreneurs. You'll find a Government, and a President who is committed to helping you create more good jobs for the middle class and helping you succeed well into the 21st century. <p>We are open for business, and we're looking forward to partnering with all of you in the months and years ahead. <p>Thank you very much.\" "
"233" "\"Hi, everybody. On Thursday, I addressed a conference for business leaders from around the world. And my pitch was simple: Choose America. Invest in America. Create jobs in America. It speaks to my top priority as President: growing our economy, creating good jobs, strengthening security and opportunity for the middle class. <p>Over the past 3&frac12; years, our businesses have created over 7&frac12; million new jobs. And this week, the Treasury confirmed that since I took office, we've cut our deficits by more than half. But we have more work to do. We need to grow and create more good jobs faster. That's my driving focus. And I'll go anywhere and do anything to make it happen. <p>That has to be Washington's driving focus as well. But I know that what you often hear out of Washington can sound like Charlie Brown's teacher: a jumble of unfocused noise that's out of touch with the things you care about. So today I want to cut through that noise and talk plainly about what we should do right now to keep growing this economy and creating new jobs. <p>It begins by ending what has done more than anything else to undermine our economy over the past few years, and that's the constant cycle of manufactured crises and self-inflicted wounds. I was glad to hear the Republican leader in the Senate say this week that they won't pursue another Government shutdown or threaten another default on our debt. Because we shouldn't be injuring ourselves every few months, we should be investing in ourselves. <p>And one way to do that is through the budget that Congress started working on this week. Now, budgets can be a boring topic, especially on the weekend. But they can also be revealing because they expose what our priorities are as a country for everybody to see. <p>Think about it. We can keep wasteful corporate tax giveaways that working folks don't get, or we could close those loopholes and use that money to pay for things that actually create jobs. We can keep harmful cuts to education programs or we could give more kids a Head Start, hire more teachers in math and science and help more kids afford a college education. We can keep doling out corporate welfare to big oil companies or we could keep investing in the renewable energy that creates jobs and lowers our carbon pollution. <p>Priorities. Choices. That's what this is about. And the stakes for the middle class couldn't be higher. If we don't pick the right priorities now, make the right choices now, we could hinder growth and opportunity for decades and leave our children with something less. <p>That includes the obsession with cutting just for the sake of cutting. That hasn't helped our economy grow, it's held it back. <p>Remember, our deficits are getting smaller, not bigger. On my watch, they're falling at the fastest pace in 60 years. So that gives us room to fix our long-term debt problems without sticking it to young people or undermining our bedrock retirement and health security programs or ending basic research that helps us grow. <p>Here's the bottom line. Congress should pass a budget that cuts things we don't need and closes wasteful tax loopholes that don't help create jobs so that we can free up resources for the things that actually do create jobs and growth. Building new roads and bridges and schools and airports, that creates jobs. Educating our kids and our workers for a global economy, that helps us grow. Investing in science and technology, research that keeps our businesses and our military on the cutting edge, that's vital for our economic future. <p>So the question isn't between growth and fiscal responsibility. We need both. The question can't be how much more we can cut, it's got to be how many more jobs we can create, how many more kids we can educate, and how much more shared prosperity we can generate. <p>Because in America, our economy doesn't grow from the top down. It grows from the middle class out. And as long as I am President, our national mission will remain building an America where everyone belongs and everyone who works hard has a chance to get ahead. <p>Thanks, everybody, and have a great weekend.\" "
"234" "\"Thank you, everybody! Thank you. Everybody have a seat, have a seat. <p>Jim claims that he always gives short introductions. That is not true. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's why I walked out here with him, to keep him on point. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I can't thank Jim enough for everything that he's done. He and I were just reminiscing a little bit backstage. Somebody had brought for me to sign a New York Times article&mdash;New York Times Magazine&mdash;dated November 2011. And it was some&mdash;it has a picture of me on the cover and some numbers and it says, \\"Is Obama Toast?\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] And so Jim had that blown up, and I'm signing that as well. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>A couple other people I want to thank: Jon Carson, who does extraordinary work every day; we love Jon. We miss him over at the White House, but he is in the right place because he's one of the best organizers I have ever met&mdash;of anything. And he is doing just great, great work with OFA. <p>And then two elected officials&mdash;I see Congressman Eliot Engel here, who is doing a great job on behalf of his district back in New York. And then somebody who is not just a great colleague, but a great friend. When Deval&mdash;Deval and I have sort of hopscotched a little bit, because initially, I met Deval because he came into Chicago to campaign for me when I was still running for the U.S. Senate. And we had a mutual friend who introduced us. And Deval, who had worked at the Justice Department and had some modest celebrity, but also was just good-looking and smart, so people like to hear him talk&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;so he came and did a little fundraiser for me. And so then I won the Senate race. And then I was in the Senate, and one day, he comes by to visit, and he says, \\"I'm thinking about running for Governor.\\" He said, \\"You've won a Senate seat; how hard can this be?\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And so then he ran a historic race for Governor. And then when I decided to run for President, I sought his counsel and advice. And there's nobody who I'm not just more fond of, but who I actually think is a better public servant anywhere in the country, than the Governor of Massachusetts. So Deval Patrick. <p>So because I've got a bunch of friends here, I'm not going to give a big windup. I want to basically spend some time in conversation, as we usually do when we get together. I'll just make a couple of points. <p>Number one, the work that we've done this year has been challenging, to say the least, because of a Congress that has been resistant to everything. And I know that sometimes, that causes great frustration, even when there's not a Government shutdown. But what I want to just remind people of is that this Government is an enormous enterprise, and so even as sometimes we see ourselves getting stymied at the congressional level, at the administrative level, in the work that we're doing, all kinds of changes are happening. Whether it's on climate change or education or speeding up services to veterans or making sure that we are creating the kind of job training programs that are going to put people back to work or making your tax dollars work more effectively to rebuild our infrastructure in this country, we're accomplishing a lot of stuff. <p>It doesn't always get publicity, partly because a lot of times it's not controversial. But slowly, surely, we keep on making progress on the things that you care very deeply about. And I want you guys to understand that and know that. <p>Number two, obviously, we've been very frustrated&mdash;I, personally, have been frustrated&mdash;with the problems around the web site on health care. And it's inexcusable, and there are a whole range of things that we're going to need to do once we get this fixed: to talk about Federal procurement when it comes to IT and how that's organized. But the model of providing health insurance for all Americans and using not just what government can do, but also private sector competition and choice, that model is working. <p>We have in most States massively expanded the choices that people have available, and because of competition and these insurers having to chase after folks' business, premiums are lower, the deals are better, and people ultimately are going to be benefiting greatly across the board. And the web site will get fixed. <p>So there are going to be challenges and bumps along this path&mdash;we always knew there would be&mdash;because we are not only initiating one of the largestchanges in one of the largest sectors of our economy in history, but we're doing so under a very hostile political environment. <p>Nevertheless, the mission is the right one, and the plan is the right one. And we are going to look back a year from now, 3 years from now, 5 years from now, 10 years from now, and the American people are going to understand that in this country, finally, after decades, we are going to make sure that every single person in this country can get affordable health care. And we're going to be driving down health care costs at the same time. That's point number two. <p>Point number three, despite the resistance of Congress, slowly, surely, we're starting to see some common sense starting to prevail. It hasn't quite gotten over the hump, but you're starting to see in the Senate in particular&mdash;we had already gotten the vote on immigration reform, bipartisan vote. It's ready to go. We still need help from the House, but there's still an opportunity. <p>We're seeing it, perhaps tonight, on the ENDA vote, which&mdash;nondiscrimination around sexual orientation&mdash;where we think that we'll probably get this done in the Senate. Again, there is going to be resistance in the House. But the more that we can continue at a grassroots level to speak out on behalf of the values that we care about&mdash;they're mainstream values. They're the values that 60, 70, 80 percent of the country believe in. And they're also the values that young people and future generations believe in. <p>And so I want everybody to understand that change in America has always been slow, and sometimes, you take a step back for every two steps you take forward. But inexorably, the idea of a more tolerant, more prosperous country that offers more opportunity to more people, that's an idea that the vast majority of Americans believe in. <p>And the challenge we've got is that with a Federal Government that has been gridlocked and a filter through which people see and receive information about government that is tilted towards cynicism, I think sometimes people, particularly on our side, end up feeling frustrated or despairing. And I'm here to tell you, we've got a righteous wind at our backs, and we are, on each of these fights, going to just keep on steadily making progress. And when the journey is over&mdash;now, the journey of the country is never over, but the journey of my Presidency is over, and we look back, I think people are going to be maybe even surprised themselves at how much we've gotten done. And that's because of you and the support that all of you provide. So I'm grateful for it. <p>And with that, let me start taking some questions or suggestions.\" "
"235" "\"<i>The President.</i> Please, everybody, have a seat. It is my pleasure to welcome back the Chicago Blackhawks to the White House. We have some very proud Blackhawks fans here. A couple I want to point out in particular: Senator Dick Durbin from Illinois and Congressman Mike Quigley, who actually still has an old man's hockey game that he's in all the time. [<i>Laughter</i>] Any false teeth, Mike? Just a couple, all right. But this guy is a serious hockey player. So Mike Quigley. <p>Now, since I took office, we've hosted a lot of championship teams from Boston and New York, Pittsburgh, Miami, but since I've been President, only one team has brought a world championship to my hometown of Chicago. And now the Blackhawks have done it twice. [<i>Applause</i>] Twice! <p>Three years ago, the 'Hawks won their first Stanley Cup in 49 years. And keep in mind, the Cubs have been waiting for 105&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;so 49 might have not seemed so bad. But luckily, the second Stanley Cup came just a little bit quicker. <p>From the very beginning of last season, when these guys won their first six games in a row, we had a feeling that this was a team on the move. And we were right. <p>With Coach Q behind the bench, 'Hawks dominated the regular season. In the playoffs, Captain Jonathan Toews led the team all the way for the second time, and he's still only, by the way, 25 years old. Now, I don't remember everything I was doing when I was 25, but I wasn't doing that. [<i>Laughter</i>] That I'm pretty certain of. Incredible leadership on his part. <p>Patrick Kane, the playoff MVP, helped to send this team to the finals in an incredible double overtime. I will say, some of the games were just stressful though. [<i>Laughter</i>] I was getting a little tense <p>Duncan Keith had an interesting first round: scored a goal in game three. Then he flew home to Chicago to be with his wife for the birth of their son Colton. Then, he flew back to Minneapolis the same day, arrived 2 hours before the drop of the puck, helped lead the team to a win that put them up 3 to 1 in the series. And about 6 weeks later, Colton may have become the youngest person ever to be hoisted by the Cup. [<i>Laughter</i>] That hadn't been happening before. <p>Finally, we've got Bryan Bickell and Dave Bolland. With less than 2 minutes left in game six of the finals&mdash;the 'Hawks down by just one goal&mdash;teamed up to score two goals in just 17 seconds to bring the Cup back to Chicago&mdash;17 seconds. Now, that's the kind of clutch performance that would make Jordan proud, which is why the statue was wearing a Blackhawks jersey, I think, during the playoffs. <p>So this team is a great example of what Chicago is all about. It's not just, by the way, because of what they've done on the ice. In game six, Andrew Shaw got hit in the face by a puck. It earned him more than a few stitches, but after the game, he decided to make the best of a painful situation. When those stitches came out, he auctioned every one of them off. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, it does raise the question, like, who's buying sutures? [<i>Laughter</i>] Right? Somebody bid on this stuff. He raised almost $20,000 for the V Foundation to help cancer research. <p>And he's not the only guy with a big heart back here. This morning the entire team paid a visit to our wounded warriors of Walter Reed, helping to raise the spirits of men and women who have sacrificed so much for this country. And when I had a chance to have some of our wounded warriors in the room with these guys beforehand, I said, I love the Blackhawks, I love all my sports teams, but obviously, our best team, our most important team are those folks who every day serve us in uniform and keep us free. So we really just are grateful to them. <p>So these are not just good hockey players, they are good guys. And that helps explain why 2 million Chicago fans came out to Grant Park to celebrate bringing home the Cup. Speaking of Grant Park, we were originally going to let Corey Crawford say a few words today&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but we thought we'd keep this family event family friendly. [<i>Laughter</i>] You guys have been hanging out with Rahm Emanuel too much. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So congratulations again to the Blackhawks. To the Bulls, Bears, Cubs, White Sox&mdash;I am term limited, so you guys have got to get moving. I need to see you here soon. Championships belong in Chicago. So, to the Blackhawks, thank you for bringing it back home. Thanks for bringing the Stanley Cup. <p>Chairman Wirtz, do you want to say something? <p><i>Chairman W. Rockwell Wirtz. </i>Thank you, Mr. President. On behalf of the Chicago Blackhawks, thank you for this incredible honor. I can assure you, these fine players, beginning with Captain Jonathan Toews, will never take these visits for granted. You can be proud the way that these players play for your home team&mdash;hockey team. <p>More than that, they are gifted athletes who not only win championships, but go a long way in breaking gridlock if you allow them into Congress. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> That's true. I should try a hockey stick&mdash;during the shutdown&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I should have just seen how that worked. <p><i>Mr. Wirtz.</i> But thank you once again on behalf of the team and our fans, and please accept this jersey as a gesture for our gratitude.\" "
"236" "\"Hello, everybody! Hey! Thank you, everybody. Have a seat, have a seat. [<i>Applause</i>] Hey! It is good to see you. And thank you to&mdash;give Leslie a big round of applause for the wonderful introduction. Leslie is an example of folks on the ground who are just working day in, day out, through rain and&mdash;I guess no snow in Florida, but&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;rain or hot sun. But it's just a real honor to have somebody like Leslie introduce me, because that's what not only our health reform effort is all about, but that's what our politics is all about. She's just a great example, as are all of you. <p>I want to thank two leaders who have been working really hard to do the same on behalf of people that they serve. First of all, Governor Deval Patrick in Massachusetts, who we love. And Congressman Eliot Engel, who's been doing outstanding work. Give Eliot a big round of applause. <p>And I am proud to be with all of you. Some of your groups who are represented here have made access to affordable health care your mission. That's what you do. You've been organizing, even before I was President, because you understood how important it was. Some of you have made this the cause of your lives. So today I'm here to simply say thank you. We could not have passed this law without you, and we're not going to be able to get the job done without you. <p>It was 5 years ago today that I had the honor of being elected President. Some of you remember, I had no gray hair&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and Malia came up to here&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and Sasha was about here. And across so many fronts, we've made just incredible progress. In other areas, we've still got more work to do. But there's not a day that goes by that I am not incredibly humbled by this extraordinary privilege to be able to serve the American people. <p>And it fills me with resolve&mdash;every time I meet folks like you each and every day, it fills me with resolve&mdash;to make sure that every minute, every hour of every day that I'm in this office, I am working hard to make sure that your lives and your children's lives and grandchildren's lives are just a little bit better. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Thank you! [<i>Applause</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> And during the campaign, I made you a promise. I promised that by the end of my first term, I would have passed health care reform into law. I would have signed that bill. And thanks to your help, we did that. We got it done. <p>Now, let's face it, a lot of us didn't realize that passing the law was the easy part. [<i>Laughter</i>] But there's been so much noise and so much misinformation and this incredible organized effort to block the notion that everybody should have affordable health care in this country that I think it's important for us to step back and take a look at what's already been accomplished, because a lot of times, it doesn't make news. Controversies make news, but what's happened quietly across the country over the last 3 years hasn't got a lot of attention. In fact, a lot of the people who are benefiting don't even know it. <p>Because of you, the insurance market now has the strongest consumer protections that this country has ever known: no more discriminating against kids with preexisting conditions, no more dropping your policy when you get sick, no more lifetime limits on the care that you can receive. All of that and more is part of a new patient's bill of rights that's smack dab in the middle of the Affordable Care Act, and it's helping people right now. <p>Because of you, there are 3 million young adults under the age of 26 that are getting coverage by staying on their parent's plan right now, including Leslie's son. That happened because of you. Because of you, millions of seniors on Medicare have saved hundreds of dollars on their prescription medicine. It's already happened. They may not be aware of it, but that's already taking place. They're saving money because of the work that you did. <p>More than a hundred million Americans have gotten free preventive care like mammograms and contraceptive care with no copays. That's all part of the law. Because of you, millions of Americans will soon know the security of health care, in some cases for the first time, in States where Governors have chosen to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Arkansas has covered almost 14 percent of its uninsured already. Think about that: Fourteen percent of the uninsured in Arkansas are already covered just because of the work that you did. Oregon has covered 10 percent of its uninsured already. [<i>Applause</i>] Got some Oregon folks in the house. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>The&mdash;and what's been encouraging is, you've got some conservative Republican Governors who, in some cases, have put aside politics to do the same. They've recognized, this is too good a deal for the people of our State for us to pass up even if it's not convenient politics for us. And I'm proud of them for doing that. And I hope more will too. Because nobody deserves to be denied health care because of politics. <p>And because of you, the Affordable Care Act created new marketplaces where Americans without health care and Americans who buy it on their own can shop and buy quality private insurance plans. Insurers in the marketplace can no longer use your medical history to charge you more. If you've got a preexisting condition, they've got to take you. Folks who've been sick have finally the same chance to buy quality, affordable health care as everybody else. And that's happening because of you. <p>A lot of folks are going to qualify for new tax credits that will immediately bring down the price even further. For a young person who's trying several jobs until they find that one that sticks, that means they're going to be able to buy insurance that gives them the freedom to pursue the careers that they want without fear that an illness or an accident will derail their dreams. <p>And most of the young people in this country who don't have health insurance currently, they're going to be able to get it for less than their cell phone bill, less than their cable bill. That's happening because of you. <p>So it's important sometimes to just step back and say, all that stuff is already happening. A lot of it got underreported, kind of crept up on people. And as we move forward, you've got to keep that in mind. <p>Now, there have been some tough parts, let's face it. The truth of the matter is, is that while ultimately, healthcare.gov, the web site, is going to be the easiest place to shop for and buy these new plans&mdash;and it's getting faster and more stable&mdash;it's not where it needs to be yet. I'm not happy about it, as you might imagine. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm not happy about it, because I know that people need health care and this is the right place to get it. <p>I know you're not happy about it because as long as the web site is not working the way it should, it makes it harder for you to help them get covered. And that's unacceptable, and I'm taking responsibility to make sure that it gets fixed. And it will be fixed. We're working overtime to get it fixed. <p>But in the meantime, as you go back to your home States, I just want to remind everybody that they can still apply for coverage by phone, by mail, in person. There was a time when the Internet didn't exist. [<i>Laughter</i>] It wasn't that long ago. A lot of programs like Medicaid still don't operate electronically. And so there are ways for us to still work to make sure that people are getting the opportunity to buy affordable, quality health care. <p>And remember, we're only 1 month into a 6-month open enrollment period. Everybody who wants to get insurance through the marketplace, they'll be able to get it. It's not as if this is a 1-day sale or something. [<i>Laughter</i>] Right? So we've just got to keep on working. <p>Now, the other news that people have focused on lately has to do with notices that some Americans have gotten from their insurance companies suggesting that, because of the Affordable Care Act, they may be losing the plan that they bought. Now, while virtually every insurer is offering new, better plans and competing for these folks' business, I realize that can be scary for people if they just get some notice like that. So we've got to make sure that we're getting them the right information. <p>Remember that one of the reasons that we took up health care reform was not just to help the uninsured, but also the underinsured or the badly insured. People forget how unfair and unaffordable the status quo has been for millions of Americans, millions of hard-working families who live in constant fear that just one illness or accident could cost them their home or their life savings. Sometimes, by the way, they don't know how vulnerable they are because when you look at the fine print, it turns out that a whole bunch of things that people think are covered aren't covered. We know because we heard the stories of people saying, I'd been paying premiums all these years, and suddenly, I found out that I've got all these out-of-pocket expenses that I can't afford, and I'm going broke. That's part of what health care reform was about. We did this to put an end to the days when the individual market had almost no standards, when every year thousands of Americans would be dropped from their coverage. <p>People are acting like this is some new phenomenon. Every year, there was churn in this individual market. The average increase was double digits on premiums in this same market, with or without affordable&mdash;the Affordable Care Act. People were getting oftentimes a very bad deal. And as a consequence, what you had is Americans who'd be dropped from coverage, exposed to massive double-digit premium increases, or most frequently, they'd just be denied access altogether because of some preexisting condition. <p>Now, if you have or had one of these plans before the Affordable Care Act came into law and you really like that plan, what we said was, you could keep it if it hasn't changed since the law was passed. So we wrote into the Affordable Care Act, you're grandfathered in on that plan. <p>But if the insurance company changes it, then what we're saying is, they've got to change it to a higher standard. They've got to make it better. They've got to improve the quality of the plan that they're selling. That's part of the promise that we made too. That's why we went out of our way to make sure that the law allowed for grandfathering, but if we had allowed these old plans to be downgraded or sold to new enrollees once the law had already passed, then we would have broken an even more important promise: making sure that Americans gain access to health care that doesn't leave them one illness away from financial ruin. <p>So the bottom line is, is that we are making the insurance market better for everybody. And that's the right thing to do. That is the right thing to do. <p>So today, that promise means that every plan in the marketplace has to cover a core set of minimum benefits, like maternity care and preventive care, mental health care, prescription drug benefits, hospitalization. Preexisting conditions like allergies or heartburn&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;can't be an excuse for you being charged more. Being a woman can't be used as an excuse to be charged more. <p>Which means if you couldn't afford coverage before for a child with asthma, well, now he's covered. If you're one of the one in five Americans with a mental illness, you're covered. If you're a young couple that's expecting a baby, congratulations. [<i>Laughter</i>] And by the way, you're covered. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So we should encourage any American who gets one of these letters to shop around in the new marketplace. Now, I recognize that as&mdash;while the web site isn't working as fast as it needs to, that makes it tougher and that makes it scarier for folks. We want them immediately to get the information that they need, to understand they've got more competition and more options. <p>Now, insurers are offering these new options, and they don't just want to keep their current policyholders, they want to cover the uninsured too. And because of the competition between insurers and the new health care tax credits, most people will be able to buy better plans for the same price or even cheaper than what they've gotten before. <p>Now, some Americans with higher incomes will pay more on the front end for better insurance with better benefits and better protections that could eventually help them a lot, even if right now they'd rather be paying less. But nobody is going to lose their right to health insurance coverage. Nobody can be dropped altogether. Those days are over. They're not coming back. That happened because of the work that you did. <p>So the&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. Look, here's the bottom line. I don't need to tell any of you because you've been on the frontlines on this. Change isn't easy, period. Change in this area is especially hard because it touches on everybody. Everybody's lives are impacted and it's a very personal issue. And when you're undertaking something this big, this important, like health care reform, we knew we were going to get resistance. Maybe not&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;to the same degree as we've gotten. But there's a reason why this hasn't gotten done before. <p>And by the way, there's a reason why the opponents of this law throughout have never been able to actually offer a better alternative. Right? Initially, they said they would. [<i>Laughter</i>] But they didn't, because they understand that it's hard. But when the unexpected happens, when the unanticipated happens, we're just going to work on it, and we're going to fix things that aren't working the way they should be. We're going to smooth this thing out, and we're just going to keep on going. We are going to keep on going because it is too important to too many people, not just in this generation, but in future generations. And we've got to make sure that we stay on track to make this work. <p>So I don't want any of you to ever lose sight of why we got involved in this thing in the first place. We did it for every mother who was desperate because of a child with a preexisting condition. We did it for every hard-working American who was forced to give up their insurance and hang his or her fortunes on chance. We did it for the same reason that Leslie did: because of our own experiences or heartbreak under a broken health care system. We decided we need to build something better, no matter how hard it is. <p>And here's the thing: Every day, there are new stories to tell. I hear them every single day. And I know you do too; when you help folks enroll for new plans; when you help small-business owners cover their workers for the first time; when you help a young woman get the coverage that she deserves. <p>A couple weeks ago, I got a letter from Jeffrey Huff, Lexington, Kentucky. Currently, Jeffrey and his girlfriend pay $1,500 a month to cover their family of six. Once the marketplaces opened, his girlfriend went online, enrolled in a new plan that will cut their monthly cost by more than half, drop their deductible from $3,000 to $500. <p>So he told me in his letter that it \\"breathed life back into our family. We can't wait until January 1.\\" He said if he could give one message to the American people, it's this: \\"It works. Obamacare is working for people.\\" <p>Now, stories&mdash;let's face it, stories like Jeffrey's may not get all the media attention, but they're why we did this. They're what we're fighting for. And I know you hear them too. So I'm asking all of you to go out there and share these stories far and wide. Because it's nothing new to have a bunch of folks spreading fear and misinformation and confusion and cynicism about this law; we've been facing that for 4 years. We're used to that. <p>What's new is that today, there are Americans with health care for the very first time. Today, there are Americans whose lives have been saved by preventive care that they wouldn't have gotten before. Today, there are Americans who can breathe easy again, free from the crushing fear that an illness or accident means they lose everything. So the rhetoric of reform is becoming the reality of reform. And we're not going back. <p>So just remember this: I have run my last political campaign, but I'll tell you what, we've&mdash;I've got one more campaign in me: the campaign to make sure that this law works for every single person in America. And I'm asking for your help. I need your help to implement this law. I need your help to educate folks about this law. I&mdash;you need to keep knocking on doors and making phone calls and traveling all across your States. <p>For over a century, folks have argued that in this country, the security of affordable health care is a privilege. It's not a privilege, it is a right. We are making that right a reality, but we've got to make sure that all of you stay on it, and you're going to have me every step of the way. <p>God bless you, everybody. God bless America.\" "
"237" "\"In addition to talking about the Red Sox&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;we are here to talk about immigration reform. We've got an outstanding group of leaders here, a wide cross-section of industry. We've got manufacturers, service sector, food, high tech. And they represent just a small cross-section of the businesses all across the country who are deeply committed to making sure that we get comprehensive immigration reform done and done quickly. <p>Just last week, we had 600 business and faith leaders who came to emphasize that this is something that is not only the right thing to do, but it's also critical to our economy. We know that the Senate bipartisan bill that already passed would grow the economy by $1.4 trillion above and beyond the growth that's already taking place. We know it will reduce our deficit by $850 billion. This is not&mdash;these aren't my estimates, these are independent estimates that had been made about the salutary effect that comprehensive immigration reform will have on our economy. And these businesses understand that. <p>They understand that if we are serious about border security, if we do a better job of streamlining the legal immigration system, if we are holding employers who aren't doing the right thing accountable, and we provide a pathway to citizenship for those who have paid a fine, learned English, are getting to the back of the line, taking their responsibilities, that all together, these businesses are going to have more customers, we're going to see people who are currently working here out of the shadows, paying taxes, and getting right with the law. We have the opportunity when young people come to this country to study on our dime, making sure that if they're able and willing, they can stay here, start businesses of their own, contribute to our economy, help our exports. <p>So this is something that has strong bipartisan support. Keep in mind that my predecessor, George W. Bush, was a strong supporter of this. We have a fascinating cross-section of people&mdash;some unlikely bedfellows, some very liberal folks and very conservative folks&mdash;who all believe that now is the time to get this done. And as we saw in the Senate, there is the strong potential for bipartisan support. <p>So what I'm going to be talking to the business community about is how we can continue to amplify this issue in the coming weeks. There's no reason why we can't get this done before the end of the year. And I continue to be hopeful that with the leadership of many who are around this table, who represent hundreds of thousands of employees and billions of dollars of assets, who are important in their communities all across the country, them joining up with law enforcement, clergy, citizens to make the case, that ultimately, folks up on Capitol Hill will do the right thing. <p>And although right now there's been some resistance from House Republicans, what's been encouraging is, is that there are a number of House Republicans who have said, we think this is the right thing to do as well. And it's my estimation that we actually have votes to get comprehensive immigration reform done in the House right now. <p>The politics are challenging for the Speaker and others, and we want to make it as easy for him as possible. This is not an issue where we're looking for a political win. This is one where we're looking for a substantive win for the U.S. economy and the American people and the businesses that are represented here. <p>So I'm very grateful to all of you who have joined us. But we're going to be pushing to make sure that we send out that clarion call up towards Capitol Hill, see if we can get this done before the end of the year. All right? <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"238" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you, Edna. Give Edna a big round of applause. Well, it is wonderful to see all of you. And let me just make some special mention of some people in addition to Edna who are here. <p>First of all, your outstanding mayor, Mike Rawlings, is here. Outstanding county judge, Clay Jenkins, who's doing a great job on affordable care. Thank you, Clay. Wonderful Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson is here. And we want to thank Rabbi David Stern and Rabbi Asher Knight of Temple Emanu-El for hosting us here today. <p>And the main reason I'm here is to thank all of you. Edna's story is a story that is repeated all across the country: people who got sick and didn't have health insurance; folks who thought they had health insurance; and then, turned out, because of the fine print or them not filling something out right, they were short of what they needed in terms of getting healed. <p>And when I ran for office, obviously, we were in the midst of a great recession, and my number-one priority was making sure that we didn't go into a great depression and making sure that we started putting people back to work. We've now seen the economy begin to recover, although sometimes, Washington is not helpful with things like the shutdown. We've seen 7&frac12; million new jobs created. We've seen exports at record levels. We've seen a lot of growth in places like Dallas, and people are starting to get their footing back, home prices starting to recover. <p>But what I also understood was that if we did not start tackling our health care system in a serious way, it would continue to undermine our economy, it would continue to hurt families, and it would continue to hurt businesses. <p>And there's a reason why it had never been done before. Starting with Harry Truman, people had talked about how we were going to make sure that everybody had affordable, quality health care. But through Democratic and Republican Presidents and Congresses, we couldn't get it done. And the reason is it's hard. It's a big chunk of the economy, and a lot of people, even if they don't like what is going on, are always nervous about change. So it was a challenge. But we were able to get it done, in part because of grassroots folks like you that fought so hard to make sure that we were able to deliver on universal health care. <p>And that is what this is all about. Ultimately, all the politics, all the chatter sometimes leaves out the fact that the system we had, the status quo just wasn't working for too many people. And so it was important for us, as difficult and challenging as it has been, to go ahead and move forward to make sure that folks like Edna, when they go to the hospital because they've been stricken with an illness, know not only that they're going to get good care, but also that their families aren't going to go bankrupt just because somebody in the family got sick. That's what we've been fighting for. <p>Now, over the last 3 years, we've already put a whole bunch of benefits in place. A lot of people don't know that they're in place because of the Affordable Care Act, but they're already in place. So if you've got a child who's 25, didn't have health insurance, but now is on the parent's plan, the reason for that is because of the Affordable Care Act. Seniors are getting discounts on their prescription drugs, saving hundreds of dollars because we deepened the discount through the Affordable Care Act. Insurance companies have to treat customers right because of the Affordable Care Act. No more lifetime limits, no more dropping people just when they get sick. <p>But to finish the job, now what we've got to do is sign up those folks who don't have health insurance and improve insurance for those who are underinsured, who don't have very good insurance and have been subject to the whims of the insurance company. And that's what this is all about. And that's the challenge that we've got over the next month, 3 months, 6 months, next year. And if we get that done&mdash;when we get that done&mdash;then we will have created a stable system in which there's no reason why people shouldn't be getting health care in this country. <p>Now, I'm the first to say that the first month I've not been happy with. [<i>Laughter</i>] You've all heard about the web site woes. Nothing drives me more crazy than the fact that right now, there's great insurance to be had out there, choice and competition, where people can save money for a better product, except, too many folks haven't been able to get through the web site. <p>Now, this is like having a really good product in a store, and the cash registers don't work and there aren't enough parking spots and nobody can get through the door. And so we are working overtime to get this fixed. And the web site is already better than it was at the beginning of October, and by the end of this month, we anticipate that it is going to be working the way it is supposed to. All right? And folks are working 24/7 to make sure that happens. <p>But remember, the insurance is already there. And if people can't get through the web site, they can get on the phone to the call center and people can take their application and walk them through this process, and people can apply in person if they've got committed folks who are out there helping people to sign up. And that's what all of you have been committed to doing. <p>And it is so important, because the truth of the matter is, even if the web site were working a hundred percent, a lot of people would still need help to navigate through this stuff. A high percentage of people who don't have health care also might not have ready access to a computer right away, or it might be confusing for them, and they would need people to help guide them through this process. And that's true, by the way, if they were buying any kind of insurance. Right? Sometimes, it's a complicated process. <p>So the commitment that all of you&mdash;that congregations, that faith-based groups&mdash;are engaged in is critically important. And it's not going to stop; even after the web site is running perfectly, we're still going to need all of you to be making these efforts. And I want to make special mention of the mayor's and Clay's work and Bernice&mdash;Eddie Bernice's work to get people signed up, because that's the kind of commitment that we're going to need on the ground on a day-to-day basis. <p>So my main job here today is to say thank you. And as Clay has said, nothing is going to stop us from getting this done, because we're on the right side of history. It is the right thing to do. It is the right thing to do for our economy, our businesses, and our families. <p>Now, the last point I want to make: I know that sometimes, this task is especially challenging here in the great Lone Star State. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member.</i> We're up to the task. <p><i>The President.</i> But I think that all of you understand that there's no State that actually needs this more than Texas. Think about it. We were just talking on the way over here that in addition to signing people up for the marketplaces so they can buy private insurance, part of the Affordable Care Act was expanding the number of working families who would qualify for Medicaid. Now, because of a Supreme Court ruling, it's voluntary, which States decide to expand Medicaid coverage, which don't. <p>Here in just the Dallas area, 133,000 people who don't currently have health insurance would immediately get health insurance without even having to go through the web site if the State of Texas decided to do it. There's over $500 million just for this county that would come in to help families get health insurance&mdash;has nothing to do with the web site&mdash;if the State of Texas made this decision. And your neighboring States have made that decision because they look at it and they say, this is a no-brainer, why would not&mdash;why would we not want to take advantage of this. <p>So the State of Arkansas has already reduced its number of uninsured by 14 percent already, just in the first month, by signing people up for expanded Medicaid&mdash;14 percent. State of Oregon, 10 percent reduction in the number of uninsured already, in the first month, right away, folks are signed up, just because the Governor and the legislature there made the right decision. <p>There's no reason why this State can't do the same. <p><i>Audience member</i>. [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President</i>. And&mdash;well, I mentioned that in the Dallas area it's 133,000 people who stand to benefit. Across this State, you've got a million people&mdash;because this is a big State&mdash;a million people, citizens, who don't have health insurance that could get health insurance right away if the State of Texas decided to take advantage of it. <p>So one of the things that sometimes gets me a little frustrated, although I understand it because I'm in politics, is folks who are complaining about how the web site is not working and why isn't Obama fixing this and all these people are uninsured, and yet they're leaving a million people right now without health insurance that they could immediately fix. <p><i>Audience member</i>. That's right. That's right. <p><i>The President</i>. There's not a lot of logic to that. <p>But that's okay, because we've gone through barriers before; we have gone through struggles before. Eventually, though, if you stick with doing the right thing, you get it done. It will happen, all right? <p>And so I just want all of you to remember that, as challenging as this may seem sometimes, as frustrating as healthcare.gov may be sometimes, we are going to get this done. And when we do&mdash;when we do, not if&mdash;when we do, you're going to have families all across this great State of Texas who are going to have the security and the well-being of high-quality, affordable health insurance. And that's going to be good for business. It means that all the providers around here, instead of having to take in folks in the emergency room, they suddenly have customers who have insurance. That means those of you who already have health insurance, your premiums will not be subsidizing folks who don't have health insurance. People will get preventive care, which means that people are likely to be healthier. <p>And that's within our power. That's within our grasp. So this is a pretty motivated group. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes! <p><i>The President.</i> This looks like a group that's ready to go. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes! <p><i>The President.</i> I'm here to tell you that I'm going to be right there with you the entire way until we get this done and everybody in Texas and everybody all across this country have the affordable health care that they need. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America. God bless the State of Texas.\" "
"239" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Big Easy! Everybody, give it up for Nancy for that great introduction. It is good to be back in New Orleans. I can't&mdash;this is what passes for winter here in New Orleans, huh? [<i>Laughter</i>] Folks got all their coats on and all that. Come on. You need to go to Chicago to know what it's like to be cold. <p>It is great to be here. It is especially happy for my staff. They love coming to New Orleans. But we did schedule the event early because I figured there's a limit to how much trouble they could get into. [<i>Laughter</i>] They can't get over to Bourbon Street fast enough if we did a daytime event. And I know that there are probably a couple of my staff that are LSU fans. I wouldn't mind staying for the game tomorrow night. I know we've got the president here; I just saw him a minute ago, and I wished him all the best. <p>I also want to acknowledge a couple of other people who are here. You've got your Governor, Bobby Jindal is here. We've got the Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx, who is here. We have Cedric Richmond, your outstanding Congressman. Cedric then brought down a whole bunch of his colleagues from the Congressional Black Caucus for some important work that they're doing, not that they're going to enjoy themselves at all while they're here. [<i>Laughter</i>] But we are thrilled to see them all here. <p>You have one of the best mayors in the country in Mitch Landrieu. And I just flew down with your Senator, who, by coincidence, has the same name: Mary Landrieu. She's traveling around the State today and doing unbelievable work on behalf of the people of Louisiana. And I just want to say, nobody is a tougher advocate on behalf of the working people of Louisiana than Mary Landrieu. So we're very, very proud of the work that she does. <p>Now, finally, I want to thank Mr. Larry&mdash;Gary LaGrange, Keith Palmisano, and Chris Hammond. They showed me around the port. And this is one of the&mdash;by the way, anybody who's got a seat, feel free. I noticed that a few folks are standing up. If you don't have a seat, then keep on standing. I don't want you hurting yourself. <p>This is one of the busiest port complexes in the entire world. You move millions of tons of steel and chemicals and fuel and food every single year. I just found out, you also handle a lot of the country's coffee, which means you're responsible for keeping the White House awake at all times. [<i>Applause</i>] Got some coffee folks here. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And in so many ways, this port is representative of what ports all around the country do: They help to keep our economy going: moving products, moving people, making sure that businesses are working. You've got corn and wheat that's coming down from my home State of Illinois down the river, ending up here, and then going all around the world. And it's part of the reason why we've been able to increase exports so rapidly, is because we've got some of the best natural resources and waterways and facilities in the world. <p>Now, growing our economy, creating new jobs, helping middle class families regain a sense of stability and security so they can find good jobs and make sure that their kids are doing even better than they did&mdash;now, that's always been what America is about, but for too many people, that sense that you can make it here if you try, that sense has been slipping away. And my driving focus has been to restore that sense of security, and it should be Washington's focus, regardless of party. That's what everybody in Washington should be thinking about every day. <p>So today I want to just offer a couple of ideas about what we could do right now together that would help our economy, right now. Now, the good news is, over the past 44 months, our businesses have created 7.8 million new jobs. Since I took office, we've cut the deficits in half. [<i>Applause</i>] That's right. By the way, you wouldn't know this sometimes listening to folks on TV, but the deficits are going down, they're not going up. They've been cut in half. And they are&mdash;they keep on going down. <p>Over the past 3 years, health care costs have risen at the slowest pace on record. Exports are up. The housing market is up. The American auto industry is roaring back. So we've got a lot of good things to build on, but we've got a lot more work to do. And what we should start doing&mdash;the first thing we should do&mdash;is stop doing things that undermine our businesses and our economy over the past few years, this constant cycle of manufactured crises and self-inflicted wounds that have been coming out of Washington. <p>For example, we learned yesterday that over the summer, our economy grew at its fastest pace in a year. That's the good news. The bad news is that the very day that the economic quarter ended, some folks in Washington decided to shut down the Government and threatened to default on America's obligations for the first time in more than 200 years. And it's like, the gears of our economy, every time they are just about to take off, suddenly, somebody taps the brakes and says, not so fast. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Tell it! [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Now, our businesses are resilient. We've got great workers. And so, as a consequence, we added about 200,000 new jobs last month. But there's no question that the shutdown harmed our jobs market. The unemployment rate still ticked up. And we don't yet know all the data for this second&mdash;this final quarter of the year, but it could be down because of what happened in Washington. Now, that makes no sense. These self-inflicted wounds don't have to happen. They should not happen again. <p>We should not be injuring ourselves every few months, we should be investing in ourselves. We should be building, not tearing things down. Rather than refighting the same old battles again and again and again, we should be fighting to make sure everybody who works hard in America and hard right here in New Orleans, that they have a chance to get ahead. That's what we should be focused on. <p>Which brings me to one of the reasons I'm here at this port. One of the things we should be focused on is helping more businesses sell more products to the rest of the world. And the only way those products get out is through facilities like this. Right now exports are one of the brightest spots in our economy. Thanks in part to new trade deals that we signed with countries like Panama and Colombia and South Korea, we now export more goods and services than ever before. And that means jobs right here in the United States of America. <p>Last year, every $1 billion in exports supports nearly 5,000 jobs, including jobs right here at this port. So we're working on new trade deals that will mean more jobs for our workers and more business for ports like this one. <p>And by the way, I&mdash;when I travel around the world, I'm out there selling. I'll go anywhere in the world to make sure that those products stamped with those words \\"Made in America,\\" that we can open up those markets and sell them anywhere. <p>So helping American businesses grow, creating more jobs&mdash;these are not Democratic or Republican priorities, they are priorities that everybody, regardless of party, should be able to get behind. And that's why, in addition to working with Congress to grow our exports, I've put forward additional ideas where, I believe, Democrats and Republicans can join together to make progress right now. <p>Number one, Congress needs to pass a farm bill that helps rural communities grow and protects vulnerable Americans. For decades, Congress found a way to compromise and pass farm bills without fuss. For some reason, now Congress can't even get that done. Now, this is not something that just benefits farmers. Ports like this one depend on all the products coming down the Mississippi. So let's do the right thing: Pass a farm bill. We can start selling more products. That's more business for this port. And that means more jobs right here. <p>Number two, we should fix our broken immigration system. This would be good for our national security, but it would also be good for our economic security. Over the next two decades, it would grow our economy by $1.4 trillion. It would shrink our deficits by nearly a trillion dollars. This is&mdash;this should not be a partisan issue. President Bush proposed the broad outlines of commonsense immigration reform almost a decade ago. When I was in the Senate, I joined 23 of my Republican colleagues to back those reforms. This year, the Senate has already passed a bill with broad bipartisan support. <p>So all we're doing now is waiting for the House to act. I don't know what the holdup is. But if there's a good reason not to do it, I haven't heard it. There's no reason both parties can't come together: Get this done this year. [<i>Applause</i>] Get it done this year. <p>Number three, Democrats and Republicans should work together on a responsible budget that sets America on a stronger course for the future. We shouldn't get caught up in the same old fights. And we shouldn't just cut things just for the sake of cutting things. Remember, I want to remind you: What's happening to the deficits? They're going down. They're shrinking. They're falling faster than they have in 60 years. <p>So what we have to do now is do what America has always done: make some wise investments in our people and in our country that will help us grow over the long term. We should close wasteful tax loopholes that don't help our jobs, don't grow our economy, and then invest that money in things that actually do create jobs and grow our economy. And one of those things is building new roads and bridges and schools and ports. That creates jobs. It puts people to work during the construction phase. And then it creates an infrastructure for our economy to succeed moving forward. <p>Educating our kids, training our workers so they're prepared for the global economy, that helps us grow. We should be investing in that. And Mayor Landrieu has been doing a great job in improving education here in New Orleans. <p>Investing in science and research and technology, that keeps our businesses and our military at our cutting edge. That's the kind of investment we should be making. <p>I mean, think about our infrastructure. In today's global economy, businesses are going to take root and grow wherever there's the fastest, most reliable transportation and communications networks; they can go anywhere. So China is investing a whole lot in infrastructure. Europe is investing a whole lot in infrastructure. And Brazil is investing a whole lot in infrastructure. What are we doing? <p>We're doing some good things locally here. The State and city are trying to do some work, but nationally, we're falling behind. We're relying on old stuff. I don't think we should have just old stuff, we should have some new stuff that is going to help us grow and keep pace with global competition. <p>Rebuilding our transportation and communications networks is one of the fastest ways to create good jobs. And consider that just a couple of years from now, we're going to have new supertankers that are going to start coming through the Panama Canal, and these tankers can hold three times as much cargo as today's. If a port can't handle those supertankers, they'll go load and unload cargo somewhere else. So there's work that we can start doing in terms of dredging and making the passageways deeper, which means the supertankers can have more stuff on them, which means they can unload and load more stuff, which makes this port more competitive. <p>So why wouldn't we put people to work upgrading them? Why wouldn't we do that? It's not just our ports either. One in nine of our bridges is rated structurally deficient. More than 40 percent of our major highways are congested; so is our airspace. Everybody who's sitting on a tarmac wondering why it is that you're not taking off and getting aggravated when you go fly someplace, part of the reason is, we've got this antiquated air traffic control system. We need the next-generation air traffic control system. It would reduce time travel; it would reduce delays. It reduces fuel costs for airlines. It reduces pollution in the sky. We know how to do it, we just haven't done it. <p>That shouldn't be a Democratic or a Republican issue. That's just smart to go ahead and do it, something that people across the political spectrum should be able to agree on. Now, here's the thing: All these opportunities and challenges, they're not going to magically fix themselves. We've got to do it. And anybody who says we can't afford to pay for these things needs to realize we're already paying for them. <p>I'll give you an example. A lot of trucking companies now reroute their shipments to avoid traffic and unsafe bridges. So they're going longer than they need to; that costs them money. So you're paying for it. Those costs then get passed on to consumers. Or it means companies aren't making as much of a profit and maybe they've got fewer employees. So directly or indirectly, we're paying for it. And the longer we delay, the more we'll pay. <p>So the sooner we take care of business, the better. And I know that if there's one thing that Members of Congress from both parties want, it's smart infrastructure projects that create good jobs in their district. <p>So that's why, last year, I took the step&mdash;without Congress&mdash;to speed up the permitting process for big infrastructure projects like upgrading our ports. Just cut through the redtape, get it done faster. This year, rebuilding our infrastructure could be part of a bipartisan budget deal. A couple months ago, I put forward an idea to try to break through some of the old arguments, a grand bargain for middle class jobs. And what I said was, we'll simplify our corporate Tax Code, close some&mdash;close wasteful tax loopholes, end incentives to ship jobs overseas, lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs here in the United States, and use some of the money we save by switching to a smarter tax system to create good construction jobs building the things that our businesses need right here in America. It's a pretty sensible deal. <p>So we&mdash;if we took that step, we could modernize our air traffic control system to keep planes running on time, modernize our power grids and pipelines so they survive storms, modernize our schools to prepare our kids for jobs of the future, modernize our ports so they can accommodate the new ships. <p>Point is, rebuilding our infrastructure or educating our kids, funding basic research&mdash;they are not partisan issues, they're American issues. There used to be a broad consensus that these things were important to our economy. And we've got to get back to that mindset. We've got to move forward on these things together. It doesn't mean that there aren't going to be disagreements on a whole bunch of stuff, but let's work on the things we agree on. <p>Now, I'm going to make one last point. One area where we haven't made much bipartisan progress&mdash;at least not as much as I'd like&mdash;is fixing our broken health care system. And I took up this cause knowing it was hard&mdash;there was a reason why no other President had done it&mdash;to make sure every American has access to quality, affordable health care and to make sure that no American ever again has to fear one illness is going to bankrupt them. <p>And the work we've already done has resulted in, over the past 3 years, health care costs rising at the slowest pace on record. Health care costs for businesses are growing about one-third of the rate they were a decade ago, and we want those trends to continue. <p>Now, we've had this problem with the web site. I'm not happy about that. But we're working overtime to make sure that it gets fixed, because right now we've put in place a system, a marketplace, where people can get affordable health care plans. I promise you, nobody has been more frustrated. I wanted to go in and fix it myself, but I don't write code, so&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>But to every American with a preexisting condition who's been waiting for the day they could be covered just like everybody else, for folks who couldn't afford to buy their own insurance because they don't get it on the job, we're going to fix the web site. Because the insurance plans are there. They are good, and millions of Americans are already finding that they'll gain better coverage for less cost, and it's the right thing to do. <p>Now, I know that's&mdash;I know health care is controversial, so there's only going to be so much support we get on that on a bipartisan basis; until it's working really well, and then they're going to stop calling it Obamacare. [<i>Laughter</i>] They're going to call it something else. <p>One thing, though, I was talking to your mayor and your Governor about, though, is a separate issue, which is one of the things that the Affordable Care Act does is allow States to expand Medicaid to cover more of their citizens. <p>And here in Louisiana, that would benefit about 265,000 people. And already, you've seen States&mdash;Arkansas has covered&mdash;taken this up, and they're covering almost 14 percent of their uninsured. Republican Governors in States like Ohio and Nevada, Arizona, they're doing it, too. Oregon has already reduced the number of uninsured by about 10 percent. And some of these folks opposed Obamacare, but they did support helping their citizens who can't get coverage. <p>So we want to work with everybody&mdash;mayor, Governor, insurance&mdash;whoever it is that wants to work with us here in Louisiana to make sure that even if you don't support the overall plan, let's at least go ahead and make sure that the folks who don't have health insurance right now and can get it through an expanded Medicaid. Let's make sure we do that. [<i>Applause</i>] It's the right thing to do. <p>And one of the reasons to do it is&mdash;I've said this before; sometimes, people don't fully appreciate it&mdash;we already pay for the health care of people who don't have health insurance, we just pay for the most expensive version, which is when they go to the emergency room. Because what happens is, the hospitals have to take sick folk. They're not just going to leave them on the streets. But people who are sick, they wait till the very last minute. It's much more expensive to treat them. Hospitals have to figure out how to get their money back, which means, they jack up costs for everybody who does have health insurance by about a thousand dollars per family. <p>So, as a consequence, what happens is, you're already paying a hidden tax for a broken health care system. Community hospitals struggle to care for the uninsured who can't pay their bills when they get sick. So it's the right thing to do for the health of our economies as a whole. It is a practical, pragmatic reason to do it. It has nothing to do with politics or ideology. And the more States that are working together&mdash;Democrats and Republicans&mdash;the better off we're going to be. <p>So bottom line is, New Orleans, we can work together to do these things, because we've done them before. We did not become the greatest nation on Earth just by chance, just by accident. We had some advantages: really nice real estate here in the United States. But what we also had were people who, despite their differences&mdash;and we come from everywhere and look different and have different traditions&mdash;we understand that this country works best when we're working together. And we decided to do what was necessary for our businesses and our families to succeed. And if we did it in the past, we can do it again. <p>So let's make it easier for more businesses to expand and grow and sell more goods made in America to the rest of the world. Let's make sure we've got the best ports and roads and bridges and schools. Let's make sure our young people are getting a great education. Let's give everybody a chance to get ahead, not just a few at the top, but everybody, because if we do that, if we help our businesses grow and our communities thrive and our children reach a little higher, then the economy is going to grow faster. <p>We'll rebuild our middle class stronger. The American Dream will be real and achievable: not just for a few, but for everybody; not just today, but for decades to come. That's what we're fighting for. That's what you're all about here at this port and here in New Orleans. And I'm looking forward to working with you to make sure we keep that up. All right? <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"240" "\"Hello, everybody. Veterans Day weekend is a chance for all of us to say two simple words: \\"Thank you.\\" Thank you to that greatest generation who fought island by island across the Pacific and freed millions from fascism in Europe. Thank you to the heroes who risked everything through the bitter cold of Korea and the stifling heat of Vietnam. And thank you to all the heroes who have served since, most recently our 9/11 generation of veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. <p>Now that more of them are coming home, we need to serve them as well as they serve us, and that requires more than a simple thank you, especially from those of us who've been elected to serve. <p>I've often said that my top priority is growing the economy, creating new jobs, and restoring middle class security. And a very important part of that is making sure that every veteran has every chance to share in the opportunity he or she has helped defend. In addition to the care and benefits they've earned&mdash;including good mental health care to stay strong&mdash;that means a good job, a good education, and a home to call their own. <p>If you fight for your country overseas, you should never have to fight for a job when you come home. I've made sure the Federal Government leads by example, and since I took office, we've hired about 300,000 veterans to keep serving their country. Our new transition assistance program is helping veterans and their spouses find that new job and plan their career. And I'm going to keep calling on Congress to do the right thing and pass the veterans jobs corps. Put our veterans to work rebuilding America. <p>Our troops gain unmatched skills while serving in harm's way. So we're also doing everything we can to connect more businesses with highly skilled veterans: more help with job searches, more tools to connect veterans to job openings, more chances to earn licenses and credentials for civilian jobs, and new tax credits for companies that hire veterans and wounded warriors, tax credits which Congress should make permanent. <p>And America's businesses have worked with Michelle and Jill Biden's Joining Forces campaign to help returning heroes find jobs in the private sector. They've already hired or trained 290,000 veterans and military spouses, and they've committed to hiring over 400,000 more. <p>We're also committed to giving today's veterans and their families the same shot at a great education this country gave my grandfather when he came home from World War II. We're helping more of them earn their degrees under the post-9/11 GI bill. We've worked with thousands of schools across the country to set new standards to protect against dishonest recruiting and predatory lending practices that target our veterans. And we're helping hundreds of community colleges and universities do more to welcome and encourage our veterans on campus. <p>Thanks to these efforts and the efforts of the private sector, we've made progress getting our vets back to work. But we've got a lot more to do. And as more than a million of our troops return to civilian life, we're going to have to work even harder. Because the skill, dedication, and courage of our troops is unmatched, and when they come home, we all benefit from their efforts to build a stronger America and a brighter future for our kids. <p>So to all our veterans, on behalf our entire Nation, thank you for everything you've done and will continue to do for our country. As your Commander in Chief, I'm proud of your service and grateful for your sacrifice. And as long as I'm your President, I will make it my mission to make sure that America has your back, not just on one day or one weekend, but 365 days a year. <p>Thanks. God bless you, and have a great weekend.\" "
"241" "\"<i>The President</i>. Thank you. Please be seated. Good morning, everyone. <p><i>Audience members</i>. Good morning. <p><i>The President</i>. Thank you, Secretary Shinseki, for your lifetime of service to our Nation and for being a tireless advocate on behalf of America's veterans, including your fellow Vietnam veterans. To Vice President Biden and Dr. Jill Biden; Secretaries Hagel and Perez; Admiral Winnefeld; Major General Buchanan; most of all, to our outstanding veteran service organizations, our men and women in uniform, and to the proud veterans and family members joining us in this sacred place: Michelle and I are incredibly honored to be with you all here today again. <p>To the Gold Star families and the brothers- and sisters-in-arms who walk the paths of these hallowed grounds and the cemeteries around the world, we join you as you remember your loved ones who wore America's uniform. And here at Arlington and Section 60, we've ensured that you can continue to bring the small mementos of your love and affection to the final resting place of these American heroes. <p>Today we gather once more to honor patriots who have rendered the highest service any American can offer this Nation: those who fought for our freedom and stood sentry for our security. On this hillside of solemn remembrance and in veterans halls and in proud parades across America, we join as one people to honor a debt we can never fully repay. <p>In the life of our Nation, across every generation, there are those who stand apart. They step up, they raise their hands, they take that oath, they put on the uniform, and they put their lives on the line. They do this so that the rest of us might live in a country and a world that is safer, freer, and more just. This is the gift they've given us. This is the debt that we owe them. <p>They fought on a green at Lexington so that we could make independent the country they imagined. They fought on the fields of Gettysburg so that we could make whole a nation torn asunder. They fought on the beaches of Europe and across Pacific islands. And from their sacrifice we emerged the strongest and most prosperous nation in the history of the world. And this year, as we mark the 60th anniversary of the end of the fighting in Korea, we pay special tribute to all those who served in the Korean war. <p>From the jungles of Vietnam to Desert Storm, to the mountains of the Balkans, they have answered America's call. And since America was attacked on that clear September morning, millions more have assumed that mantle, defining one of the greatest generations of military service this country has ever produced. <p>On tour after tour after tour in Iraq and Afghanistan, this generation&mdash;the 9/11 generation&mdash;has met every mission we have asked of them. And today we can say that because of their heroic service, the core of Al Qaida is on the path to defeat, our Nation is more secure, and our homeland is safer. <p>They're men and women like the soldier&mdash;and soon to be veteran&mdash;I met a few months ago, Jacare Hogan. Jacare deployed to Iraq twice, and she survived not one, but two&mdash;excuse me, three&mdash;separate IED explosions. And when she was well enough, she deployed again, this time to Afghanistan, where she was often the only woman at our forward operating bases. She proudly wears the Combat Action Badge. And today, Jacare is committed to helping other wounded warriors recover from the trials of war. \\"Helping the troops,\\" she says, \\"is what I'm all about.\\" And, my fellow Americans, that's what we should be all about. <p>Our work is more urgent than ever, because this chapter of war is coming to an end. Soon, one of the first marines to arrive in Afghanistan 12 years ago, Brigadier General Daniel Yoo, will lead his Camp Pendleton marines as they become one of the last major groups of marines to deploy in this war. And over the coming months, more of our troops will come home. This winter, our troop levels in Afghanistan will be down to 34,000. And by this time next year, the transition to Afghan-led security will be nearly complete. The longest war in American history will end. <p>As is true after every conflict, there's a risk that the devoted service of our veterans could fade from the forefront of our minds, that we might turn to other things. But part of the reason we're here today is to pledge that we will never forget the profound sacrifices that are made in our name. Today reminds us of our sacred obligations. For even though this time of war is coming to a close, our time of service to our newest veterans has only just begun. <p>Think about it: Our troops wear the uniform for a time, yet they wear another proud title, the title of \\"veteran,\\" for decades, for the rest of their lives. As a nation, we make sure we have the best led, best trained, best equipped military in the world. We have to devote just as much energy and passion to making sure we have the best cared for, best treated, best respected veterans in the world. <p>So when we talk about fulfilling our promises to our veterans, we don't just mean for a few years, we mean now, tomorrow, and forever, and not just for generations past, but for this generation of veterans and all who will follow. <p>And that's why, as Commander in Chief, I'm going to keep making sure we're providing unprecedented support to our veterans. Even as we make difficult fiscal choices as a nation, we're going to keep making vital investments in our veterans. We're going to keep improving veterans health care, including mental health care so you can stay strong. We're making sure that veterans not covered by the VA can secure quality, affordable health insurance. <p>We're going to keep reducing the claims backlog. We've slashed it by a third since March, and we're going to keep at it so you can get the benefits that you have earned and that you need, when you need them. We're going to keep helping our newest veterans and their families pursue their education under the post-9/11 GI bill. We just welcomed our 1 millionth student veteran, and we're ready for all those who come next. <p>And we're going to keep demanding that the rights and dignity of every veteran are upheld, including by pushing for the Disabilities Treaty so that our disabled veterans enjoy the same opportunities to travel and work and study around the world as everybody else. And with the help of Michelle and Dr. Jill Biden and Joining Forces, we're going to keep fighting to give every veteran who has fought for America the chance to pursue the American Dream, a fair shot at the jobs and opportunity you need to help us rebuild and grow here at home. Because you're bringing home the skills and the work ethic and leadership necessary to start companies and serve your communities and take care of your fellow veterans. <p>And that's our promise to you and all who have served: to be there, to support you, when you come home, every step of the way. And as a nation, we will strive to be worthy of the sacrifices that you've made. That's what we owe all our veterans. That's what we owe veterans like Richard Overton, who served in the Army in World War II. He was there, at&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;now, everybody, I want you to know a little something about Mr. Overton here. He was there at Pearl Harbor, when the battleships were still smoldering. He was there at Okinawa. He was there at Iwo Jima, where he said, \\"I only got out of there by the grace of God.\\" <p>When the war ended, Richard headed home to Texas to a nation bitterly divided by race. And his service on the battlefield was not always matched by the respect that he deserved at home. But this veteran held his head high. He carried on and lived his life with honor and dignity. He built his wife a house with his own two hands. He went back to work in the furniture business. In time, he served as a courier in the Texas State Capitol, where he worked for four Governors and made more friends than most of us do in a lifetime. <p>And today, Richard still lives in the house that he built all those years ago. He rakes his own lawn. And every Sunday he hops in his 1971 Ford truck and drives one of the nice ladies in his neighborhood to church. [<i>Laughter</i>] So this is the life of one American veteran, living proud and strong in the land he helped keep free. <p>And earlier this year, the great folks at Honor Flight Austin brought Richard to Washington, DC, for the first time. And he and his fellow veterans paid their respects at the World War II Memorial. And then they visited the memorial to Martin Luther King, Jr. And as Richard sat in a wheelchair beneath that great marble statue, he wept. And the crowd that gathered around him wept too to see one of the oldest living veterans of World War II bear witness to a day&mdash;to the progress of a nation&mdash;he thought might never come. <p>Richard Overton, this American veteran, is 107 years old. And we are honored that he's here with us today. So let's ask Richard to stand again, because he can stand. <p>And this is how we'll be judged: not just by how well we care for our troops in battle, but how we treat them when they come home, and by the America we build together; by what we do with the security and peace that they have helped grant us; by the progress that allows citizens from Richard Overton to Jacare Hogan to play their part in the American story. <p>Today our message to all those who have ever worn the uniform of this Nation is this: We will stand by your side, whether you're 7 days out or, like Richard, 70 years out. Because here in America, we take care of our own. We honor the sacrifices that has been made in our name, for this Nation that we love. And we commit ourselves to standing by these veterans and their families, for as long as we're blessed to walk this Earth. <p>God bless you all. God bless our veterans. God bless our men and women in uniform. And God bless these United States of America. Thank you.\" "
"242" "\"Thank you, everybody. Everybody, please, have a seat. Thank you, Karen, for the kind introduction. <p>A couple of people I want to introduce, or at least acknowledge. First of all, give it up for our outstanding new Secretary of the Interior, Sally Jewell. We're joined by several other members of my Cabinet, which reflects how much my administration values your partnership, the partnership with your communities. I want to thank the Members of Congress who are here. <p>I want to give, also, a special shout-out to one of my closest advisers, one of my oldest friends. But he's also a great friend to all of you, and he doesn't get a lot of credit, because he hates credit. He just likes to work behind the scenes. But he worked with many of you when he worked in the Senate. He has been a key adviser on Native American affairs for me throughout this process, and I could not be prouder of him: Mr. Pete Rouse. So give Mr. Pete Rouse a big round of applause. <p>Now, most of all, I want to thank all of you, especially the tribal leaders who are here today. And I understand, actually, we've got more tribal leaders here than we ever have at any of these conferences. So it just keeps on growing each year, which is wonderful news. You represent more than 300 tribal nations, each of you with your own extraordinary heritage, each a vital part of a shared American family. And as a proud adopted member of the Crow Nation, let me say <i>kahe&eacute;</i>&mdash;welcome&mdash;to all of you. <p>Now, after I became President, I said that, given the painful chapters and broken promises in our shared history, I'd make sure this country kept its promises to you. I promised that tribal nations would have a stronger voice in Washington, that as long as I was in the White House, it would be your house too. And for the past 5 years, my administration has worked hard to keep that promise, to build a new relationship with you based on trust and respect. <p>And this new relationship wasn't just about learning from the past. It was also about the here and now, recognizing the contributions that your communities make to enrich the United States every single day. Native Americans are doctors and teachers and business men and women and veterans and servicemembers. And they get up every morning and help make America stronger and more prosperous and more just. <p>And I want to build on our true government-to-government relationship as well. So I'm proud to have Native Americans serving with dedication in my administration, including Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs Kevin Washburn of the Chickasaw Nation; my Senior Adviser for Native American Affairs, Jodi Gillette of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe; our Governmental [Intergovernmental; White House correction.] Affairs office, we've got Charlie Galbraith of the Navajo Nation. And I look forward to&mdash;so they worked so incredibly hard to make this conference possible, and I look forward to it every year. <p>I had the privilege of some of you coming to the White House yesterday. As we made clear in the Executive order earlier this year that established the White House Council on Native American Affairs, we have a unique legal and political relationship, one that's been affirmed many times in treaties, in statutes, and in the Constitution. <p>That's the unique relationship we honor today. That's the relationship we're called upon to sustain for the progress of all of our peoples. And while we should be proud of what we've achieved together in recent years, we also should be focused on all the work that we still have to do. <p>I know we've got members of the Iroquois Nations here today. And I think we could learn from the Iroquois Confederacy, just as our Founding Fathers did when they laid the groundwork for our democracy. The Iroquois called their network of alliances with other tribes and European nations a \\"covenant chain.\\" Each link represented a bond of peace and friendship. But that covenant chain didn't sustain itself. It needed constant care so that it would stay strong. And that's what we're called to do, to keep the covenant between us for this generation and for future generations. And there are four areas in particular where I think we need to focus. <p>First, let's keep our covenant strong by strengthening justice and tribal sovereignty. We've worked with you in good faith to resolve longstanding disputes like establishing the Land Buy-Back Program to consolidate Indian lands and restore them to tribal trust lands. We've reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act so tribes can prosecute those who commit domestic violence in Indian Country, whether they're Native American or not. I signed changes to the Stafford Act, to let tribes directly request disaster assistance, because when disasters like floods or fires strike, you shouldn't have to wait for a middleman to get the help you need. <p>But there's more we can do to return more control to your communities. And that's why I'm urging Congress to reauthorize the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act, because your communities know your affordable housing needs better than Washington does. It's why we'll keep pushing Congress to pass the Carcieri fix, so that more tribal nations can put their land into Federal trust. And we've heard loud and clear your frustrations when it comes to the problem of being fully reimbursed by the Federal Government for the contracted services you provide, so we're going to keep working with you and Congress to find a solution. That's all going to be part of making sure that we're respecting the nation-to-nation relationship. <p>Now, second, we've got to keep our covenant strong by expanding opportunity for Native Americans. We've created jobs building new roads and high-speed Internet to connect more of your communities to the broader economy. We've made major investments in job training and tribal colleges and universities. But the fact remains, Native Americans face poverty rates that are higher by far than the national average. And that's more than a statistic, that's a moral call to action. We've got to do better. <p>So I said to some of you that I met with yesterday, growing our economy, creating new jobs is my top priority. We've got to stop the self-inflicted wounds in Washington. Because for many tribal nations, this year's harmful sequester cuts and last month's Government shutdown made a tough situation worse. Your schools, your police departments, child welfare offices are all feeling the squeeze. That's why I'm fighting for a responsible budget that invests in the things that we need in order to grow, things like education, and job training, and affordable housing and transportation, including for Native American communities. And we're going to work to make sure Native American-owned businesses have greater access to capital and to selling their goods overseas. So we've got to build the economy, create more opportunity. <p>Number three, we've got to keep our covenant strong by making sure Native Americans have access to quality, affordable health care just like everybody else. That's one of the reasons we fought hard to pass the Affordable Care Act, and we're working overtime to make sure the law works the way it's supposed to. For Native Americans, this means more access to comprehensive, affordable coverage. It permanently reauthorizes the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, which provides care to so many in your communities. <p>And let me just give you one example of how this law is already working for tribal nations. Thanks to the ACA, the Puyallup Tribal Health Authority in Washington State created the country's first tribal family medicine residency program. Patients are cared for in a culturally sensitive way, often by Native American staff. And we're seeing results: a young physician caring for a revered tribal elder; a doctor who has delivered babies in the community for years, and now his son is also doing the same. And that's creating more quality health care, but also sustaining bonds between generations. That's progress that we need to build on. <p>And then the fourth area that we've got to work on is, let's keep our covenant strong by being good stewards of native homelands, which are sacred to you and your families. I saw the beauty of Crow Agency, Montana, when I was a candidate for this office. Next year, I'll make my first trip to Indian Country as President. <p>The health of tribal nations depends on the health of tribal lands. So it falls on all of us to protect the extraordinary beauty of those lands for future generations. And already, many of your lands have felt the impacts of a changing climate, including more extreme flooding and droughts. That's why, as part of the climate action plan I announced this year, my administration is partnering with you to identify where your lands are vulnerable to climate change, how we can make them more resilient. <p>And working together, we want to develop the energy potential of tribal lands in a responsible way and in accordance with tribal wishes. Over the last 4 years, we've more than doubled oil and gas revenues on tribal lands, a big reason why the United States is now more energy independent. So we're working with tribes to get more renewable energy projects, like solar and wind, up and running. Because your lands and your economies can be a source of renewable energy and the good local jobs that come with it. <p>So standing up for justice and tribal sovereignty, increasing economic opportunity; expanding quality health care, protecting native homelands&mdash;this is the foundation we can build on. This is the progress that we can make together. <p>And we don't have to look far for inspiration. Some of you know, Monday obviously was Veterans Day, a time to honor all who have worn America's uniform. I know everyone here is proud that Native Americans have such a high enlistment rate in our military. And we've seen generations of patriotic Native Americans who have served with honor and courage. <p>We draw strength from the Navajo code talkers whose skill helped win the Second World War. We draw strength from Woodrow Wilson Keeble, who many years after his death was finally awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism in the Korean War. We draw strength from&mdash;and I want to make sure I get this right&mdash;Lori Piestewa, who during the Iraq war was the first known Native American woman to give her life in combat for the United States. And we draw strength from all our men and women in uniform today, including two pilots I rely on when I step onto Marine One&mdash;Major Paul Bisulca, from the Penobscot Nation, and Major Eli Jones, of the Shoshone Bannock. And those guys are carrying me around, keeping me safe. <p>So on this Veterans Day week, even though it's technically not Veterans Day, I want to ask all the veterans in the audience&mdash;including several legendary Navajo code talkers who are here&mdash; if you can, please stand, accept our gratitude. <p>For generations, these men and women have helped keep our covenant strong. So now we've got to keep strong what they've built, for this and generations to come. It falls to us to keep America the place where no matter where you come from, what you look like, you can always make it as long as you try, as long as you work hard. And I know that that's what&mdash;all of you are working hard. That's what you represent as leaders of the communities that are represented here from coast to coast. I want you to know, that's what I'm working for. That's the partnership that I cherish, and I will cherish as long as I have the honor of serving as your President. <p>So thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you.\" "
"243" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hey! Hello, Ohio! Well, it is good to be back in Cleveland. The last time I was here was about a year ago, in the final days of the campaign. I know how much you miss hearing how I approve this message every night on TV. [<i>Laughter</i>] I will say it is nice to be here when the only real battle for Ohio is the Browns-Bengals game this Sunday. He's got the Browns shirt right here, Browns cap. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member.</i> Yes, sir! <p><i>The President</i>. The&mdash;I want to thank Scotty for that terrific introduction. Give him a big round of applause. He was a natural. I want to thank your CEO, Lakshmi Mittal, for investing in America and the Cleveland area. We appreciate him. And I want to thank all of you for having me here today. <p>Along with me, there are a couple of people I just want to acknowledge. First of all, America's Secretary of Energy, Ernie Moniz, is here. Right there. And Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur is here. Give Marcy a big round of applause. Fighting for working people every day. <p>And earlier this afternoon I had a chance to see your mayor, Frank Jackson; your county executive, Ed FitzGerald. And I want&mdash;even though they're not here, I want to thank them for the great work they're doing on behalf of working people throughout the region. <p>And then finally, I want to thank Mark and Gary for showing me one of the biggest steel plants in America. They told me that folks are proud to have been making steel right here for a century&mdash;a hundred years&mdash;right here. And they explained that, today, you&mdash;the steel you make is some of the strongest you'll find anywhere in the world. This is one of the most productive plants in the world. Best workers in the world. <p>And what's remarkable is, when you think about it, go back to where this plant was just a few years ago: Economy was in a free fall, auto industry on the brink of collapse. And that meant demand for steel had dried up. The blast furnaces went quiet. About 1,200 steelworkers punched out for what might have been the last time. And that all came at the end of a decade when the middle class was already working harder and harder just to get by and nearly one in three American manufacturing jobs had vanished, a lot of them going overseas. And that could have devastated this community for good. <p>But we rolled up our sleeves, we made some tough choices. We rescued and retooled the American auto industry; it saved more than a million jobs. We bet on American ingenuity and American workers. And assembly lines started humming again, and automakers started to make cars again. And just a few months after this plant shut down, your plant manager got the call: Fire those furnaces back up, get those workers back on the job. And over the last 4 years, you've made yourselves one of the most productive steel mills not just in America, but in the world. [<i>Applause</i>] In the world. <p>So you retooled to make the strongest steel that goes into newer, better American cars and trucks. You created new partnerships with schools and community colleges to make sure that folks who work here have the high skill&mdash;high-tech skills they need for the high-tech jobs, because I was looking around this factory, and there's a whole bunch of computer stuff going on and&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>One of your engineers&mdash;and I want to make sure I get Margaret's name right here&mdash;Margaret Krolikowski. Did I get that right, Margaret? Where's Margaret? Where is she? There is she is back there. So I'm going to quote you, I'm going to quote you. Here's what Margaret said: \\"When we came back, we wanted to make sure we were in a position where we never shut down again.\\" Never shut down again. And that means making sure that workers here are constantly upgrading their skills and investments being made in the state-of-the-art technology. <p>And it was interesting, when I was meeting a number of the folks who were giving me the tour&mdash;folks who have been here 30 years, 40 years&mdash;but obviously, the plant has changed, and so during that period, they've had to upgrade their skills. That's what's happened. And that&mdash;and the story of this plant is the story of America over the last 5 years. We haven't just been recovering from a crisis, what we've been trying to do is rebuild a new foundation for growth and prosperity to protect ourselves from future crises. And because of the grit and resilience and optimism of the American people, we're seeing comeback stories like yours all across America. <p>Over the last 44 months, our businesses have created 7.8 million new jobs. Last month, another 200,000 Americans went back to work. And a lot of those jobs are in manufacturing. So now we've got to do more to get those engines of the economy churning even faster. But because we've been willing to do some hard things&mdash;not just kick the can down the road&mdash; factories are reopening their doors, businesses are hiring new workers, companies that were shipping jobs overseas, they're starting to talk about bringing those jobs back to America. We're starting to see that. <p>And let me give you an example, because we were talking about this; Mr. Mittal and others were talking about what's different now. Take a look at what we've done with American energy. For years, folks have talked about reducing our dependence on foreign oil, but we didn't really do it. And we were just importing more and more oil, sending more and more money overseas. Gas prices keep on going up and up and up. We finally decided we were going to do something about it. <p>So we invested in new American technologies to reverse our addiction to foreign oil, double wind power, double solar power, produce more oil, produce more natural gas, and do it all in a way that is actually bringing down some of our pollution, making our entire economy more energy efficient. Today, we generate more renewable energy than ever. We produce more natural gas than anybody in the world. Just yesterday we learned that for the first time since 1995, the United States of America produces more of our own oil here at home than we buy from other countries. [<i>Applause</i>] First time since 1995. And that's a big deal. That's what America has done these past 5 years. <p>And that is a huge competitive advantage for us. Part of the reason companies now want to move&mdash;we were just talking about it&mdash;this plant, if it's located in Germany, energy costs are double, maybe triple; same in Japan. So this gives us a big edge. But this is also important: We reached the milestone not just because we're producing more energy, but also, we're wasting less energy. And this plant's a good example of it. We set new fuel standards that double the distance our cars and trucks go on a gallon of gas by the middle of the next decade. That saves the average driver&mdash;everybody here&mdash;more than $8,000 at the pump over the life of a new car. You like that? [<i>Applause</i>] We launched initiatives to put people to work upgrading our homes, and our businesses, and our factories so we're wasting less energy. All that saves businesses money on their energy bills. Your plant is one of the hundreds to answer that call. And if you're saving money on energy costs, that means you can invest in equipment, invest in workers, hire more people, produce more product. <p>And here's another thing: Between more clean energy, less wasted energy, the carbon pollution that's helping to warm the planet, that actually starts going down. And that's good news for anybody who cares about leaving a planet to our kids that is as beautiful as the one we got from our parents and our grandparents. So it's a win-win. Our economy keeps growing, creating new jobs, which means that strengthening our energy security and increasing energy efficiency doesn't have to be a choice between the environment and the economy. We can do both.<p>So we've tackled the way we use energy. That's making America more competitive in order to attract good jobs. We've also tackled our deficits. A lot of people have been concerned about deficits. Since I took office, we cut them in half. That makes America more attractive when it comes to business investment decisions. <p>And we've tackled a broken health care system. Obviously, we're not done yet. [<i>Applause</i>] Obviously, we're not done yet. But over the last 3 years, health care costs have grown at the slowest pace on record. And this is a great place to work thanks to a great steelworkers union and cooperation between management and labor. But just keep in mind that if businesses' health care costs are growing at about one-third the rate that they were a decade ago, that makes America a more affordable place to do business, and it also means that the investors here, if they're putting less money into health care costs, they can put more money in terms of hiring more workers and making sure that they're getting good pay. <p>So that's what all these tough decisions are about: Reversing the forces that have hurt the middle class for a long, long time and building an economy where anybody, if you work hard, you can get ahead. That's what plants like this have always been about. It's not that it's easy work. But it means if you work hard, you've got a chance to buy a home, you've got a chance to retire, you've got a chance to send your kids to school, you have a chance to maybe take a little vacation once in a while. That's what people strive for. And that's what will make the 21st century an American century, just like the last century was. <p>But I didn't run for President to go back to where we were. I want us to go forward. I want us to go towards the future. I want us to get us to where we need to be. I want to solve problems, not just put them off. I want to solve problems. And we've got to do more to create more good, middle class jobs like the ones folks have here. <p>That means we've got to do everything we can to prepare our children and our workers for the competition that they're going to face. We should be doing everything we can to help put some sort of advanced education within reach for more young people. Not everybody has got to go to a 4-year college, but just looking at the equipment around here, you've got to have a little bit of advanced training. It may come through a community college, or it may come through a technical school, but we've got to make sure you can get that education, your kids can get that education, without going broke&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;without going broke, without going into debt. So we're working on that. <p>Another thing we should be working on: fixing a broken immigration system. When you think about this whole region, a lot of folks forget, but almost everybody who worked in that plant a hundred years ago came from someplace else. And so we've got now a new generation of hopeful, striving immigrants; we've got to make sure that they come legally and that we do what we need to secure our borders, but we've also got to make sure that we're providing them opportunity just like your parents, grandparents, great-grandparents received when they arrived at this plant. And that's important. And by the way, it will help our economy grow, because then they're paying taxes and helping to invest and build here in America. <p>We should do everything we can to revitalize American manufacturing. Manufacturing is&mdash;that's the hub of our economy. When our manufacturing base is strong, the entire economy is strong. A lot of service jobs depend on servicing manufacturing jobs. And typically, manufacturing jobs pay a little bit better. So that's been a path, a ticket to the middle class. So when we make steel and cars, make them here in America, that helps. Like I said, work may be hard, but it gives you enough money to buy a home and raise a kid, retire and send your kids to school. <p>And those kinds of jobs also tell us something else. It's not just how much you get in your paycheck, it's also a sense of, \\"I'm making something, and I'm helping to build this country.\\" It helps establish a sense of&mdash;that we're invested in this country. It tells us what we're worth as a community. One of your coworkers, Mike Longa&mdash;where's Mike? <p><i>Audience member.</i> Right here. <p><i>The President.</i> Is he back here? That's Mike right there. Mike grew up here. His mom and dad worked at this plant. This plant helped put Mike and four brothers and/or sisters through college. And once this plant started growing again, Mike got his chance to be a steelworker here and provide for his own two young kids. So it's a generational thing, and I want to keep that going. <p>In my State of the Union Address, I talked about how we created America's first manufacturing innovation institute right here in Ohio. Marcy Kaptur has been a big proponent of this because she knows how important manufacturing is. I want to create more of them: places where businesses are working with universities and they're partnering to figure out what are the new manufacturing techniques that keep us at the cutting edge so that China or Germany don't get ahead of us in terms of the equipment that's being invested. We want to be at the cutting edge so what we're producing is always the best steel, it's always the best cars. But that requires research and investment. <p>And your Senator Sherrod Brown helped us to create that first manufacturing hub in Youngstown. And he's now leading a bipartisan effort with Senator Blunt of Missouri to move more of these manufacturing innovation hubs all across the country. And Congress should pass Sherrod's bill. We should be doing everything we can to guarantee the next revolution in manufacturing happens right here in Cuyahoga, happens right here in Ohio, happens right here in America. <p>And let me make one last point. We have to do everything we can to make sure every American has access to quality, affordable health care, period. You may have read, we had some problems last month with web sites. I'm not happy about that. And then I had a press conference today, and I said, you know what, we fumbled the ball in terms of the rollout. <p>But we always knew this was going to be hard. There's a reason why folks had tried to do it for a hundred years and hadn't done it. And it's complicated. There are a lot of players involved. The status quo is entrenched. And so yes, there's no question, the rollout on the Affordable Care Act was much tougher than we expected. But I want everybody here to understand, I am going to see this through. I want millions of Americans to make sure that they're not going broke when they get sick and they can go to a doctor when their kid gets sick. And we're not apologizing for that. We are going to get this done. <p>So we're going to get the web site working the way it's supposed to. The plans are already out there that are affordable, and people can get tax credits. We're going to help folks whose old plans have been canceled by the insurers&mdash;many of them weren't very good&mdash;and we're going to make sure that they can get newer, better options. <p>But we're not going to go back to the old system because the old system was broken. And every year, thousands of Americans would get dropped by&mdash;dropped from coverage or denied their medical history or exposed to financial ruin. You guys are lucky that you work at a company with a strong union that gives you good health benefits. But you know friends and family members who don't have it, and you know what it's like when they get sick. You know what it's&mdash;how scary it is for them when they get sick. Or some of them have health insurance&mdash;they think they do&mdash;and they get sick, and suddenly, the insurance company says: \\"Oh, I'm sorry, you owe $50,000. That's not covered.\\" Or they jack up your premium so you can't afford it because you had some sort of preexisting condition. That happens every day. <p>So we're not going to let that happen. We're not going to let folks who pay their premiums on time get jerked around. And we're not going to walk away from the 40 million Americans without health insurance. We are not going to gut this law. We will fix what needs to be fixed, but we're going to make the Affordable Care Act work. And those who say they're opposed to it and can't offer a solution, we'll push back. <p>I got to give your Governor a little bit of credit. John Kasich, along with a lot of State legislators who are here today, they expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. And think about that. Just that one step means as many as 275,000 Ohioans are going to have health insurance. And it doesn't depend on a web site. That's already happening because of the Affordable Care Act. <p>And I think it's fair to say that the Governor didn't do it because he just loves me so much. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, we don't agree on much, but he saw: well, this makes sense. Why wouldn't we do this? Why wouldn't we make sure that hundreds of thousands of people right here in Ohio have some security? It was the right thing to do. And by the way, if every Republican Governor did what Kasich did here rather than play politics about it, you'd have another 5.4 million Americans who could get access to health care next year, regardless of what happens with the web site. That's their decision not to do it. And it's the wrong decision. They've got to go ahead and sign folks up. <p>So the bottom line is, sometimes, we just have to set aside the politics and focus on what's good for people. What's good to grow our middle class? What's going to help keep plants like this growing? What's going to make sure we're putting more people back to work? What's going to really make a difference in terms of our kids getting a great education? <p>And look, we've done it before. That's the good news. The good news is that America is&mdash;look, we make mistakes. We have our differences. Our politics get screwed up sometimes. Web sites don't work sometimes. [<i>Laughter</i>] But we just keep going. <p><i>Audience members</i>. That's right. <p><i>The President</i>. We didn't become the greatest nation on Earth by accident. We did it because we did what it took to make sure our families could succeed, make sure our businesses could succeed, make sure our communities could succeed. And if you don't believe me, listen to one of your coworkers. <p>So Sherrod Brown, earlier this year, brought a special guest along with him to the State of the Union Address, one of your coworkers, Cookie Hall. Where's Cookie? Is Cookie here? <p><i>Audience member.</i> No, she's back at the hall. <p><i>The President.</i> She's back at the hall working. [<i>Laughter</i>] Well, let me say something nice about her behind her back. [<i>Laughter</i>] So Cookie said, one of&mdash;let me make sure I can find this. She said&mdash;that night she said: \\"If I get a chance to meet President Obama, I'll tell him my greatest pride is in our 12,000&mdash;2012 production record at Cleveland Works. We're the most productive steelworkers in the world.\\" More than a ton of steel produced for every single one of the workers at this plant. That's pretty good. [<i>Applause</i>] That's pretty good. <p>So all of you are an example of what we do when we put our minds to it. This plant was closed for a while. We go through hard times. And a lot of our friends are still going through hard times. But when we work at it, we know we can get to a better place, and we can restore some security to a middle class that was forged in plants just like this one and keep giving ladders of opportunity for folks who were willing to work hard to get into the middle class. That's what I'm about. That's what this plant is about. I'm proud to be with you. <p>And as long as I have the honor of being your President, I'm going to be waking up every single day thinking about how I can keep on helping folks like the ones who work in this plant. <p>God bless you. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. Thank you.\" "
"244" "\"Well, I want to welcome the executives who are here from a lot of the insurance companies that are participating in the marketplace. We all share a similar value, which is, we want to make sure that Americans have good, solid coverage that gives them the security they need for themselves and their family members if and when they get sick. <p>And we know the demand is out there for that. We had, despite all the problems with the web site, over a million people apply. Many multiples of that wanted to see what options were available. Obviously, because of the problems with the web site, some folks have been blocked from seeing the well-priced benefits that are available in the marketplace, and so we're working 24/7 to get it fixed. The web site is working a lot better now than it was a couple of weeks ago. <p>And what we're going to be doing is brainstorming on how do we make sure that everybody understands what their options are. Because of choice and competition, a whole lot of Americans who have always seen health insurance out of risk&mdash;or out of reach are going to be in a position to purchase it. And because of the law, we're also going to be able to provide them help even if they are still having trouble purchasing that insurance. But they've got to know what those options are in order to be successful. <p>So I appreciate all these folks coming in. We're going to be soliciting ideas from them. This is going to be a collaborative process. We want to make sure that we get this done so that in the years to come, every American is going to have the kind of affordable health care that they all deserve. <p>Thank you very much for being here. Appreciate you guys.\" "
"245" "\"Hi, everybody. On Thursday, I visited a steel plant in Cleveland, Ohio, to talk about what we're doing to rebuild our economy on a new foundation for stronger, more durable economic growth. One area where we've made great progress is American energy. After years of talk about reducing our dependence on foreign oil, we are actually poised to control our own energy future. <p>Shortly after I took office, we invested in new American technologies to reverse our dependence on foreign oil and double our wind and solar power. And today, we generate more renewable energy than ever, with tens of thousands of good, American jobs to show for it. We produce more natural gas than anyone, and nearly everyone's energy bill is lower because of it. And just this week, we learned that for the first time in nearly two decades, the United States of America now produces more of our own oil here at home than we buy from other countries. <p>That's a big deal. That's a tremendous step towards American energy independence. <p>But this is important too: We reached this milestone in part not only because we're producing more energy, but because we're wasting less energy. We set new fuel standards for our cars and trucks so that they'll go twice as far on a gallon of gas by the middle of the next decade. That's going to save an average driver more than $8,000 at the pump over the life of a new car. We also launched initiatives to put people to work upgrading our homes, businesses, and factories so that they waste less energy. That's going to save our businesses money on their energy bills. And that's money they can use to hire more workers. <p>Here's another thing. Between more clean energy and less wasted energy, our emissions of dangerous carbon pollution are actually falling. That's good news for anyone who cares about the world we leave to our kids. <p>And while our carbon emissions have been dropping, our economy has been growing. Our businesses have created 7.8 million new jobs in the past 44 months. It proves that the old argument that we can't strengthen the economy and be good stewards of our planet at the same time is a false choice. We can do both. And we have to do both. <p>More good jobs. Cheaper and cleaner sources of energy. A secure energy future. Thanks to the grit and resilience of American businesses and the American people, that's where we're heading. And as long as I'm President, that's where we're going to keep heading: to leave our children a stronger economy and a safer planet. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"246" "\"<i>The President.</i> Good morning! Good morning, everybody! Everybody, please have a seat. Have a seat. <p>Well, on behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the White House. This is one of my favorite events every year, especially special this year, as I look at this extraordinary group of individuals and our opportunity to honor them with our Nation's highest civilian honor: the Presidential Medal of Freedom. <p>And this year, it's just a little more special because this marks the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy establishing this award. We're honored, by the way, today to have with us one of my favorite people, Ethel Kennedy, and a pretty good basketball player, President Kennedy's grandson Jack. <p>Now, this medal has been bestowed on more than 500 deserving people. Tonight I'm looking forward to joining some of these honorees, as well as members of the Kennedy family, as we pay tribute to these 50 years of excellence. And this morning we're honored to add 16 new names to this distinguished list. <p>Today we salute fierce competitors who became true champions. In the sweltering heat of a Chicago summer, Ernie Banks walked into the Cubs locker room and didn't like what he saw. \\"Everybody was sitting around, heads down, depressed,\\" he recalled. So Ernie piped up and said: \\"Boy, what a great day! Let's play two!\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] That's \\"Mr. Cub,\\" a man who came up through the Negro Leagues, making $7 a day, and became the first Black player to suit up for the Cubs and one of the greatest hitters of all time. And in the process, Ernie became known as much for his 512 home runs as for his cheer and his optimism and his eternal faith that someday, the Cubs would go all the way. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And that's serious belief. [<i>Laughter</i>] That is something that even a White Sox fan like me can respect. [<i>Laughter</i>] But he is just a wonderful man and a great icon of my hometown. <p>Speaking of sports, Dean Smith is one of the winningest coaches in college basketball history, but his successes go far beyond X's and O's. Even as he won 78 percent of his games, he graduated 96 percent of his players. The first coach to use multiple defenses in a game, he was the pioneer who popularized the idea of \\"pointing to the passer.\\" After a basket, players should point to the teammate who passed them the ball. And with his first national title on the line, he did have the good sense to give the ball to a 19-year-old kid named Michael Jordan. [<i>Laughter</i>] Although, they used to joke that the only person who ever held Michael under 20 was Dean Smith. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>While Coach Smith couldn't join us today due to an illness that he's facing with extraordinary courage, we also honor his courage in helping to change our country. He recruited the first Black scholarship athlete to North Carolina and helped to integrate a restaurant and a neighborhood in Chapel Hill. That's the kind of character that he represented on and off the court. <p>We salute innovators who pushed the limits of science, changing how we see the world and ourselves. And growing up, Sally Ride read about the space program in the newspaper almost every day, and she thought this was \\"the coolest thing around.\\" When she was a Ph.D. candidate at Stanford, she saw an ad for astronauts in the student newspaper, and she seized the opportunity. As the first American woman in space, Sally didn't just break the stratospheric glass ceiling, she blasted through it. And when she came back to Earth, she devoted her life to helping girls excel in fields like math, science, and engineering. \\"Young girls need to see role models,\\" she said. \\"You can't be what you can't see.\\" Today, our daughters&mdash;including Malia and Sasha&mdash;can set their sights a little bit higher because Sally Ride showed them the way. <p>Now, all of us have moments when we look back and wonder, \\"What the heck was I thinking?\\" I have that&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;quite a bit. Psychologist Daniel Kahneman has made that simple question his life's work. In a storied career in Israel and America, he basically invented the study of human decisionmaking. He's helped us to understand everything from behavioral economics to \\"Does living in California make people happy?\\" It's an interesting question. He's also been called an expert on irrational behavior, so I'm sure that he could shed some light on Washington. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But what truly sets Daniel apart is his curiosity. Guided by his belief that people are \\"endlessly complicated and interesting,\\" at 79, he's still discovering new insights into how we think and learn, not just so we understand each other, but so we can work and live together more effectively.&nbsp;<p>Dr. Mario Molina's love of science started as a young boy in Mexico City, in a homemade laboratory in a bathroom at home. And that passion for discovery led Mario to become one of the most respected chemists of his era. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize&mdash;or the Nobel Prize, rather, not only for his pathbreaking research, but also for his insistence that when we ignore dangerous carbon emissions, we risk destroying the ozone layer and endangering our planet. And thanks to Mario's work, the world came together to address a common threat, and today, inspired by his example, we're working to leave our planet safer and cleaner for future generations. <p>We also have to salute musicians, who bring such joy to our lives. Loretta Lynn was 19 the first time she won the big&mdash;she won big at the local fair. Her canned vegetables brought home 17 blue ribbons&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and made her \\"Canner of the Year.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Where's Loretta? Now, that's impressive. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>For a girl from Butcher Hollow, Kentucky, that was fame. Fortunately for all of us, she decided to try her hand at things other than canning. Her first guitar cost $17, and with it, this coal miner's daughter gave voice to a generation, singing what no one wanted to talk about and saying what no one wanted to think about. And now, over 50 years after she cut her first record&mdash;and canned her first vegetables&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;Loretta Lynn still reigns as the rule-breaking, record-setting queen of country music. <p>As a young man in Cuba, Arturo Sandoval loved jazz so much it landed him in jail. It was the cold war, and the only radio station where he could hear jazz was the Voice of America, which was dangerous to listen to. But Arturo listened anyway. Later, he defected to the United States knowing he might never see his parents or beloved homeland again. \\"Without freedom,\\" he said, \\"there is no life.\\" And today, Arturo is an American citizen and one of the most celebrated trumpet players in the world. \\"There isn't any place on Earth where the people don't know about jazz,\\" he says, and that's true in part because musicians like him have sacrificed so much to play it. <p>We salute pioneers who pushed our Nation towards greater justice and equality. A Baptist minister, C.T. Vivian was one of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s closest advisers. \\"Martin taught us,\\" he says, \\"that it's in the action that we find out who we really are.\\" And time and again, Reverend Vivian was among the first to be in the action: in 1947, joining a sit-in to integrate an Illinois restaurant; one of the first Freedom Riders; in Selma, on the courthouse steps to register Blacks to vote, for which he was beaten, bloodied, and jailed. Rosa Parks said of him, \\"Even after things had supposedly been taken care of and we had our rights, he was still out there, inspiring the next generation, including me,\\" helping kids go to college with a program that would become Upward Bound. And at 89 years old, Reverend Vivian is still out there, still in the action, pushing us closer to our founding ideals. <p>Now, early in the morning the day of the March on Washington, the National Mall was far from full and some in the press were beginning to wonder if the event would be a failure. But the march's chief organizer, Bayard Rustin, didn't panic. As the story goes, he looked down at a piece of paper, looked back up, and reassured reporters that everything was right on schedule. The only thing those reporters didn't know was that the paper he was holding was blank. [<i>Laughter</i>] He didn't know how it was going to work out, but Bayard had an unshakable optimism, nerves of steel, and most importantly, a faith that if the cause is just and people are organized, nothing can stand in our way. <p>So for decades, this great leader, often at Dr. King's side, was denied his rightful place in history because he was openly gay. No medal can change that, but today we honor Bayard Rustin's memory by taking our place in his march towards true equality, no matter who we are or who we love. <p>Speaking of game-changers, disrupters, there was a young girl named Gloria Steinem who arrived in New York to make her mark as a journalist, and magazines only wanted her to write articles like \\"How To Cook Without Really Cooking for Men.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Gloria noticed things like that. [<i>Laughter</i>] She's been called a \\"champion noticer.\\" She's alert to all the ways, large and small, that women had been and, in some cases, continue to be treated unfairly just because they're women. <p>As a writer, a speaker, an activist, she awakened a vast and often skeptical public to problems like domestic violence, the lack of affordable child care, unfair hiring practices. And because of her work across America and around the world, more women are afforded the respect and opportunities that they deserve. But she also changed how women thought about themselves. And Gloria continues to pour her heart into teaching and mentoring. Now, her one piece of advice to young girls is&mdash;I love this&mdash;\\"Do not listen to my advice. Listen to the voice inside you and follow that.\\" <p>When Patricia Wald's law firm asked if she'd come back after having her first child, she said she'd like some time off to focus on her family, devoted almost 10 years to raising 5 children. But Patricia never lost the itch to practice law. So while her husband watched the kids at home, she'd hit the library on weekends. At the age of 40, she went back to the courtroom to show the \\"young kids\\" a thing or two. As the first female judge on the DC Circuit, Patricia was a top candidate for Attorney General. After leaving the bench, her idea of retirement was to go to the Hague to preside over the trials of war criminals. Patricia says she hopes enough women will become judges that \\"it's not worth celebrating\\" anymore. But today we celebrate her. And along with Gloria, she shows there are all kinds of paths listening to your own voice. <p>We salute communicators who shined a light on stories no one else was telling. A veteran of World War II and more than a dozen Pacific battles, Ben Bradlee brought the same intensity and dedication to journalism. Since joining the Washington Post 65 years ago, he transformed that newspaper into one of the finest in the world. With Ben in charge, the Post published the Pentagon Papers, revealing the true history of America's involvement in Vietnam; exposed Watergate; unleashed a new era of investigative journalism, holding America's leaders accountable and reminding us that our freedom as a nation rests on our freedom of the press. When Ben retired, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan put the admiration of many into a poem: <p>O rare Ben Bradlee <p>His reign has ceased <p>But his nation stands <p>Its strength increased <p>And I also indicated to Ben, he can pull off those shirts, and I can't. [<i>Laughter</i>] He always looks so cool in them. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Early in Oprah Winfrey's career, her bosses told her she should change her name to Susie. [<i>Laughter</i>] I have to pause here to say I got the same advice. [<i>Laughter</i>] They didn't say I should be named \\"Susie,\\" but they suggested I should change my name. [<i>Laughter</i>] People can relate to Susie; that's what they said. It turned out, surprisingly, that people could relate to Oprah just fine. <p>In more than 4,500 episodes of her show, her message was always: \\"You can. You can do, and you can be, and you can grow, and it can be better.\\" And she was living proof, rising from a childhood of poverty and abuse to the pinnacle of the entertainment universe. But even with 40 Emmys, the distinction of being the first Black female billionaire, Oprah's greatest strength has always been her ability to help us discover the best in ourselves. Michelle and I count ourselves among her many devoted fans and friends. As one of those fans wrote, \\"I didn't know I had a light in me until Oprah told me it was there.\\" What a great gift. <p>And finally, we salute public servants who've strengthened our Nation. <p>Daniel Inouye was a humble man and didn't wear his Medal of Honor very often. Instead, he liked to wear a pin representing the Good Conduct Medal he earned as a teenage private. \\"To behave yourself takes special effort,\\" he said, \\"and I did not want to dishonor my family.\\" Danny always honored his family and his country, even when his country didn't always honor him. <p>After being classified as an enemy alien, Danny joined a Japanese American unit that became one of the most decorated in World War II. And as the second longest serving Senator in American history, he showed a generation of young people&mdash;including one kid with a funny name growing up in Hawaii who noticed that there was somebody, during some of those hearings in Washington, that didn't look like everybody else, which meant maybe I had a chance to do something important too&mdash;he taught all of us that no matter what you look like or where you come from, this country has a place for everybody who's willing to serve and work hard. <p>A proud Hoosier, Dick Lugar has served America for more than half a century, from a young Navy lieutenant to a respected leader in the United States Senate. I'll always be thankful to Dick for taking me&mdash;a new, junior Senator&mdash;under his wing, including travels together to review some of his visionary work, the destruction of cold war arsenals in the former Soviet Union, something that doesn't get a lot of public notice, but was absolutely critical to making us safer in the wake of the cold war. <p>Now, I should say, traveling with Dick, you get close to unexploded landmines, mortar shells, test tubes filled with anthrax and the plague. [<i>Laughter</i>] His legacy, though, is the thousands of missiles and bombers and submarines and warheads that no longer threaten us because of his extraordinary work. And our Nation and our world are safer because of this statesman. And in a time of unrelenting partisanship, Dick Lugar's decency, his commitment to bipartisan problem-solving, stand as a model of what public service ought to be.<p>Now, last, but never least, we honor a leader who we still remember with such extraordinary fondness. He still remembers as a child waving goodbye to his mom&mdash;tears in her eyes&mdash;as she went off to nursing school so she could provide for her family. And I think lifting up families like his own became the story of Bill Clinton's life. He remembered what his mom had to do on behalf of him, and he wanted to make sure that he made life better and easier for so many people all across the country that were struggling in those same ways and had those same hopes and dreams. So as a Governor, he transformed education so more kids could pursue those dreams. As President, he proved that, with the right choices, you could grow the economy, lift people out of poverty. We could shrink our deficits and still invest in our families, our health, our schools, science, technology. In other words, we can go farther when we look out for each other. <p>And as we've all seen, as President, he was just getting started. He doesn't stop. He's helped lead relief efforts after the Asian tsunami, Hurricane Katrina, the Haiti earthquake. His Foundation and Global Initiative have helped to save or improve the lives of literally hundreds of millions of people. And of course, I am most grateful for his patience during the endless travels of my Secretary of State. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So I'm grateful, Bill, as well for the advice and counsel that you've offered me on and off the golf course&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and most importantly, for your lifesaving work around the world, which represents what's the very best in America. So thank you so much, President Clinton. <p>So these are the recipients of the 2013 Presidential Medal of Freedom. These are the men and women who in their extraordinary lives remind us all of the beauty of the human spirit, the values that define us as Americans, the potential that lives inside of all of us. I could not be more happy and more honored to participate in this ceremony here today. <p>With that, what I would like to do is invite our honorees to just sit there and let all of us stand and give you a big round of applause. [<i>Applause</i>] <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hurray! <p><i>The President. </i>Hey! Hey! <p>All right. I guess we should actually give them the medals though. [<i>Laughter</i>] So where are my&mdash;here we go. Lee, you want to hit it? <p>[<i>At this point, Maj. S. Lee Meyer, USMC, Marine Aide to the President, read the citations, and the President presented the medals.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>]&mdash;the Medal of Freedom honorees, please. [<i>Applause</i>] Hey! <p>All right. Well, that concludes the formal part of today's ceremony. I want to thank all of you for being here. Obviously, we are deeply indebted to those who we honor here today. And we're going to have an opportunity to take some pictures with the honorees and their family members. <p>The rest of you, I understand, the food here is pretty good. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I hope you enjoy the reception, and I hope we carry away from this a reminder of what JFK understood to be the essence of the American spirit, that it's represented here. And some of us may be less talented, but we all have the opportunity to serve and to open people's hearts and minds in our smaller orbits. So I hope everybody has been as inspired, as I have been, participating and being with these people here today. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"247" "\"<i>The President.</i> Good evening, everybody. Please have a seat. Michelle and I are so pleased to join you tonight to honor the legacy of an American leader in a building dedicated to the preservation of our American history. <p>And we are thrilled to be joined by so many people whose accomplishments helped write new chapters in that history. This morning I recognized 16 brilliant, compassionate, wildly talented people with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian award. And that was intimidating enough. Tonight I'm facing dozens of you. <p>To the Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients of this year and years past, it is a great honor to be with you for this anniversary celebration. To Wayne Clough, thank you for hosting us and for all the Smithsonian does to enrich our cultural heritage. And to Jack, I have to say that our new Ambassador to Japan, I'm sure, would be pleased with how you performed this evening. I'll give her a full report. [<i>Laughter</i>] To all the family members of the Kennedy family, we are grateful for your presence and your enduring contributions to the life of our country. <p>For centuries, awards have existed for military valor. And 50 years ago, President John F. Kennedy established a way to award extraordinary civilian virtue: contributions to our country, service to our democracy, a dedication to our humanity that has advanced the common interest of freedom-loving people, both here at home and around the world. <p>Since its creation, the Presidential Medal of Freedom has paid tribute to the creativity of writers, and artists, and entertainers. We've recognized the leadership of elected officials and civil rights organizers, the imagination of scientists and business leaders, the grit and determination of our astronauts and our athletes. Because there is no one way to contribute to the success of America. What makes us great is that we believe in a certain set of values that encourage freedom of expression and aspiration. We celebrate imagination and education and occasional rebellion. And we refuse to set limits on what we can do or who we can be. <p>And other peoples in other times have marked their history by moments of conquest at war, by dominion over empires. But in the arc of human history, the American experience stands apart, because our triumph is not simply found in the exertion of our power, it's found in the example of our people. Our particular genius over 237 years has been something more than the sum of our individual excellence, but rather a culmination of our common endeavors. <p>It's a truth that resonated with President Kennedy when he said, \\". . . I am certain that after the dust of centuries has passed over our cities, we . . . will be remembered not for our victories or defeats in battle or in politics, but for our contribution to the human spirit.\\" <p>And that unbending belief that the power to make great a nation is found in its people and in their freedom, that was his philosophy. That is his legacy. <p>And it's a legacy told in villages around the world that have clean water or a new school and a steady friend in the United States, thanks to the volunteers of the Peace Corps. It's a legacy found in the courage of all who serve under our proud flag, willing, like President Kennedy himself, to pay any price and bear any burden for the survival and success of our liberty. <p>It's a legacy on display in the arts and culture that he and Jackie championed as part of our national character, a legacy planted on the Moon that he said that we'd visit and that we did, in the stars beyond, but also in the breakthroughs of the generations of scientists that his audacious promise inspired. <p>It's a legacy continued by his brothers and his sisters, who have left this a more gentle and compassionate country. Jean, a Medal of Freedom recipient herself and a diplomat in every sense, is with us tonight. Bobby, whose wife, Ethel is one of my dearest friends, as Jack noted, we'd be celebrating Bobby's 88th birthday today. Eunice and Pat were devoted advocates for Americans of all abilities. And Teddy, the youngest brother with the biggest heart, he was a happy warrior who never forgot who we were sent here to serve and waged a decades-long battle on behalf of those folks who sent us here: for workers' rights and immigrants' rights and the right to affordable health care. Tonight our sympathies are with the love of Teddy's life, Vicki, as she mourns the loss of her father, Judge Edmund Reggie. <p>And it's all told a legacy of service that the Kennedy family continues to this day: from Caroline, who's already drawing crowds of her own as she settles into her role as Ambassador in Japan; to his great-nephew, and Massachusetts' newest Congressman, Joe Kennedy; to the school of public service that bears the family name and teaches its young leaders how they too might one day pass the torch to a new generation. <p>This is a legacy of a man who could have retreated to a life of luxury and ease, but who chose to live a life in the arena, sailing sometimes against the wind, sometimes with it. And that's why, 50 years later, John F. Kennedy stands for posterity as he did in life: young and bold and daring. And he stays with us in our imagination not because he left us too soon, but because he embodied the character of the people that he led: resilient, resolute; fearless and fun-loving; defiant in the face of impossible odds; and most of all, determined to make the world anew, not settling for what is, but rather for what might be. And in his idealism&mdash;his sober, square-jawed idealism&mdash;we are reminded that the power to change this country is ours. <p>This afternoon Michelle and I were joined by President Clinton and Secretary Clinton to pay tribute to that proud legacy. We had a chance to lay a wreath at the gravesite at Arlington, where President Kennedy is surrounded by his wife and younger brothers, and where he will rest in peace for all time, remembered not just for his victories in battle or in politics, but for the words he uttered all those years ago: \\"We will be remembered for our contribution to the human spirit.\\" <p>How blessed we are to live in a country where these contributions overflow in ways both heralded and not so heralded. The thousands of people in San Francisco who helped a little boy recovering from cancer live out his superhero dreams, that's part of that spirit. The Marines deploying relief after a devastating typhoon and all across an ocean, people checking on their neighbors after a tornado, the families across the country who will spend Thanksgiving Day cooking feasts so others less fortunate might eat&mdash;that's part of the spirit. <p>That's who we are: a people whose greatness comes not by settling for what we can achieve in our own lives, but also because we dare to ask what we can do, as citizens, to contribute to this grand experiment we call America. <p>And that's what our Presidential Medal of Freedom honorees embody, each and every one of them who are here today and those who we remember posthumously. That's the living legacy of the Kennedy family. And that is the responsibility we all welcome, as Americans, for our lifetime on this planet. <p>We are extraordinarily blessed to be Americans because we have the opportunity to serve in ways that so many of you have served, because we have the opportunity to touch lives in the ways that so many of you have touched lives. <p>God bless you all, and God bless the United States of America.\" "
"248" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. It's no secret that the American people have probably never been more frustrated with Washington. And one of the reasons why that is, is that over the past 5 years, we've seen an unprecedented pattern of obstruction in Congress that's prevented too much of the American people's business from getting done. <p>All too often, we've seen a single Senator or a handful of Senators choose to abuse arcane procedural tactics to unilaterally block bipartisan compromises or to prevent well-qualified, patriotic Americans from filling critical positions of public service in our system of Government. <p>Now, at a time when millions of American have desperately searched for work, repeated abuse of these tactics have blocked legislation that might create jobs. They've defeated actions that would help women fighting for equal pay. They've prevented more progress than we would have liked for striving young immigrants trying to earn their citizenship. Or it's blocked efforts to end tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. They've even been used to block commonsense and widely supported steps to protect more Americans from gun violence, even as families of victims sat in the Senate Chamber and watched. And they've prevented far too many talented Americans from serving their country at a time when their country needs their talents the most. <p>It's harmed our economy, and it's been harmful to our democracy. And it's brought us to the point where a simple majority vote no longer seems to be sufficient for anything, even routine business, through what is supposed to be the world's greatest deliberative body. <p>Now, I realize that neither party has been blameless for these tactics. They've developed over years, and it seems as if they've continually escalated. But today's pattern of obstruction, it just isn't normal. It's not what our Founders envisioned. A deliberate and determined effort to obstruct everything, no matter what the merits, just to refight the results of an election, is not normal. And for the sake of future generations, we can't let it become normal. <p>So I support the step a majority of Senators today took to change the way that Washington is doing business, more specifically, the way the Senate does business. What a majority of Senators determined by Senate rule is that they would restore the longstanding tradition of considering judicial and public service nominations on a more routine basis. <p>And here's why this is important: One of a President's constitutional responsibilities is to nominate Americans to positions within the executive and judicial branches. Over the six decades before I took office, only 20 Presidential nominees to executive positions had to overcome filibusters. In just under 5 years since I took office, nearly 30 nominees have been treated this way. Now, these are all public servants who protect our national security, look out for working families, keep our air and water clean. <p>This year alone, for the first time in history, Senate Republicans filibustered a President's nominee for the Secretary of Defense who used to be a former Republican Senator. They tried everything they could to hold up our EPA Administrator. They blocked our nominee for our top housing regulator at a time when we need more help for more families to afford a home and prevent what has caused mortgage meltdowns from happening again. And in each of these cases, it's not been because they opposed the person, that there was some assessment that they were unqualified, that there was some scandal that had been unearthed. It was simply because they opposed the policies that the American people voted for in the last election. <p>And this obstruction gets even worse when it comes to the judiciary. The Constitution charges the President with filling vacancies to the Federal bench. Every President has exercised this power since George Washington first named Justices to the Supreme Court in 1789. But my judicial nominees have waited nearly two and a half times longer to receive yes-or-no votes on the Senate floor than those of President Bush. And the ones who eventually do get a vote generally are confirmed with little, if any, dissent. <p>So this isn't obstruction on substance, on qualifications. It's just to gum up the works. And this gridlock in Congress causes gridlock in much of our criminal and civil justice systems. You've seen judges across the country, including a Bush-appointed Chief Justice to the Supreme Court, say these are vital vacancies that need to be filled and this gridlock has not served the cause of justice; in fact, it's undermined it. <p>Over the past 3 weeks, Senate Republicans again denied a yes-or-no vote on three highly qualified Americans to fill three vacancies on the Nation's second highest court, even though they have the support of a majority of Senators. Four of President Bush's six nominees to this court were confirmed. Four out of five of my nominees to this court have been obstructed. <p>So the vote today, I think, is an indication that a majority of Senators believe, as I believe, that enough is enough. The American people's business is far too important to keep falling prey, day after day, to Washington politics. <p>I'm a former Senator. So is my Vice President. We both value any Senate's duty to advise and consent. It's important, and we take that very seriously. But a few now refuse to treat that duty of advise and consent with the respect that it deserves. It's no longer used in a responsible way to govern. It's rather used as a reckless and relentless tool to grind all business to a halt. And that's not what our Founders intended, and it's certainly not what our country needs right now. <p>And I just want to remind everybody, what's at stake here is not my ability to fulfill my constitutional duty. What's at stake is the ability of any President to fulfill his or her constitutional duty. Public service is not a game, it is a privilege. And the consequences of action or inaction are very real. The American people deserve better than politicians who run for election telling them how terrible Government is and then devoting their time in elected office to trying to make Government not work as often as possible. <p>Now, I want to be clear, the Senate has actually done some good bipartisan work this year. Bipartisan majorities have passed commonsense legislation to fix our broken immigration system and upgrade our courts&mdash;our ports. It's passed a farm bill that helps rural communities and vulnerable Americans. It's passed legislation that would protect Americans from being fired based on their sexual orientation. So we know that there are folks there, Republican and Democrat, who want to get things done. And frankly, privately they've expressed to me their recognition that the system in the Senate had broken down and what used to be a sporadic exercise of the filibuster had gotten completely out of hand. <p>I believe&mdash;I'm confident&mdash;that that spirit will have a little more space now. I want us to make sure that we can do more work together to grow the economy and to create jobs. And if there are differences in the Senate, then debates should be had. People should vote their conscience. They should vote on behalf of their constituents. But they should vote. That's what they're there to do. And ultimately, if you've got a majority of folks who believe in something, then it should be able to pass. <p>Americans work hard. They do their jobs, and they expect the same from everybody who got sent here. And as long as I have the privilege of being in this office, I'll keep working as hard as I know how to make sure that the economy is growing, and we're creating good jobs, and we're widening prosperity and opportunity for everybody. And I know that that's what the majority of folks in the Senate believe as well. But the gears of Government have to work, and the step that a majority of Senators took today, I think, will help make those gears work just a little bit better. <p>Thanks very much, everybody. And now Josh will answer all your questions.\" "
"249" "\"Well, hello, everybody. Have a seat, have a seat. And thank you, Misa, for the introduction and, more importantly, what you are doing in the classroom every single day, which is making such a big difference. And I want to welcome all of you who are here. This is one of my favorite events we do periodically. It gives me an opportunity to say thanks and recognize people who are making extraordinary contributions in their local communities. And we're learning from you, seeing what works, seeing what has an impact. <p>We call them Champions of Change: people who have done some innovative work that, hopefully, can be replicated in other parts of the country once they have good models that are having success. And today we are honoring 10 educators who use technology to support one of our country's top priorities, and that's preparing our kids and our workers for the competition that they're going to face in a 21st-century global economy. <p>In an age when the world's information is just a click away, we've got to bring our schools and our libraries into the 21st century. That's why 5 months ago I launched an initiative that we're calling ConnectED to bring high-speed Internet to 99 percent of American students over the next 5 years. And this is going to be a top priority for me. It's going to take some hard work across my administration, but I'm committed to getting it done. <p>Because this is not just about wiring schools, it's about changing students' lives. It's about using technology to give students a chance to learn at their own pace, whether they're catching up on a subject or moving ahead to the next level. It's about giving teachers a better data set so they can see exactly what's working and what isn't for particular students. It's about unleashing a new market for educational devices and apps that will create jobs and spur innovation. <p>And it's about supporting outstanding, innovative educators like our Champions for Change. Because of their work in North Dakota, young people with autism are using educational apps to discover abilities that they didn't even know that they had. In Colorado, preschoolers have now obtained access to a digital discovery center that helps them to get a great education from the earliest age. In Georgia, students at an afterschool technology club are learning skills that are going to help them succeed in college and throughout their careers. And today's Champions of Change are helping to give our students what every parent wants for their child: the chance to go as far as their talents and hard work will take them. <p>So to all of our Champions for Change, we want to thank you for your extraordinary efforts. As long as I'm President, I'm going to keep working not only to support the great work that educators and librarians are doing across the country, but more fundamentally, to make sure that young people are getting every opportunity that they deserve to thrive and succeed in this modern economy. And I see some young people here, and they look like they're doing pretty good. [<i>Laughter</i>] Although, they may be bored by me making too long a speech. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"250" "\"Hi, everybody. Over the past couple of months, most of the political headlines you've read have probably been about the Government shutdown and the launch of the Affordable Care Act. And I know that many of you have rightly never been more frustrated with Washington. But if you look beyond those headlines, there are some good things happening in our economy. And that's been my top priority since the day I walked into the Oval Office. <p>After decades in which the middle class was working harder and harder just to keep up and a punishing recession that made it worse, we made the tough choices required not just to recover from the crisis, but to rebuild on a new foundation for stronger, more durable economic growth. Five years later, we've fought our way back. Our businesses have created 7.8 million new jobs in the past 44 months. Another 200,000 Americans went back to work last month. The American auto industry has come roaring back with more than 350,000 new jobs, jobs churning out and selling the high-tech, fuel-efficient cars the world wants to buy. And they're leading the charge in a manufacturing sector that has added jobs for the first time since the 1990s, a big reason why our businesses sell more goods and services made in America than ever before. <p>We decided to reverse our addiction to foreign oil. And today, we generate more renewable energy than ever, more natural gas than anybody, and for the first time in nearly 20 years, America now produces more oil than we buy from other countries. <p>We decided to fix a broken health care system. And even though the rollout of the marketplace where you can buy affordable plans has been rough, so far about 500,000 Americans are poised to gain health coverage starting January 1. And by the way, health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in 50 years. <p>One more thing: Since I took office, we've cut our deficits by more than half. And that makes it easier to invest in the things that create jobs: education, research, and infrastructure. <p>Imagine how much farther along we could be if both parties were working together. Think about what we could do if a reckless few didn't hold the economy hostage every few months or waste time on dozens of votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act rather than try to help us fix it. In the weeks ahead, I'll keep talking about my plan to build a better bargain for the middle class: good jobs; a good education; a chance to buy a home, save, and retire; and yes, the financial security of affordable health care. And I'll look for any willing partners who want to help. <p>Because of your hard work and tough sacrifices over the past 5 years, we're pointed in the right direction. But we've got more work to do to keep moving that way. And as long as I'm President, I'll keep doing everything I can to create jobs, grow the economy, and make sure that everyone who works hard has a chance to get ahead. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"251" "\"Good evening. Today the United States, together with our close allies and partners, took an important first step toward a comprehensive solution that addresses our concerns with the Islamic Republic of Iran's nuclear program. <p>Since I took office, I've made clear my determination to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. As I've said many times, my strong preference is to resolve this issue peacefully, and we've extended the hand of diplomacy. Yet for many years, Iran has been unwilling to meet its obligations to the international community. So my administration worked with Congress, the United Nations Security Council, and countries around the world to impose unprecedented sanctions on the Iranian Government. <p>These sanctions have had a substantial impact on the Iranian economy, and with the election of a new Iranian President earlier this year, an opening for diplomacy emerged. I spoke personally with President Rouhani of Iran earlier this fall. Secretary Kerry has met multiple times with Iran's Foreign Minister. And we have pursued intensive diplomacy, bilaterally with the Iranians and together with our P-5-plus-1 partners: the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China, as well as the European Union. <p>Today that diplomacy opened up a new path toward a world that is more secure, a future in which we can verify that Iran's nuclear program is peaceful and that it cannot build a nuclear weapon. While today's announcement is just a first step, it achieves a great deal. For the first time in nearly a decade, we have halted the progress of the Iranian nuclear program, and key parts of the program will be rolled back. Iran has committed to halting certain levels of enrichment and neutralizing part of its stockpiles. Iran cannot use its next-generation centrifuges, which are used for enriching uranium. Iran cannot install or start up new centrifuges, and its production of centrifuges will be limited. Iran will halt work at its plutonium reactor. And new inspections will provide extensive access to Iran's nuclear facilities and allow the international community to verify whether Iran is keeping its commitments. <p>These are substantial limitations, which will help prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon. Simply put, they cut off Iran's most likely paths to a bomb. Meanwhile, this first step will create time and space over the next 6 months for more negotiations to fully address our comprehensive concerns about the Iranian program. And because of this agreement, Iran cannot use negotiations as cover to advance its program. <p>On our side, the United States and our friends and allies have agreed to provide Iran with modest relief, while continuing to apply our toughest sanctions. We will refrain from imposing new sanctions, and we will allow the Iranian Government access to a portion of the revenue that they have been denied through sanctions. But the broader architecture of sanctions will remain in place, and we will continue to enforce them vigorously. And if Iran does not fully meet its commitments during this 6-month phase, we will turn off the relief and ratchet up the pressure. <p>Over the next 6 months, we will work to negotiate a comprehensive solution. We approach these negotiations with a basic understanding: Iran, like any nation, should be able to access peaceful nuclear energy. But because of its record of violating its obligations, Iran must accept strict limitations on its nuclear program that make it impossible to develop a nuclear weapon. <p>In these negotiations, nothing will be agreed to unless everything is agreed to. The burden is on Iran to prove to the world that its nuclear program will be exclusively for peaceful purposes. <p>If Iran seizes this opportunity, the Iranian people will benefit from rejoining the international community, and we can begin to chip away at the mistrust between our two nations. This would provide Iran with a dignified path to forge a new beginning with the wider world based on mutual respect. If on the other hand, Iran refuses, it will face growing pressure and isolation. <p>Over the last few years, Congress has been a key partner in imposing sanctions on the Iranian Government, and that bipartisan effort made possible the progress that was achieved today. Going forward, we will continue to work closely with Congress. However, now is not the time to move forward on new sanctions, because doing so would derail this promising first step, alienate us from our allies, and risk unraveling the coalition that enabled our sanctions to be enforced in the first place. <p>That international unity is on display today. The world is united in support of our determination to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. Iran must know that security and prosperity will never come through the pursuit of nuclear weapons. It must be reached through fully verifiable agreements that make Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons impossible. <p>As we go forward, the resolve of the United States will remain firm, as will our commitments to our friends and allies, particularly Israel and our Gulf partners, who have good reason to be skeptical about Iran's intentions. <p>Ultimately, only diplomacy can bring about a durable solution to the challenge posed by Iran's nuclear program. As President and Commander in Chief, I will do what is necessary to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. But I have a profound responsibility to try to resolve our differences peacefully, rather than rush towards conflict. Today we have a real opportunity to achieve a comprehensive, peaceful settlement, and I believe we must test it. <p>The first step that we've taken today marks the most significant and tangible progress that we've made with Iran since I took office. And now we must use the months ahead to pursue a lasting and comprehensive settlement that would resolve an issue that has threatened our security, and the security of our allies, for decades. It won't be easy, and huge challenges remain ahead. But through strong and principled diplomacy, the United States of America will do our part on behalf of a world of greater peace, security, and cooperation among nations. <p>Thank you very much.\" "
"252" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! Well, hello, San Francisco! It is great to be back in California. It is great to be with all of you. I love San Francisco. You got great food. You got great people, beautiful scenery, no more super villains because \\"Batkid\\" cleaned up the streets. Love \\"Batkid.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to start by thanking Geetha for the wonderful introduction and the great work that she's doing. Give her a big round of applause. I want to thank your Mayor, Ed Lee. Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom. I want to recognize some wonderful Members of Congress who are fighting every day for the people of California: Mike Honda, Eric Swalwell, Judy Chu. They are all doing great work every single day. <p>We have a special guest, Janet Napolitano, who is now overseeing the entire UC system and going to be doing a great job. We miss her back in Washington, but she is going to be outstanding leading the University of California. <p>Now, before I begin, I want to say a few words about the news from the weekend. I'm here to talk about immigration reform, but I'm also here in my capacity as Commander in Chief, and this weekend, together with our allies and our partners, the United States reached an agreement with Iran on a first step towards resolving our concerns over its nuclear program. <p>Now, some of you may recall that when I first ran for President, I said it was time for a new era of American leadership in the world, one that turned the page on a decade of war and began a new era of our engagement with the world. And as President and as Commander in Chief, I've done what I said. We ended the war in Iraq; we brought our troops home. Usama bin Laden met justice; the war in Afghanistan will end next year. <p>And as the strongest, most powerful nation on the face of the Earth, we've engaged in clear-eyed and principled diplomacy&mdash;even with our adversaries&mdash;in order to begin to destroy Syria's chemical weapons and to place the first real constraints in a decade on Iran's nuclear program. Because I firmly believe in what President Kennedy once said. He said, \\"Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.\\" I believe that. And this diplomacy, backed by the unprecedented sanctions we brought on Iran, has brought us the progress that was achieved this weekend. <p>For the first time in a decade, we've halted the progress on Iran's nuclear program. Key parts of the program will be rolled back. International inspectors will have unprecedented access to Iran's nuclear-related facilities. So this will help Iran from building a nuclear weapon. And over the coming months, we're going to continue our diplomacy, with the goal of achieving a comprehensive solution that deals with the threat of Iran's nuclear program once and for all. <p>And if Iran seizes this opportunity and chooses to join the global community, then we can begin to chip away at the mistrust that's existed for many, many years between our two nations. None of that is going to be easy. Huge challenges remain. But we cannot close the door on diplomacy. And we cannot rule out peaceful solutions to the world's problems. We cannot commit ourselves to an endless cycle of conflict. And tough talk and bluster may be the easy thing to do politically, but it's not the right thing for our security. [<i>Applause</i>] It is not the right thing for our security. <p>Now, this progress, and the potential it offers, reminds us of what is possible when the United States has the courage to lead, not just with the force of arms, but with the strength of our diplomacy and our commitment to peace. That's what keeps us strong. That's what makes us a beacon to the world. That's how I'll continue to lead so long as I'm President of the United States. <p>And that spirit&mdash;not just what we can criticize or tear down or be against, but what we can build together&mdash;that's what brings me here today. Because it's long past time to fix our broken immigration system. We need to make sure Washington finishes what so many Americans just like you started. We've got to finish the job. <p>And it's fitting that we're here in Chinatown, just a few miles away from Angel Island. In the early 1900s, about 300,000 people&mdash;maybe some of your ancestors&mdash;passed through on their way to a new life in America. And for many, it represented the end of a long and arduous journey; they'd finally arrived in a place where, they believed, anything was possible. <p>And for some, it also represented the beginning of a new struggle against prejudice in a country that didn't always treat its immigrants fairly or afford them the same rights as everybody else. Obviously, Asians faced this, but so did the Irish, so did Italians, so did Jews. And many groups still do today. <p>That didn't stop those brave men and women from coming. They were drawn by a belief in the power of opportunity, in a belief that says, maybe I never had a chance at a good education, but this is a place where my daughter can go to college. Maybe I started out washing dishes, but this is a place where my son can become mayor of San Francisco. Maybe I have to make sacrifices today, but those sacrifices are worth it if it means a better life for my family. <p>And that's a family story that will be shared by millions of Americans around the table on Thursday. It's the story that drew my great-great-great-great-grandfather from a small village in Ireland and drew my father from a small village in Kenya. It's the story that drew so many of your ancestors here: that America is a place where you can make it if you try. <p>And here's something interesting: Today, more than one in four residents born outside the United States came here from Asian countries, many through our family immigration system. They're doctors, business owners, laborers, refugees. This rec center's namesake, Betty Ong, was a hero on 9/11. But she was also the daughter of immigrants who grew up not far from here. And we're honored to have her family with us here today. <p>But too often, when we talk about immigration, the debate focuses on our southern border. The fact is, we're blessed with immigrants from all over the world who've put down roots in every corner of this country. Here in San Francisco, 35 percent of business owners are immigrants, and your economy is among the fastest growing in the country. That's not an accident. That's the impact that our talented, hard-working immigrants can have. That's the difference they can make. They're hungry, and they're striving, and they're working hard, and they're creating things that weren't there before. <p>And that's why it is long past time to reform an immigration system that right now doesn't serve America as well as it should. We could be doing so much more to unleash our potential if we just fix this aspect of our system. <p>And I know out here in California that you watch the news and you share the country's not very sunny view of Washington these days. For the last few months, you've seen a lot of headlines about gridlock and partisan bickering, and too often one faction of one party in one House of Congress has chosen courses of action that ended up harming our businesses or our economy or our workers. Or they want to refight old political battles rather than create jobs and grow the economy and strengthen the middle class or take 40 more votes to undermine or repeal the Affordable Care Act&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;instead of passing a single serious jobs bill, despite the fact that Americans want us to focus on jobs and business and growth. And by the way, thousands of Californians are signing up every day for new health care plans all across this State. <p>So even as we're getting this darn web site up to speed&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and it's getting better&mdash;States like California are proving the law works. People want the financial security of health insurance.<i> </i>And even if you're already insured, reach out to a friend or neighbor who's not and help them get covered. <p>But when it comes to immigration reform, we have to have the confidence to believe we can get this done. And we should get it done. And by the way, most Americans agree. The only thing standing in our way right now is the unwillingness of certain Republicans in Congress to catch up with the rest of the country. <p>Now, I met the other day with the CEOs of some of America's business&mdash;biggest companies. And I'm positive, not all of them voted for me. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm pretty sure. Maybe some of them, but definitely not all of them. But the thing they wanted to talk about, their top priority was the fact that we invite the brightest minds from around the world to study here&mdash;many of them enrolled in the University of California system&mdash;and then we don't invite them to stay. We end up sending them home to create new jobs and start new businesses someplace else. So we're training our own competition, rather than invite those incredibly talented young people, like Geetha, to stay here and start businesses and create jobs here. <p>I hear from folks who have been separated from their families for years because of green card backlogs, desperately want their loved ones to be able to join them here in America. I hear from young DREAMers who are Americans through and through in every way but on paper, and they just want a chance to study and serve and contribute to the Nation that they love. <p>I talk to business owners who play by the rules, but get frustrated because they end up being undercut by those who exploit workers in a shadow economy: aren't getting paid overtime; aren't required to meet the same obligations. And so those companies end up losing out on business. <p>Right now I'm seeing brave advocates who have been fasting for 2 weeks in the shadow of the Capitol, sacrificing themselves in an effort to get Congress to act. And I want to say to Eliseo Medina, my friend from SEIU, and the other fasters who are there as we speak, I want them to know, we hear you. We're with you. The whole country hears you. <p>And there are plenty of leaders&mdash;Democrat and Republican&mdash;who don't think it's fair that we've got 11 million people in this country, including more than a million from Asia, with no real way to come forward and get on the right side of the law. It's not smart. It's not fair. It doesn't make sense. And we have kicked this particular can down the road long enough. Everybody knows it. <p>Now, the good news is, we know what the solutions are. There is bipartisan hope of getting it done. This year, the Senate passed an immigration reform bill by a wide, bipartisan majority, and it addresses the key issues that need to be addressed. It would strengthen our borders. It would level the playing field by holding employers accountable if they knowingly hire undocumented workers. It would modernize our legal immigration system so that we eliminate the backlog of family visas and make it easier to attract highly skilled entrepreneurs from beyond our borders. It would make sure that everybody plays by the same rules by providing a pathway to earned citizenship for those who are living in the shadows, a path that includes passing a background check and learning English and paying taxes and a penalty and getting in line behind everyone trying to come here the right way. <p>And each of these pieces would go a long way towards fixing our broken immigration system. Each of them has been supported by Democrats and Republicans in the past. There's no reason we can't come together and get it done. <p>And what's more, we know the immigration reform that we're proposing would boost our economy and shrink our deficits. Independent economists have said that if the Senate bill became law, over the next two decades, our economy would grow by $1.4 trillion more, and it would reduce our deficits by $850 billion more. <p>And you don't have to be an economist to figure out that workers will be more productive if they've got their families here with them, they're not worried about deportation, they're not living halfway around the world. This isn't just the right thing to do, it's the smart thing to do. <p>Of course, just because something is smart, fair, good for the economy, and supported by business, labor, law enforcement, and faith leaders&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;Democratic and Republican Governors, including the Governor of this State&mdash;just because all that is in place doesn't mean we'll actually get it done, because this is Washington, after all, that we're talking about and everything is looked through a political prism. And look, let's be honest, some folks automatically think, well, if Obama's for it, then I've got to be against it even if I was&mdash;before that, I was for it. <p>But I want to remind everybody, to his great credit, my Republican predecessor, President Bush, was for reform. He proposed reform like this almost a decade ago. I was in the Senate. I joined 23 Senate Republicans back then supporting reform. It's worth remembering that the Senate bill that just passed won more than a dozen Republican votes this past summer. And some of them even forget that I'm&mdash;sometimes, people forget, I'm not running for office again. Michelle doesn't forget. [<i>Laughter</i>] So you don't have to worry about this somehow being good for me. This is good for the country. It's the right thing to do for the American people. <p>And I believe, ultimately&mdash;not always in the short term&mdash;but ultimately, good policy is good politics. Look at the polls right now, because the American people support immigration reform by a clear majority. Everybody wins if we get this done. So there's no reason we shouldn't get immigration reform done right now. None. If there is a good reason, I haven't heard it. <p>And by the way, if there's a better plan out there than the one that Democrats and Republicans have already advanced together, if there are additional ideas that would make it even better, I'm always willing to listen to new ideas. My door is always open. But right now it's up to Republicans in the House to decide if we can move forward as a country on this bill. If they don't want to see it happen, they've got to explain why. <p>The good news is, just this past week, Speaker Boehner said that he is \\"hopeful we can make progress\\" on immigration reform. And that is good news. I believe the Speaker is sincere. I think he genuinely wants to get it done. And that's something we should be thankful for this week. And I think there are a number of other House Republicans who also want to get this done. Some of them are hesitant to do it in one big bill, like the Senate did. That's okay. They can&mdash;it's Thanksgiving; we can carve that bird into multiple pieces. [<i>Laughter</i>] A drumstick here&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;breast meat there. But as long as all the pieces get done soon and we actually deliver on the core values we've been talking about for so long, I think everybody is fine with it. They're not worried about the procedures, they just want the result. <p>But it's going to require some courage. There are some members of the Republican caucus who think this is bad politics for them back home. And they're free to vote their conscience, but what I've said to the Speaker and others is, don't let a minority of folks block something that the country desperately needs. And we can't leave this problem for another generation to solve. If we don't tackle this now, then we're undercutting our own future. <p>So my message to Congress is, rather than create problems, let's prove Washington can get something done. This is something that has broad-based support. We've been working on it for a decade now. This reform comes as close as we've gotten to something that will benefit everybody, now and for decades to come. And it has the potential to enrich this country in ways that we can't even imagine. <p>And I'll just give you one example to wrap up. Andrew Ly is here today. Where's Andrew? He's around here somewhere. There he is. Now, Andrew has got an amazing story. Andrew grew up in Vietnam, and he and his four , brothers tried three times to flee to the United States. Obviously, the country was going through all kinds of difficulties. So three times, they tried; three times, they failed. On the fourth try, their boat, filled with 140 refugees&mdash;is that right, Andrew?&mdash;was attacked by pirates. <p>But the Lys and their family eventually made it to Malaysia, and then they eventually made it here to San Francisco. And they learned English, and they worked as handymen, and they worked as seamstresses. And eventually, Andrew and his brothers , earned enough money to buy a small bakery. And they started making donuts, and they started selling them to Chinese restaurants. And with a lot of hard work and a little luck, the Sugar Bowl Bakery today is a $60 million business. [<i>Applause</i>] Right? <p>So these humble and striving immigrants from Vietnam now employ more than 300 Americans. They're supplying pastries to Costco and Safeway, and almost every hotel and hospital in San Francisco. And I don't know if Andrew brought me any samples, but&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;they must be pretty good. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And Andrew says: \\"We came here as boat people, so we don't take things for granted. We know this is the best country in the world if you work hard.\\" That's what America is about. This is the place where you can reach for something better if you work hard. This is the country our parents and our grandparents and waves of immigrants before them built for us. And it falls on each new generation to keep it that way. The Statue of Liberty doesn't have its back to the world. The Statue of Liberty faces the world and raises its light to the world. <p>When Chinese immigrants came to this city in search of Gold Mountain, they weren't looking just for physical riches, they were looking for freedom and opportunity. They knew that what makes us American is not a question of what we look like or what our names are&mdash;because our&mdash;we look like the world. I mean, you got a President named Obama. [<i>Laughter</i>] What makes us American is our shared belief in certain enduring principles, our allegiance to a set of ideals, to a creed, to the enduring promise of this country. <p>And our shared responsibility is to leave this country more generous, more hopeful than we found it. And if we stay true to that history&mdash;if we get immigration reform across the finish line, and it is there, just within our grasp; if we can just get folks in Washington to go ahead and do what needs to be done&mdash;we're going to grow our economy, we're going to make our country more secure, we'll strengthen our families, and most importantly&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> Mr. Obama&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The President. &mdash;</i>&mdash;most importantly, we will live up&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member. </i>I need your help. My family has been separated for Thanksgiving. <p><i>The President. &mdash;</i>&mdash;most importantly, we will live up to our character as a nation. <p><i>Audience member.</i> I have not seen my family Thanksgiving week because my families are separated. I need your help. There are thousands of&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The President. </i>That's exactly what we're talking about here. <p><i>Audience member</i> .&mdash;&mdash;undocumented immigrants that are torn apart every single day. <p><i>The President.</i> That's why we're here. <p><i>Audience member.</i> So, Mr. President, please use your Executive order to halt deportations for all 11.5 undocumented immigrants in this country right now. <p><i>The President.</i> What we're trying&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> We agree&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> Obama! Obama! Obama! <p><i>Audience member. &mdash;</i>&mdash;that we need to pass comprehensive immigration reform. At the same time, we have a&mdash;you have a power to stop deportation for all&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The President.</i> Actually, I don't. <p><i>Audience member.</i> &mdash;&mdash;undocumented immigrant families in this country. <p><i>The President.</i> And that's why we're here. <p><i>Audience member.</i> So, please, I need your help. <p><i>The President.</i> Okay&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> Stop deportations! <p><i>Audience members.</i> Stop deportations! Stop deportations! <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. All right. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Stop deportations! Stop deportations! <p><i>The President.</i> What I'd like to do&mdash;no, no, don't worry about it, guys. Okay, let me finish. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Stop deportations! Yes, we can! Stop deportations! <p><i>The President.</i> How about&mdash;these guys don't need to go. <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Let me finish. No, no, no, let&mdash;he can stay there. Let me&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. Hold on a second. Hold on a second. <p>So I respect the passion of these young people because they feel deeply about the concerns for their families. Now, what you need to know, when I'm speaking as President of the United States and I come to this community, is that if, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so. <p>But we're also a nation of laws. That's part of our tradition. And so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws. And what I'm proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve. But it won't be as easy as just shouting. It requires us lobbying and getting it done. <p>So the&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. So for those of you who are committed to getting this done, I am going to march with you and fight with you every step of the way to make sure that we are welcoming every striving, hard-working immigrant who sees America the same way we do: as a country where no matter who you are or where you&mdash;what you look like or where you come from, you can make it if you try. <p>And if you're serious about making that happen, then I'm ready to work with you. But it is going to require work. It is not simply a matter of us just saying we're going to violate the law. That's not our tradition. But the great thing about this country is we have this wonderful process of democracy, and sometimes, it is messy, and sometimes, it is hard, but ultimately, justice and truth win out. That's always been the case in this country; that's going to continue to be the case today. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "

So I want to thank her publicly for all the support that she's given us. <p>We've got some folks here who are fighting for the people of South&mdash;Southern California every single day, and I just want to acknowledge them. We've got the mayor of Glendale, Dave Weaver. We've got three of your outstanding Members of Congress: Brad Sherman, Adam Schiff, Karen Bass. They are all doing a great job. <p>I want to thank all of you for being here. And I want to thank your CEO, Jeffrey Katzenberg, for inviting me. Jeffrey, like Mellody, has been a friend and a supporter through thick and thin. And I think his place in the entertainment industry is legendary; I don't need to puff him up too much. [<i>Laughter</i>] He has a healthy sense of self. [<i>Laughter</i>] But he is a great friend and somebody whose counsel and advice I value. And I'm incredibly grateful to be here at this wonderful institution that he helped to build. <p>And I've come here today because this is one of America's economic engines. Not just DreamWorks, but this whole cluster of companies that generations have grown up knowing: Disney and Warner and Universal and others. When you think about it, what finance is to New York, what the auto industry is to the Midwest, what technology is to Northern California, entertainment is to this part of the country. <p>And most of us have spent a lot of time thinking about our favorite movies or TV shows, but we don't often think about the entire infrastructure and industry behind the scenes. Hundreds of thousands of middle class jobs&mdash;they're not always on the marquee&mdash;jobs for electricians and carpenters and sound mixers and makeup artists and designers and animators depend on this incredible industry here in Southern California. <p>Entertainment is one of America's biggest exports. And every day, you sell a product that's made in America to the rest of the world. Every time somebody buys movie tickets or DVDs or distribution rights to a film, some of that money goes back to the local economy right here. <p>And believe it or not, entertainment is part of our American diplomacy. It's part of what makes us exceptional, part of what makes us such a world power. You can go anywhere on the planet, and you'll see a kid wearing a \\"Madagascar\\" T-shirt. [<i>Laughter</i>] You can say, \\"May the Force be with you\\"&mdash;they know what you're talking about. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Hundreds of millions of people may never set foot in the United States, but thanks to you, they've experienced a small part of what makes our country special. They've learned something about our values. We have shaped a world culture through you. <p>And the stories that we tell transmit values and ideals about tolerance and diversity and overcoming adversity and creativity that are part of our DNA. And as a consequence of what you've done, you helped shape the world culture in a way that has made the world better. <p>They might not know the Gettysburg Address, but if they're watching some old movie, maybe \\"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\\" or \\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\\" or \\"Will or Grace\\"&mdash;\\"Will and Grace\\" and \\"Modern Family,\\" they've had a front-row seat to our march towards progress, even if their own nations haven't made that progress yet. And young people in countries all around the world suddenly make a connection and have an affinity to people who don't look like them and maybe originally they might have been fearful of, and now suddenly, they say, oh, this person is like me, which is one of the powers of art, but that's what you transmit. <p>And that is a remarkable legacy. Now, it's also a big responsibility. When it comes to issues like gun violence, we've got to make sure that we're not glorifying it, because the stories you tell shape our children's outlook and their lives. Earlier this year, leaders from this town sat down with Vice President Biden to talk about what Hollywood could do to help keep our kids safe. This was in the wake of Sandy Hook. And those conversations need to continue. The stories we tell matter. And you tell stories more powerfully than anybody else on the Earth. <p>But I want to make clear, even as we think long and hard about the messages we send, we should never waver from our commitment to the freedom that allows us to tell those stories so well. Protecting our First Amendment rights are vital to who we are. And it's also good business, because in the global race for jobs and industries, the thing we do better than anybody else is creativity. That's something that can't be copied. It's one of the reasons why even with new markets and new technologies, there's still no better place to make movies and television and music than right here in the United States. <p>Entertainment is one of the bright spots of our economy. The gap between what we can do and what other countries can do is enormous. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Woo! <p><i>The President.</i> Yes, that's worth cheering for. [<i>Applause</i>] Yes. And that means that we've got to do what it takes to make sure that this industry, and every great American industry, keeps that competitive edge so that more folks can find career paths like many of you have, and get good middle class jobs that allow you to support a family and get ahead. <p>Nothing is more important than that right now. And as Mellody mentioned, when I came into office, we were going through a severe crisis. Five years later, America has largely fought our way back. We've made the tough choices required not just to help the economy recover, but to rebuild it on a new foundation for stronger, more durable economic growth. <p>We refocused on manufacturing and exports, and today, our businesses sell more goods and services made in this country to the rest of the world than ever before. Our manufacturers are adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s, led by an American auto industry that's come roaring back. American cars are really good now. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We decided to reverse our dependence on foreign oil. So today, we generate more renewable energy than ever&mdash;doubled our renewable energy&mdash;more natural gas than anybody. For the first time in nearly 20 years, America now produces more of our own oil than we buy from other countries. [<i>Applause</i>] It's good news. <p>When I took office, America invested far less than countries like China did in wireless infrastructure, and we've now narrowed that gap, and we have helped companies unleash jobs and innovation and become a booming app economy that's created hundreds of thousands of jobs. Six years ago, only 5 percent of the world's smartphones ran on American operating systems. Today, more than 80 percent do. <p>And yes, we decided to fix a broken health care system. And it's interesting&mdash;I was talking to some of the studio execs here, and I said, look, the rollout of the new health care marketplace was rough and nobody was more frustrated about the problems with our web site than I am. And yet, here in Southern California and here across this State, there are thousands of people every single day who are getting health care for the first time&mdash;for the first time&mdash;because of this. And by the way, the web site is continually working better, so check it out. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But as a country, we're now poised to gain health coverage for millions of Americans, starting on January 1, and that includes more than 350,000 here in California who have already signed up. And thanks in part to the Affordable Care Act, health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in 50 years. Employer-based health care costs are growing at about one-third the rate of a decade ago. And that means that if the studios here or your employers aren't having to spend as much on health care, that they can hire more folks and reinvest more in the business and come up with those cool technologies that&mdash;I don't exactly understand how they work, but&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;were really neat to look at. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And by the way, we've done all this while bringing down our deficits. After years of trillion-dollar deficits, we reined in spending. You would think sometimes listening to folks in Washington that we haven't made any progress on that front. We wound down two wars. We changed a Tax Code that was too skewed towards the wealthiest Americans at the expense of the middle class. You add it all up, we've cut our deficits by more than half, and they continue to go down faster than any time since World War II. <p>So all told, our businesses created 7.8 million new jobs over the past 44 months. America has gone farther, recovered faster than most other industrialized nations. But as Mellody said, we've got more work to do. The stock market is doing great, corporate profits soaring, but too many Americans aren't sharing in that success. And everybody here who works at DreamWorks&mdash;a really good place to work. I'm going to ask Jeff if maybe I can work here after&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. But all of you have friends and family and neighbors who aren't as lucky. And you know there are still a lot of folks who are struggling out there. And my top priority is making sure that this country remains a country where everybody who is willing to work hard can get ahead. <p>And we'd be a lot further along without some of the dysfunction and obstruction we've seen in Washington. We would be a lot further along if we could just get folks to act with some sense&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;if we didn't have one wing of one party that was a little less obsessed with repealing health care for 40 million people, more concerned with making sure the law works. If they hadn't spent 40 votes trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act, they might have actually taken some votes on rebuilding our infrastructure or instituting early childhood education for young people across this country or investing more money in basic research that helps to create the amazing technologies that many of you utilize. Any of the serious proposals I've put forward that would be creating jobs right now, they could have been taking votes on that. <p>Instead of rooting for failure or refighting old battles, Republicans in Congress need to work with us to improve those things about the Affordable Care Act that aren't working as well as they should and implement policies to strengthen the middle class and create jobs. <p>I&mdash;a couple of weeks ago, House Republican leaders handed out a piece of paper to their members, and on the top it said, \\"Agenda 2014.\\" I'm not making this up. Below that, it was blank. [<i>Laughter</i>] No, it was a blank sheet of paper: nothing to create jobs or grow the economy or strengthen the middle class. <p>And I've put forward my plans to create new jobs and even the odds for the middle class. And I've put forward plans that gives some Republicans some of the things that they want in exchange for ideas that will create good jobs right now. And so far, they won't consider them. <p>Some people have heard me say my list of top five movies&mdash;\\"The Godfather,\\" I and II, have to be on it. But it turns out Marlon Brando had it easy, because when it comes to Congress, there's no such thing as an \\"offer they can't refuse.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, I just keep on coming back. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm going to keep on trying though. [<i>Laughter</i>] I am, because we've got no choice. <p>The American people agree with us that jobs, growing the economy should be our number-one priority. And we've got to make some investments to make that happen. And we've got to give a better bargain to the middle class and everybody who is working to join the middle class. And that means building on those cornerstones of what makes for a strong middle class: good jobs, a good education, a home of your own, health care when you get sick, a secure retirement even if you're not rich. So we can help manufacturers bring more jobs back to America by investing in American clean energy technology and putting people to work building roads and bridges and schools and high-speed broadband networks that attract businesses from around the world. <p>We can prepare our children and our workers for the global competition that they'll face: expanding high-quality preschool education, redesigning our high schools, investing in community colleges and job training, and tackling rising college costs so that young people can afford it. We can help responsible homeowners afford a mortgage or refinancing at today's low rates, help build a rock-solid housing system for decades to come, instead of boom and bust. <p>We can bring the promise of a secure retirement back to reach for middle class families, finding new ways to make it easier for workers to save and strengthening Social Security and getting immigration reform done so that undocumented workers are paying their full share of taxes, but they're not living in the shadows, and we're attracting the best and the brightest from all around the world. <p>As I was getting a tour of DreamWorks, I didn't ask, but just looking at faces, I could tell, there were some folks who are here not because they were born here, but because they want to be here and they bring extraordinary talents to the United States. And that's part of what makes America special. And that's part of what, by the way, makes California special, because it's always been this magnet of dreamers and strivers and people coming from every direction saying to themselves, you know, if I work hard there, I can have my piece of the American Dream. <p>We're going to continue to make progress on all those fronts. And yes, we are going to continue to implement the health care law. The product is good. People want it. And we should not live in a country where people are going bankrupt just because they get sick. And anybody who is going to keep on pushing against that, they will meet my resistance, because I am willing to fix any problems that there are, but I'm not going to abandon people to make sure that they've got health insurance in this country. That is not something we're going to do. And the good news is, as I said, thousands of Californians are already signing up. <p>I read a really powerful story over the weekend&mdash;I just want to mention&mdash;about uninsured folks in Kentucky who are signing up in droves in one of the poorest counties in the country. Some of them can't imagine what having health insurance would be like. And you read these stories, and you realize how important it is for folks in Kentucky&mdash;a State, by the way, that did not vote for me&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and if Kentucky can do it, than every State should be able to do it. <p>We should be able to expand Medicaid all across the country. There are millions of people who, right now, even under the law, may not get health care that they deserve because their Governors have refused to do it just for political reasons, expanding Medicaid. Fortunately, California obviously is not one of them. But this is a fight that we're going to keep fighting, because it's worth fighting. And that's what Mellody referred to. <p>It's true. I'm not an ideological guy, but there are some things I really believe in. And part of what I believe in is that the essence of this country, what makes this place special, is this idea that Hollywood has glorified and held up&mdash;but I actually think it's true&mdash;that here, more than anyplace else, no matter what you look like, where you come from, what your last name is, who you love, you should be able to make it if you're willing to work hard. That's what I believe. <p>And there's certain values that make that a reality. I have my critics, obviously, but since were here in Hollywood, I want to think about something that the late, great Chicago film critic, Robert [Roger; White House correction.] Ebert said&mdash;and I was fortunate to get to know Roger Ebert and was always inspired by how he handled some really tough stuff. \\"Kindness,\\" he wrote, \\"covers all of my political beliefs.\\" Kindness covers all of my political beliefs. <p>And when I think about what I'm fighting for, what gets me up every single day, that captures it as much&mdash;just about as much as anything. Kindness, empathy, that sense that I have a stake in your success; that I'm going to make sure, just because Malia and Sasha are doing well, that's not enough, I want your kids to do well also. And I'm willing to help to build good schools so that they get a great education, even if mine are already getting a great education. <p>And I'm going to invest in infrastructure and building things like the Golden Gate Bridge and the Hoover Dam and the Internet&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>[<i>At this point</i>, <i>the President winked at the audience</i>.] <p>Because I'm investing for the next generation, not just this one. And that's what binds us together, and that's how we've always moved forward, based on the idea that we have a stake in each other's success. And that's what drives me. And that's what will continue to drive me. <p>I believe that our&mdash;every kid should have opportunity. I believe our daughters should have the same opportunities as our sons. I believe that Jeffrey's kids should be able to aspire to whatever they can dream of, but I also want to make sure that the person who's cleaning up Jeffrey's office, that their kid has that same possibility. <p>And we may have different ideas and different policies on how to do things, but that shouldn't&mdash;it shouldn't negate that that core vision is what we're fighting for, and we should be able to sit down together and to keep dreaming and keep working and to make sure that the American Dream that's been described here in Southern California is sustained for generations to come. <p>And what's stopping us is not policy details; it's not technical issues. It's to summon the courage to put politics aside once in a while and remember that we've got more in common than our politics would suggest. And as long as I've got the privilege of serving as your President, that's what I'm going to keep on making sure that I do: to put politics aside once in a while and work on your behalf. <p>So thank you, DreamWorks, for what you do. Thank you, Jeffrey, for your hospitality. God bless you. God bless America. Can't wait to see your next movie.\" "
"254" "\"Good afternoon, everybody, and happy Thanksgiving. <p>The office of the Presidency, the most powerful position in the world, brings with it many awesome and solemn responsibilities. This is not one of them. [<i>Laughter</i>] But though&mdash; the White House turkey pardon is a great tradition. And I know Malia loves it, as does Sasha. <p>Generally speaking, Thanksgiving is a bad day to be a turkey. Especially at a house with two dogs. So I salute our two guests of honor, Caramel and Popcorn, for their bravery. They came all the way from outside Badger, Minnesota, to be with us. They, like my Chief of Staff, are Vikings fans. I'm not sure that they know that&mdash;&mdash; <p>[<i>At this point, the turkeys gobbled.</i>] <p>&mdash;&mdash;uh-oh. [<i>Laughter</i>] Yes. See. I'm not sure they know that that my Bears are heading to Minnesota on Sunday, but in the spirit of Thanksgiving, I'm going to give them a break. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We are also excited to have students from Badger High School here. Where they are&mdash;where are you guys? [<i>Applause</i>] There they are, right there. And finally, let me say thank you to John Burkel, chairman of the National Turkey Federation. Give him a big round of applause. <p>Now, 80 turkeys on John's farm competed for the chance to make it to the White House and stay off the Thanksgiving table. It was, quite literally, the \\"Hunger Games.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] And then, after weeks of vocal practice and prepping for the cameras, the two tributes, Caramel and Popcorn, went head to head together for America's vote as top gobbler. <p>The competition was stiff, but we can officially declare that Popcorn is the winner, proving&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. There you go. Proving that even a turkey with a funny name can find a place in politics. [<i>Laughter</i>] As for Caramel, he's sticking around, and he's already busy raising money for his next campaign. [<i>Laughter</i>] Yes. <p>On a more serious note, later today Michelle, Malia, Sasha, and I will bring a couple less fortunate turkeys to a great organization that works to help out our neighbors here in DC who need it most. And I want to thank Jaindl's Turkey Farm in Orefield, Pennsylvania, for donating those dressed birds for the fifth year in a row. This is a reminder that this is a season to not only be thankful for the incredible blessings that we have, but also to remember the neediest and generously serve those who are not as fortunate. <p>This is a quintessentially American holiday, and during this time, we give thanks to our friends and our family, for citizens who show compassion to those in need, and for neighbors who help strangers they've never met. We give thanks for the blessings of freedom and opportunity that previous generations worked so hard to secure for. And we give thanks for the service and sacrifice of our brave men and women in uniform who serve our Nation around the world. For those of you who are watching, you keep us safe, you make us proud, and you remind us of our own obligations to build on the work of our predecessors and leave something better for our own kids. <p>So on behalf of the Obama family, I want to wish everybody a very happy Thanksgiving. Tomorrow, as we gather with our own friends and family, we'll count ourselves lucky that there's more to be thankful for than we can ever say and more to be hopeful for than we can ever imagine. <p>And now, before these turkeys get away: With the power vested in me, I want to grant Popcorn a full reprieve. Come on. [<i>Laughter</i>] I want to&mdash;Popcorn, you have a full reprieve from cranberry sauce and stuffing. We wish you well. And we're going to give Caramel a break as well. <p>All right? So&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. Congratulations, everybody. All right. Happy Thanksgiving, everybody. See you, Popcorn. Give them a big round of applause. All right, get out of the rain. [<i>Laughter</i>]\" "
"255" "\"Hi, everybody. On behalf of all the Obamas, Michelle, Malia, Sasha, Bo, and the newest member of our family, Sunny, I want to wish you a happy and healthy Thanksgiving. We'll be spending today just like many of you, sitting down with family and friends to eat some good food, tell some stories, and watch a little football, and most importantly, count our blessings. <p>And as Americans, we have so much to be thankful for. We give thanks for the men and women who set sail for this land nearly four centuries ago, risking everything for the chance at a better life, and the people who were already here, our Native American brothers and sisters, for their generosity during that first Thanksgiving. We give thanks for the generations who followed, people of all races and religions, who arrived here from every country on Earth and worked to build something better for themselves and for us. <p>We give thanks for all our men and women in uniform and for their families, who are surely missing them very much today. We're grateful for their sacrifice too. <p>We give thanks for the freedoms they defend: the freedom to think what we want and say what we think; to worship according to our own beliefs; to choose our leaders and, yes, criticize them without punishment. People around the world are fighting and even dying for their chance at these freedoms. We stand with them in that struggle, and we give thanks for being free. <p>And we give thanks to everyone who's doing their part to make the United States a better, more compassionate nation, who spend their Thanksgiving volunteering at a soup kitchen or joining a service project or bringing food and cheer to a lonely neighbor. That big-hearted generosity is a central part of our American character. We believe in lending a hand to folks who need it. We believe in pitching in to solve problems even if they aren't our problems. And that's not a 1-day-a-year belief, it's part of the fabric of our Nation. <p>And we remember that many Americans need that helping hand right now: Americans who've lost their jobs and can't get a new one through no fault of their own, Americans who have been trapped in poverty and just need that helping hand to climb out, citizens whose prayers and hopes move us to act. <p>We're a people who are greater together than we are on our own. And that's what today is about. That's what every day should be about. No matter what our differences, we're all part of one American family. We're each other's keepers. We are \\"one Nation under God.\\" That core tenet of our American experience has guided us from the earliest days of our founding, and it will guide us to a future that's even brighter than today. <p>Thank you, God bless you, and from my family to yours, happy Thanksgiving.\" "
"256" "\"Thank you, everybody. Everybody, please have a seat. Well, thank you, Grant, for your outstanding leadership of the Office of National AIDS Policy. And thanks to all of you for being here. This is a pretty distinguished crowd, I have to say, and it is wonderful to be here. <p>I should say, actually, welcome back, because many of you have joined us before as we've marked new milestones in our fight against HIV and AIDS. And I'm honored that you could join us in commemorating World AIDS Day, which was yesterday. And this is a time for remembering the friends and loved ones that we've lost, celebrating the extraordinary progress&mdash;thanks to some people in this room&mdash;that we've been able to make, and most importantly, recommitting ourselves to the mission that we share, which is achieving an AIDS-free generation. <p>I especially want to welcome ministers from our partner countries; members of my administration, including Secretary Sebelius, Secretary John Kerry; Congresswoman Barbara Lee; Mark Dybul from the Global Fund To Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. And we've also got here Francis Collins from the National Institutes of Health; Michel Sidib&eacute; from UNAIDS; Deborah von Zinkernagel, who's carrying on the great work of Eric Goosby as our Acting Global AIDS Coordinator; and our many friends from the philanthropic world, including Bill Gates. So thank you all for joining us here today. <p>Every year, this is a moment to reflect on how far we've come since the early days of the AIDS epidemic. And those of you who lived through it remember all too well the fear and the stigma and how hard people with HIV had to fight to be seen or heard or to be treated with basic compassion. And you remember how little we knew about how to prevent AIDS or how to treat it. What we did know was the devastation that it inflicted, striking down vibrant men and women in the prime of their lives and spreading from city to city and country to country seemingly overnight. <p>Today, that picture is transformed. Thanks to the courage and love of so many of you in this room and around the world, awareness has soared, research has surged. Prevention, treatment, and care are now saving millions of lives, not only in the world's richest countries, but in some of the world's poorest countries as well. And for many, with testing and access to the right treatment, the disease that was once a death sentence now comes with a good chance at a healthy and productive life. And that's an extraordinary achievement. <p>As President, I've told you that in this fight, you'll have a partner in me. And I said that if the United States wanted to be the global leader in combating this disease, then we needed to act like it, by doing our part and by leading the world to do more together. And that's what we've done, in partnership with so many of you. We created the first comprehensive national HIV/AIDS strategy, rooted in a simple vision that every person should get access to life-extending care, regardless of age or gender, race or ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, or socioeconomic status. <p>We've continued to support the Ryan White CARE Act to help underserved communities, and we lifted the entry ban so that people with HIV are no longer barred from the United States, which led to the International AIDS Conference being held here last year for the very first time in over 20 years. <p>This summer, I issued an Executive order creating the HIV Care Continuum Initiative to boost our Federal efforts to prevent and treat HIV. Last month, I signed the HIV Organ Policy Equity Act to finally allow research into organ donations between people with HIV, a step achieved with bipartisan support. And thanks to the Affordable Care Act, millions of insured Americans will be able to get tested free of charge. Americans who were uninsured will now be able to have access to affordable health care coverage, and beginning in January, no American will be again denied health insurance because of their HIV status. <p>On World AIDS Day 2 years ago, I announced an additional $35 million for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, which helps people pay for lifesaving medications. At one time, the need was so great that over 9,000 people were on the wait list. We vowed to get those numbers down. And I'm proud to announce that as of last week, we have cleared that wait list. We are down to zero. And we're going to keep working to keep it down. <p>So we're making progress. But we're all here today because we know how much work remains to be done. Here in the United States, we need to keep focusing on investments to communities that are still being hit hardest, including gay and bisexual men, African Americans, and Latinos. We need to keep up the fight in our cities, including Washington, DC, which in recent years has reduced diagnosed infections by nearly half. <p>And we're going to keep pursuing scientific breakthroughs. Today I'm pleased to announce a new initiative at the National Institutes of Health to advance research into an HIV cure. We're going to redirect a hundred million dollars into this project to develop a new generation of therapies because the United States should be at the forefront of new discoveries into how to put HIV into long-term remission without requiring lifelong therapies or, better yet, eliminate it completely. <p>And of course, this fight extends far beyond our borders. When I became President, I inherited President Bush's phenomenal program, PEPFAR, which has helped millions around the world receive lifesaving treatment. And we haven't just sustained those efforts, we've expanded them, reaching and serving even more people, especially mothers and children. Earlier this year, PEPFAR reached a wonderful milestone: the 1 millionth baby born without HIV. And that alongside the rapid decline in new HIV infections and deaths from AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. <p>On my visit to South Africa this year, I visited a clinic run by Bishop Desmond Tutu and had the honor of spending time with some of their extraordinary young patients and counselors and outreach workers and doctors. Every day, they are doing extraordinary work. And when you visit this facility, you cannot help but be inspired by what they do each and every day, in part thanks to the support of the United States of America. They're saving lives, and they're changing the way their country and the world approaches this disease. And that's work that we have to continue to advance. <p>On World AIDS Day 2 years ago, I set new prevention and treatment targets for PEPFAR, like increasing the number of mothers we reach so that we prevent their children from becoming infected and helping 6 million people get treatment by the end of 2013. Today I'm proud to announce that we've not only reached our goal, we've exceeded our treatment target. So we've helped 6.7 million people receive lifesaving treatment. And we're going to keep at it. Which is why, after I leave here today, I'll be proud to sign the \\"PEPFAR Stewardship and Oversight Act\\" to keep this program going strong. [<i>Applause</i>] Count on the legislator to applaud legislation. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, looking ahead, it's time for the world to come together to set new goals. Right now we're working hard to get a permanent leader in place at PEPFAR, and once we do, one of our first items of business will be convening a meeting early next year so the United States and our partners worldwide&mdash;including governments, the Global Fund, UNAIDS, and civil society&mdash;can sit around one table and develop joint HIV prevention and treatment goals for the countries where we and the Global Fund do business. We'll hold each other accountable, and we'll continue to work to turn the tide of this epidemic together. <p>And that includes keeping up our support for the Global Fund. Its success speaks for itself. It's helping over 6 million people in over 140 countries receive antiretroviral therapy. And now it's time to replenish the fund. The United States will contribute $1 for every $2 pledged by other donors over the next 3 years, up to $5 billion total from the United States. And the United Kingdom has made a similar promise. <p>So today I want to urge all those who are attending the Global Fund's replenishment meetings both today and tomorrow to take up this commitment. Don't leave our money on the table. It's been inspiring to see the countries most affected by this disease vastly increase their own contributions to this fight, in some cases providing more than donor countries do. And that ought to inspire all of us to give more, to do more, so we can save more lives. <p>After all, none of the progress we've made against AIDS could have been achieved by a single government or foundation or corporation working alone. It's the result of countless people&mdash;including so many of you&mdash;working together from countries large and small, philanthropies, universities, media, civil society, activists. More than anything, I think it's thanks to the courageous people living with HIV around the world who've shared their stories. You've lent your strength, demanded your dignity be recognized, and led the fight to spare others the anguish of this disease. <p>We can't change the past or undo its wrenching pain. But what we can do&mdash;and what we have to do&mdash;is to chart a different future, guided by our love for those we couldn't save. That allows us to do everything we can, everything in our power to save those that we can. And that's my commitment to you as President. <p>The United States of America will remain the global leader in the fight against HIV and AIDS. We will stand with you every step of this journey until we reach the day that we know is possible, when all men and women can protect themselves from infection; a day when all people with HIV have access to the treatments that extend their lives; the day when there are no babies being born with HIV or AIDS and when we achieve, at long last, what was once hard to imagine, and that's an AIDS-free generation. <p>That's the world I want for my daughters. That's the world that all of us want for our families. And if we stay focused, if we keep fighting, and if we honor the memory of those that we've lost&mdash;if we summon the same courage that they displayed&mdash;by insisting on whatever it takes, however long it takes, I believe we're going to win this fight. And I'm confident that we'll do so together. <p>So thank you very much for your extraordinary efforts. Appreciate it. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. Good work.\" "
"257" "\"All right. Thank you, Monica. Well, thanks to Monica, thanks to everybody standing behind me, and thanks for everybody out there who cares deeply about this issue. Monica's story is important, because for all the day-to-day fights here in Washington around the Affordable Care Act, it's stories like hers that should remind us why we took on this reform in the first place. <p>And for too long, few things left working families more vulnerable to the anxieties and insecurities of today's economy than a broken health care system. So we took up the fight because we believe that in America, nobody should have to worry about going broke just because somebody in their family or they got sick. We believe that nobody should have to choose between putting food on their kids' table or taking them to see a doctor. We believe we're a better country than a country where we allow, every day, 14,000 Americans to lose their health care coverage; or where every year, tens of thousands of Americans died because they didn't have health care; or where out-of-pocket costs drove millions of citizens into poverty in the wealthiest nation on Earth. We thought we were better than that, and that's why we took this on. <p>And that's what's gotten lost a little bit over the last couple of months. And our focus, rightly, had to shift towards working 24/7 to fix the web site, healthcare.gov, for the new marketplaces where people can buy affordable insurance plans. And today, the web site is working well for the vast majority of users. More problems may pop up, as they always do when you're launching something new. And when they do, we'll fix those too. But what we also know is that after just the first month, despite all the problems in the rollout, about half a million people across the country are poised to gain health care coverage through marketplaces and Medicaid beginning on January 1, some for the very first time. We know that: half a million people. And that number is increasing every day, and it is going to keep growing and growing and growing because we know that there are 41 million people out there without health insurance. And we know there are a whole bunch of folks out there who are underinsured or don't have a good deal. And we know the demand is there, and we know that the product on these marketplaces is good and it provides choice and competition for people that allow them, in some cases for the very first time, to have the security that health insurance can provide. <p>The bottom line is, this law is working and will work into the future. People want the financial stability of health insurance. And we're going to keep on working to fix whatever problems come up. In any startup, any launch of a project this big that has an impact on one-sixth of our economy, whatever comes up we're going to just fix it because we know that the ultimate goal, the ultimate aim, is to make sure that people have basic security and the foundation for the good health that they need. <p>Now, we may never satisfy the law's opponents. I think that's fair to say. Some of them are rooting for this law to fail. That's not my opinion, by the way; they say it pretty explicitly. [<i>Laughter</i>] Some have already convinced themselves that the law has failed, regardless of the evidence. But I would advise them to check with the people who are here today and the people that they represent all across the country whose lives have been changed for the better by the Affordable Care Act. <p>The other day I got a letter from Julia Walsh in California. Earlier this year, Julia was diagnosed with leukemia and lymphoma. \\"I have a lot of things to worry about,\\" she wrote. \\"But thanks to the [Affordable Care Act], there are lots of things I do not have to worry about, like . . . whether there will be a lifetime cap on benefits [or] whether my treatment will bankrupt my family. . . . I can't begin to tell you how much that peace of mind means. . . .\\" That's what the Affordable Care Act means to Julia. She already had insurance, by the way, but because this law banned lifetime limits on the care you or your family can receive, she's never going to have to choose between providing for her kids or getting herself well; she can do both. <p>Sam Weir, a doctor in North Carolina, e-mailed me the other day. \\"The coming years will be challenging for all of us in family medicine,\\" he wrote. \\"But my colleagues and I draw strength from knowing that beginning with the new year, the preventive care many of our current patients have been putting off will be covered and the patients we have not yet seen will finally be able to get the care that they have long needed.\\" That's the difference that the Affordable Care Act will make for many of Dr. Weir's patients. Because more than a hundred million Americans with insurance have gained access to recommended preventive care like mammograms or colonoscopies or flu shots or contraception to help them stay healthy, at no out-of-pocket cost. <p>At the young age of 23, Justine Ula is battling cancer for the second time. And the other day, her mom Joann e-mailed me from Cleveland University Hospital where Justine is undergoing treatment. She told me she stopped by the pharmacy to pick up Justine's medicine. If Justine were uninsured, it would have cost her $4,500. But she is insured because the Affordable Care Act has let her and 3 million other young people like Monica gain coverage by staying on their parent's plan until they're 26. And that means Justine's mom, all she had to cover was the $25 copay. <p>Because of the Affordable Care Act, more than 7 million seniors and Americans with disabilities have saved an average of $1,200 on their prescription medicine. This year alone, 8.5 million families have actually gotten an average of a hundred dollars back from their insurance company&mdash;you don't hear that very often&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;because it spent too much on things like overhead and not enough on their care. And by the way, health care costs are rising at the slowest rate in 50 years. So we're actually bending the cost of health care overall, which benefits everybody. <p>So that's what this law means to millions of Americans. And my main message today is, we're not going back. We're not going to betray Monica or Julia or Sam or Justine or Joann. I mean, that seems to be the only alternative that Obamacare's critics have is, well, let's just go back to the status quo, because they sure haven't presented an alternative. If you ask many of the opponents of this law what exactly they'd do differently, their answer seems to be, well, let's go back to the way things used to be. <p>Just the other day, the Republican leader in the Senate was asked what benefits people without health care might see from this law. And he refused to answer, even though there are dozens in this room and tens of thousands in his own State who are already on track to benefit from it. He just repeated \\"repeal\\" over and over and over again. And obviously, we've heard that from a lot of folks on that side of the aisle. <p>Look, I've always said I will work with anybody to implement and improve this law effectively. I mean, if you've got good ideas, bring them to me. Let's go. But we're not repealing it as long as I'm President, and I want everybody to be clear about that. <p>We will make it work for all Americans. If you don't like this law&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. So, if despite all the millions of people who are benefiting from it, you still think this law is a bad idea, then you've got to tell us specifically what you'd do differently to cut costs, cover more people, make insurance more secure. You can't just say that the system was working with 41 million people without health insurance. You can't just say that the system's working when you've got a whole bunch of folks who thought they had decent insurance and then when they got sick, it turned out, it wasn't there for them or they were left with tens of thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs that were impossible for them to pay. <p>Right now what that law is doing&mdash;&mdash; <p>[<i>At this point, a baby in the audience made a noise.</i>] <p>Yes, you agree with me. [<i>Laughter</i>] Right now what this law is doing is helping folks, and we're just getting started with the exchanges, just getting started with the marketplaces. So we're not going to walk away from it. If I've got to fight another 3 years to make sure this law works, then that's what I'll do. [<i>Applause</i>] That's what we'll do. <p>But what's important for everybody to remember is not only that the law has already helped millions of people, but that there are millions more who stand to be helped. And we've got to make sure they know that. And I've said very clearly that our poor execution in the first couple months on the web site clouded the fact that there are a whole bunch of people who stand to benefit. Now that the web site is working for the vast majority of people, we need to make sure that folks refocus on what's at stake here, which is the capacity for you or your families to be able to have the security of decent health insurance at a reasonable cost through choice and competition on this marketplace and tax credits that you may be eligible for that can save you hundreds of dollars in premium costs every month, potentially. <p>So we just need people to&mdash;now that we are getting the technology fixed, we need you to go back, take a look at what's actually going on, because it can make a difference in your lives and the lives of your families. And maybe it won't make a difference right now if you're feeling healthy, but I promise you, if somebody in your family, heaven forbid, gets sick, you'll see the difference. And it will make all the difference for you and your families. <p>So I'm going to need some help in spreading the word. I'm going to need some help in spreading the word. I need you to spread the word about the law, about its benefits, about its protections, about how folks can sign up. Tell your friends. Tell your family. Do not let the initial problems with the web site discourage you because it's working better now and it's just going to keep on working better over time. Every day, I check to make sure that it's working better. [<i>Laughter</i>] And we've learned not to make wild promises about how perfectly smooth it's going to be at all times, but if you really want health insurance through the marketplaces, you're going to be able to get on and find the information that you need for your families at healthcare.gov. <p>So if you've already got health insurance or you've already taken advantage of the Affordable Care Act, you've got to tell your friends, you've got to tell your family. Tell your coworkers. Tell your neighbors. Let's help our fellow Americans get covered. Let's give every American a fighting chance in today's economy. All right? <p>Thank you so much, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"258" "\"Hey! Hello, everybody. Hello, hello. Good to see you. Everybody, sit down. Good afternoon. Welcome to the White House. This is a little bit of a rowdy bunch. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>The&mdash;well, it is wonderful to be with all of you, and I couldn't be more appreciative of all the stuff that you guys are doing all across the country in your communities, in your organizations. There was a time when I was a young invincible. [<i>Laughter</i>] After 5 years in this office, people don't call me that anymore. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But I just wanted to drop by and say thank you for everything that you've done and will do to spread the word about the Affordable Care Act and what it means for young people. About a year ago, I got a letter from a woman in her twenties; she had just graduated from law school. And she wrote: \\"Thank you for making health care reform a priority. If you hadn't, you probably would have fewer gray hairs right now.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] That's a good point. But her story is a reminder that the law was worth a few gray hairs, because she was one of the 3.1 million young people that this law helped to cover because they could join their parent's plan. And that means that when she was diagnosed with a potentially deadly autoimmune disorder, she got the care she needed: medications, blood transfusions, ultimately lifesaving surgery. <p>She was able to stay in school, graduate first in her class, find a job in her field. And in the letter she wrote: \\"I'm grateful because the Affordable Care Act saved my life. It saved my family from bankruptcy, and it gave me a future.\\" So that's what this law is about: health care that's there for you when you need it, financial protection for you and your family if you get sick, the security of knowing that an illness or an accident is not going to completely derail your dreams. <p>And there are a lot of benefits that are especially important to young people. Insurance companies now have to provide free preventive care that will help you stay healthy. They'll have to provide contraceptive care for women at no extra cost. If you wanted to take a chance and start your own business or try multiple careers like many young people do&mdash;particularly in this economy&mdash;before you settle down, you're not going to have to wonder whether or not you can do that because you're worried about coverage. When you do settle down and start a family, maternal care will be covered. If you're a woman, you won't be charged twice as much as men because you're the one carrying the baby. <p>So this law is already making a difference for millions of young people, and it's about to help millions more. About half a million people across the country already are poised to gain coverage on January 1, some for the very first time. One recent article reported that a surprisingly large number of young people are signing up. And there's a good reason for that: The law works. Most young people without insurance can now get covered for under a hundred bucks a month. <p>Now, I am not allowed, for security reasons, to have an iPhone. [<i>Laughter</i>] I don't know what your bills are. I have noticed that Sasha and Malia seem to spend a lot of time on it. [<i>Laughter</i>] My suspicion is that for a lot of you, between your cable bill, your phone bill, you're spending more than a hundred bucks a month. The idea that you wouldn't want to make sure that you've got the health security and financial security that comes with health insurance for less than that price, you guys are smarter than that. And most young people are as well. <p>The product is good. It's affordable. People want financial stability of health insurance. We're going to keep working through any glitches, problems that may come up. Obviously, the website, when it was first launched, wasn't in tiptop shape, to say the least. But we have been, 24/7, going at it. And now, for the vast majority of users, it's working. And there will be other things that come up during the course of the next several months, because you're starting off a new program that has an impact on one-sixth of the economy. This is a \\"big deal,\\" to quote Joe Biden. And so&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>But we're just going to keep on working on it and improving it and refining it. And if we see a problem, we're going to fix it. But we're not repealing it&mdash;not as long as I'm President&mdash;particularly because the folks who are criticizing it don't seem to have any ideas in terms of how to reduce costs, ensure millions of people get coverage for the first time, make sure that insurance is more secure. Those are things that the law is already doing. <p>And we're going to have to just make sure that people know about it. And that's why I'm here, because I need your help. That's why you're here, because you know I need your help. Believe it or not, there are actually organizations that are out there working to convince young people not to get insurance. <p>Now, think about that. That's a really bizarre way to spend your money, to try to convince people not to get health insurance, not to get free preventive care, not to make sure that they're able to survive an accident or an illness. If I had that much money, I wouldn't be spending it that way. And some of these ad campaigns are backed by well-funded special interest groups. I assume they've got great health care. <p>And just remember and remind your friends and your peers: Imagine what happens if you get sick, what happens with the massive bills. I&mdash;the people who are running those ads, they're not going to pay for your illness. You're going to pay for it, or your family is going to pay for it. And that's hard to imagine. <p>Look, I do remember what it's like being 27 or 28, and aside from the occasional basketball injury, most of the time I kind of felt like I had nothing to worry about. Of course, that's what most people think until they have something to worry about. But at that point, oftentimes it's too late. And sometimes in this debate, what we've heard are people saying, well, I don't need this, I don't want this. What's&mdash;why are you impinging on my freedom to do whatever I want? <p>And part of what I say to folks when they tell me that is, if you get sick and you get to the hospital and you don't have any coverage, then somebody else is also going to be paying for it. It may be your family that can't afford it, or it may be everybody else who does have health insurance and is acting responsibly and is essentially subsidizing for your care. And that's not what I think most young people want. They want to be independent, and this is part of feeling and being, financially and from a health perspective, secure. <p>So I'm going to need you all to spread the word about how the Affordable Care Act really works, what its benefits are, what its protections are, and most importantly, how people can sign up. I know people call this law Obamacare. And that's okay&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;because I do care, and&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I do. I care about you. I care about families. I care about Americans. But no matter how much I care, the truth is, is that for your friends and your family, the most important source of information is not going to be me, it's going to be you. They are going to trust you. If you're taking them on a website, walking them through it, saying, look at the price you're able to get, look at the benefits you're able to get, that's what's going to be making a difference. <p>So if you're a student body president, set up a conference on campus. If you work at a nonprofit, open your doors and use your e-mail list to help people learn the facts. If you've got a radio show, spread the word on air. If you're a bartender, have a happy hour&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and also probably get health insurance, because a lot of bartenders don't have it. Post something on your Facebook or Instagram. You can tweet using the hashtag  getcovered. But do whatever it takes to make sure people have the information they need to make the decision that's right for them. <p>If you're in a State that has its own State exchange, they're probably doing a lot of activities, and you should plug into those as well. If you're in a State that so far has not decided to set up a State exchange, then obviously, we can make sure that you have all the information you need to succeed. But the bottom line is I'm going to need you, and the country needs you. And a lot of your friends and peers, they may not know that they need you, but if something happens somewhere down the road where they really need to get to a hospital or a doctor, the fact that you have talked to them and gotten them involved is going to make all the difference in the world. <p>And finally, let me just make a broader point to all the young people here. This whole exercise obviously has huge implications for this country's future, because if we can start bringing down health care costs, make sure people are covered, give people financial security, that's good for the economy, it's good for businesses, it's good for the Federal budget. <p>But I hope you haven't been discouraged by how hard it's been, because stuff that's worth it's always hard. The Civil Rights Movement was hard. Getting women the right to vote, that was hard. Making sure that workers had the right to organize, that was hard. It's never been easy for us to change how we do business in this country and particularly to address needs that a lot of people aren't worried about on a day-to-day, constant basis, but then suddenly are desperately worried about it when a mishap happens. <p>So this has been the case for Social Security, for Medicare, for all the great social progress that we've made in this country. And I wanted to say all that just because my hope is not only that you work hard to help folks get signed up today and tomorrow and next week, but I look around the room and I see a lot of leaders who are going to be leading the charge well into the future on a whole range of issues. Don't get discouraged. Be persistent. You may get a few gray hairs as a consequence&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but I think at the end of the day you'll think it's worth it. All right? <p>Thank you, guys. See you.\""
"259" "\"Thank you so much. Please, please have a seat. Thank you so much. Well, thank you, Neera, for the wonderful introduction and sharing a story that resonated with me. There were a lot of parallels in my life and probably resonated with some of you. <p>Over the past 10 years, the Center for American Progress has done incredible work to shape the debate over expanding opportunity for all Americans. And I could not be more grateful to CAP not only for giving me a lot of good policy ideas, but also giving me a lot of staff. [<i>Laughter</i>] My friend, John Podesta, ran my transition; my Chief of Staff, Denis McDonough, did a stint at CAP. So you guys are obviously doing a good job training folks. <p>I also want to thank all the Members of Congress and my administration who are here today for the wonderful work that they do. I want to thank Mayor Gray and everyone here at THEARC for having me. This center, which I've been to quite a bit and have had a chance to see some of the great work that's done here&mdash;and all the nonprofits that call THEARC home offer access to everything from education, to health care, to a safe shelter from the streets, which means that you're harnessing the power of community to expand opportunity for folks here in DC. And your work reflects a tradition that runs through our history: the belief that we're greater together than we are on our own. And that's what I've come here to talk about today. <p>Now, over the last 2 months, Washington has been dominated by some pretty contentious debates; I think that's fair to say. And between a reckless shutdown by congressional Republicans in an effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act and admittedly poor execution on my administration's part in implementing the latest stage of the new law, nobody has acquitted themselves very well these past few months. So it's not surprising that the American people's frustrations with Washington are at an alltime high. <p>But we know that people's frustrations run deeper than these most recent political battles. Their frustration's rooted in their own daily battles: to make ends meet, to pay for college, buy a home, save for retirement. It's rooted in the nagging sense that no matter how hard they work, the deck is stacked against them. And it's rooted in the fear that their kids won't be better off than they were. They may not follow the constant back and forth in Washington or all the policy details, but they experience in a very personal way the relentless, decades-long trend that I want to spend some time talking about today. And that is a dangerous and growing inequality and lack of upward mobility that has jeopardized middle class America's basic bargain: that if you work hard, you have a chance to get ahead. <p>I believe this is the defining challenge of our time: making sure our economy works for every working American. It's why I ran for President. It was at the center of last year's campaign. It drives everything I do in this office. And I know I've raised this issue before, and some will ask why I raise the issue again right now. I do it because the outcomes of the debates we're having right now&mdash;whether it's health care or the budget or reforming our housing and financial systems&mdash;all these things will have real, practical implications for every American. And I am convinced that the decisions we make on these issues over the next few years will determine whether or not our children will grow up in an America where opportunity is real. <p>Now, the premise that we're all created equal is the opening line in the American story. And while we don't promise equal outcomes, we've strived to deliver equal opportunity: the idea that success doesn't depend on being born into wealth or privilege, it depends on effort and merit. And with every chapter we've added to that story, we've worked hard to put those words into practice. <p>It was Abraham Lincoln, a self-described \\"poor man's son,\\" who started a system of land grant colleges all over this country so that any poor man's son could go learn something new. When farms gave way to factories, a rich man's son named Teddy Roosevelt fought for an 8-hour workday, protections for workers, and busted monopolies that kept prices high and wages low. When millions lived in poverty, FDR fought for Social Security, and insurance for the unemployed, and a minimum wage. When millions died without health insurance, LBJ fought for Medicare and Medicaid. <p>Together, we forged a New Deal, declared a War on Poverty and a Great Society. We built a ladder of opportunity to climb and stretched out a safety net beneath so that if we fell, it wouldn't be too far, and we could bounce back. And as a result, America built the largest middle class the world has ever known. And for the three decades after World War II, it was the engine of our prosperity. <p>Now, we can't look at the past through rose-colored glasses. The economy didn't always work for everyone. Racial discrimination locked millions out of poverty&mdash;or out of opportunity. Women were too often confined to a handful of often poorly paid professions. And it was only through painstaking struggle that more women and minorities and Americans with disabilities began to win the right to more fairly and fully participate in the economy. <p>Nevertheless, during the post-World War II years, the economic ground felt stable and secure for most Americans, and the future looked brighter than the past. And for some, that meant following in your old man's footsteps at the local plant, and you knew that a blue-collar job would let you buy a home and a car, maybe a vacation once in a while, health care, a reliable pension. For others, it meant going to college, in some cases, maybe the first in your family to go to college. And it meant graduating without taking on loads of debt and being able to count on advancement through a vibrant job market. <p>Now, it's true that those at the top, even in those years, claimed a much larger share of income than the rest: The top 10 percent consistently took home about one-third of our national income. But that kind of inequality took place in a dynamic market economy where everyone's wages and incomes were growing. And because of upward mobility, the guy on the factory floor could picture his kid running the company some day. <p>But starting in the late seventies, this social compact began to unravel. Technology made it easier for companies to do more with less, eliminating certain job occupations. A more competitive world let companies ship jobs anywhere. And as good manufacturing jobs automated or headed offshore, workers lost their leverage, jobs paid less and offered fewer benefits. <p>As values of community broke down and competitive pressure increased, businesses lobbied Washington to weaken unions and the value of the minimum wage. As a trickle-down ideology became more prominent, taxes were slashed for the wealthiest, while investments in things that make us all richer, like schools and infrastructure, were allowed to wither. And for a certain period of time, we could ignore this weakening economic foundation, in part because more families were relying on two earners as women entered the workforce. We took on more debt financed by a juiced-up housing market. But when the music stopped and the crisis hit, millions of families were stripped of whatever cushion they had left. <p>And the result is an economy that's become profoundly unequal and families that are more insecure. I'll just give you a few statistics. Since 1979, when I graduated from high school, our productivity is up by more than 90 percent, but the income of the typical family has increased by less than 8 percent. Since 1979, our economy has more than doubled in size, but most of that growth has flowed to a fortunate few. <p>The top 10 percent no longer takes in one-third of our income, it now takes half. Whereas in the past, the average CEO made about 20 to 30 times the income of the average worker, today's CEO now makes 273 times more. And meanwhile, a family in the top 1 percent has a net worth 288 times higher than the typical family, which is a record for this country. <p>So the basic bargain at the heart of our economy has frayed. In fact, this trend towards growing inequality is not unique to America's market economy. Across the developed world, inequality has increased. Some of you may have seen, just last week, the Pope himself spoke about this at eloquent length. \\"How can it be,\\" he wrote, \\"that it is not a news item when an elderly homeless person dies of exposure, but it is news when the stock market loses two points?\\" <p>But this increasing inequality is most pronounced in our country, and it challenges the very essence of who we are as a people. Understand, we've never begrudged success in America, we aspire to it. We admire folks who start new businesses, create jobs, and invent the products that enrich our lives, and we expect them to be rewarded handsomely for it. In fact, we've often accepted more income inequality than many other nations for one big reason: because we were convinced that America is a place where even if you're born with nothing, with a little hard work, you can improve your own situation over time and build something better to leave your kids. As Lincoln once said, \\"While we do not propose any war upon capital, we do wish to allow the humblest man an equal chance to get rich with everybody else.\\" <p>The problem is that alongside increased inequality, we've seen diminished levels of upward mobility in recent years. A child born in the top 20 percent has about a 2-in-3 chance of staying at or near the top. A child born into the bottom 20 percent has a less than 1-in-20 shot at making it to the top. He's 10 times likelier to stay where he is. In fact, statistics show not only that our levels of income inequality rank near countries like Jamaica and Argentina, but that it is harder today for a child born here in America to improve her station in life than it is for children in most of our wealthy allies: countries like Canada or Germany or France. They have greater mobility than we do, not less. <p>The idea that so many children are born into poverty in the wealthiest nation on Earth is heartbreaking enough. But the idea that a child may never be able to escape that poverty because she lacks a decent education or health care or a community that views her future as their own, that should offend all of us, and it should compel us to action. We are a better country than this. <p>So let me repeat: The combined trends of increased inequality and decreasing mobility pose a fundamental threat to the American Dream, our way of life, and what we stand for around the globe. And it is not simply a moral claim that I'm making here. There are practical consequences to rising inequality and reduced mobility. <p>For one thing, these trends are bad for oureconomy. One study finds that growth is more fragile and recessions are more frequent in countries with greater inequality. And that makes sense. When families have less to spend, that means businesses have fewer customers and households rack up greater mortgage and credit card debt. Meanwhile, concentrated wealth at the top is less likely to result in the kind of broadly based consumer spending that drives our economy, and together with lax regulation, may contribute to risky speculative bubbles. <p>And rising inequality and declining mobility are also bad for our families and social cohesion, not just because we tend to trust our institutions less, but studies show, we actually tend to trust each other less when there's greater inequality. And greater inequality is associated with less mobility between generations. That means it's not just temporary; the effects last. It creates a vicious cycle. For example, by the time she turns 3 years old, a child born into a low-income home hears 30 million fewer words than a child from a well-off family, which means by the time she starts school, she's already behind, and that deficit can compound itself over time. <p>And finally, rising inequality and declining mobility are bad for our democracy. Ordinary folks can't write massive campaign checks or hire high-priced lobbyists and lawyers to secure policies that tilt the playing field in their favor at everyone else's expense. And so people get the bad taste that the system's rigged, and that increases cynicism and polarization, and it decreases the political participation that is a requisite part of our system of self-government. <p>So this is an issue that we have to tackle head on. And if in fact the majority of Americans agree that our number-one priority is to restore opportunity and broad-based growth for all Americans, the question is, why has Washington consistently failed to act? And I think a big reason is the myths that have developed around the issue of inequality. <p>First, there is the myth that this is a problem restricted to a small share of predominantly minority poor, that this isn't a broad-based problem, this is a Black problem or a Hispanic problem or a Native American problem. Now, it's true that the painful legacy of discrimination means that African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans are far more likely to suffer from a lack of opportunity: higher unemployment, higher poverty rates. It's also true that women still make 77 cents on the dollar compared to men. So we're going to need strong application of antidiscrimination laws. We're going to need immigration reform that grows the economy and takes people out of the shadows. We're going to need targeted initiatives to close those gaps. <p>But here's an important point. The decades-long shifts in the economy have hurt all groups: poor and middle class, inner-city and rural folks, men and women, and Americans of all races. And as a consequence, some of the social patterns that contribute to declining mobility that were once attributed to the urban poor that's a particular problem for the inner city&mdash; single-parent households or drug abuse&mdash;it turns out, now we're seeing that pop up everywhere. <p>A new study shows that disparities in education, mental health, obesity, absent fathers, isolation from church, isolation from community groups&mdash;these gaps are now as much about growing up rich or poor as they are about anything else. The gap in test scores between poor kids and wealthy kids is now nearly twice what it is between White kids and Black kids. Kids with working class parents are 10 times likelier than kids with middle or upper class parents to go through a time when their parents have no income. So the fact is this: The opportunity gap in America is now as much about class as it is about race, and that gap is growing. <p>So if we're going to take on growing inequality and try to improve upward mobility for all people, we've got to move beyond the false notion that this is an issue exclusively of minority concern. And we have to reject a politics that suggests any effort to address it in a meaningful way somehow pits the interests of a deserving middle class against those of an undeserving poor in search of handouts. <p>Second, we need to dispel the myth that the goals of growing the economy and reducing inequality are necessarily in conflict, when they should actually work in concert. We know from our history that our economy grows best from the middle out, when growth is more widely shared. And we know that beyond a certain level of inequality, growth actually slows altogether. <p>Third, we need to set aside the belief that government cannot do anything about reducing inequality. It's true that government cannot prevent all the downsides of the technological change and global competition that are out there right now, and some of those forces are also some of the things that are helping us grow. And it's also true that some programs in the past, like welfare before it was reformed, were sometimes poorly designed, created disincentives to work. <p>But we've also seen how government action, time and again, can make an enormous difference in increasing opportunity and bolstering ladders into the middle class. Investments in education, laws establishing collective bargaining, and a minimum wage&mdash;these all contributed to rising standards of living for massive numbers of Americans. Likewise, when previous generations declared that every citizen of this country deserved a basic measure of security&mdash;a floor through which they could not fall&mdash;we helped millions of Americans live in dignity and gave millions more the confidence to aspire to something better, by taking a risk on a great idea. <p>Without Social Security, nearly half of seniors would be living in poverty. Half. Today, fewer than 1 in 10 do. Before Medicare, only half of all seniors had some form of health insurance. Today, virtually all do. And because we've strengthened that safety net and expanded prowork and profamily tax credits like the earned income tax credit, a recent study found that the poverty rate has fallen by 40 percent since the 1960s. And these endeavors didn't just make us a better country, they reaffirmed that we are a great country. <p>So we can make a difference on this. In fact, that's our generation's task: to rebuild America's economic and civic foundation to continue the expansion of opportunity for this generation and the next generation. And like Neera, I take this personally. I'm only here because this country educated my grandfather on the GI bill. When my father left and my mom hit hard times trying to raise my sister and me while she was going to school, this country helped make sure we didn't go hungry. When Michelle, the daughter of a shift worker at a water plant and a secretary, wanted to go to college, just like me, this country helped us afford it until we could pay it back. <p>So what drives me as a grandson, a son, a father&mdash;as an American&mdash;is to make sure that every striving, hard-working, optimistic kid in America has the same incredible chance that this country gave me. It has been the driving force between everything we've done these past 5 years. And over the course of the next year and for the rest of my Presidency, that's where you should expect my administration to focus all our efforts. <p>Now, you'll be pleased to know, this is not a State of the Union Address. [<i>Laughter</i>] And many of the ideas that can make the biggest difference in expanding opportunity I've presented before. But let me offer a few key principles, just a roadmap that I believe should guide us in both our legislative agenda and our administrative efforts. <p>To begin with, we have to continue to relentlessly push a growth agenda. It may be true that in today's economy, growth alone does not guarantee higher wages and incomes. We've seen that. But what's also true is, we can't tackle inequality if the economic pie is shrinking or stagnant. The fact is, if you're a progressive and you want to help the middle class and the working poor, you've still got to be concerned about competitiveness and productivity and business confidence that spurs private sector investment. <p>And that's why, from day one, we've worked to get the economy growing and help our businesses hire. And thanks to their resilience and innovation, they've created nearly 8 million new jobs over the past 44 months. And now we've got to grow the economy even faster. And we've got to keep working to make America a magnet for good, middle class jobs to replace the ones that we've lost in recent decades: jobs in manufacturing and energy and infrastructure and technology. <p>And that means simplifying our corporate Tax Code in a way that closes wasteful loopholes and ends incentives to ship jobs overseas. We can&mdash;and by broadening the base, we can actually lower rates to encourage more companies to hire here and use some of the money we save to create good jobs rebuilding our roads and our bridges and our airports and all the infrastructure our businesses need. <p>It means a trade agenda that grows exports and works for the middle class. It means streamlining regulations that are outdated or unnecessary or too costly. And it means coming together around a responsible budget, one that grows our economy faster right now and shrinks our long-term deficits; one that unwinds the harmful sequester cuts that haven't made a lot of sense and then frees up resources to invest in things like the scientific research that's always unleashed new innovation and new industries. <p>When it comes to our budget, we should not be stuck in a stale debate from 2 years ago or 3 years ago. A relentlessly growing deficit of opportunity is a bigger threat to our future than our rapidly shrinking fiscal deficit. <p>So that's step one towards restoring mobility: making sure our economy is growing faster. Step two is making sure we empower more Americans with the skills and education they need to compete in a highly competitive global economy. <p>We know that education is the most important predictor of income today, so we launched a Race to the Top in our schools. We're supporting States that have raised standards for teaching and learning. We're pushing for redesigned high schools that graduate more kids with the technical training and apprenticeships and in-demand, high-tech skills that can lead directly to a good job and a middle class life. <p>We know it's harder to find a job today without some higher education, so we've helped more students go to college with grants and loans that go farther than before. We've made it more practical to repay those loans. And today, more students are graduating from college than ever before. And we're also pursuing an aggressive strategy to promote innovation that reins in tuition costs. We've got to lower costs so that young people are not burdened by enormous debt when they make the right decision to get higher education. And next week, Michelle and I will bring together college presidents and nonprofits to lead a campaign to help more low-income students attend and succeed in college. <p>But while higher education may be the surest path to the middle class, it's not the only one. So we should offer our people the best technical education in the world. That's why we've worked to connect local businesses with community colleges so that workers, young and old, can earn the new skills that earn them more money. <p>And I've also embraced an idea that I know all of you at the Center for American Progress have championed&mdash;and by the way, Republican Governors in a couple of States have championed&mdash;and that's making high-quality preschool available to every child in America. We know that kids in these programs grow up likelier to get more education, earn higher wages, form more stable families of their own. It starts a virtuous cycle, not a vicious one. And we should invest in that. We should give all of our children that chance. <p>And as we empower our young people for future success, the third part of this middle class economics is empowering our workers. It's time to ensure our collective bargaining laws function as they're supposed to so unions have a level playing field to organize for a better deal for workers and better wages for the middle class. It's time to pass the \\"Paycheck Fairness Act\\" so that women will have more tools to fight pay discrimination. It's time to pass the non&mdash;\\"Employment \\\\"Non-Discrimination Act\\" so workers can't be fired for who they are or who they love. <p>And even though we're bringing manufacturing jobs back to America&mdash;we're creating more good-paying jobs in education and health care and business services&mdash;we know that we're going to have a greater and greater portion of our people in the service sector. And we know that there are airport workers and fast food workers and nurse assistants and retail salespeople who work their tails off and are still living at or barely above poverty. And that's why it's well past the time to raise a minimum wage that in real terms right now is below where it was when Harry Truman was in office. <p>This shouldn't be an ideological question. It was Adam Smith, the father of free-market economics, who once said, \\"They who feed, clothe, and lodge the whole body of the people should have such a share of the produce of their own labor as to be themselves tolerably well fed, clothed, and lodged.\\" And for those of you who don't speak old English&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;let me translate. It means if you work hard, you should make a decent living. If you work hard, you should be able to support a family. <p>Now, we all know the arguments that have been used against a higher minimum wage. Some say it actually hurts low-wage workers: Business will be less likely to hire them. But there's no solid evidence that a higher minimum wage costs jobs, and research shows, it raises incomes for low-wage workers and boosts short-term economic growth. <p>Others argue that if we raise the minimum wage, companies will just pass those costs on to consumers. But a growing chorus of businesses, small and large, argue differently. And already, there are extraordinary companies in America that provide decent wages, salaries, and benefits and training for their workers and deliver a great product to consumers. <p>SAS in North Carolina offers childcare and sick leave. REI, a company my Secretary of the Interior used to run, offers retirement plans and strives to cultivate a good work balance. There are companies out there that do right by their workers. They recognize that paying a decent wage actually helps their bottom line, reduces turnover. It means workers have more money to spend, to save, maybe eventually start a business of their own. <p>A broad majority of Americans agree we should raise the minimum wage. That's why last month voters in New Jersey decided to become the 20th State to raise theirs even higher. That's why yesterday the DC Council voted to do it too. I agree with those voters. I agree with those voters, and I'm going to keep pushing until we get a higher minimum wage for hard-working Americans across the entire country. It will be good for our economy. It will be good for our families. <p>Number four, as I alluded to earlier, we still need targeted programs for the communities and workers that have been hit hardest by economic change and the great recession. These communities are no longer limited to the inner city. They're found in neighborhoods hammered by the housing crisis, manufacturing towns hit hard by years of plants packing up, landlocked rural areas where young folks oftentimes feel like they've got to leave just to find a job. There are communities that just aren't generating enough jobs anymore. <p>So we've put forward new plans to help these communities and their residents, because we've watched cities like Pittsburgh or my hometown of Chicago revamp themselves. And if we give more cities the tools to do it&mdash;not handouts, but a hand up&mdash;cities like Detroit can do it too. So in a few weeks, we'll announce the first of these Promise Zones, urban and rural communities where we're going to support local efforts focused on a national goal, and that is, a child's course in life should not be determined by the zip code he's born in, but by the strength of his work ethic and the scope of his dreams. <p>And we're also going to have to do more for the long-term unemployed. For people who have been out of work for more than 6 months, often through no fault of their own, life is a catch-22. Companies won't give their r&eacute;sum&eacute; an honest look because they've been laid off so long, but they've been laid off so long because companies won't give their r&eacute;sum&eacute; an honest look. [<i>Laughter</i>] And that's why earlier this year, I challenged CEOs from some of America's best companies to give these Americans a fair shot. And next month, many of them will join us at the White House for an announcement about this. <p>Fifth, we've got to revamp retirement to protect Americans in their golden years, to make sure another housing collapse doesn't steal the savings in their homes. We've also got to strengthen our safety net for a new age so it doesn't just protect people who hit a run of bad luck from falling into poverty, but also propels them back out of poverty. <p>Today, nearly half of full-time workers and 80 percent of part-time workers don't have a pension or retirement account at their job. About half of all households don't have any retirement savings. So we're going to have to do more to encourage private savings and shore up the promise of Social Security for future generations. And remember, these are promises we made to one another. We don't do it to replace the free market, but we do it to reduce risk in our society by giving people the ability to take a chance and catch them if they fall. One study shows that more than half of Americans will experience poverty at some point during their adult lives. Think about that. This is not an isolated situation. More than half of Americans at some point in their lives will experience poverty. <p>That's why we have nutrition assistance or the program known as SNAP, because it makes a difference for a mother who's working, but is just having a hard time putting food on the table for her kids. That's why we have unemployment insurance, because it makes a difference for a father who lost his job and is out there looking for a new one that he can keep a roof over his kids' heads. By the way, Christmas time is no time for Congress to tell more than 1 million of these Americans that they have lost their unemployment insurance, which is what will happen if Congress does not act before they leave on their holiday vacation. <p>The point is, these programs are not typically hammocks for people to just lie back and relax. These programs are almost always temporary means for hard-working people to stay afloat while they try to find a new job or go into school to retrain themselves for the jobs that are out there or sometimes just to cope with a bout of bad luck. Progressives should be open to reforms that actually strengthen these programs and make them more responsive to a 21st-century economy. For example, we should be willing to look at fresh ideas to revamp unemployment and disability programs to encourage faster and higher rates of reemployment without cutting benefits. We shouldn't weaken fundamental protections built over generations, because given the constant churn in today's economy and the disabilities that many of our friends and neighbors live with, they're needed more than ever. We should strengthen them and adapt them to new circumstances so they work even better. <p>But understand that these programs of social insurance benefit all of us, because we don't know when we might have a run of bad luck. We don't know when we might lose a job. Of course, for decades, there was one yawning gap in the safety net that did more than anything else to expose working families to the insecurities of today's economy: namely, our broken health care system. <p>That's why we fought for the Affordable Care Act, because 14,000 Americans lost their health insurance every single day and even more died each year because they didn't have health insurance at all. We did it because millions of families who thought they had coverage were driven into bankruptcy by out-of-pocket costs that they didn't realize would be there. Tens of millions of our fellow citizens couldn't get any coverage at all. Dr. King once said, \\"Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.\\" <p>Well, not anymore. Because in the 3 years since we passed this law, the share of Americans with insurance is up, the growth of health care costs are down to their slowest rate in 50 years. More people have insurance, and more have new benefits and protections: a hundred million Americans who have gained the right for free preventive care like mammograms and contraception; the more than 7 million Americans who have saved an average of $1,200 on their prescription medicine; every American who won't go broke when they get sick because their insurance can't limit their care anymore. <p>More people without insurance have gained insurance: more than 3 million young Americans who have been able to stay on their parent's plan, the more than half a million Americans and counting who are poised to get covered starting on January 1, some for the very first time. <p>And it is these numbers&mdash;not the ones in any poll&mdash;that will ultimately determine the fate of this law. It's the measurable outcomes in reduced bankruptcies and reduced hours that have been lost because somebody couldn't make it to work and healthier kids with better performance in schools and young entrepreneurs who have the freedom to go out there and try a new idea&mdash;those are the things that will ultimately reduce a major source of inequality and help ensure more Americans get the start that they need to succeed in the future. <p>I have acknowledged more than once that we didn't roll out parts of this law as well as we should have. But the law is already working in major ways that benefit millions of Americans right now, even as we've begun to slow the rise in health care costs, which is good for family budgets, good for Federal and State budgets, and good for the budgets of businesses, small and large. So this law is going to work. And for the sake of our economic security, it needs to work. <p>And as people in States as different as California and Kentucky sign up every single day for health insurance, signing up in droves, they're proving, they want that economic security. If the Senate Republican leader still thinks he is going to be able to repeal this someday, he might want to check with the more than 60,000 people in his home State who are already set to finally have coverage that frees them from the fear of financial ruin and lets them afford to take their kids to see a doctor. <p>So let me end by addressing the elephant in the room here, which is the seeming inability to get anything done in Washington these days. I realize we are not going to resolve all of our political debates over the best ways to reduce inequality and increase upward mobility this year or next year or in the next 5 years. But it is important that we have a serious debate about these issues. For the longer that current trends are allowed to continue, the more it will feed the cynicism and fear that many Americans are feeling right now: that they'll never be able to repay the debt they took on to go to college; they'll never be able to save enough to retire; they'll never see their own children land a good job that supports a family. <p>And that's why, even as I will keep on offering my own ideas for expanding opportunity, I'll also keep challenging and welcoming those who oppose my ideas to offer their own. If Republicans have concrete plans that will actually reduce inequality, build the middle class, provide more ladders of opportunity to the poor, let's hear them. I want to know what they are. If you don't think we should raise the minimum wage, let's hear your idea to increase people's earnings. If you don't think every child should have access to preschool, tell us what you'd do differently to give them a better shot. <p>If you still don't like Obamacare&mdash;and I know you don't&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;even though it's built on market-based ideas of choice and competition in the private sector, then you should explain how exactly you'd cut costs and cover more people and make insurance more secure. You owe it to the American people to tell us what you are for, not just what you're against. That way we can have a vigorous and meaningful debate. That's what the American people deserve. That's what the times demand. It's not enough anymore to just say we should just get our government out of the way and let the unfettered market take care of it, for our experience tells us, that's just not true. <p>Look, I've never believed that government can solve every problem or should, and neither do you. We know that ultimately our strength is grounded in our people: individuals out there, striving, working, making things happen. It depends on community, a rich and generous sense of community; that's at the core of what happens at THEARC here every day. You understand that turning back rising inequality and expanding opportunity requires parents taking responsibility for their kids, kids taking responsibility to work hard. It requires religious leaders who mobilize their congregations to rebuild neighborhoods block by block, requires civic organizations that can help train the unemployed, link them with businesses for the jobs of the future. It requires companies and CEOs to set an example by providing decent wages and salaries and benefits for their workers and a shot for somebody who is down on his or her luck. We know that's our strength: our people, our communities, our businesses. <p>But government can't stand on the sidelines in our efforts because Government is us. It can and should reflect our deepest values and commitments. And if we refocus our energies on building an economy that grows for everybody and gives every child in this country a fair chance at success, then I remain confident that the future still looks brighter than the past and that the best days for this country we love are still ahead. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"260" "\"At his trial in 1964, Nelson Mandela closed his statement from the dock saying: \\"I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.\\" <p>And Nelson Mandela lived for that ideal, and he made it real. He achieved more than could be expected of any man. And today he has gone home. And we have lost one of the most influential, courageous, and profoundly good human beings that any of us will share time with on this Earth. He no longer belongs to us, he belongs to the ages. <p>Through his fierce dignity and unbending will to sacrifice his own freedom for the freedom of others, Madiba transformed South Africa and moved all of us. His journey from a prisoner to a President embodied the promise that human beings and countries can change for the better. His commitment to transfer power and reconcile with those who jailed him set an example that all humanity should aspire to, whether in the lives of nations or our own personal lives. And the fact that he did it all with grace and good humor and an ability to acknowledge his own imperfections only makes the man that much more remarkable. As he once said, \\"I am not a saint, unless you think of a saint as a sinner who keeps on trying.\\" <p>I am one of the countless millions who drew inspiration from Nelson Mandela's life. My very first political action&mdash;the first thing I ever did that involved an issue or a policy or politics&mdash;was a protest against apartheid. I would study his words and his writings. The day he was released from prison gave me a sense of what human beings can do when they're guided by their hopes and not by their fears. And like so many around the globe, I cannot fully imagine my own life without the example that Nelson Mandela set, and so long as I live, I will do what I can to learn from him. <p>To Gra&ccedil;a Machel and his family, Michelle and I extend our deepest sympathy and gratitude for sharing this extraordinary man with us. His life's work meant long days away from those who loved him most. And I only hope that the time spent with him these last few weeks brought peace and comfort to his family. <p>To the people of South Africa, we draw strength from the example of renewal and reconciliation and resilience that you made real. A free South Africa at peace with itself, that's an example to the world, and that's Madiba's legacy to the nation that he loved. <p>We will not likely see the likes of Nelson Mandela again. So it falls to us, as best we can, to forward the example that he set: to make decisions guided not by hate, but by love; to never discount the difference that one person can make; to strive for a future that is worthy of his sacrifice. <p>For now, let us pause and give thanks for the fact that Nelson Mandela lived: a man who took history in his hands and bent the arc of the moral universe towards justice. May God bless his memory and keep him in peace.\" "
"261" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! Welcome to the White House. Now, normally, we just have one Hanukkah reception, but this year, we are hosting two, because we have so many friends to celebrate with, we had to do it twice. And I'll be welcoming a whole other group this evening. Don't tell them, though, but you're my favorite group. [<i>Laughter</i>] It is our own little Hanukkah miracle. The party that was supposed to last only 1 hour will go on for 8. [<i>Laughter</i>] You got that one? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, this is the fifth time I've celebrated Hanukkah as President. But this is my first \\"Thanikkah.\\" Did I say that right? <p><i>Audience member.</i> Thanksgivukkah. <p><i>The President.</i> This intersection of two wonderful holidays has inspired a whole lot of people across America; we are delighted to welcome a few of them here tonight. <p>We've got 10-year-old Asher Weintraub from New York City&mdash;where's Asher? Asher came up with what we believe is the world's first-ever menorah shaped like a turkey. It is called the \\"menurkey\\". [<i>Laughter</i>] Where is the menurkey? I had it just a second ago. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Wait. You just had it. Where is the menurkey? <p><i>The President.</i> We've got to bring in the menurkey out here. I'll continue speaking. You've got to see this. Thank you, Asher, for your spirit and your creativity. <p>We've got Dana Gitell. Where's Dana, who actually coined the term \\"Thanksgivukkah\\".Her sister Deborah&mdash;oh, here's the menurkey. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Team Thanksgivukkah is here! <p><i>The President.</i> There we go. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I'm going to keep this in a special place. <p>So Dana, along with her sister Deborah, expect this term to catch on around the country. Where are they? <p><i>Hebrew SeniorLife Marketing Specialist Dana Reichman Gitell.</i> Right here. <p><i>The President.</i> There they are. Let's see them. Hey, guys. How are you? They've had a lot of fun with their project. But there is a serious side to it, because they've said they always express their gratitude to America, a place where no matter who you are, you can always celebrate your faith. And that same spirit is reflected in the menorah that we're about to light. <p>It was designed by Manfred Anson, who was born in Germany in 1922. And as a child, he lived through the horrors of Kristallnacht and later lost a brother to the Holocaust. But Manfred escaped, and like the Maccabees at the center of the Hanukkah story, he fought against tyranny, serving in the Australian army during World War II. And like the Maccabees, after the war was over, he sought a place where he could live his life and practice his religion free from fear. So for Manfred and millions like him, that place was ultimately America. <p>And Manfred passed away last year, but during his life, he designed this special menorah, with a model of the Statue of Liberty at the base of each candle. I don't know if you've noticed that. In a few moments, all nine Lady Liberties will be shining: a reminder that our country endures as a beacon of hope and of freedom wherever you come from, whatever your faith. <p>And that beacon stays bright because of families like the ones that will join me in lighting the menorah this evening: the Schmitters. Now, dad, Jake, could not be here because he's deployed in Afghanistan. But we are joined by his wonderful wife Drew, his daughters Lainey and Kylie&mdash;go ahead and wave, guys. [<i>Laughter</i>] So, Drew, Lainey, Kylie, I want you to know how proud we are of not only your dad, but also of you. And we're so grateful for the sacrifices that you make on behalf of our country every single day. <p>And tonight we give thanks to all the men and women in uniform and for their families. They make tremendous sacrifices on our behalf, on behalf of our freedom and our security: not only of us, but our allies and friends around the world, including our friends in the State of Israel. And the commitment and the courage of our men and women in uniform and their families is itself a miracle for which we give thanks. <p>As the Festival of Lights draws to a close, let's take one last chance to think about all the miracles we've been lucky enough to experience in our own lives. There are small miracles, like the invention of the menurkey. [<i>Laughter</i>] And then there are big miracles, like the chance to be a part of this great country. <p>The first day of Hanukkah and Thanksgiving won't overlap again for more than 70,000 years. So it's safe to say that this was a once-in-a-lifetime event&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;unless there's a&mdash;really a scientific breakthrough that we don't know about. But while we never may see again another Thanksgivukkah, I know that if we can show the same resilience as Manfred Anson and the same resourcefulness as young Asher, as well as Dana and Deborah, and the same strength as military families like the Schmitters, we will be blessed with many more miracles for years to come. <p>So thank you, everybody. Happy Hanukkah. And now I want to welcome Rabbi Amanda Lurer, a lieutenant in our Navy, to say a blessing. <p><i>Rabbi Amanda Lurer.</i> Hanukkah formally ends tonight as the sun goes down this evening. But it will always be appropriate for us as we gather to remind ourselves and the world of the meaning of this holiday. So in that spirit, in this wonderful gathering, we now kindle the menorah and recite two blessings. And as we kindle the lights, we'll say&mdash;the first one is the <i>she-asa nissim</i> blessing, thanking God for the miraculous capability to bring light to the darkest corners of the world and for leaders who are dedicated to strengthening religious freedoms in our days as in the day of the Maccabees. <p>The second blessing is <i>shehecheyanu</i>, that simple yet powerful prayer of thanksgiving, for the blessing of life, the gift of light and the privilege to celebrate Hanukkah together. Please join me. <p>[<i>At this point, a Hebrew prayer was sung. A second prayer was then recited</i>.] <p><i>The President.</i> All right. <p>[<i>The menorah was lit</i>.] <p><i>The President</i>. Well, thank you all again for being here. We hope you have a wonderful celebration. And we can't stay to party because I got to go back to work. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I do want to make sure that we get a chance to shake hands with all of you briefly as we go by. And again, we just want to thank the Schmitters and make sure to tell dad we're proud of him too. <p><i>Military Spouse Drew Schmitter</i>. Okay. <p><i>The President.</i> Okay. Thank you. Enjoy, everybody. Thank you.\" "
"262" "\"<i>The President.</i> Good evening, everybody. Welcome to the White House, and happy Hanukkah. I should say that normally we just have one Hanukkah reception, but this year, we're hosting two. We have so many friends to celebrate with, we had to do it twice. I welcomed a whole other group this afternoon. But I want you&mdash;don't tell them, this is actually my favorite group right here. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's our own little Hanukkah miracle: The party was only last&mdash;supposed to last for 1 hour, and it's lasted for 8. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to welcome so many friends and leaders from throughout the Jewish community. We are honored to be joined by one-third of our Supreme Court: Justice Ginsburg; Justice Kagan, who is here somewhere&mdash;there she is; and Justice Breyer is here. We've got some outstanding Members of Congress, members of my administration with us, including our new Director of Jewish Outreach, Matt Nosanchuk. Where's Matt? Matt's out here somewhere. <p>I also want to welcome representatives from the State of Israel who are joining us. I&mdash;some of you recall, I had just an extraordinary, magical visit to Israel earlier this year and was proud to reaffirm the alliance between our two great democracies. I also had the opportunity to go to an expo where I saw the best of Israeli technology. And there's been such a burst of innovation and creativity that's taking place, including, by the way, I saw a robot that served me <i>matzah</i>. [<i>Laughter</i>] We were thinking about having that robot here to serve <i>latkes</i>, but we couldn't get him&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;so maybe next year. <p>Obviously, on a note of seriousness, our&mdash;tonight our thoughts and prayers are with the Mandela family in South Africa. They're grieving the loss of a man, a moral giant who embodied the dignity and the courage and the hope and sought to bring about justice not only in South Africa, but, I think, to inspire millions around the world. And he did that: the idea that every single human being ought to be free and that oppression can end and justice can prevail. <p><i>Supreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg</i>. Yes. <p><i>The President.</i> That's what&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. That was a Supreme Court Justice who said \\"yes.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] So I&mdash;that's what Nelson Mandela taught us, and it's that same spirit that brings us here tonight. <p>And over the last 8 days, Jews around the world have gathered with friends and family to light the menorah and retell the story that has been kept alive for more than 2,000 years. And it's a story of miracles, of a light that burned for 8 days when it should have only lasted for 1 and a people who surmounted overwhelming odds to reclaim their historic homeland so they could live their lives in peace and practice their religion in peace. <p>It's a story that has been repeated countless times throughout Jewish history. And as we light the candles tonight, we're reminded that we're still writing new chapters in that story today. In 1922, Abraham and Hayyah Ettinger donated this menorah to their congregation in a small town that's now the Czech Republic. And tragically, the Ettingers&mdash;and their prayer hall&mdash;were lost in the Holocaust. <p>Yet even in the face of tragedy, Jewish communities around the world kept alive a light that would not be extinguished: the hope that freedom would triumph over tyranny. And tonight, we're honored that the menorah that once belonged to the Ettingers will be lit by two Holocaust survivors from the former Czechoslovakia: Margit Meissner and Martin Weiss. The triumph they represent and the triumph this menorah represents, the progress that it represents, the notion that we can join together here tonight reminds us that we can never take our blessings for granted and that we always need to keep working for peace and the freedom that we seek. <p>And that's why we continue to stand up for our values around the world. That's why we stand alongside and partner with those allies who share those values, including the State of Israel. Together with our Israeli friends, we're determined to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. And we're testing whether it's possible through diplomacy to achieve that goal, understanding that we have to remain vigilant. <p>For the first time in a decade, we've halted the progress of Iran's nuclear program. And key parts of the program will be rolled back, even though the toughest of our sanctions remain in place. And that's good for the world and that's good for Israel. Over the coming months, we're going to continue our diplomacy, with the goal of achieving a comprehensive solution that deals with the threat of Iran's nuclear weapons once and for all. And through it all, as always, our commitment to Israel and its security will remain iron clad and unshakeable. <p>Now, building a future of security and peace is not easy. But the story of Hanukkah, of survivors like Margit and Martin&mdash;leaders like Nelson Mandela&mdash;remind us that those who came before us overcame even greater obstacles than those that we face. So let's take strength from their struggles and from their sacrifice. Let's give thanks for miracles, large and small. Let's recommit ourselves to building a future that shines with hope and freedom and peace. I want to thank all of you for the contributions you've made to communities across the country and the many friends who have been so supportive to Michelle and myself during these years. <p>And with that, I want to welcome Rabbi Joshua Sherwin, a lieutenant in the United States Navy, to say a blessing. <p><i>Rabbi Joshua Sherwin</i>. Thank you, Mr. President. As Hanukkah formally ends this evening, it is appropriate for us to gather to remind ourselves and the world the true meaning of this holiday. In that spirit, at this wonderful gathering, we now kindle the menorah and recite two blessings as we kindle these lights: the <i>she-asa nissim</i>, thanking God for the miraculous capability to bring light to the darkest corners of the world and for the leaders who are dedicated to strengthening religious freedom in our days just as the Maccabees did in ancient ones. <i> </i><p>The second <i>bracha</i>: We'll all join together in the <i>shehecheyanu</i>, the simple yet powerful prayer of thanks giving for the blessing of life, for the gift of light, and for the privilege of celebrating this Hanukkah together. I invite you to join me. <p>[<i>At this point, a Hebrew prayer was sung. A second prayer was then recited, and the menorah was lit. A final blessing was sung. Music then began to play.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> They came in a little late, but that's okay. [<i>Laughter</i>] There is only one last piece of business that I need to do. This was prepared for us. Some of you may be aware that Thanksgiving and the first day of Hanukkah converge only every 70,000 years. [<i>Laughter</i>] So presumably, this is the first and the last time that this may be used. [<i>Laughter</i>] This was prepared for us. This is called a \\"menurkey.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And I just wanted to make sure that those of you who were not familiar with the menurkey&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that we had our own here in the White House. [<i>Laughter</i>] Enjoy the reception, everybody. Thank you so much. God bless you. God bless America. Thank you.\" "
"263" "\"Merry Christmas, everybody! Well, this show is always a great way to get in the holiday spirit. Every year, I rehearse my own little act, just in case. But it seems like, yet again, they couldn't find space to squeeze me into the program. [<i>Laughter</i>] You are lucky I'm not singing. <p>First of all, let me thank Secretary Jewell and welcome her to her first Christmas tree lighting. She is doing a great job for our national parks. She used to run one of America's biggest outdoor recreation companies, and now she's charged with protecting the great outdoors for all of us. So we appreciate her, and we want to thank Neil Mulholland and the whole National Park Foundation and National Park Service team for helping to put this beautiful production together. <p>Let's also give it up for Jane Lynch and all the great performers who are doing an incredible job putting us in a festive mood tonight. And to all Americans who are here today and watching at home, we are so glad to be part of this wonderful holiday tradition. <p>For 91 years, the national Christmas tree has stood as a beacon of light and of promise during the holiday season. During times of peace and prosperity, challenge and change, Americans have gathered around our national tree to kick off the holiday season and give thanks for everything that makes this time of year so magical: spending time with friends and family and spreading tidings of peace and good will here at home and around the world. <p>And this year, we give a special measure of gratitude for Nelson Mandela, a man who championed that generosity of spirit. In his life, he blessed us with tremendous grace and unbelievable courage. And we are all privileged to live in a world touched by his goodness. <p>Each Christmas, we celebrate the birth of a child who came into the world with only a stable's roof to shelter Him. But through a life of humility and the ultimate sacrifice, a life guided by faith and kindness towards others, Christ assumed a mighty voice, teaching us lessons of compassion and charity that have lasted more than two millennia. He ministered to the poor. He embraced the outcast. He healed the sick. And in Him we see a living example of scripture that we ought to love others not only through our words, but also through our deeds. <p>It's a message both timeless and universal: No matter what god you pray to or if you pray to none at all, we all have a responsibility to ourselves and to each other to make a difference that is real and lasting. We are our brother's keeper. We are our sister's keeper. <p>And so in this season of generosity, let's reach out to those who need help the most. In this season of reflection, let's make sure that our incredibly brave servicemembers and their families know how much we appreciate their sacrifice. And there are several military families and service men and women here tonight. We are so grateful to you for all that you do. <p>In this season of hope, let us come together as one people, one family, to ensure that we're doing everything we can to keep America the land of endless opportunity and boundless optimism for which we're so thankful. <p>So on behalf of Malia, Sasha, Marian, the First Lady Michelle, plus Bo and Sunny, I want to wish everybody a Merry Christmas and a joyful holiday season. God bless you. God bless our troops. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"264" "\"Hi, everybody. The holiday season is a time for remembering the bonds we share and our obligations to one another as human beings. But right now more than 1 million of our fellow Americans are poised to lose a vital economic lifeline just a few days after Christmas if Congress doesn't do something about it. <p>Our top priority as a country should be restoring opportunity and broad-based economic growth for all Americans. And yesterday we learned that our businesses created about 200,000 jobs in the month of November. That's more than 8 million new jobs in the last 45 months. And the unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in 5 years. <p>But we need to do everything we can to help businesses create more good jobs that pay good wages, even faster. Because the hole that we're still digging out of means that there are still millions of Americans looking for work, often because they've been laid off through no fault of their own. <p>We also have to look out for the Americans working hard to get those jobs. That's why, as a country, we offer temporary unemployment insurance so that job seekers don't fall into poverty and so that when they get that job, they can bounce back more quickly. <p>For many families, it can be the difference between hardship and catastrophe. It makes a difference for a mother who suddenly doesn't know if she'll be able to put food on the table for her kids. It makes a difference for a father who lost his job and is looking for a new one. Last year alone, it lifted 2.5 million people out of poverty and cushioned the blow for many more. <p>But here's the thing: If Members of Congress don't act before they leave on their vacations, 1.3 million Americans will lose this lifeline. These are people we know. They're our friends and neighbors; they sit next to us in church and volunteer in our communities; their kids play with our kids. And they include 20,000 veterans who have served this country with honor. <p>If Congress refuses to act, it won't just hurt families already struggling, it will actually harm our economy. Unemployment insurance is one of the most effective ways there is to boost our economy. When people have money to spend on basic necessities, that means more customers for our businesses and ultimately more jobs. And the evidence shows that unemployment insurance doesn't stop people from trying hard to find work. <p>Just this week, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicted that allowing benefits to expire will be a drag on our economic growth next year. A report by the Department of Labor and my Council of Economic Advisers estimated that it could cost businesses 240,000 jobs. And without the ability to feed their families or pay the bills, many people currently looking for work could stop looking for good. <p>So extending unemployment insurance isn't just the right thing to do for our families, it's the smart thing to do for our economy. And it shouldn't be a partisan issue. For decades, Congress has voted to offer relief to job seekers, including when the unemployment rate was lower than it is today. But now that economic lifeline is in jeopardy, all because Republicans in this Congress&mdash;which is on track to be the most unproductive in history&mdash;have so far refused to extend it. <p>So this holiday season, let's give our fellow Americans who are desperately looking for work the help they need to keep on looking. Let's make it easier for businesses to attract more customers and our economy to grow. And together, let's keep doing everything we can to make this country a place where anyone who works hard has a chance to get ahead. <p>Thanks, everybody, and have a great weekend.\" "
"265" "\"Well, good evening, everyone. On behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the White House. This is truly one of our favorite nights of the year and not just because of everyone who visits the White House; this group also usually wins best dressed award. [<i>Laughter</i>] All of you look spectacular. I am a little disappointed that Carlos Santana wore one of his more conservative shirts this evening. [<i>Laughter</i>] Back in the day, you could see those things from space. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to start by thanking everyone who dedicates themselves to making the Kennedy Center such a wonderful place for the American people to experience the arts: David Rubenstein, the Kennedy Center trustees, and of course, Michael Kaiser, who will conclude 13 years of tremendous service as the President of the Kennedy Center next year. So on behalf of Michelle and myself, we want to all thank Michael so much for the extraordinary work that he has done. <p>As always, this celebration wouldn't be what it is without the enthusiasm of the Cochair of the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities, George Stevens. George. [<i>Applause</i>] And his son Michael. And together, for years they've put on this event to honor the artists whose brilliance has touched our lives. <p>President Kennedy once said of such creative genius that, \\"The highest duty of the writer, the composer, the artist is to remain true to himself and to let the chips fall where they may.\\" Now, that's easy to say when&mdash;as they do for these artists&mdash;the chips usually fall in your favor, whether at Woodstock or the Oscars or elite venues all over the world. <p>But the fact is that the diverse group of extraordinary individuals we honor today haven't just proven themselves to be the best of the best. Despite all their success, all their fame, they've remained true to themselves and inspired the rest of us to do the same. <p>Now, growing up in Harlem, Martina Arroyo's parents told her she could be and do anything. That was, until she said that she wanted to be an opera singer. [<i>Laughter</i>] Her father&mdash;perhaps not fully appreciating the versatility required of an opera singer&mdash;said he didn't want his daughter to be like a can-can girl. [<i>Laughter</i>] In her neighborhood back then, opera was not the obvious career path. And there weren't a lot of opera singers who looked like her that she could look up to. <p>But Martina had a dream she couldn't shake, so she auditioned relentlessly and jumped at any role she could get. Along the way, she earned money by teaching and working as a social worker in New York City. And when she got a call from the Metropolitan Opera asking her to fill in the lead for \\"Aida,\\" she was sure it was just a friend pulling her leg. It wasn't until they called back that she realized the request was real, and she just about fell over in shock. But in that breakout role, she won fans around the world, beloved for her tremendous voice and unparalleled grace. <p>Martina has sung the great roles: Mozart's Donna Anna, Puccini's Madame Butterfly, Verdi's Lady Macbeth, and of course, Aida. She's played the world's stages, from Cincinnati to Paris, to Israel. She's broken through barriers, broadening our notion of what magnificent artists look like and where they come from. <p>And along the way, she's helped people of all ages, all over the world, discover the art form that she loves so deeply. For a lot of folks, it was Martina Arroyo who helped them see and hear and love the beauty and power of opera. And with her charitable foundation, she is nurturing the next generation of performers: smart, talented, driven, and joyous, just like her. For moving us with the power of her voice and empowering others to share theirs too, we honor Martina Arroyo. <p>Now, Herbie Hancock played his first concerto with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra when he was 11 years old. Two years later, he heard a classmate play jazz piano at a variety show and thought: \\"That's my instrument, and he can do that? Why can't I?\\" It turned out, he could. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>By 23, Herbie was playing with Miles Davis in New York and on his way to becoming a jazz legend. And he didn't stop there. In the seventies, he put his electrical engineering studies to work and helped create electronic music. In the eighties, his hit \\"Rockit\\" became an anthem for a fledging new genre called hip-hop. At one recent show, he played alongside an iMac and five iPads. [<i>Laughter</i>] And a few years ago, he became the first jazz artist in 43 years to win a Grammy for best album. <p>But what makes Herbie so special isn't just how he approaches music, it's how he approaches life. He tours the world as a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador. He's done so many benefit concerts that Joni Mitchell once gave him a watch inscribed with the words: \\"He played real good for free.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] And we know this because he's played here for free a lot. [<i>Laughter</i>] We work Herbie, I'm telling you. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But we just love the man. Michelle and I love this man, not just because he's from Chicago. Not just because he and I had the same hairdo in the 1970s. [<i>Laughter</i>] Not just because he's got that spooky Dorian Gray, doesn't-get-older thing going on. [<i>Laughter</i>] It is his spirit, it is his energy&mdash;which is relentless and challenging&mdash;and he's always pushing boundaries. Herbie once said of his outlook: \\"We're going to see some unbelievable changes. And I would rather be on the side of pushing for that than waiting for somebody else to do it.\\" <p>Well, Herbie, we are glad that you didn't wait for somebody else to do what you've done, because nobody else could. For always pushing us forward, we honor Herbie Hancock. <p>When a 22-year-old Carlos Santana took the stage at Woodstock, few people outside his hometown of San Francisco knew who he was. And the feeling was mutual. Carlos was in such a&mdash;shall we say&mdash;altered state of mind that he remembers almost nothing about the other performers. [<i>Laughter</i>] He thought the neck of his guitar was an electric snake. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But that did not stop Carlos and his band from whipping the crowd into a such frenzy with a mind-blowing mix of blues and jazz and R&B and Latin music. They'd never heard anything like it. And almost overnight, Carlos Santana became a star. <p>It was a pretty steep climb for a young man who grew up in Mexico, playing the violin for tourists, charging 50 cents a song. But as a teenager, Carlos fell in love with the guitar. He developed a distinctive sound that has drawn admirers from Bob Dylan to Herbie Hancock. And he gave voice to a Latino community that had too often been invisible to too many Americans. \\"You can cuss or you can pray with the guitar,\\" Carlos says. He found a way to do both. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And today, with 10 Grammys under his belt, Carlos is considered one of the greatest guitarists of all time. And he's still attracting new fans. Back in 2000, his album \\"Supernatural\\" beat out Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys to get to the number 1 on the charts. Kids were listening to Carlos who hadn't even heard of Woodstock. But despite all his success, Carlos says he still feels blessed to \\"be able to play a piece of wood with strings and touch people's hearts.\\" So for blessing us all with his music, we honor Carlos Santana. <p>Now, when you first become President, one of the people&mdash;questions that people ask you is, what's really going on at Area 51? [<i>Laughter</i>] When I wanted to know, I called Shirley MacLaine. [<i>Laughter</i>] I think I just became the first President to ever publicly mention Area 51. How's that, Shirley? [<i>Laughter</i>] So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>We love Shirley MacLaine. She's unconventional, and that makes her incomparable, with nearly 60 years of a reign as one of the most celebrated stars in movie history to prove it. \\"There are some performers that are indelible,\\" said one fan about Shirley. \\"We fall early, and we fall hard for them, and we follow them for the rest of their lives.\\" Now, that fan just happens to be a legend in her own right, who we honored here 2 years ago: Meryl Streep. But Meryl is not the only one who fell hard. <p>Shirley has been drawing fans, including me, since&mdash;well, not since she first lit up the big screen&mdash;because in 1955, she was in Alfred Hitchcock's \\"The Trouble with Harry,\\" but she's still been spitting fire with the same old spunk, most recently playing the American grandma in \\"Downton Abbey,\\" which Michelle, I think, got some early previews for. [<i>Laughter</i>] Along the way, Shirley has racked up about every Hollywood award that is out there. That's why her nickname Powerhouse is so fitting. The truth is Shirley earned that nickname for hitting the most home runs on the boys' baseball team when she was a kid. But I'd say that it still works pretty well to describe her today. <p>And that's because Shirley MacLaine's career isn't defined by a list of film roles and musical performances. Through raucous comedies and stirring dramas and spirited musicals, Shirley has been fearless, and she's been honest, and she's tackled complicated characters, and she's revealed a grittier, deeper truth in each one of those characters, giving every audience the experience of cinema at its best. It's a motto she has lived by: \\"Don't be afraid to go out on a limb. That's where all the fruit is.\\" For her risk-taking, for her theatrical brilliance, for her limitless capacity for wonder, we honor this American powerhouse, Miss Shirley MacLaine. <p>And finally, in a world full of brilliant musicians, there's only one Piano Man. The son of a Jewish father who left Germany for America to escape the Nazis, Billy Joel started piano lessons as a boy growing up on Long Island. His father was a classical pianist, so that was Billy's training too&mdash;until the night he and millions of Americans watched the Beatles play the Ed Sullivan Show. Most people thought, \\"I want to hear more music like that.\\" But Billy thought, \\"I want to make my own music like that.\\" And from then on, it was all rock and roll to him. <p>With lyrics that speak of love and class and failure and success, angry young men and the joy of becoming a father, he has become one of the most successful musicians in history, selling more than 150 million records. <p>Above all, Billy Joel sings about America: About the workers living in Allentown after the factories closed down. About soldiers home from the war, forever changed, bidding \\"Goodnight Saigon.\\" Commercial fishermen struggling to make a living in the waters off of Long Island, sailing the \\"Downeaster 'Alexa.'\\" The sights and sounds of that city like no other, which can put anyone in a \\"New York State of Mind.\\" And of course, the ragtag bunch of regulars at the bar where he started out, shouting at him again and again to \\"sing us a song.\\" <p>Billy Joel probably would have been a songwriter no matter where he was born. But we are certainly lucky that he ended up here. And the hardworking folks he's met and the music that he's heard across our nation come through in every note and every lyric that he's written. For an artist whose songs are sung around the world, but which are thoroughly, wonderfully American, we honor Billy Joel. <p>So Martina Arroyo, Herbie Hancock, Carlos Santana, Shirley MacLaine, Billy Joel: Each of our brilliant honorees has given us something unique and enriched us beyond measure, as individuals and as a nation. Together they bring us closer to President Kennedy's vision of the arts as a great humanizing and truth-telling experience. Their triumphs have lifted our spirits and lifted our Nation and left us a better and richer place. And for that we will always be grateful. So we thank you all. <p>God bless you, and please join me in saluting one more time our remarkable 2013 Kennedy Center Honorees.\" "
"266" "\"Thank you. To Gra&ccedil;a Machel and the Mandela family; to President Zuma and members of the Government; to heads of states and government, past and present; distinguished guests: It is a singular honor to be with you today, to celebrate a life like no other. To the people of South Africa&mdash;people of every race and walk of life&mdash;the world thanks you for sharing Nelson Mandela with us. His struggle was your struggle. His triumph was your triumph. Your dignity and your hope found expression in his life. And your freedom, your democracy, is his cherished legacy. <p>It is hard to eulogize any man, to capture in words not just the facts and the dates that make a life, but the essential truth of a person: their private joys and sorrows; the quiet moments and unique qualities that illuminate someone's soul. How much harder to do so for a giant of history, who moved a nation toward justice and, in the process, moved billions around the world. <p>Born during World War I, far from the corridors of power, a boy raised herding cattle and tutored by the elders of his Thembu tribe, Madiba would emerge as the last great liberator of the 20th century. Like Gandhi, he would lead a resistance movement, a movement that at its start had little prospect for success. Like Dr. King, he would give potent voice to the claims of the oppressed and the moral necessity of racial justice. He would endure a brutal imprisonment that began in the time of Kennedy and Khrushchev and reached the final days of the cold war. Emerging from prison, without the force of arms, he would&mdash;like Abraham Lincoln&mdash;hold his country together when it threatened to break apart. And like America's Founding Fathers, he would erect a constitutional order to preserve freedom for future generations: a commitment to democracy and rule of law ratified not only by his election, but by his willingness to step down from power after only one term. <p>Given the sweep of his life, the scope of his accomplishments, the adoration that he so rightly earned, it's tempting, I think, to remember Nelson Mandela as an icon, smiling and serene, detached from the tawdry affairs of lesser men. But Madiba himself strongly resisted such a lifeless portrait. Instead, Madiba insisted on sharing with us his doubts and his fears, his miscalculations along with his victories. \\"I am not a saint,\\" he said, \\"unless you think of a saint as a sinner who keeps on trying.\\" <p>It was precisely because he could admit to imperfection&mdash;because he could be so full of good humor, even mischief, despite the heavy burdens that he carried&mdash;that we loved him so. He was not a bust made of marble, he was a man of flesh and blood: a son and a husband, a father and a friend. And that's why we learned so much from him, and that's why we can learn from him still. For nothing he achieved was inevitable. In the arc of his life, we see a man who earned his place in history through struggle and shrewdness and persistence and faith. He tells us what is possible not just in the pages of history books, but in our own lives as well. <p>Mandela showed us the power of action, of taking risks on behalf of our ideals. Perhaps Mandela was right that he inherited, \\"a proud rebelliousness, a stubborn sense of fairness\\" from his father. And we know he shared with millions of Black and colored South Africans the anger born of, \\"a thousand slights, a thousand indignities, a thousand unremembered moments . . . a desire to fight the system that imprisoned my people,\\" he said. <p>But like other early giants of the ANC&mdash;the Sisulus and Tambos&mdash;Madiba disciplined his anger and channeled his desire to fight into organization and platforms and strategies for action so men and women could stand up for their God-given dignity. Moreover, he accepted the consequences of his actions, knowing that standing up to powerful interests and injustice carries a price: \\"I have fought against White domination, and I have fought against Black domination. I've cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and [with] equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.\\" <p>Mandela has taught us the power of action, but he also taught us the power of ideas, the importance of reason and arguments, the need to study not only those who you agree with, but also those who you don't agree with. He understood that ideas cannot be contained by prison walls or extinguished by a sniper's bullet. He turned his trial into an indictment of apartheid because of his eloquence and his passion, but also because of his training as an advocate. He used decades of prison to sharpen his arguments, but also to spread his thirst for knowledge to others in the movement. And he learned the language and the customs of his oppressor so that one day, he might better convey to them how their own freedom depend upon his. <p>Mandela demonstrated that action and ideas are not enough. No matter how right, they must be chiseled into law and institutions. He was practical, testing his beliefs against the hard surface of circumstance and history. On core principles, he was unyielding, which is why he could rebuff offers of unconditional release, reminding the apartheid regime that \\"prisoners cannot enter into contracts.\\" <p>But as he showed in painstaking negotiations to transfer power and draft new laws, he was not afraid to compromise for the sake of a larger goal. And because he was not only a leader of a movement, but a skillful politician, the Constitution that emerged was worthy of this multiracial democracy, true to his vision of laws that protect minority as well as majority rights and the precious freedoms of every South African. <p>And finally, Mandela understood the ties that bind the human spirit. There is a word in South Africa, <i>ubuntu</i>, a word that captures Mandela's greatest gift: his recognition that we are all bound together in ways that are invisible to the eye; that there is a oneness to humanity; that we achieve ourselves by sharing ourselves with others and caring for those around us. <p>We can never know how much of this sense was innate in him or how much was shaped in a dark and solitary cell. But we remember the gestures, large and small&mdash;introducing his jailers as honored guests at his Inauguration, taking a pitch in a Springbok uniform, turning his family's heartbreak into a call to confront HIV/AIDS&mdash;that revealed the depths of his empathy and his understanding. He not only embodied <i>ubuntu</i>, he taught millions to find that truth within themselves. <p>It took a man like Madiba to free not just the prisoner, but the jailer as well; to show that you must trust others so that they may trust you; to teach that reconciliation is not a matter of ignoring a cruel past, but a means of confronting it with inclusion and generosity and truth. He changed laws, but he also changed hearts. <p>For the people of South Africa, for those he inspired around the globe, Madiba's passing is rightly a time of mourning and a time to celebrate a heroic life. But I believe it should also prompt in each of us a time for self-reflection. With honesty, regardless of our station or our circumstance, we must ask, how well have I applied his lessons in my own life? It's a question I ask myself, as a man and as a President. <p>We know that, like South Africa, the United States had to overcome centuries of racial subjugation. As was true here, it took sacrifice&mdash;the sacrifices of countless people, known and unknown&mdash;to see the dawn of a new day. Michelle and I are beneficiaries of that struggle. But in America and in South Africa and in countries all around the globe, we cannot allow our progress to cloud the fact that our work is not yet done. <p>The struggles that follow the victory of formal equality or universal franchise may not be as filled with drama and moral clarity as those that came before, but they are no less important. For around the world today, we still see children suffering from hunger and disease. We still see run-down schools. We still see young people without prospects for the future. Around the world today, men and women are still imprisoned for their political beliefs and are still persecuted for what they look like and how they worship and who they love. That is happening today. <p>And so we too must act on behalf of justice. We too must act on behalf of peace. There are too many people who happily embrace Madiba's legacy of racial reconciliation, but passionately resist even modest reforms that would challenge chronic poverty and growing inequality. There are too many leaders who claim solidarity with Madiba's struggle for freedom, but do not tolerate dissent from their own people. And there are too many of us on the sidelines, comfortable in complacency or cynicism when our voices must be heard. <p>The questions we face today&mdash;how to promote equality and justice, how to uphold freedom and human rights, how to end conflict and sectarian war&mdash;these things do not have easy answers. But there were no easy answers in front of that child born in World War I. Nelson Mandela reminds us that it always seems impossible until it is done. South Africa shows that is true. South Africa shows we can change, that we can choose a world defined not by our differences, but by our common hopes. We can choose a world defined not by conflict, but by peace and justice and opportunity. <p>We will never see the likes of Nelson Mandela again. But let me say to the young people of Africa and the young people around the world: You too can make his life's work your own. Over 30 years ago, while still a student, I learned of Nelson Mandela and the struggles taking place in this beautiful land, and it stirred something in me. It woke me up to my responsibilities to others and to myself, and it set me on an improbable journey that finds me here today. And while I will always fall short of Madiba's example, he makes me want to be a better man. He speaks to what's best inside us. <p>After this great liberator is laid to rest, and when we have returned to our cities and villages and rejoined our daily routines, let us search for his strength. Let us search for his largeness of spirit somewhere inside of ourselves. And when the night grows dark, when injustice weighs heavy on our hearts, when our best laid plans seem beyond our reach, let us think of Madiba and the words that brought him comfort within the four walls of his cell: <p>It matters not how strait the gate, <p>How charged with punishments the scroll, <p>I am the master of my fate: <p>I am the captain of my soul. <p>What a magnificent soul it was. We will miss him deeply. May God bless the memory of Nelson Mandela. May God bless the people of South Africa.\" "
"267" "\"Well, it is a great pleasure to welcome not only some of the most outstanding mayors in the country, but also folks who are representing incredible cities, world-class cities, that are going to be central to America's economic growth and progress for years to come. <p>I've always said that mayors don't have time to be ideological, and they don't really have time to be partisan, because they, every day, are held accountable for concretely delivering the services that people count on all across the country. And I think it's for that reason that when we think about mayors, we think about folks who actually get stuff done. <p>This is an outstanding group of both mayors and mayors-elect, representing some of our largest cities. They have a shared vision of cities as being critical hubs in which we're creating jobs; bringing businesses; seeing startups develop; making sure that there are pathways, gateways for opportunity for people from the surrounding areas, the surrounding States, the regions, and in many cases, the world, because I think you've got a lot of immigrant populations that naturally gravitate towards the diversity and dynamism of the city. <p>And although we have seen terrific progress in our cities, as we have across the country over the last several years&mdash;millions of jobs being created, the housing market starting to recover, businesses investing again, manufacturing making an extraordinary comeback&mdash;what we know is, we've still got a lot of work to do to deliver a vision that we all share, which is an America where if you work hard, you can make it. <p>And what that means is, is that my hope and goal out of this meeting is, we immediately set up a strong partnership with all the mayors here and all the mayors who aren't here where we get a clear sense of what their vision is and how they're trying to deliver services; how we can make sure that our kids are getting the very best education possible; how we make sure that we are creating the platforms, the infrastructure for jobs to succeed&mdash;or jobs to be created and businesses to succeed in these cities; how we make sure our transportation dollars are flowing in a way that maximizes economic development that, hopefully, reduces congestion and rush-hour traffic&mdash;I suspect that's something that some of you have heard from your constituents about&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;how we make sure that there's a strong social safety net there that is not a place where people stay over the long term, but rather is a mechanism whereby people who have had some bad luck can get back on their feet and get back into the workforce. <p>So I'm very much looking forward to the conversation. In the meantime, at the Federal level, there's some things that we can do to help mayors. If we in fact can get this budget deal completed and out of the Senate, we can get away for the first time in a couple of years from the constant brinksmanship and crisis governance that we've seen up on Capitol Hill that impedes growth and makes businesses and investors less certain about wanting to put their money in. So that would be an important achievement, and that's something the Federal Government can do to help make. <p>One element that's not in this budget that needs to be passed right away is UI, unemployment insurance. You've got potentially 1.3 million people who, during Christmas time, are going to lose their unemployment benefits, at a time when it's still very difficult for a lot of folks to find a job. And that's not just bad for those individuals and for those families, that's bad for our economy, and that's bad for our cities, because if they don't have the money to pay the rent or be able to buy food for their families, that has an impact on demand and businesses and it can have a depressive effect generally. In fact, what we know is, the economists have said failing to extend unemployment benefits is going to have a drag on economic growth for next year. <p>So there are some basic things that we can do just to create a better economic environment for these outstanding mayors. There are some areas&mdash;for example, raising the minimum wage&mdash;that could have a tremendous boost in a lot of the cities where there are a lot of service workers who get up and do some of the critical work for all of us every single day, but oftentimes, still find themselves just barely above poverty or, in some cases, below poverty. <p>So what I want to do is explore ideas with them. We wish them luck. You can see that it's a diverse group, but what binds them together is a commitment to helping people succeed in this country. <p>And so I want to congratulate all of them, and I'm looking forward to, over the next 3 years for me, working with them for the benefit of their constituencies. Many of them may end up being around for 20 years and&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;so they'll have other Presidents to work with. <p>But thank you so much for coming in. <p>[<i>At this point, several reporters called out questions</i>.] <p>Thank you, guys.\" "
"268" "\"One year ago today, a quiet, peaceful town was shattered by unspeakable violence. Six dedicated school workers and 20 beautiful children were taken from our lives forever. As parents, as Americans, the news filled us with grief. <p>Newtown is a town like so many of our hometowns. The victims were educators and kids that could have been any of our own. And our hearts were broken: for the families that lost a piece of their heart; for the communities changed forever; for the survivors, so young, whose innocence was torn away far too soon. <p>But beneath the sadness, we also felt a sense of resolve that these tragedies must end and that to end them, we must change. From the very beginning, our efforts were led by the parents of Newtown&mdash;men and women, impossibly brave&mdash;who stepped forward in the hopes that they might spare others their heartbreak. And they were joined by millions of Americans&mdash;mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers&mdash;who refused to accept these acts of violence as somehow inevitable. <p>Over the past year, their voices have sustained us, and their example has inspired us: to be better parents and better neighbors; to give our children everything they need to face the world without fear; to meet our responsibilities not just to our own families, but to our communities. More than the tragedy itself, it's how Newtown will be remembered. <p>And on this anniversary of a day we will never forget, that's the example we should continue to follow. Because we haven't yet done enough to make our communities and our country safer. We have to do more to keep dangerous people from getting their hands on a gun so easily. We have to do more to heal troubled minds. We have to do everything we can to protect our children from harm and make them feel loved and valued and cared for. <p>And as we do, we can't lose sight of the fact that real change won't come from Washington. It will come the way it's always come: from you, from the American people. As a nation, we can't stop every act of violence. We can't heal every troubled mind. But if we want to live in a country where we can go to work, send our kids to school, and walk our streets free from fear, we have to keep trying. We have to keep caring. We have to treat every child like they're ours. Like those in Sandy Hook, we must choose to love. <p>And together, we must and can change. Thank you.\" "
"269" "\"Thank you. Well, merry Christmas, everybody! I want to thank our host, Hugh Jackman, for keeping our safety in mind and leaving Wolverine's claws at home. [<i>Laughter</i>] It can't be easy to wrap presents with those things. [<i>Laughter</i>] Good for carving up \\"roast beast\\" though. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to thank all the incredible performers for sharing their talents and their holiday spirit with us tonight. And we appreciate the whole team at Time Warner and the National Building Museum who make it possible for our fellow Americans to enjoy these evenings' performances. <p>Every year, we mark the holiday season with celebrations and good cheer. And I should remind my girls that I like getting Christmas presents as much as anybody. [<i>Laughter</i>] But this is also a time to remember the story of a child born to two faithful travelers on a holy night, long ago. <p>The sacred birth of Jesus Christ was God's gift to man on Earth. And through His example, He taught us that we should love the Lord, love our neighbors as we love ourselves. It's a teaching that has endured for generations. And today, it lies at the heart of my faith and that of millions of Americans and billions around the globe. <p>No matter who we are or where we come from or how we worship, it's a message of hope and devotion that can unite all of us this holiday season. It compels all of us to reach out and help our less fortunate citizens&mdash;our poor, our sick, our neighbors in need&mdash;and to serve those who sacrifice so much on our behalf. <p>And that's why tonight's celebration benefits the Children's National Medical Center and all the children whose lives they touch and save, including all the little elves who are here tonight. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And that's why, with our men and women in uniform serving far from home in harm's way, we thank them as well and their families. And we wish, this holiday season and all seasons, for peace on Earth. <p>To all Americans, from our family to yours, God bless you, and have a very merry Christmas.\" "
"270" "\"Hi, everybody. This week, Congress finished up some important work before heading home for the holidays. <p>For the first time in years, both parties came together in the spirit of compromise to pass a budget, one that helps chart our economic course for the next 2 years. This budget will unwind some of the damaging cuts that have threatened students and seniors and held back our businesses. It clears the path for critical investments in the things that grow our economy and strengthen our middle class, like education and research. And it will keep reducing our deficits, at a time when we've seen 4 years of the fastest deficit reduction since the end of World War II. <p>Members of Congress also voted to finally allow several dedicated and well-qualified public servants to do their jobs for the American people, many of whom waited months for a simple yes-or-no vote. These are judges, Cabinet Secretaries, and military leaders. They're men and women charged with growing our economy, keeping our homeland secure, and making sure our housing system and financial system work for ordinary Americans. <p>So after a year of showdowns and obstruction that only held back our economy, we've been able to break the logjam a bit over the last few weeks. It's a hopeful sign that we can end the cycle of shortsighted, crisis-driven decisionmaking and actually work together to get things done. And that's important because there's plenty of work to do. <p>Right now, because Congress failed to act before leaving on vacation, more than 1 million Americans are poised to lose a vital source of income just a few days after Christmas. For many people who are still looking for work, unemployment insurance is a lifeline that can make the difference between temporary hardship or lasting catastrophe. Instead of punishing these families who can least afford it&mdash;especially now&mdash;Congress should first restore that lifeline immediately, then put our entire focus on creating more good jobs that pay good wages. <p>That's what I'll be focused on next year and every day I have the privilege of being your President: growing the economy, expanding opportunity, building an America that offers everyone who works hard the chance to get ahead and every child a fair shot at success. <p>And if Congress continues to act in the spirit of cooperation we've seen in recent weeks, I'm confident we can make much more progress together in the year to come. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend and a very merry Christmas.\" "
"271" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody, and happy holidays. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> We know how busy this time of year is for everyone, so we're not going to take much of your time. But we did want to take a moment to wish you all a merry Christmas, from our family to yours. <p><i>The President.</i> This is a season for millions of Americans to be together with family, to continue long-held holiday traditions, and to show our gratitude to those we love. And along the way, some of us might even watch a little basketball or eat some Christmas cookies too. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Here at the White House, over the past few weeks, we've had about 70,000 people from all across the country come visit and look at our holiday decorations. This year's theme was \\"Gather Around: Stories of the Season.\\" And in every room of the house, we tried to tell the story about who we are as Americans and how we celebrate the holidays together. <p>And we made certain to highlight some of the most powerful stories we know: the stories of our outstanding troops, veterans, and military families and their service and sacrifice for our country. <p><i>The President.</i> Our extraordinary men and women in uniform are serving so that the rest of us can enjoy the blessings we cherish during the holidays. But that means many of our troops are far from home and far from family. They're spending some extra time on the phone with their loved ones back home. Or they're setting up video chats so they can watch as the presents are opened. So today we want all our troops to know that you're in our thoughts and prayers this holiday season. <p>And here's the good news: For many of our troops and newest veterans, this might be the first time in years that they've been with their families on Christmas. In fact, with the Iraq war over and the transition in Afghanistan, fewer of our men and women in uniform are deployed in harm's way than at any time in the last decade. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> And that's something that we all can be thankful for. And with more and more of our troops back here at home, now it's our turn to serve. It's our turn to step up and show our gratitude for the military families who have given us so much. <p>And that's why Jill Biden and I started our Joining Forces initiative, to rally all Americans to support our military families in ways large and small. And again and again, we have been overwhelmed by the response we've gotten, as folks from across the country have found new ways to give back to these families through their schools, businesses, and houses of worship. <p><i>The President.</i> That's the same spirit of giving that connects all of us during the holidays. So many people all across the country are helping out at soup kitchens, buying gifts for children in need, or organizing food or clothing drives for their neighbors. For families like ours, that service is a chance to celebrate the birth of Christ and live out what He taught us: to love our neighbors as we would ourselves, to feed the hungry and look after the sick, to be our brother's keeper and our sister's keeper. And for all of us as Americans, regardless of our faith, those are values that can drive us to be better parents and friends, better neighbors, and better citizens. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> So as we look to the new year, let's pledge ourselves to living out those values by reaching out and lifting up those in our communities who could use a hand up. <p><i>The President.</i> So merry Christmas, everyone. And from the two of us, as well as Malia, Sasha, Grandma, Bo&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The First Lady.</i> And Sunny, the newest Obama. <p><i>The President.</i> &mdash;&mdash;we wish you all a blessed and safe holiday season. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Happy holidays everybody, and God bless.\" "
