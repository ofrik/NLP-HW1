"1" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you, everybody! Give Mia a big round of applause for that outstanding introduction. Well, hello, Michigan! Happy New Year to everybody. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Happy New Year! <p><i>Audience member.</i> I love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I&mdash;what was that? <p><i>Audience member</i>. Love you, man. <p><i>The President</i>. I love you back. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to thank all the outstanding leaders that we've got here today. I want to introduce some of them. We've got Secretary of Labor Tom Perez here. We've got Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan here. Senator Gary Peters is in the house. Congresswoman Debbie Dingell is here. Your outstanding CEO, Mark Fields, is here. <p>Now, I have to say, I love the Secret Service, I love the Beasts that they put me in and&mdash;that's what we call the cars I drive in, \\"the Beasts.\\" So I like my ride these days. And it was made in Michigan too. But I just had a chance to look at these new Mustangs, and I've got to say that the Mustangs had a little more style, a little more flavor. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Bill Ford is in the house. Surprisingly enough, we talked a little bit about Sunday. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, listen, I'm a Bears fan. You beat us twice. But even a Bears fan has to admit&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> We got hosed! <p><i>The President.</i>&mdash;&mdash;that that was a little suspect. I have never seen anything like that before. I would have been pretty irritated. Were you irritated? Oh, yes. [<i>Laughter</i>] But all I can say&mdash;because I'm used to saying this, I'm a Bears fan&mdash;there's always next year. [<i>Laughter</i>] And look, you've got a lot to be hopeful for. First of all, you've got one of the best defenses in the league. A fine young quarterback, Megatron. And if there's one thing that you can take to the bank when talking about Detroit is that Detroit always comes back. [<i>Applause</i>] Detroit always comes back. <p>And that's why I'm here today. One of my New Year's resolutions is to make sure that more Americans in Wayne, more Americans in Michigan, more Americans all across this great country&mdash;that everybody feels like they're coming back. And there is no doubt, thanks to the steps that we took early on to rescue our economy and to rebuild it on a new foundation, we are entering into the new year with new confidence that America is coming back. <p>Now, you don't have to take my word for it. The facts are the facts. And let's face it, a lot of times the media doesn't like reporting on good news, but every once in a while, it's important for us to hear some good news, not to make us complacent, but to give us confidence that if we work harder, we can make even more good news. So here's how we begin this year. Last year, 2014, was the strongest year for job growth since the 1990s. [<i>Applause</i>] Since the 1990s. We've now had a 57-month streak of private sector job creation. We've created nearly 11 million new jobs. That's the longest stretch in our history of private sector, uninterrupted job creation. <p>Here's another way of thinking about it. Since 2010, we, America, have put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and every other advanced economy combined. [<i>Applause</i>] Combined. And let me tell you what's leading the way: American manufacturing. After a decade of decline, American manufacturing is in its best stretch of job growth since the 1990s. Here in Michigan, manufacturers have created more than a hundred thousand jobs, helping to cut your unemployment rate in half. <p>So we're making more stuff. We're selling it around the world. America is the number-one producer of oil, the number-one producer of gas. It's helping to save drivers about a buck-10 a gallon at the pump over this time last year. And the cars that you make help everybody go a little further on that gallon of gas. <p>Thanks to the Affordable Care Act&mdash;also known as Obamacare&mdash;about 10 million Americans gained health insurance just over this last year. We've cut our deficits by about two-thirds. I'd like people to think about that, because when they do surveys of, like, ordinary folks on the street and they ask them, are the deficits going up or are they coming down, everybody automatically assumes, well, Government spending and deficits must be going up. Deficits have come down by two-thirds since I took office&mdash;by two-thirds. They're going down. And after 13 long years, our war in Afghanistan has come to a responsible end, which means more of our brave troops have come home and spent time with their families during the holidays. <p>So the point is, we're moving. These 6 years have been tough, demanded hard work, demanded sacrifice on everybody's part. You guys know that more than most. Which means that as a country, we have every right to be proud of what we've got to show for all that hard work. <p>America's resurgence is real. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise. We've got the best cards, and we are doing better than just about anybody else on Earth. And now that we've got some calmer waters, now that the worst of the crisis is behind us, if we all do our part, if we all pitch in, then we can make sure that this rising tide is actually lifting all the boats, not just some. We can make sure that the middle class is the engine that powers American prosperity for decades to come. <p>And that's going to be the focus of my State of the Union address in a couple of weeks: building on the progress that we've already made. But I've got to admit, I've only got 2 years left in office; I didn't want to wait for the State of the Union to talk about all the things that make this country great and how we can make it better. So I thought I'd get started this week. I figured, why wait? It's like opening your Christmas presents a little early. <p>So today I'm here in Detroit, going to talk about the incredible things that have happened in the auto industry and what more we can do with manufacturing. Tomorrow I'm going to visit Arizona, a State that's&mdash;was hit about as hard as anybody by the housing crisis, because we want to talk about how we're making homeownership a reality for more middle class families. <p>On Friday, I'm going to go to Tennessee, a State that's making big strides in education, to show how we can help every American get the education they need to get ahead in this new economy. But today I wanted to come here to Michigan because this State proves no matter how tough times get, Americans are tougher. So&mdash;and plus, I wanted to see the new Mustang. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, just&mdash;let's just take a minute and think about what you've had to fight through. A few years ago, nearly one in five autoworkers got a punch in the gut with a pink slip. The year before I took office, 400,000 jobs vanished in this industry&mdash;400,000. Sales plunged 40 percent. And then, as the financial crisis built, we faced what once seemed unimaginable when just two of the Big Three&mdash;GM and Chrysler&mdash;were on the brink of failure. <p>Now, this is the heartbeat of American manufacturing right here. And it was flatlining. And we had a choice to make. We could have kept giving billions of taxpayer dollars to the auto industry without asking for accountability or change in return. But that would have just kicked the problem down the road. We could have done nothing, which some people said we should do, and let those companies fail. But think about what that would have meant for this country. The suppliers, the distributors, the communities that depend on the workers who patronize the restaurants and shop at the stores&mdash;all those companies would have gone under also. <p>And look, the fact is, nobody was in a stronger position than Ford. Bill and the team had done a great job steering Ford through tough times, but Bill and others are the first to admit that you could have had a cascading effect if the whole supply chain in the U.S. auto industry starts declining. Then, Ford could have gone under too. Plants would have shuttered. We would have lost this iconic industry, sold for scraps. And folks like you&mdash;the men and women who built these companies with your hands&mdash;would have been left hanging out to dry. And the communities you depended on&mdash;the schoolteachers, the small-business owners, the servers in the diner, and, let's face it, the barkeep&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I'm just saying. [<i>Laughter</i>] Are you a barkeep, or you're just waving at me? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member</i>. [<i>Inaudible</i>]&mdash;a teacher. <p><i>The President</i>. But everybody would have been affected. Their jobs were at stake too. <p>And it's more than that. The jobs in the auto industry have always been about more than a paycheck. They're a source of pride for generations. It was representative of what it meant to get into the middle class. You work hard in this job, you could afford to raise a family, buy a house, go on vacation, retire with some dignity. You knew you were making something that people could count on. It meant something. Every car you sent off the line brought you that step closer to doing the right thing by your family and giving something to your kids and having a sense of security in your life. So plants like this one built more than just cars, they built the middle class in this country. And that was worth fighting for. <p>So in exchange for the help, we demanded responsibility. We said to the auto industry, you've got to change with the times. Plants retooled. Plants restructured. Labor and management worked together, settled their differences. Everybody put some skin in the game. Everybody made some sacrifices. It wasn't just some, it wasn't just the workers who gave something up&mdash;everybody. <p>And that's how things work best, by the way, when everybody is in it: when workers and businesses work together; when whoever is in the boardroom and folks on the floor, they both understand they're in it together. And we believe America is best when everybody is in it together. And we rejected the false choice that either unions or businesses could succeed but not both. We said: You know what, what's going to work for the company is also going to work for that worker and vice versa, which means when the company is doing better, then the workers have got to get their share as well. <p>And Ford rejected the false choice that they could either take care of their shareholder or take care of their worker. They did both. And the company benefited, and America benefited. We believed in shared sacrifice and that shared sacrifice leads to shared prosperity. <p>Now, I've got to tell you, I was talking to the Detroit News. They were asking: What was it like when you were making this decision? I just want everybody to be clear: It was not popular. Even in Michigan, it wasn't popular. I remember they did a poll and, like, in Michigan, it was like only 10 percent were in favor. [<i>Laughter</i>] And you don't have to be a genius political analyst to say 10 percent's not very high. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And look&mdash;and it wasn't on my to-do list when I ran for President. I wasn't expecting to have to do this. But I ran not to be just doing the popular things, I ran not just to do the easy things, I ran to do the right thing. And saving the American auto industry was the right thing to do. Betting on you was the right thing to do. [<i>Applause</i>] It was the right thing to do. And that bet has paid off for America, because the American auto industry is back. <p>Now, part of the reason that we wanted to start this trip here is not just because I wanted to see the new Mustang&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;not just because the American auto industry is back, but because last month, we actually marked a milestone. Last month, the rescue of the auto industry officially came to an end. The auto companies have now repaid taxpayers every dime and more of what my administration invested in you. You paid the taxpayers back with your hard work, with your dedication. <p>And over the past 5 years, this industry created about 500,000 new jobs. Last year, American autoworkers churned out cars faster than any year since 2005. Ford has brought jobs back from Mexico, created nearly 24,000 new jobs across this country, including 1,800 new jobs right here in this plant. And after more than a century since Henry Ford introduced the moving assembly line, you're reinventing it: one production line for gas, electric, hybrid, plug-in vehicles. That's the first in the world, right here in Wayne, Michigan. [<i>Applause</i>] First in the world. That's always cool when you do something first. <p>And you're helping rebuild the middle class for the 21st century. Just down the road, in Lincoln Park, UAW-Ford Joint Apprenticeship Program is providing workers with hands-on training in the skills that employers need for the jobs of tomorrow. And nationally, by the way, 87 percent of all apprentices are employed after they complete their apprenticeship program, with an average starting wage of $50,000. So the more folks we get into apprenticeships, the more folks are getting middle class jobs. <p>And that's why I called on last year for businesses across the country to create more and expand more apprenticeship programs. And since then, we've seen the largest increase in apprenticeships in nearly a decade. And now my administration is investing a hundred million dollars in an American Apprenticeship Grant competition. We're going to build on this momentum. We're going to expand successful programs. We want young people to see that they have opportunities. They don't all have to go to a 4-year college. They can get an apprenticeship, save some money, start working, build a family, buy a home, get some Lions tickets. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Because everybody came together here and worked together, folks are better off. And some of the most high-tech, fuel-efficient, high-powered, heart-pounding, good-looking, well-designed, fuel-efficient cars in the world are once again designed, engineered, forged, and built not in Europe, not in Asia, right here in the United States of America. Right here in America. <p>So because of you&mdash;because of you&mdash;manufacturing has a future in this country. Manufacturing's actually grown faster than other parts of the economy. And companies are now saying: \\"You know what, we've got to get back to America; we've got to relocate. We were offshore.\\" And now they're saying: \\"Uh-oh. America's back; we better get back in there.\\" And that means, because of you, the middle class has a future in this country. <p>And the auto industry has proved that any comeback is possible. And by the way, so has Motor City. [<i>Applause</i>] So has a Motor City. A year and a half ago, Detroit became the largest city ever to file for bankruptcy. Today, under the leadership of Mayor Duggan, Detroit is charting a new course. Businesses and private investors are making big investments, including Ford, which is helping to launch a tech startup incubator downtown. New restaurants and stores are popping up. Residents are fighting blight, securing abandoned homes, cleaning up neglected neighborhoods. <p>We're seeing stories of young people who left town for other opportunities, didn't think they could make it here, and suddenly, they're saying, \\"You know what, maybe I want to get back to Detroit,\\" hoping to be part of the rebirth of this city. <p>Now, this city still faces big challenges, but you're coming back. Just like the auto industry is going to have to continue to come up with new ideas and new designs and address competition. It never stops. We got to stay hungry. We can't be complacent. Just like America has got to still keep on working. Just like the Lions got to still come up with a little more work. But we're coming back. <p>And one thing is for sure: We may not all root for the Lions, but America is rooting for Detroit. [<i>Applause</i>] America is rooting for Detroit. We want the Motor City strong. And behind the stories of plants and cities and economic data, it's people. It's all of you. <p>So I'll just close with a story of a guy named Ramone, because we're rooting for guys like Ramone. Ramone spent 8 years in the military, served in Afghanistan, served in Iraq. Ramone here? Raise your hand, Ramone. <p>So Ramone is somebody who fought for our freedom, fought for our security. But sometimes, we give lip service to supporting our troops, and then when they come home, they get lost. So when Ramone came home, he had a hard time finding a job because it was a tough economy. He didn't want to be a burden on his family, so he moved into a homeless shelter, took whatever work he could get. And then, one day in 2012, a VA counselor that he'd been working with handed him an application from Ford. Ford was hiring for new shifts. <p>Imagine what Ramone felt the day he knocked on his grandpa's door&mdash;his grandfather who had spent 25 years building Mustangs in Dearborn&mdash;and Ramone was able to tell his grandfather he got a job at Ford. And now Ramone has got his own place. And now Ramone has got a good job right on the line here in Wayne. And every day, he's doing just what his grandfather did. And he's proud. He's punching in and building some of the best cars in the world. <p>If you want to know what America is about, about grit and determination and hard work and sacrifice and looking out for one another and not giving up, think about Ramone. Think about Detroit. Think about the auto industry. Think about the Midwest. Think about Michigan. Think about America. When our assembly lines grind to a halt, we work together, we get them going again. We don't give up. We get up, we fight back. We come back stronger than before. Thanks to the hard work of people like you, America is coming back. And I'm going to be on your side every step of the way. <p>Thank you, Michigan. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"2" "\"I've reached out to President Hollande of France and hope to have the opportunity to talk to him today. But I thought it was appropriate for me to express my deepest sympathies to the people of Paris and the people of France for the terrible terrorist attack that took place earlier today. <p>I think that all of us recognize that France is one of our oldest allies, our strongest allies. They have been with us at every moment when we've&mdash;from 9/11 on, in dealing with some of the terrorist organizations around the world that threaten us. For us to see the kind of cowardly, evil attacks that took place today, I think, reinforces once again why it's so important for us to stand in solidarity with them, just as they stand in solidarity with us. <p>The fact that this was an attack on journalists, an attack on our free press, also underscores the degree to which these terrorists fear freedom: of speech and freedom of the press. But the one thing that I'm very confident about is that the values that we share with the French people, a belief&mdash;a universal belief in freedom of expression, is something that can't be silenced because of the senseless violence of the few. <p>And so our counterterrorism cooperation with France is excellent. We will provide them with every bit of assistance that we can going forward. I think it's going to be important for us to make sure that we recognize, these kinds of attacks can happen anywhere in the world. And one of the things I'll be discussing with Secretary Kerry today is to make sure that we remain vigilant not just with respect to Americans living in Paris, but Americans living in Europe and in the Middle East and other parts of the world, and making sure that we stay vigilant in trying to protect them and to hunt down and bring the perpetrators of this specific act to justice and to roll up the networks that help to advance these kinds of plots. <p>In the end, though, the most important thing I want to say is that our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who've been lost in France and with the people of Paris and the people of France. What that beautiful city represents&mdash;the culture and the civilization that is so central to our imaginations&mdash;that's going to endure. And those who carry out senseless attacks against innocent civilians, ultimately, they'll be forgotten. And we will stand with the people of France through this very, very difficult time. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"3" "\"Well, listen, I just had a chance to hear from Edmundo and David&mdash;you guys don't have to go anywhere&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;about this development. Nueva Villas was originally a private development, but the timing obviously was tough because it happened right as the housing market here in Arizona and across the country was plummeting. And because of the great work that this nonprofit has done, but also because of assistance from HUD, what the community has been able to do is, through a nonprofit, purchase some of these homes that were empty and vacant, hire local residents to help reconstruct them, and now they're able to make homes available to working families. A family of four that maybe makes $40,000 or $60,000 a year has a chance to buy a beautiful home in a terrific neighborhood. <p>The market is stabilizing. And what's even better, some of the money that they then get as a consequence of the sale to these new families, they're able to use to rehab and move in even more families. And so it's a program that's working well. It's one example of some of the steps that we've taken in order to strengthen the housing market. <p>The thing I'm going to be announcing today is a new policy in which the fees that are charged by the FHA for loans are going to be reduced and could save a family like this, one that's buying through FHA a home, could save them as much as $900 a year, which obviously makes a big difference if their payment is 900 bucks a month. It could be a full month's payment that they're saving, and that could make all the difference for a family that is owning its first home. <p>And over time, this is going to potentially have an impact over millions of families all across the country. It should help further accelerate growth in the housing market and stabilizing prices in areas like Arizona that have a long way to come back. And it's just one more example of the kinds of steps that we can take to build on the progress that's already been made. Housing has come back, but we can do even better. There are still families out there that could benefit from great homes like this one, and we want to make sure that everybody has that access to that piece of the American Dream. <p>So we're really thrilled by&mdash;that we're able to make this announcement. I couldn't be prouder of Secretary Castro for the work that HUD is doing in helping make a home like this available to families who need it. As you can see here, the neighborhood, it is really looking great.\" "
"4" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Arizona! Well&mdash;hey! Happy New Year, Arizona. Go Bobcats! <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. <p>It's good to be in Phoenix. And I mean that, because I was in Detroit yesterday, which is a great city, but it was 60 degrees colder. [<i>Laughter</i>] So it feels pretty good, this weather right here. I had a couple staff people who said, \\"We're going to miss the plane.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] They're just going to try to get stranded here for a while. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But I went to Detroit, I went here; I guess between the Lions and the Cardinals, this is my post-wild card consolation tour. [<i>Laughter</i>] As a Bears fan, I want you to know that, first of all, you guys did a lot better than we did. [<i>Laughter</i>] You've got a great coach; you've got a great team. You had some bad luck. And there is always next year. So keep your chin up. Keep your chin up. <p>I want to thank Secretary Castro not just for the terrific introduction, but for the great job he's doing every day. I want to thank your Congressman, Ruben Gallego. Yay Ruben? Where is he? Ruben, I already liked him, and then he told me he was from Chicago originally, before he got smart and moved to warmer weather. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to thank your mayor, Greg Stanton. Where&mdash;he was here. There he is. Greg is doing a great job. I want to thank your principal, John Biera, Jr. [<i>Applause</i>] Hey! And your superintendent, Kent Scribner. And I want to thank all the students and staff and faculty who may be here. We really appreciate your hospitality. <p>I&mdash;one last acknowledgement. I had a chance to meet a couple of really good friends, Mark Kelly and Gabby Giffords. This was a remarkable meeting for me, because it was 4 years ago today that Gabby and some other wonderful Arizonans were gunned down outside a supermarket in Tucson. It's a tough day for a lot of folks down there. We keep them in our thoughts and prayers. <p>But Gabby is doing great. She looks wonderful, and she's got the same energy and passion that she always has had. And even as she's waged her own fight to recover, she's fought to prevent the next tragedies from happening to others. She's a hero, and she is a great Arizonan. So we're really proud of her. And her brother, who is also an astronaut&mdash;her brother-in-law, who's also an astronaut, is going to be in space for a year. He was just on the cover of Time magazine, which I know there's some folks in Washington who wish I was going to be in space for a year, but&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but I'm still around. Because I got some work to do. <p>Now, I am here because one of my New Year's resolutions is to make sure more Americans in Phoenix and in Arizona and all across the country feel like they're coming back. Because the country is coming back, but I want everybody to feel like things are getting better and we are moving in the right direction. And let there be no doubt: Thanks to the steps we took early on to rescue our economy, to rebuild it on a new foundation, America is coming back. And that's not just my own opinion. Here are the facts: 2014 was the strongest year for job growth since the 1990s. We've had 57 straight months of private sector job growth, created nearly 1&mdash;11 million new jobs. Since 2010, we've put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and every advanced economy combined. American manufacturing is growing at the fastest pace since the nineties. We're now the number-one producer of oil, of gas. And by the way, you're saving about a buck-10 a gallon at the pump over this time last year. <p>Although, I was in Detroit, and I told folks yesterday, gas prices aren't going to be low forever, so don't start suddenly saying you don't have to worry about fuel efficiency. If you're going out shopping for a new car, don't think it's always going to be this low, because then you'll be surprised and you'll be mad at me later&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and I'll be able to say, I told you don't get a gas guzzler because gas is going to go back up. But while it's low, enjoy it. And feel free to spend some of that money on local businesses, who then will hire more people and put more folks back to work. <p>Meanwhile, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, about 10 million Americans have gained health insurance in the past year alone. <p>We've done all this while cutting our Federal deficit by about two-thirds. And I'm going to repeat that, because they did a poll the other day and, like, 70 percent of the people think the deficit is going up. [<i>Laughter</i>] No, 70 percent of the people. You stop people on the street, 7 out of 10 think the deficit is going up. The deficit has gone down by two-thirds since I was President of the United States. So we're doing all this in a fiscally responsible way. <p>And maybe closest to my heart, after 13 long years, our war in Afghanistan has come to a responsible end, which means more of our brave troops spent time with their families this holiday season, right here back home. <p>So these last 6 years required hard work and sacrifice by everybody. But as a country, we have a right to be proud that all that hard work paid off. America's resurgence is real. And now that we've got some calmer waters out there, if everybody does their part, if we all work together, we can make sure that the tide starts lifting all boats again. We can get wages and incomes growing faster. We can make sure the middle class is growing, that the ladders of the middle class for folks who are struggling are firm and steady and have a lot of rungs to them. Because it's the middle class, it's working families, that power America's prosperity. That's always been the case; that will be true for decades to come. <p>And I've got a State of the Union Address in about 2 weeks, and that's what I want to talk about: building on the progress we've made. But of course, why wait for the State of the Union? It's sort of like you've got presents under the tree, you kind of start shaking them a little bit. [<i>Laughter</i>] I want to kind of give you a little sense of what I want to talk about. So we're going to start this week laying out some of the agenda for the next year. <p>And here in Phoenix, I want to talk about helping more families afford their piece of the American Dream, and that is owning their own home. <p>Now, let me just say, right now Michelle and I live in rental housing. [<i>Laughter</i>] We don't own where we live. We've got 2 years remaining on our lease. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm hoping I get my security deposit back. [<i>Laughter</i>] Although, Bo and Sunny have been tearing things up occasionally. We're going to have to clean things up a little bit. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But I'll never forget the day we bought our first place, a place of our own, a condo, back in Chicago. And for us and millions of Americans like us, buying a home has always been about more than owning a roof and four walls. It's about investing in savings and building a family and planting roots in a community. So we bought this place; it was about, I guess, probably about 2,000 square feet. It was in this complex called East View Park. It was sort of like a railway apartment. And it felt huge when we moved in. And then, Malia and Sasha were born, and their toys got everywhere. [<i>Laughter</i>] And then, it felt small because they basically took over the whole dining room with their toys. <p>But I have such good memories not just about the place itself, but all the work we had to do to save to get in there and then to fix it up and that sense of accomplishment that you were building something for your family and for your future. <p>And that's always been true. When my grandfather came back from World War II, this country gave him the chance to buy his first home with a loan from the FHA. For folks like him, a home was proof that America was a place where if you worked hard, if you were responsible, it was rewarded. <p>But we all know what happened in the last decade when responsibility gave way to recklessness. Families who did the right thing and bought a home that they could afford and made their payments each month and did everything right, when the market plummeted, they got hurt. Even though somebody else was acting irresponsibly&mdash;whether on Wall Street or folks who weren't responsible in terms of how they were dealing with their real estate&mdash;ordinary families got hurt bad. And that was especially true here in Arizona. <p>There were folks who borrowed more than they should have. There were lenders who really were just worried about making profits and not whether the people they were lending to were going to be able to keep up their homes. So home values plunged. Americans sank underwater. Foreclosures skyrocketed. Builders stopped building. Construction workers lost their jobs. <p>And when I came into office, I believed we could not let this crisis play itself out. If we could save more families from losing everything they had worked so hard to build, we had to make the effort. So less than a month after I took office, I came here to Arizona to lay out my plan to get responsible homeowners back on their feet. And I said that healing our housing market wouldn't be easy, it would not be quick. But we were going to act swiftly, we were going to act boldly, we were going to try something&mdash;everything that we could to help responsible homeowners. If something didn't work, we'd try something else. But we were going to try to keep folks in their homes. <p>And we ended up helping millions stay in their homes. We helped millions more save thousands of dollars each year by refinancing. We helped folks who didn't want to buy a home or who weren't ready to buy find an affordable place to rent. We kept up our fight against homelessness. And by the way&mdash;there's some homeless advocates here&mdash;since 2010, we've helped bring one in three homeless veterans off the streets. And I want to make sure everybody knows, under Mayor Stanton, Phoenix is leading the way in that effort. Phoenix is doing a great job. <p>So as a result of all these efforts, today, home sales are up nearly 50 percent from where they were in the worst of the crisis. Homebuilding has more than doubled. That's created hundreds of thousands of construction jobs. New foreclosures are at their lowest level since 2006. Since 2012, nearly 10 million fewer Americans have their homes underwater. Rising home prices have put hundreds of billions of dollars of wealth back in the pockets of middle class families. Now, I want everybody to be clear: This progress is not an accident. It is not luck. It's what happens when you have policies that put middle class families first. <p>And what's true in Arizona is true all across the country: We've still got some more work to do, our job is not done, but what we're doing is working. And we've got to keep at it. We've got to stay at it. <p>Today, here in Phoenix, I'm going to take a new action to help even more responsible families stake their claim on the middle class and buy their first new home. Starting this month, the Federal Housing Authority will lower its mortgage insurance premium rates enough to save the average new borrower more than $900 a year. Now, that's $900 that can go towards paying the groceries or gas or a child's education. Or depending on what your mortgage is, it might be a month's mortgage payment. <p>And for those who aren't familiar with FHA, FHA underwrites, it guarantees, it's the backstop for a lot of loans around the country, especially for middle class folks. So a lot of people pay these fees, and if they're saving $900, that's money that's going to be going throughout the economy. <p>Over the next 3 years, these lower premiums will give hundreds of thousands more families the chance to own their own home, and it will help make owning a home more affordable for millions more households overall in the coming years. <p>And I&mdash;just to give you an example, earlier today Secretary Castro and I visited Nueva Villas. It's a new neighborhood here in Phoenix where a lot of families are buying homes with the help of the FHA. And we actually&mdash;this was a big development that wasn't finished or it wasn't all sold; the crisis came, half the homes were still unsold. Folks lost their homes. It started getting boarded up. People were feeling insecure. It was starting to get depressed. Nonprofits, with the help of HUD, came in, purchased some of the properties, hired local residents to rehab them. Now people are building them, beautiful homes. And with the help of the FHA, we can now make sure that more people are getting access to these homes. And today's action will mean more money in the pockets of families like the ones that we've met. <p><i>Audience member.</i> President Obama&mdash;[<i>inaudible</i>]. <p><i>The President.</i> Is this about housing? [<i>Laughter</i>] All right. <p>So the&mdash;and keep in mind, hundreds of thousands of new buyers is going to mean a healthier housing market for everybody. So how many people here own their own home? [<i>Applause</i>] All right. So even though you've already got your mortgage or your loan, already have your home, if your neighbors are buying more homes, that's lifting the whole market here, which means the value of your home starts going up. And that's good for you. It means fewer foreclosure signs as people fix up old properties. It means more construction, which means more jobs, which means a better economy. So this is the kind of boost that we need to keep the momentum that we have seen over the last several years, keep it going here in Phoenix and all across the country. <p>So I want to be clear. If you're looking to take advantage of these lower rates, that's great. On the other hand, don't buy something you can't afford. You're going to be out of luck. These rates are for responsible buyers. We're not going down the road again of financing folks buying things they can't afford. We're going to be cracking down on that. We put in place tough rules on Wall Street, and we created a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and we're really policing irresponsible lenders luring folks into buying stuff they can't afford. And we designed a mortgage form that's written in simple language so that people understand what the commitments are when you buy a home. We're cracking down on some of the worst practices that led to the housing crisis. We're going to protect middle class families from getting ripped off. <p>And that's why we had the Justice Department fight for buyers who were discriminated against or preyed upon, and we won a settlement that awarded more money to victims in 1 year than in the previous 23 years combined. That's why we worked with States to force big banks to repay more than $50 billion to more than 1.5 million borrowers who had been treated wrongly, and that was the largest lending settlement in history. And that's why I've called on Congress to wind down the Government-backed companies known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. <p>So the bottom line is that we don't think there's anything wrong with pursuing a profit, but we want to make clear the days of making bad bets on the backs of taxpayer money and then getting bailed out afterwards. We're not going back to that. We've worked too hard, and everything we've done to heal the housing markets we want to preserve. But we do want to make sure that the housing market is strong and that responsible homeowners can get a good deal. Or people who have saved, done the right thing, now are looking to buy their first home, we want to make sure that they get a little bit of help. <p>In the end, everything we've done to heal the housing market is about more than just restoring housing values. It's about restoring our common values. It's about who we are as a country and who we are as communities. <p>And I want to just tell you a quick story. Lorraine Cona, from Sun City, next door, she did everything right. She had a good job as a librarian. She bought a home she could afford. She wanted to retire in that home. She made her payments on time. Then, 5 years ago, through no fault of her own, she was laid off, and she started falling behind in her payments. She knew foreclosure was coming. She said, \\"I'd look out the window, and I'd see somebody taking pictures of my house.\\" <p>But when things seemed darkest, Lorraine learned about something called the Hardest Hit fund. This is a program that we created to help folks in States like Arizona that had been especially hard hit by the real estate crash. And they helped her make her late payments, because she had a great track record until she had lost her job. They set her up with financial counseling so she could stay on track. It wasn't easy, but Lorraine repaired her credit. She refinanced her mortgage. And today, after a lifetime of hard work, Lorraine is retired, she's back to making her payments every single month. She's in her home. She was able to accomplish that. Even though it was scary at times, she got it done. Lorraine came back, just like Phoenix has come back. Just like Arizona's come back. Just like America has come back. <p>It's not just the economy turning around. It's turning around the lives of hard-working people, making sure that that hard work finally pays off. It's making sure you finally get that job you're looking for or the raise you deserve or a little bit of security or the retirement that you've earned or being able to send your kid to college so their lives are better than yours. That's what this is about. <p>So I just want everybody to know that we have been through some tough times, but we are moving. There are workers today with jobs who didn't have jobs last year. There are families who have got health insurance who didn't have health insurance before. There are students who are in college right now who didn't think they could afford it before. There are heroes who had served tour after tour who are finally home with their families. There are autoworkers who are building great American cars now when they thought that those plants were going to shut down. <p>America is coming back. And the key, Arizona, is for us all to work together to make sure we keep it going. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"5" "\"<i>The President.</i> Good afternoon, everybody. There's no need to stand up. Thank you so much. First of all, it's wonderful being here in Clinton. And I want to thank Mayor Scott Burton and very much appreciate the hospitality. And I want to thank John Manuck and the whole Techmer team for having me and the Vice President, as well as your own Senator, Bob Corker. <p>I understand I am the first President&mdash;sitting President&mdash;to visit Clinton. You'd think Bill would have come down here. [<i>Laughter</i>] I don't know&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Vice President Joe Biden.</i> Missed opportunity. <p><i>The President.</i> Missed opportunity. Let me tell you, if there's an Obama, Tennessee&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I'm going there. [<i>Laughter</i>] But the reason we're here is because wherever Americans are doing big things that can help build our middle class and grow our economy and extend opportunity to everybody, I want to be here to lift it up and figure out how we can promote more of it. <p>Last year, our economy created jobs faster than at any time since the 1990s. The key now is to make sure that that growing prosperity and resurgence is reaching everybody, not just some. And that means that that we've got to create more good jobs and we've got to train people for those jobs that are being created. The&mdash;and this is going to be the focus of my State of the Union Address, but we decided to get started a little early. <p>This morning I was over in Pellissippi State, where I announced my plan to make 2 years of community college free for students who are willing to work hard, keep their grades up, and do the right thing. And we're here in Clinton because I'm taking actions, building on what we've been doing over the last 4 or 5 years, to attract more high-quality manufacturing jobs for workers to fill in the new economy. <p>For decades, manufacturing was the essential ingredient in building our middle class. You punched in, you made something you were proud of&mdash;made in America, shipped everywhere around the world&mdash;and as a consequence, you were able to take home a good paycheck, could support your family, had good benefits. And it was a bargain that involved more than just building things, it reflected the values that this country stood for. <p>Over time, technology made some jobs obsolete. Globalization and additional foreign competition meant that some jobs went overseas. American manufacturing lost about one-third of its jobs in the last decade, and the middle class paid the price. <p>So when I took office, I believed&mdash;and I know Joe believed&mdash;that if the last decade was characterized by outsourcing, I wanted to define this decade for insourcing, making sure that the United States was competitive and that businesses wanted to locate here and that we had a dynamic manufacturing sector and research and development sector to support that manufacturing so that we could reverse some of those trends. <p>So we invested in clean energy, saved the auto industry, and today, factories are opening their doors at the fastest pace in almost two decades. Manufacturing is actually in its best stretch of job creation since the 1990s. It's added about 786,000 jobs over the past 58 months. Manufacturing is actually growing faster than the rest of the economy. Right here in Tennessee, manufacturing jobs have jumped by about 11 percent. <p>And the question is, how do we keep that progress going? How do we build on it? And that's why we're working to grow the jobs of tomorrow through a national network of manufacturing hubs. We're launching these hubs around the country, and the concept is simple: We bring businesses, research universities, community colleges, State, local, and Federal governments together, and we figure out, where are some key opportunities for manufacturing in the future, how do we get out in front of the curve, how do we make sure everybody is working together? <p>And as a consequence, we're potentially able to get cutting-edge research and design to market faster, and businesses are intimately involved in the process of figuring out how these things can be applied in ways that are really going to boost the economy and, in some cases, create entirely new industries. <p>So these hubs are working on everything from 3-D printing&mdash;the idea that you can have some software and put in some materials and something pops out that actually works&mdash;to flexible computer chips that can be woven into the fabric of your shirt. <p>And today we're proud to announce our latest manufacturing hub, and it is right here in Tennessee. Led by the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, the hub will be home to 122 public and private partners who are teaming up to develop materials that are lighter and stronger than steel. So these are materials that would be ideal for fuel-efficient cars or longer wind turbine blades that produce more energy or materials that might go into our aviation sector. And of course, these advanced polymer composites are a sophisticated combination of materials like carbon fiber and tough plastics. That's&mdash;we saw some samples during our tour here. Everybody knows that. That means they're expensive to produce. So the idea here is for the partners to come together to see if we can not only come up with improved design, but also start driving down cost and look at new applications. <p>So Joe and I just watched how these folks develop the composites here at Techmer. That was cool. We lost Joe's attention when we laid eyes on that 3-D-printed sports car&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;the carbon filler Cobra. Biden started pulling out his aviator glasses&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and we had to explain to him, you don't get to drive on this trip. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But besides being a cool car, it's a great example of how the hub like this operates. So Oak Ridge National Labs creates&mdash;created the design and manufacturing processes. Techmer produced the composite materials. Another company called Tru-Design developed the surface finishing techniques. Undergrads from UT worked on the project, gaining skills that can help them get hired in the future. And a number of others partners chipped in as well. <p>So these hubs just make sense. They work. They get people working together. They create an ecosystem for a particular type of manufacturing and a specialization that allows, then, where the hub is located, to be a magnet for others who want to participate in this particular industry. And this is why&mdash;this is an area where Congress and I are working together. Bob Corker, myself, Governor Haslam, we're all interested in making sure that advanced manufacturing is taking place here in the United States. <p>Last month, I was glad to see Members of Congress from both parties pass legislation that supports the progress we've made by creating a real national network of hubs. Senators Brown and Blunt and Representatives Kennedy and Reed deserve credit for working together to get this legislation over the finish line. I'm working to work with Congress this year to fully fund the network. <p>Because places like this are who we are. We create. We innovate. We build. We do it together. When I was taking the tour and we had a chance to hear from John about how he got this company started: started off as an engineer, worked for another big company, and then decided he could it better and struck out on his own. And that story of entrepreneurship and taking a chance, that's what built this country. <p>But at every step of the way throughout our history, there have been instances where government can be a partner in that progress: whether it's creating infrastructure, whether it's financing the basic research that generates new products. That's a role we can play. We've got the most dynamic economy in the world, and we've got the best businesspeople in the world and the best universities in the world. Let's put them all together and make sure they're working to create more good jobs and more opportunity for the American people. <p>So congratulations to the new hub. Let's get to work. And I look forward to hearing about all the great things that are coming out of Clinton and across Tennessee and across America. Appreciate you. All right.\" "
"6" "\"Hello, everybody! Hey! Thank you! Everybody, please have a seat. Please have a seat. Well, it is good to be back in Tennessee. I hope you guys aren't getting tired of me. I've been coming around a lot lately, because there's a lot of good stuff happening here. <p>I want to begin by thanking Joe and Jill Biden. They're not just good friends and good partners, but they really believe in the power of education, and they really believe in creating those kinds of ladders to opportunity that gave all three of us and Michelle the chances, the incredible opportunities that we've had today. And they understand the promise of America's community colleges. Well, Jill really understands it, and Joe&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;he doesn't really have a choice. But&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>Before I get into the reason that I'm here today, I want to begin by saying just a few words about the tragic events that we've watched unfold in France over the last several hours and days. And because events have been fast moving this morning, I wanted to make sure to comment on them. <p>I just spoke to my counterterrorism adviser. We have been in close touch with the French Government throughout this tragedy. The moment that the outrageous attack took place, we directed all of our law enforcement and counterintelligence operations to provide whatever support that our ally needs in confronting this challenge. We're hopeful that the immediate threat is now resolved, thanks to the courage and professionalism of the French personnel on the ground. <p>But the French Government continues to face the threat of terrorism and has to remain vigilant. The situation is fluid. President Hollande has made it clear that they're going to do whatever is necessary to protect their people. And I think it's important for us to understand: France is our oldest ally. I want the people of France to know that the United States stands with you today, stands with you tomorrow. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families who have been directly impacted. We grieve with you. We fight alongside you to uphold our values, the values that we share, universal values that bind us together as friends and as allies. <p>And in the streets of Paris, the world has seen once again what terrorists stand for. They have nothing to offer but hatred and human suffering. And we stand for freedom and hope and the dignity of all human beings. And that's what the city of Paris represents to the world, and that spirit will endure forever, long after the scourge of terrorism is banished from this world. So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;that's important. Anyway. <p>Now, I'm in Knoxville not only because I just like Knoxville, but I'm here today because one of my resolutions is to make sure that folks across this great country feel like they are coming back. And there is no doubt: Thanks to the steps we took early on to rescue our economy and to rebuild it on a new foundation, America is coming back. <p>Now, I'm not running for office anymore, so let me just present the facts. I promised that 2014 would be a breakthrough year for America. This morning we got more evidence to back that up. In December, our businesses created 240,000 new jobs. Our unemployment rate fell to 5.6 percent, which is the lowest in 6&frac12; years. What that means is, 2014 was the strongest year for job growth since the 1990s. Unemployment fell in 2014 faster than any year since 1984. Now, think about that. It's been 30 years since unemployment fell as fast as it did last year. And most importantly, we're seeing faster job growth in industries that provide good-paying jobs, traditionally middle class jobs, than anything else. <p>Since 2010, the United States of America has created more jobs than Europe, Japan, and every other advanced economy combined. American manufacturing is in its best stretch of job growth since the 1990s. We're actually seeing companies insourcing instead of outsourcing. They're realizing, we want to be here with American workers making American products. America is now the world's number-one producer in oil, gas. We've doubled the production of clean energy. And by the way, you're saving about a buck-10 a gallon at the pump over this time last year. <p>Although, I keep on reminding folks, gas prices, they go up and they come down and then they go up. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I just want everybody to know that you should enjoy this. Take the money you're saving, pay off the credit card or go get a new appliance or buy a fuel-efficient car&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;so that when prices go back up, you're still well positioned. <p>Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, about 10 million Americans have gained health insurance over the past year. And by the way, we've done this while cutting our deficits by about two-thirds. Everybody thinks that&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. They did a survey; in every survey, they ask, is the deficit going up or going down? And 70 percent of Americans say that the deficit is going up. The deficit has come down by two-thirds since I took office. So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>Meanwhile, thanks to the hard work of students and educators, dropout rates are down, graduation rates are up. And after 13 long years, our war in Afghanistan has come to a responsible end, and we've got more troops that were home this holiday season. <p>So I say all this because these 6 years have demanded a lot of hard work and a lot of sacrifice on everybody's part. And as a country, we've got every right to be proud of what we've got to show for it. America's resurgence is real. And now that we've seen calmer waters economically, if we all do our part, if we all pitch in, then we can start making sure that all boats are actually lifted again and wages and incomes start rising again. And we can make sure that the middle class is the engine that powers America's prosperity just as it always has. <p>So that's going to be the focus of my State of the Union Address in a couple weeks. I wanted to give you a little preview. Don't tell anybody I said this&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but I'm giving you the inside scoop. That's the&mdash;that's going to be the essence of my message: How do we build on the progress that we've made? And I figured, why wait for the State of the Union? [<i>Laughter</i>] Why stand on formalities? Let's get the ball rolling right now. <p>Two days ago, I visited Michigan, where workers have brought the auto industry roaring back. And we talked about what else we can do around advanced manufacturing. Yesterday I was in Arizona, where I announced new actions to make the dream of homeownership a reality for more middle class families. Later today Joe and I are going to head to a company in Clinton to take action that will develop high-tech industry even further here in Tennessee. And right here, right now, at Pellissippi State, I'm going to announce one of my most important State of the Union proposals, and that's helping every American afford a higher education. <p>Now, part of the reason I wanted to come here was because Tennessee is at the forefront of doing some really smart stuff. And we've got some proud Tennesseans who can take some credit for the great work that's been done. First, your Governor, Bill Haslam, who's here. Your two very fine Senators: You've got Bob Corker and your senior Senator, Lamar Alexander, who's a former Secretary of Education himself, so he knows a little bit about this. You've got Congressman John Duncan. Your mayor, Madeline Rogero. And we've got Pellissippi's president, Anthony Wise. [<i>Applause</i>] Hey! And we've got all of you. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, Joe already&mdash;and Jill both already touched on these themes, but let me just amplify them a little bit. Here in America, we don't guarantee equal outcomes. Some folks work harder; some folks don't. Some folks take advantage of opportunities; some folks don't. Some people have good luck; some people have bad luck, and things don't always work out where everything is perfectly equal. But we do expect that everybody gets an equal shot. We do expect everybody can go as far as their dreams and hard work will take them. <p>We don't expect anybody to be bound by the circumstances of their birth. If they were, I wouldn't be here, and neither would Joe. Jill, she's so accomplished she would have succeeded no matter what. [<i>Laughter</i>] But we expect everybody to get a fair shot. And in exchange, we do our fair share. That's the basic bargain at the heart of this country: If you work hard, you can get ahead. It shouldn't matter what your last name is or what we look like or what family we were born into or how we worship. What matters is effort and merit. That's the promise of America. <p>And the way we deliver on that is making sure that our education system works on behalf of every person who lives here. America thrived in the 20th century in large part because we made high school the norm, and then, we sent a generation to college on the GI bill, including my grandfather. Then, we dedicated ourselves to cultivating the most educated workforce in the world, and we invested in what's one of the crown jewels of this country, and that's our higher education system. And then, dating back to Abraham Lincoln, we invested in land-grant colleges. We understood that this was a hallmark of America, this investment in education. <p>But eventually, the world caught on and the world caught up. And that's why we have to lead the world in education again. That's why my administration is working to make high-quality early childhood education available to all of our kids. We know if we invest in them early, it pays dividends on the backend. <p>That's why we're working to bring high-speed broadband to 99 percent of America's students within the next 4 years. We want to make sure every child is plugged in. That's why we're recruiting more highly trained math and science teachers. That's why we're working to raise standards and invest more in our elementary and middle and high schools so that every young person is prepared for a competitive world. <p>And this work is not easy. Sometimes, it's controversial. It's not going to be the same in every State. But in places like Tennessee, we're seeing incredible strides as a consequence of these efforts. Over the past few years, Tennessee's students have improved their reading scores and math scores more than any other State in the country. That's a credit to their hard work, their teachers' hard work, Governor Haslam's hard work, leaders from both parties. It's about&mdash;it's been a bipartisan effort. Every Tennessean should be proud of that. <p>And today, in a 21st-century economy, where your most valuable asset is your knowledge, the single most important way to get ahead is not just to get a high school education, you've got to get some higher education. And that's why all of you are here. <p>Now, the value of an education is not purely instrumental. Education helps us be better people. It helps us be better citizens. You came to college to learn about the world and to engage with new ideas and to discover the things you're passionate about&mdash;and maybe have a little fun. [<i>Laughter</i>] And to expand your horizons. That's terrific. That's a huge part of what college has to offer. But you're also here, now more than ever, because a college degree is the surest ticket to the middle class. It is the key to getting a good job that pays a good income and to provide you the security where even if you don't have the same job for 30 years, you're so adaptable and you have a skill set and the capacity to learn new skills, it ensures you're always employable. <p>And that is the key not just for individual Americans, that's the key for this whole country's ability to compete in the global economy. In the new economy, jobs and businesses will go wherever the most skilled, best educated workforce resides. Because businesses are mobile now. Technology means they can locate anywhere. And where they have the most educated, most adaptable, most nimble workforce, that's where they're going to locate. And I want them to look no further than the United States of America. I want them coming right here. I want those businesses here, and I want the American people to be able to get those businesses&mdash;or get those jobs that those businesses create. <p>So that's why we've increased grants and took on a student loan system that was funneling billions of taxpayer dollars through big banks and said, let's cut out the middleman, let's give them directly to students instead. We can help more students. <p>We've increased scholarships. We've cut taxes for people paying tuition. We've let students cap their Federal student loan payments at 10 percent of income so that they can borrow with confidence, particularly if you're going into a job like nursing or teaching that may not pay a huge salary, but that's where your passions are. <p>We're creating a new college ratings system that will give parents and students the kind of clear, concise information you need to shop around for a school with the best value for you and gives us the capacity to recognize schools that offer a great education at a reasonable price. <p>On the flight over here, Lamar and I were talking about how we can do more to simplify the application process for Federal student loans, which is still too complicated. <p>So we've done a lot of good work over the last 6 years; we're going to keep at it. But today I want to focus on a centerpiece of my education agenda, and that's the community colleges, like this one. <p>For millions of Americans, community colleges are essential pathways to the middle class because they're local, they're flexible. They work for people who work full time. They work for parents who have to raise kids full time. They work for folks who have gone as far as their skills will take them and want to earn new ones, but don't have the capacity to just suddenly go study for four years and not work. Community colleges work for veterans transitioning back into civilian life. Whether you're the first in your family to go to college or coming back to school after many years away, community colleges find a place for you. And you can get a great education. <p>Now, Jill has been teaching English at community colleges for 20 years. She started when she was, like, 15. [<i>Laughter</i>] And she's still full time today. And she sees&mdash;I talk to her, and she talks about her students, and she can see the excitement and the promise and sometimes the fear of being a 32-year-old mom who's going back to school and never finished the degree that she had started, and life got in the way, and now she's coming back and suddenly getting a whole new skill set and seeing a whole range of career options opening up to her. It's exciting. <p>And that's what community colleges are all about: the idea that no one with drive and discipline should be left out, should be locked out of opportunity, and certainly, that nobody with that drive and discipline should be denied a college education just because they don't have the money. Every American, whether they're young or just young at heart, should be able to earn the skills and education necessary to compete and win in the 21st-century economy. <p>So today I'm announcing an ambitious new plan to bring down the cost of community college tuition in America. I want to bring it down to zero. We're going to&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. I want to make it free. I want to make it free. Community colleges should be free for those willing to work for it, because in America, a quality education cannot be a privilege that is reserved for a few. I think it's a right for everybody who's willing to work for it. <p>Now, the good news is, you already do something like this in Tennessee. You call it Tennessee Promise. So you call it Tennessee Promise, and we thought, why not just build on what works? So we're going to call it America's College Promise. <p>And the concept is simple: America's College Promise will make 2 years of community college free to responsible students who are willing to work for it. Now, I want to underscore that last clause: everybody who's working hard for it. There are no free rides in America. You would have to earn it. Students would have to do their part by keeping their grades up. Colleges would have to do their part by offering high-quality academics and helping students actually graduate. States would have to do their part too. This isn't a blank check. It's not a free lunch. But for those willing to do the work, and for States and local communities that want to be a part of this, it can be a game changer. <p>Think about it: Students who started at community colleges during those 2 years and then go on to a 4-year institution, they essentially get the first half of their bachelor's degree for free. People who enroll for skills training will graduate ready&mdash;already ready to work, and they won't have a pile of student debt. Two years of college will become as free and universal as high school is today. <p>Now, we're also taking another page out of Tennessee's playbook and making investments to expand technical training programs at community colleges, much like you do through your 27 colleges of applied technology. Joe did a terrific job running a Task Force that we put together just to look at the job training and technical training systems all around the country. And at a time when jobs are changing and higher wages call for higher skills, we've got to make sure workers have a chance to get those skills. <p>We want young people to graduate with real-world training that leads directly to good jobs, and we want older workers to get retrained so they can compete. And we want more women and minorities to get jobs in fields that traditionally they've been left out of, like science and technology and engineering and math. And we want to connect community colleges with employers, because when that's done right, these partnerships pay off for everybody: Students learn on the job, employers get access to talent, colleges get help designing courses that actually prepare people for the workplace, all of which creates better pathways to today's middle class. So we're going to find the programs that work, and we're going to help them grow. <p>Now, in a few weeks, I'm going to send to Congress my plan for free community college. I hope that Congress will come together to support it, because opening the doors of higher education shouldn't be a Democratic issue or a Republican issue, this is an American issue. <p>Governor Haslam is a Republican. And thanks to his leadership, last year Democrats and Republicans came together and made Tennessee the first State in decades to offer free community college to its students. Meanwhile, up in my hometown of Chicago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who is a Democrat, is now offering free community college, and they're pairing students with growing sectors of the economy so they graduate with good jobs. So if a State with Republican leadership is doing this and a city with Democratic leadership is doing this, then how about we all do it? Let's do it for our future. <p>And as I said before, there are a bunch of good bipartisan ideas out there. A few days ago, Senator Alexander joined forces with a Democratic Senator, Michael Bennet, to introduce the legislation that would make financial aid forms simpler. I noticed a lot of people applauded, because it's been a while since I filled it out&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but I understand there's more than a hundred questions on it. It just shouldn't be that hard to apply for aid for college. And so I've committed to working with Senator Alexander. Let's shrink it down. Let's make life a little easier for millions of families. The point is, we're not going to agree on everything. But simplifying that form, that's something we should be able to agree on. Let's get that done this year. <p>Because in the end, nothing is more important to our country than you, our people. That's our asset. I mean, we've got very nice real estate here. We've got this incredible bounty, this&mdash;the God-given resources that we enjoy in this country. But our greatest resource is our people. <p>And I want to say to the students here and the staff and faculty how proud I am of what you guys are doing. A lot of students here, I know you had to overcome some obstacles to get here. Many of you are the first in your families to go to college. Some of you are working full time while you're going to school. But you're making this investment in you, and by doing that, you're making an investment in this country's future. <p>And I just want to use one person's story as an example, Caitlin McLawhorn. Where's Caitlin? Where is she? Is she here? I thought she was here a second ago. She&mdash;but I'm going to tell her story anyway. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>She was raised by a single mom. She helped make ends meet, getting her first job almost the minute she could, 2 days after her 16th birthday. When it came time for college, the money wasn't there. But Caitlin lives in Tennessee, so she knew she had a great, free option. She completed 2 years at this institution. Now she's a senior at Maryville College. She's working full time, just like she has since her first day of college. And Caitlin says: \\"A lot of people like me got discouraged. I get discouraged. But I can look back and say, you've made it so far. I've learned that things aren't always what you want, but you can make them what you want.\\" That's a&mdash;that's wisdom. <p>\\"Things aren't always what you want, but you can make them what you want.\\" That's what America is about. We can make of our lives what we will. And there are going to be bumps, and there are going to be challenges. And we've come through some very hard times. Things aren't always what we wanted, but we have overcome discouragement, and we have overcome division and sometimes some discord. And we don't give up. We get up, we fight back, we come back stronger than before. <p>Thanks to the hard work of the American people, the United States of America is coming back. And I've never been as confident as we&mdash;in my entire life that we're going to make of our future what we want of it thanks to you. <p>Appreciate it, Tennessee. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"7" "\"Hi, everybody. About a year ago, I promised that 2014 would be a breakthrough year for America. And this week, we got more evidence to back that up. <p>In December, our businesses created 240,000 new jobs. The unemployment rate fell to 5.6 percent. That means that 2014 was the strongest year for job growth since the 1990s. In 2014, unemployment fell faster than it has in three decades. <p>Over a 58-month streak, our businesses have created 11.2 million new jobs. After a decade of decline, American manufacturing is in its best stretch of job growth since the nineties. America is now the world's number-one producer of oil and gas, helping to save drivers about a buck-10 a gallon at the pump over this time last year. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, about 10 million Americans have gained health insurance in the past year alone. We've cut our deficits by about two-thirds. And after 13 long years, our war in Afghanistan has come to a responsible end, and more of our brave troops have come home. <p>It's been 6 years since the crisis. Those years have demanded hard work and sacrifice on everybody's part. So as a country, we have every right to be proud of what we've got to show for it. America's resurgence is real. And now that we've got some calmer waters, if we all do our part, if we all pitch in, we can make sure that tide starts lifting all boats again. We can make sure that the middle class is the engine that powers America's prosperity for decades to come. <p>That'll be the focus of my State of the Union Address in a couple weeks: building on the progress we've made. But I figured, why wait? Let's get started right now. <p>On Wednesday, I visited a Ford plant outside of Detroit, because the American auto industry and its home State are redefining the word \\"comeback.\\" On Thursday, I traveled to Arizona, a State that was hit among the hardest by the housing crisis, to announce a new plan that will put hundreds of dollars in new homeowners' pockets and help more new families buy their first home. And I'm speaking with you today from Pellissippi State Community College in Tennessee, a State making big strides in education, to unveil my new plan to make 2 years of community college free for every responsible student. I'm also here to establish a new hub that will attract more good-paying, high-tech manufacturing jobs to our shores. <p>Making homeownership easier, bringing a higher education within reach, creating more good jobs that pay good wages&mdash;these are just some of the ways we can help every American get ahead in the new economy. And there's more to come. Because America is coming back. And I want to go full speed ahead. <p>Thanks, everybody, and have a great weekend.\" "
"8" "\"Thank you so much. Thank you. Everybody, have a seat. Thank you. Well, thank you, Edith, for your introduction. As was mentioned, Edith and I go a long way back. In law school we served on the Law Review together. I will not say who edited who. [<i>Laughter</i>] I will say she looks exactly the same. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I do not. [<i>Laughter</i>] And it's upsetting. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But, Edith, in your career, you've stood up for citizens and communities. I was proud to nominate you, first as a Commissioner, and then as Chairwoman of the FTC. You are doing an outstanding job, as are your fellow Commissioners, and we very much appreciate your outstanding efforts. <p>In Edith's story, from the daughter of Mexican immigrants to the head of the FTC, we see a central part of the American story. And that's worth remembering at a time when those are issues that we're debating all the time. It's a reminder that what makes this country special is the incredible talent that we draw from all around the world and somehow it all merges into something unique: America. <p>To Edith, to the fellow Commissioners, to all of you who work at the FTC, thanks for welcoming me. I'm told I may be the first President to come to the FTC in nearly 80 years, since FDR in 19&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;first time apparently since FDR in 1937, which is a little surprising. I mean, you'd think, like, one of the Presidents would just come here by accident. [<i>Laughter</i>] You know, they ended up in the wrong building. [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"Where are we?\\" \\"We're at the FTC.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Anyway, I figured it was time to correct that. Plus, I know sometimes your name confuses folks. They don't always understand what your mission is. One person who does understand is David Letterman. [<i>Laughter</i>] A few months ago he thanked you for standing up to the companies that were trying to pitch a new weight-loss product, \\"caffeine-laced undergarments.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm actually not making this up. [<i>Laughter</i>] You ruled that these products were \\"not substantiated by scientific evidence.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] So thank you for saving America from caffeine-laced undergarments. [<i>Laughter</i>] These companies owed consumers a refund. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And that was just the latest example, because, as Edith said, you recently celebrated your 100th anniversary. And I want to thank you for a hundred proud years of protecting American consumers. I also want to thank some of the Members of Congress who are here today and many of our partners from not just government, but the private sector and consumer and privacy and advocacy groups. <p>Next week, just up the street, I will deliver the State of the Union Address. And it will be a chance to talk about America's resurgence, including something we can all be proud of, which is the longest stretch of private sector job growth in American history: 58 straight months and more than 11 million new jobs. In the speech, I'm going to focus on how we can build on that progress and help more Americans feel that resurgence in their own lives, through higher wages and rising incomes and a growing middle class. But since I've only got 2 years left in this job, I tend to be impatient, and I didn't want to wait for the State of the Union to start sharing my plans. So I've been traveling across the country rolling out some of the ideas that we'll be talking about, a little bit of a sneak preview. <p>And in the 21st century&mdash;in this dizzying age of technology and innovation&mdash;so much of the prosperity that we seek, so many of the jobs that we create, so much of the opportunity that's available for the next generation depends on our digital economy. It depends on our ability to search and connect and shop and do business and create and discover and learn online, in cyberspace. And as we've all been reminded over the past year, including the hack of Sony, this extraordinary interconnection creates enormous opportunities, but also creates enormous vulnerabilities for us as a nation and for our economy and for individual families. <p>So this week, I'm laying out some new proposals on how we can keep seizing the possibilities of an Information Age, while protecting the security and prosperity and values that we all cherish. Today I'm focusing on how we can better protect American consumers from identity theft and ensure our privacy, including for our children at school. And then tomorrow, at the Department of Homeland Security, I'll focus on how we can work with the private sector to better defend ourselves against cyber attacks. And finally, on Wednesday, in Iowa, I'll talk about how we can give families and communities faster, cheaper access to broadband so they can succeed in the digital economy. <p>But I wanted to start here, at the FTC, because every day you take the lead in making sure that Americans, their hard-earned money and their privacy are protected, especially when they go online. And these days, that's pretty much for everything: managing our bank accounts, paying our bills, handling everything from medical records to movie tickets, controlling our homes&mdash;smart houses&mdash;from smartphones. Secret Service does not let me do that. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I know other people do. <p>And with these benefits come risks: Major companies get hacked; America's personal information, including financial information, gets stolen. And the problem is growing, and it costs us billions of dollars. In one survey, 9 out of 10 Americans say they feel like they've lost control of their personal information. In recent breaches, more than a hundred million Americans have had their personal data compromised, like credit card information. When these cyber criminals start racking up charges on your card, it can destroy your credit rating. It can turn your life upside down. It may take you months to get your finances back in order. So this is a direct threat to the economic security of American families, and we've got to stop it. <p>If we're going to be connected, then we need to be protected. As Americans, we shouldn't have to base&mdash;have to forfeit our basic privacy when we go online to do our business. And that's why, since I took office, we've been working with the private sector to strengthen our cyber defenses. A few months ago, we launched our BuySecure initiative. The Federal Government and companies across the country are moving to stronger chip-and-PIN technology for credit cards. Here at the FTC, you're working with credit bureaus so that victims can recover their stolen identities faster, and every day, you're helping consumers with identitytheft.gov. <p>So today I'm announcing new steps to protect the identities and privacy of the American people. Let me list them for you. First, we're introducing new legislation to create a single, strong national standard so Americans know when their information has been stolen or misused. Right now almost every State has a different law on this, and it's confusing for consumers, and it's confusing for companies. And it's costly, too, to have to comply to this patchwork of laws. Sometimes, folks don't even find out their credit card information has been stolen until they see charges on their bill, and then it's too late. So under the new standard that we're proposing, companies would have to notify consumers of a breach within 30 days. In addition, we're proposing to close loopholes in the law so we can go after more criminals who steal and sell the identities of Americans, even when they do it overseas. <p>Second, I'm pleased that more banks, credit card issuers, and lenders are stepping up and equipping Americans with another weapon against identity theft, and that's access to their credit scores, free of charge. This includes JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, USAA, State Employees' Credit Union, Ally Financial. Some of them are here today. I want to thank them for their participation. This means that a majority of American adults will have free access to their credit score, which is like an early warning system telling you that you've been hit by fraud so you can deal with it fast. And we're encouraging more companies to join this effort every day. <p>Third, we're going to be introducing new legislation: a Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights. Working with many of you, from the private sector and advocacy groups, we've identified some basic principles to both protect personal privacy and ensure that industry can keep innovating. For example, we believe that consumers have the right to decide what personal data companies collect from them and how companies use that data, that information; the right to know that your personal information collected for one purpose can't then be misused by a company for a different purpose; the right to have your information stored securely by companies that are accountable for its use. We believe that there ought to be some basic baseline protections across industries. So we're going to be introducing this legislation by the end of next month, and I hope Congress joins us to make the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights the law of the land. <p>And finally, we're taking a series of actions to protect the personal information and privacy of our children. Those of us with kids know how hard this can be. Whether they are texting or tweeting or on Facebook or Instagram or Vine, our children are meeting up&mdash;and they are growing up&mdash;in cyberspace. It is all-pervasive. And here at the FTC, you've pushed back on companies and apps that collect information on our kids without permission. <p>And Michelle and I are like parents everywhere: We want to make sure that our children are being smart and safe online. That's a responsibility of ours as parents. But we need partners. And we need a structure that ensures that information is not being gathered without us as parents or the kids knowing it. We want our kids' privacy protected, whether&mdash;wherever they sign on or log on, including at school. <p>Now, we've&mdash;the good news is, we've got new educational technologies that are transforming how our children learn. You've got innovative websites and apps and tablets, digital textbooks and tutors. Students are getting lessons tailored to their unique learning needs. We want to encourage that information. And it also facilitates teachers and parents tracking student progress and grades in real time. And all this is part of what our ConnectED initiative is about: connecting 99 percent of American students to high-speed Internet so that we're empowering students, teachers, and parents and giving them access to worlds they may never have had access to before. <p>But we've already seen some instances where some companies use educational technologies to collect student data for commercial purposes, like targeted advertising. And parents have a legitimate concern about those kinds of practices. <p>So today we're proposing the Student Digital Privacy Act. And it's pretty straightforward. We're saying that data collected on students in the classroom should only be used for educational purposes: to teach our children, not to market to our children. We want to prevent companies from selling student data to third parties for purposes other than education. We want to prevent any kind of profiling that outs certain students at a disadvantage as they go through school. <p>And we believe that this won't just give parents more peace of mind, we're confident that it will make sure the tools we use in the classroom will actually support the breakthrough research and innovations that we need to keep unlocking new educational technologies. <p>Now, we didn't have to completely reinvent the wheel on this proposal. Many States have proposed similar legislation. California just passed a landmark law. And I hope Congress joins us in this national movement to protect the privacy of our children. <p>We won't wait for legislation though. The Department of Education is going to offer new tools to help schools and teachers work with tech companies to protect the privacy of students. As of today, 75 companies across the country have signed on to a Student Privacy Pledge. And among other things, they're committing not to sell student information or use educational technologies to engage in targeted advertising to students. <p>Some of those companies are here today. We want to thank you for your leadership. I want to encourage every company that provides these technologies to our schools to join this effort. It's the right thing to do. And if you don't join this effort, then we intend to make sure that those schools and those parents know you haven't joined this effort. <p>So this mission, protecting our information and privacy in the Information Age, this should not be a partisan issue. This should be something that unites all of us as Americans. It's one of those new challenges in our modern society that crosses the old divides, transcends politics, transcends ideology. Liberal, conservative, Democrat, Republican&mdash;everybody is online, and everybody understands the risks and vulnerabilities as well as opportunities that are presented by this new world. <p>Business leaders want their privacy and their children's privacy protected, just like everybody else does. Consumer and privacy advocates also want to make sure that America keeps leading the world in technology and innovation and apps. So there are some basic, commonsense, pragmatic steps that we ought to all be able to support. <p>And rather than being at odds, I think that much of this work actually reinforces each other. The more we do to protect consumer information and privacy, the harder it is for hackers to damage our businesses and hurt our economy. Meanwhile, the more companies strengthen their cybersecurity, the harder it is for hackers to steal consumer information and hurt American families. So we've got to all be working together in the same direction, and I'm confident if we do, we'll be making progress. <p>We are the company&mdash;we are the country that invented the Internet. And we're also the pioneers of this Information Age: the creators, the designers, the innovators. Our children are leaving us in the dust, I&mdash;if you haven't noticed. [<i>Laughter</i>] They're connecting and they're collaborating like never before and imagining a future we can only dream of. When we Americans put our minds together and our shoulder to the wheel, there's nothing we can do. So I'm confident, if we keep at this, we can deliver the prosperity and security and privacy that all Americans deserve. <p>We pioneered the Internet, but we also pioneered the Bill of Rights and a sense that each of us as individuals have a sphere of privacy around us that should not be breached, whether by our government, but also by commercial interests. And since we're pioneers in both these areas, I'm confident that we can be pioneers in crafting the kind of architecture that will allow us to both grow, innovate, and preserve those values that are so precious to us as Americans. <p>Thank you very much. And thanks to the FTC for all the great work you do to protect the American people. Thank you.\" "
"9" "\"<i>The President.</i> Well, hello, everybody! Welcome to the White House. Everybody, please have a seat. In case you didn't know, these are the NBA Champion San Antonio Spurs. I was considering having the Vice President cover these remarks so I could stay fresh for the State of the Union. [<i>Laughter</i>] Taking an example off Pop, who sits his stars sometimes&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but I decided I actually wanted to meet them. <p>So I know we've got a lot of Spurs fans in the house&mdash;no doubt&mdash;including a guy I stole from San Antonio, our Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, former Mayor Juli&aacute;n Castro. [<i>Applause</i>] Hey! And of course we want to welcome General Manager R.C. Buford and, of course, Coach Popovich. I want the coach to know that he is not contractually obligated to take questions after the first quarter of my remarks. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, look, I admit it, I'm a Bulls fan. It's never easy celebrating a non-Bulls team in the White House. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's all I've been able to do&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;so far. But even I have to admit that the Spurs are hard to dislike. First of all, they're old. [<i>Laughter</i>] And for an old guy, it makes me feel good to see&mdash;where's Tim? [<i>Laughter</i>] Tim's got some gray. There's a few others with a little sprinkles around here. There's a reason why the uniform is black and silver. [<i>Laughter</i>] So it makes me feel good to see that folks in advancing years can succeed in a young man's sport. <p>But it's also because this is an international team. It's the U.N. of basketball teams. And it shows the way that this wonderful sport has become an international sport. Some people have, rightfully, started calling it&mdash;the Spur's style of basketball&mdash;\\"the beautiful game.\\" And when you look at the passing and guys back-cutting to the hoop and sharing the basketball, you see basketball the way it should be played. And I was telling these guys, you can now see everybody around the league actually stealing, first of all, assistant coaches who then become coaches and then start applying that style of play all around the league. And it's made the game better. <p>Now, this has not always been the case, all the accolades that the Spur's received. Let's face it, just a little while back, people were saying that the Spurs were passed their prime, not just old, but kind of boring. Now they're fresh and exciting, which is basically the exact opposite of what happens to Presidents. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's a different trajectory. <p>Last season was all about redemption for the Spurs. Everybody remembers the heartbreaking loss&mdash;for the Spurs, not for Miami&mdash;2 years ago. And game six obviously was crazy. Not&mdash;I'm not going to make you relive all the details. As Tony Parker said, it seemed like the basketball gods were just being cruel. But the Spurs came back focused. <p>And Tim who's not used to&mdash;not renowned for his trash-talking, was very clear about the fact that they were going to get back to the Finals. They earned the league's best record, including a franchise-record 19 in a row. Made it back against the Finals and then eviscerated the Heat, winning in five games with an average margin of 14 points, which was the most lopsided margin in Finals history. <p>Now, that may have been a high-water mark for excellence, but this is an organization that has been marked by excellence, one of the best in professional supports. Since drafting Tim Duncan in 1997, they've won five titles. Tim has now won rings 15 years apart, only the second player in history to win titles in three different decades. Tim and Tony and Manu have&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;won more playoff games than any trio in NBA history. <p>But what's been remarkable as you watch this team over the decade is not just the incredible play of the Big Three, it's also how the organization always seems to be able to pull together those missing pieces and everybody performing at an incredibly high level. You've got Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard, who played magnificently. You've got Boris Diaw, one of the best passing big men in the game. Tiago Splitter and Danny Green, Patty Mills, Marco Belinelli&mdash;who we miss on the Bulls. [<i>Laughter</i>] You've got Matt Bonner, who my notes tell me is a sandwich blogger named Red Mamba. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, how can you not like a guy like that? [<i>Laughter</i>] Right on. <p>And San Antonio has a special bond with its fans. You've&mdash;you hear it in the \\"go Spurs, go\\" chants. You see it in how the Spurs give back to their community. Coach Popovich has helped the San Antonio Food Bank raise millions of dollars. The Spurs honor our troops and our veterans and their families with camouflage uniforms and discounted tickets. And earlier today they met with some of our wounded warriors from Walter Reed and Fort Belvoir. <p>And they've been outstanding supporters of San Antonio's East Side, an area I designated as a Promise Zone. They've created literacy programs, bought tablets and computers for schools. Spurs staffers have served as mentors for young people. So they've been leading in the community; they've been leading in terms of style of play. <p>I want to commend the Spurs as well for something they did after the championship: hiring Becky Hammon, who's the first female full-time assistant coach in the NBA. And as somebody who has got two daughters, one of who is a baller, it makes me feel good when excellence is recognized regardless of gender. <p>So that's what the Spurs do. They find ways to put together the best team, whether it means going to Australia or Italy or the WNBA. They want everybody on the court. They think everybody has worth. They find folks who didn't have a chance someplace else, and suddenly, they figure out a way to make them shine as part of a team. And in that sense, they're a great metaphor for what America should be all about. <p>So I just want to say, once again, congratulations. They're working through some injuries on their quest to another title. But I'll tell you what, if you guys need any tips on winning back to back, you know where to find me. [<i>Laughter</i>] So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p><i>Head Coach Gregg C. Popovich.</i> Mine isn't here, sir. <p><i>The President.</i> You don't get notes, man. [<i>Laughter</i>] Because&mdash;mainly, because you just give one-word answers. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Coach Popovich:</i> Exactly. What I want to remind the President about&mdash;if I might, with all due respect&mdash;when I sit stars, I get fined. He doesn't. So&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>But mostly I would just like to say thank you to the President and for all the people here for having us. It truly is an honor to be here. And for me, the most satisfying part is to be able to be with all these guys. They truly have gotten over themselves. They care about the group more than the individual. And I didn't do that. That's in their character. That's who they are. So it's a pleasure to have them here be honored by all of you, especially so many San Antonio fans and people that know San Antonio. We know that we answer to you all, and we feel that all the time. <p>The last thing I want to say is, all the pieces that the President talked about that get put together to keep the team at an excellent level, the guy responsible for that is right here, R.C. Buford. He's the guy that does that. <p>And now we have some things for the President, I believe. <p><i>The President.</i> All right, what have we got? We've got some stuff? <p>[<i>At this point, the President was presented with a team jersey and a basketball signed by team members.</i>]\" "
"10" "\"Well, I want to welcome the congressional leadership here to the White House. Harry Reid is absent because he is still convalescing a little bit from the mishap in the gym, but I know he'll be back strong next week, and I've had a chance to talk to him. I want to thank the Speaker and Leader McConnell, as well as Dick Durbin, filling in for Mr. Reid, and Nancy Pelosi and all the leadership that are here today. <p>First of all, some of these folks I haven't seen so I haven't had an opportunity to wish them Happy New Year. To the Speaker, I just want to point out&mdash;I said there are going to be some things that we agree on&mdash;having a college football playoff is clearly something that we can agree on. [<i>Laughter</i>] I called for it when I came into office, I think it turned out pretty well, particularly for Ohio&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;so I want to congratulate the Ohio State Buckeyes for their outstanding victory and commend Oregon as well for fielding a great team, because their quarterback is from my original home State of Hawaii. <p>And I also want to just talk to all this leadership about how we can keep the progress going that we're seeing, particularly in our economy. The latest job report indicates that the recovery continues to move in a robust fashion. We've now created 58 straight months of private sector job growth, about 11 million jobs created in the private sector. Unemployment rate has come down faster than any time in several decades. We now are seeing the strongest job growth overall, as well as in manufacturing, since the 1990s. We are producing more energy than ever before. The deficit has been cut by two-thirds. And we're finally starting to see some movement last year in wages going up at a time when families are also enjoying some lower gas prices. <p>So we're in a position to make sure that 2015 is an even stronger year, and relative to our competitors, we are holding much better cards. The key now is for us to work as a team to make sure that we build on this progress. Obviously, there are disagreements around the table on a whole range of issues, but there are also areas where we can agree, and that's where we're going to be focused. <p>Just to cite a few examples, I've got a State of the Union next week. One of the things we're going to be talking about is cybersecurity. With the Sony attacks that took place, with the Twitter account that was hacked by Islamist jihadist sympathizers yesterday, it just goes to show how much more work we need to do, both public and private sector, to strengthen our cybersecurity to make sure that families' bank accounts are safe, to make sure that our public infrastructure is safe. I've talked to both the Speaker as well as Mitch McConnell about this, and I think we agree that this is an area where we can work hard together, get some legislation done, and make sure that we are much more effective in protecting the American people from these kinds of cyber attacks. <p>I think that there's going to be opportunities for us to work together on trade. There's going to be opportunities for us to work together on simplifying the tax system and making sure everybody is paying their fair share. There are going to be opportunities for us to streamline Government so it's more responsible. And on each of these issues, I'm going to be listening to everybody around this table, and I'm hopeful that in the spirit of cooperation and putting America first, we can be in position where, at the end of this year, we'll be able to look back and say we're that much better off than we were when we started the year. <p>So I just wanted to thank everybody for being here, and I'm very much looking forward to not just this discussion, but some real collaboration over the course of the next several months. All right? <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"11" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. I want to thank Secretary Johnson, Deputy Secretary Mayorkas, and the dedicated public servants of the Department of Homeland Security for welcoming me here today. I've kind of taken over your workspace. I apologize for that, but just pretend that I'm not here. [<i>Laughter</i>] I want you to keep working. I did ask who dressed up for this event, and apparently, a few were brave enough to admit it. <p>But in advance of my State of the Union Address next week, I've been rolling out my proposals for keeping our economy on track, keeping it growing, making sure we're creating jobs and opportunity for the American people. And that includes the extraordinary opportunities that exist in our digital economy. <p>Yesterday I announced new proposals to better protect Americans from identity theft and ensure our privacy, including making sure that our kids are safe from digital marketing and intrusions on their privacy based on what they're doing at school. Tomorrow, in Iowa, I'll talk about how we can give more families and communities faster, cheaper access to the broadband that allows them to successfully compete in this global economy. And on Thursday, the Vice President will be in Norfolk to highlight the need to continue to invest in the education and skills for our cybersecurity professionals. But today I am here at DHS to highlight how we can work with the private sector to better protect American companies against cyber threats. <p>Shortly after I took office, I declared that cyber threats pose an enormous challenge for our country. It's one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face as a nation. Foreign Governments, criminals, and hackers probe America's computer networks every single day. We saw that again with the attack at Sony, which actually destroyed data and computer hardware that is going to be very costly for that company to clean up. Just yesterday we saw the hack of a military Twitter account and YouTube channel. No military operations were impacted. So far, it appears that no classified information was released. But the investigation is ongoing, and it's a reminder that cyber threats are an urgent and growing danger. <p>Moreover, much of our critical infrastructure&mdash;our financial systems, power grids, pipelines, health care systems&mdash;run on networks connected to the Internet. So this is a matter of public safety and of public health. And most of this infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector. So neither Government nor the private sector can defend the Nation alone. It's going to have to be a shared mission: Government and industry working hand in hand, as partners. <p>And that's why I've said that protecting our digital infrastructure is a national security priority and a national economic priority. Over the past 6 years, we've pursued a comprehensive strategy, boosting our defenses in Government, sharing more information with the private sector to help them defend themselves, working with industry through what we call the cybersecurity framework not just to respond to threats and recover from attacks, but to prevent and disrupt them in the first place. And that's where these good folks come in. We are currently at the National Cybersecurity Communications Integration Center, also known as NCCIC. I just got a tour and a briefing. I want to thank everybody here, not just from DHS, but from across Government and the private sector, because, again, this is a shared responsibility. <p>This center is one of the critical lines of America's cyber defenses. These men and women work around the clock, 24/7, monitoring threats, issuing warnings, sharing information with the private sector, and keeping Americans safe. So as a nation, we owe them thanks, and as a nation, we are making progress. We're more prepared to defend against cyber attacks. But every day, our adversaries are getting more sophisticated and more determined and more plentiful. So every day, we've got to keep upping our game at the same time. We've got to stay ahead of those who are trying to do us harm. <p>Now, the problem is that Government and the private sector are still not always working as closely together as we should. Sometimes, it's still too hard for Government to share threat information with companies. Sometimes, it's still too hard for companies to share information about cyber threats with the Government. There are legal issues involved and liability issues. Sometimes, companies are reluctant to reveal their vulnerabilities or admit publicly that they have been hacked. At the same time, the American people have a legitimate interest in making sure that Government is not potentially abusing information that it's received from the private sector. <p>So all of us&mdash;Government and industry&mdash;are going to have to keep doing better. The new legislation and proposals I put forward yesterday will help, especially for a strong, single national standard for notifying Americans when their information has been breached. Today I want to announce some additional steps. <p>First, we're proposing new cybersecurity legislation to promote the greater information sharing we need between Government and the private sector. This builds and improves upon the legislation that we've put forward in the past. It reflects years of extensive discussions with industry. It includes liability protections for companies that share information on cyber threats. It includes essential safeguards to ensure that Government protects privacy and civil liberties even as we're doing our job of safeguarding America's critical information networks. <p>I raised this issue again and the need for this legislation with congressional leaders this morning, including Speaker Boehner and Leader McConnell, and we all agree that this is a threat that has to be addressed, and I am confident that we should be able to craft bipartisan legislation soon to put these systems in place. We're going to keep on working with Congress to get this done. And in the meantime, we're going to do everything that we can with our existing authorities to make sure industry gets the information it needs to better defend itself. <p>Second, we're proposing to update the authorities the law&mdash;that law enforcement uses to go after cyber criminals. We want to be able to better prosecute those who are involved in cyber attacks, those who are involved in the sale of cyber weapons like botnets and spyware. We want to ensure that we're able to prosecute insiders who steal corporate secrets or individuals' private information. And we want to expand the authority of courts to shut down botnets and other malware. The bottom line: We want cyber criminals to feel the full force of American justice, because they are doing as much damage, if not more, these days as folks who are involved in more conventional crime. <p>Finally, and since this is a challenge that we can only meet together, I'm announcing that next month, we'll convene a White House summit on cybersecurity and consumer protection. It's a White House summit where we're not going to do it at the White House; we're going to go to Stanford University. And it's going to bring everybody together&mdash;industry, tech companies, law enforcement, consumer and privacy advocates, law professors who are specialists in the field, as well as students&mdash;to make sure that we work through these issues in a public, transparent fashion. <p>Because they're hard and they're complicated issues. But if we keep on working on them together and focus on concrete and pragmatic steps that we can take to boost our cybersecurity and our privacy, I'm confident that both our privacy will be more secure and our information, our networks, public health, public safety will be more secure. We're going to keep on at this as a Government, but we're also going to be working with the private sector to detect, prevent, defend, deter against attacks, and to recover quickly from any disruptions or damage. And as long as I'm President, protecting America's digital infrastructure is going to remain a top national security priority. <p>In closing, I want to say one of the areas I'll be working with Congress is to ensure that we don't let any disagreements keep us from fulfilling our most basic responsibilities. Last week's attack in Paris was a painful reminder that we have no greater duty than the security of the American people. And our national security should never be subject to partisan political games. Congress needs to fully fund our Department of Homeland Security, without delay, so that the dedicated public servants working here can operate with the certainty and confidence they need to keep the American people safe. And that's true across the board in the Department of Homeland Security. <p>So again, I want to thank Jeh and Deputy Secretary Mayorkas and everybody here at NCCIC and DHS for the great job you are doing. You are helping to keep the Nation safe and secure. <p>And with that, we're going to get out of here so you can get back to work. Who knows what's been happening while you've been paying attention to me? [<i>Laughter</i>] All right? Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"12" "\"<i>The President</i>. Hello, Cedar Falls! <p><i>Audience members</i>. Hello! <p><i>Audience member</i>. Welcome! <p><i>The President</i>. Thank you. It's good to be back. <p>Well, first of all, give Marc a big round of applause for the introduction and the great work he's doing. I also want to thank Mayor Jon Crews as well as Jim Krieg and the whole team here at Cedar Falls Utilities for hosting us here today. Give them a big round of applause. <p>We've got our Commerce Secretary, Penny Pritzker, here, as well as Iowa Congressman Dave Loebsack and Attorney General Tom Miller. [<i>Applause</i>] Yay, Tom! And I was reminded by the president that we have to give a shout-out to a top-25 basketball team that you've got here in town. The president was lobbying me about putting them in my brackets. I said, it's a little early. [<i>Laughter</i>] I've got to kind of see what happens the second half of the season. <p><i>Audience member</i>. [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President</i>. [<i>Laughter</i>] The Panthers are putting together a heck of a season again. And I think most folks learned a few years ago that when March rolls around, you do not bet against UNI. <p>Now, it's great to be back. I've seen a lot of good friends. Unfortunately, they're not giving me time to grab a beer down at the Pump Haus this trip, although I understand the mayor said he'd brought a Bud Light with me&mdash;or for me. The mayor brought a Bud Light, and he's trying to sneak it around Secret Service. [<i>Laughter</i>] But obviously, it's wonderful coming back to Iowa, even during winter, in fact, especially in the cold. These folks in Washington can't handle the cold. We know how to handle cold in the Midwest. <p>And here in Iowa, on a cold January caucus night about 7 years ago, we talked about change and said that it was time for us to move this country in a new direction. And obviously, a lot has changed. I'm much grayer, for example. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>As a country, we fought through the worst financial crisis and recession in our lifetimes. But the American people showed a lot of resilience and resolve. And there is no doubt about it: Thanks to the steps that we took early to rescue the economy, to rebuild it on a new foundation, America is coming back. <p>Last year was the strongest year for job growth since the 1990s. Unemployment fell in 2014 faster than any year since 1984. Our businesses have created more than 11 million jobs in the last 58 straight months. That's the longest stretch of private sector job growth in American history. Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and every other advanced economy combined. And a lot of folks talk about some of the jobs are being created in the service sector, they're not paying as much. The truth is, American manufacturing is in its best stretch of job growth since the 1990s. Manufacturing is actually growing faster than the rest of the economy. Meanwhile, America is now the number-one producer of oil and gas in the world. And by the way, you're saving about a buck-20 a gallon at the pump over this time last year. <p>So these past 6 years were trying, demanded a lot of hard work, a lot of sacrifice on everybody's part. But as a country, we have a right to be proud about what we've got to show for it. America's resurgence is real, and we're better position than any country on Earth to succeed in the 21st century. <p>Now, on Tuesday, I'm going to deliver my State of the Union Address, and in my speech, I'm going to focus on how we can build on the progress we've already made and help more Americans feel that resurgence in their daily lives, with higher wages and rising incomes and growing our middle class. But since I only got 2 years in office left, I'm kind of in a rush&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;so I didn't want to wait until the State of the Union to share some of my ideas and some of my plans. <p>I've been traveling across the country rolling out some of these ideas: plans to help more families afford a home, plans to make more students&mdash;can attend community college without loading up with debt, plans to make more workers find good jobs in high-tech manufacturing. And in the 21st century, in this age of innovation and in technology, so much of the prosperity that we're striving for, so many of the jobs that we want to create depend on our digital economy. It depends on our ability to connect and to shop and to do business and discover and learn online, in cyberspace. <p>So this week, I've been laying out new proposals on how we can keep seizing these opportunities in this Information Age, while at the same time protecting our security and our privacy and our prosperity and our values. On Monday, I announced new steps to protect American consumers from identity theft and make sure that your privacy is protected. Yesterday I spoke at the Department of Homeland Security about how we can work with the private sector to better defend American companies against cyber attacks. <p>Today I'm in Cedar Falls to talk about how we can give more communities access to faster, cheaper broadband so they can succeed in the digital economy. And I'm not telling you anything you don't already know. Today, high-speed broadband is not a luxury, it's a necessity. This isn't just about making it easier to stream Netflix or scroll through your Facebook newsfeed, although that's fun&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and it is frustrating if you're waiting for a long time before the thing finally comes up. [<i>Laughter</i>] This is about helping local businesses grow and prosper and compete in a global economy. It's about giving the entrepreneur, the small businessperson on Main Street a chance to compete with the folks out in Silicon Valley or across the globe. It's about helping a student access the online courses and employment opportunities that can help her pursue her dreams. <p>And that's why, through the Recovery Act, when I first came into office and we were trying to make sure that we prevented a Great Depression, but also start building some foundations for long-term growth, we built or improved more than 113,000 miles of network infrastructure throughout the country. That's enough to circle the globe more than four times. And we offered tax credits to help spur businesses to expand their networks. We've hooked up tens of thousands of schools and libraries and medical facilities and community organizations. And then, we launched something we call ConnectED, which trains teachers and spurs private sector innovation and is connecting 99 percent of America's students to high-speed Internet. <p>But&mdash;and this is why I'm here&mdash;we've still got a lot of work to do. Right now 98 percent of Americans have access to the most basic levels of broadband, and that's a good thing. But that number doesn't look quite as good when you look at the speeds we're going to need for all the apps and the videos and all the data and new software that is constantly coming onto market. We've got to keep pace. We've got to be up to speed. <p>Right now about 45 million Americans cannot purchase next-generation broadband. And those are&mdash;that next generation of broadband creates connections that are six or seven times faster than today's basic speeds. And by the way, only about half of rural Americans can log on at that superfast rate. <p>And if folks do have good, fast Internet, chances are, they only got one provider to pick from and today, tens of millions of Americans have only one choice for that next-generation broadband, so they're pretty much at the whim of whatever Internet provider is around. And what happens when there's no competition? You're stuck on hold. You're watching the loading icon spin. You're waiting and waiting and waiting. And meanwhile, you're wondering why your rates keep on getting jacked up when the service doesn't seem to improve. <p>Now, in Cedar Falls, things are different. About 20 years ago, in a visionary move ahead of its time, this city voted to add another option to the market and invest in a community broadband network. Really smart thing you guys did. [<i>Applause</i>] It was a really smart thing you guys did. And you've managed it right here at Cedar Falls Utilities. Then, a few years ago, you realized that customers were demanding more and more speed. All the movies, all the increased data, Instagram&mdash;all this stuff suddenly is just being loaded up, and basically, you guys were like the captain in \\"Jaws,\\" where he said, \\"We're going to need a bigger boat.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So having already made the smart investment 20 years ago, about 5 years ago you said, we've got to upgrade to a fiber network throughout the city and, eventually, with the help of some Federal funding, the surrounding rural areas as well. <p>So today, Cedar Falls is Iowa's first Gigabit City. Now, that sounds like something out of a Star Wars movie, Gigabit City. Here's what it means: Your network is as fast as some of the best networks in the world. There's Hong Kong, Tokyo, Paris, Cedar Falls. [<i>Laughter</i>] Right? That's the company you're keeping. <p>You are almost a hundred times faster than the national average&mdash;a hundred times faster. And you can log on for about the same price as some folks pay for a fully loaded cable bundle. So today, you've got small businesses like Marc's that are serving clients worldwide. Google named you the best city in Iowa for e-commerce. And what you're showing is that here in America, you don't have to be the biggest community to do really big things, you just have to have some vision, and you have to work together. <p>And we're seeing that same kind of innovation and that same kind of energy and foresight in communities across the country. In Lafayette, Louisiana, companies are bringing jobs to the city in part because of their fast, next-generation broadband network. In November, the people of Yuma County, Colorado, voted overwhelmingly in favor of a community broadband network. That's in the same election where 85 percent of folks just voted for a Republican Senate candidate. So this is not a partisan issue. It's not a red issue or a blue issue. Folks just want to know that they're at the cutting edge of this new economy. Folks around the Nation want these broadband networks. They're good for business. They're good for communities. They're good for schools. And they're good for the marketplace because they promote efficiency and competition. Here in Cedar Falls, if you don't want the highest speed package, you can still choose between the Cedar Falls Utilities or options like Mediacom or CenturyLink. It's not like you don't have choices. You can pick the company that offers the best service at the lowest cost for your family's needs. That's how free markets and capitalism are supposed to work. <p>But here's the catch: In too many place across America, some big companies are doing everything they can to keep out competitors. Today, in 19 States, we've got laws on the books that stamp out competition and make it really difficult for communities to provide their own broadband the way you guys are. In some States, it is virtually impossible to create a community network like the one that you've got here in Cedar Falls. So today I'm saying we're going to change that. Enough is enough. We're going to change that so every community can do the smart things you guys are doing. <p>So not long ago, I made my position clear on what's called net neutrality. I believe we've got to maintain a free and open Internet. Today I'm making my administration's position clear on community broadband. I'm saying I'm on the side of competition. And I'm on the side of small-business owners like Marc. I'm on the side of students and schools. I believe that a community has the right to make its own choice and to provide its own broadband if it wants to. Nobody is going to force you to do it, but if you want to do it, if the community decides this is something that we want to do to give ourselves a competitive edge and to help our young people and our businesses, they should be able to do it. <p>And if there are State laws in place that prohibit or restrict these community-based efforts, all of us&mdash;including the FCC, which is responsible for regulating this area&mdash;should do everything we can to push back on those old laws. I believe that's what stands out about America, this belief that more competition means better products and cheaper prices. We do that with just about every other product. We ought to be doing it with broadband. It's just common sense. <p>And that's why leaders from 50 cities and towns across the country&mdash;it's a coalition called Next Century Cities&mdash;have pledged to bring next-generation broadband to their cities and towns. And that's why I'm announcing a series of additional actions to support their efforts and encourage more communities to follow your lead, Cedar Falls. I'm directing Federal agencies to get rid of unnecessary regulations that slow the expansion of broadband or limit competition. They're going to report back to me in 6 months. The Department of Commerce&mdash;Penny Pritzker, who is here&mdash;they're going to work to offer support and tactical assistance to communities that want to follow your lead and set up their own networks. USDA&mdash;the Department of Agriculture&mdash;is announcing new loan opportunities for rural providers. And this summer, I'll host mayors from around the Nation at a community broadband summit to chart the next steps that we need to take. <p>So that's what we're going to be doing. We're going to clear away redtape. We're going to foster competition. We're going to help communities connect and help communities succeed in our digital economy. <p>And the good news is, we know it works because of you. [<i>Laughter</i>] You guys were like the guinea pigs on this thing. You took a chance and you made something happen. And you're supporting the jobs of the future through faster, cheaper Internet. We want everybody to do that. <p>Now, I want to leave you with a story of another community that has done this as well. Chattanooga, Tennessee&mdash;it's an old railroad town&mdash;was once called the dirtiest city in the Nation. During the recession, they were hit harder than most places. But that did not stop them from building America's first citywide, high-speed, fiber network, right down the middle of downtown. It's as fast as what you guys have got here in Cedar Falls. <p>Today, a new generation of engineers and entrepreneurs have moved down to Chattanooga. Big businesses have set up shop. Volkswagen built a billion-dollar manufacturing plant. It's unleashing a tornado of innovation. The city is even testing out futuristic technologies like 3-D holograms. And here's what their former mayor said: \\"It's like having\\"&mdash;\\"It's like being the first city to have fire.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"We don't know all of the things we can do with it yet.\\" <p>Yet. But think about that. And when you're first in something, when you figure something out, you may not know all the applications right away, but that's the spirit of America: imagining what might come next. We may not always know what's right around the corner, but we know we'll figure it out as long as we're bold and we go ahead and work together. <p>We've been through some very hard times. We didn't always know those hard times were coming, but we pulled together, we worked together, we relied on each other, we believed in each other, and we figured it out. <p>We're blessed with the greatest natural resource in the world&mdash;not corn&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but the pluck and the ingenuity and the willingness to take risks of the American people. And I'm absolutely confident, if we just give Americans the tools they need, if we just help lay the foundation and allow them to access the amazing opportunities and technologies at this moment in world history, we're not just going to continue recovering from a bad recession, we're going to ignite the next generation of American innovation. And it's going to start right here in Cedar Falls, Iowa. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless America. Thank you.\" "
"13" "\"Hello, everybody. I want to thank Amanda and the whole crew here at this wonderful coffee shop. And I also want to thank Vika and Mary, as well as the senior Senator from the State of Maryland, Barbara Mikulski. <p>We've had a great conversation about the announcements I'm making today and that I'll amplify in the State of the Union about how can we support working families so that they have the tools to succeed in this new economy. <p>Now, part of the reality of the new economy is that 60 percent of households have at&mdash;two people working, and if they've got kids or they've got an ailing parent, juggling both doing right by their families and making a living can be tough. <p>Now, one of the biggest problems that we have is that there are 43 million Americans who don't get paid sick leave, which, when you think about, is a pretty astonishing statistic. And that means that no matter how sick they are or how sick a family member is, they may find themselves having to choose to be able to buy groceries or pay the rent or look after themselves or their children. <p>And part of the reason we wanted to have this conversation here was because Amanda, is part of the cooperative that opened this coffee shop, is really adamant, as a small business, in looking after their employees and providing paid sick leave, in making sure that they're paying above minimum wage. And what Amanda's found&mdash;and we've heard this from a lot of employers&mdash;is, is that when they make that investment in their employees it pays dividends because the employees are more productive, there's lower turnover, there's greater productivity. And in fact, both large and small companies, it turns out, end up being more profitable over the long term, because, typically, any organization and certainly business is only going to be as good as its people. <p>We had a chance to hear from Mary, who is a school nurse as well as a small-businesswoman, and Mary made the point that even now, she finds herself in a situation where during flu season, you've got a kid who is at school, has a bad flu, she needs to call the parent to try to get them to pick up their kid, and the parent can't do it because they risk losing their job or losing a big chunk of their paycheck. And that obviously puts everybody else's kids at risk because you've got a sick child who can infect others. <p>Vika talked about a time in her life when she was basically a consultant, having small children and trying to juggle looking after them. And each time that she had to take a day off, that might cost her $150, which, when you're a young family getting started, that's going to have an impact on whether or not you can save to ultimately buy a home or start putting away savings for a college education. <p>So this is an issue that spans geography, spans demographics. Working families, middle class folks all across the country are concerned about it. And the good news is, we really can do something about it. <p>So today I'm going to be announcing our support and advocacy on behalf of a national 7-days&mdash;7 sick-day policy all across the country. And we're going to go beat the drum across cities and States to encourage not only that these laws are adopted nationally, but also that employers start adopting these policies as well. <p>And we're also going to help cities and States study and look at the feasibility of paid sick leave generally&mdash;or, excuse me, paid family leave generally, because we already have laws in place, the Family Medical Leave Act, that allows people to take the time off to look after their sick child or sick parent, but unfortunately, a lot of people just can't afford to take advantage of it. <p>So the good news is, the economy has picked up speed. We are past the point of crisis. We've seen 58 straight months of job growth. We have seen 11 million jobs created. The economy is stable and is building momentum. Now we have to make sure that that economy is benefiting everybody. <p>And by adopting this working families agenda, thinking about how we can provide more flexibility to families, thinking about how we can make sure that moms and dads don't have to choose between looking after their kids and doing what they need to do at work, thinking about all those families that are now trying to care for an aging parent&mdash;that kind of flexibility ultimately is going to make our economy stronger and is just one piece of what needs to be a really aggressive push to ensure that if you work hard in this country, then you can make it. <p>So I just want to thank this outstanding venue. The food was great. And I ate a little too much, but that's okay; it was off camera. [<i>Laughter</i>] I want to thank Mary, Vika, Amanda, and somebody who has been a champion for working families here in Maryland and across the country for a very long time, Barbara Mikulski. <p>All right? Thanks, guys.\" "
"14" "\"Hi, everybody. Every day, we get thousands of letters and emails at the White House from Americans across the country. And every night, I read 10 of them. They tell me about their hopes and their worries, their hardships and successes. They're the Americans I'm working for every day. And this year, several of these letterwriters will join me at the Capitol when I deliver my annual State of the Union Address on Tuesday night. <p>Carolyn Reed wrote to me from Colorado to tell me she was able to expand her business thanks to a loan from the Small Business Administration. Today, she and her husband own seven Silver Mine Sub Shops. And last year, they raised wages for all their hourly employees. <p>Victor Fugate, from Butler, Missouri, wrote to tell me that he was unemployed for a while a few years ago, but today, he's earned his degree and found a full-time job. Victor said that he and his wife were able to afford their student loans because our country offered millions of Americans the chance to cap their monthly payments as a percentage of their income. And because of the Affordable Care Act, they now have the security and peace of mind of affordable health insurance. <p>While serving in Afghanistan, Jason Gibson was gravely wounded: He lost both his legs. When I first met him in the hospital, he was just beginning his long, difficult road to recovery. But last year, Sergeant Gibson wrote to tell me that with the help of our extraordinary doctors and nurses, he's making extraordinary progress. He just moved into a new home, and he and his wife just had a baby girl. <p>Stories like these give us reason to start the new year with confidence. Two thousand fourteen was the fastest year for job growth since the 1990s. Unemployment fell faster than any year since 1984. Our combat mission in Afghanistan has come to a responsible end. And more of our heroes are coming home. America's resurgence is real. <p>Our job now is to make sure that every American feels that they're a part of our country's comeback. That's what I'll focus on in my State of the Union: how to build on our momentum with rising wages, growing incomes, and a stronger middle class. And I'll call on this new Congress to join me in putting aside the political games and finding areas where we agree so we can deliver for the American people. <p>The last 6 years have demanded resilience and sacrifice from all of us. All of us have a right to be proud of the progress America has made. And I hope you'll tune in on Tuesday to hear about the steps we can take to build on this progress and to seize this moment together. <p>Thanks, everybody, and have a great weekend.\" "
"15" "\"<i>The President. </i>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: We are 15 years into this new century. Fifteen years that dawned with terror touching our shores, that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars, that saw a vicious recession spread across our Nation and the world. It has been and still is a hard time for many. <p>But tonight we turn the page. Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis. More of our kids are graduating than ever before. More of our people are insured than ever before. And we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we've been in almost 30 years. <p>Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over. Six years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, fewer than 15,000 remain. And we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 generation who has served to keep us safe. We are humbled and grateful for your service. <p>America, for all that we have endured, for all the grit and hard work required to come back, for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this: The shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong. <p>At this moment&mdash;with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, booming energy production&mdash;we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth. It's now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years and for decades to come. <p>Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort? <p>Will we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing? Or will we lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet? <p>Will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another? Or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled America forward? <p>In 2 weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical, not partisan. And in the months ahead, I'll crisscross the country making a case for those ideas. So tonight I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us. <p>It begins with our economy. Seven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds. [<i>Laughter</i>] She waited tables. He worked construction. Their first child Jack was on the way. They were young and in love in America. And it doesn't get much better than that. \\"If only we had known,\\" Rebekah wrote to me last spring, \\"what was about to happen to the housing and construction market.\\" As the crisis worsened, Ben's business dried up, so he took what jobs he could find, even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time. Rebekah took out student loans and enrolled in community college and retrained for a new career. They sacrificed for each other. And slowly, it paid off. They bought their first home. They had a second son Henry. Rebekah got a better job and then a raise. Ben is back in construction and home for dinner every night. <p>\\"It is amazing,\\" Rebekah wrote, \\"what you can bounce back from when you have to. . . . We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.\\" We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times. <p>America, Rebekah and Ben's story is our story. They represent the millions who have worked hard and scrimped and sacrificed and retooled. You are the reason that I ran for this office. You are the people I was thinking of 6 years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis, when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation. And it has been your resilience, your effort that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger. <p>We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing and draw new jobs to our shores. And over the past 5 years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs. <p>We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet. And today, America is number one in oil and gas. America is number one in wind power. Every 3 weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008. And thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save about $750 at the pump. <p>We believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world. And today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record. Our high school graduation rate has hit an alltime high. More Americans finish college than ever before. <p>We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition. Today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices. And in the past year alone, about 10 million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage. <p>At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious, that we would crush jobs and explode deficits. Instead, we've seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years. This is good news, people. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So the verdict is clear. Middle class economics works. Expanding opportunity works. And these policies will continue to work as long as politics don't get in the way. We can't slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with Government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns. We can't put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street or refighting past battles on immigration when we've got to fix a broken system. And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, I will veto it. It will have earned my veto. <p>Today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives. Wages are finally starting to rise again. We know that more small-business owners plan to raise their employees' pay than at any time since 2007. But here's the thing: Those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure Government doesn't screw things up&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that Government doesn't halt the progress we're making. We need to do more than just do no harm. Tonight, together, let's do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American. <p>Because families like Rebekah's still need our help. She and Ben are working as hard as ever, but they've had to forego vacations and a new car so that they can pay off student loans and save for retirement. Friday night pizza, that's a big splurge. Basic childcare for Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota. Like millions of hard-working Americans, Rebekah isn't asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead. <p>And in fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot. We set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity. We gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the Internet, tools they needed to go as far as their efforts and their dreams will take them. <p>That's what middle class economics is: the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, everyone plays by the same set of rules. We don't just want everyone to share in America's success, we want everyone to contribute to our success. <p>So what does middle class economics require in our time? First, middle class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change. That means helping folks afford childcare, college, health care, a home, retirement. And my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year. <p>Here's one example. During World War II, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority, so this country provided universal childcare. In today's economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality childcare more than ever. <p>It's not a nice-to-have, it's a must-have. So it's time we stop treating childcare as a side issue, or as a women's issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us. And that's why my plan will make quality childcare more available and more affordable for every middle class and low-income family with young children in America, by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year. <p>Here's another example. Today, we are the only advanced country on Earth that doesn't guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers. Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave&mdash;43 million. Think about that. And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home. So I'll be taking new action to help States adopt paid leave laws of their own. And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let's put it to a vote right here in Washington. Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn 7 days of paid sick leave. It's the right thing to do. [<i>Applause</i>] It's the right thing to do. <p>Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages. That's why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work. I mean, it's 2015. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's time. We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they've earned. And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work full time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, try it. If not, vote to give millions of the hardest working people in America a raise. <p>Now, these ideas won't make everybody rich, won't relieve every hardship. That's not the job of government. To give working families a fair shot, we still need more employers to see beyond next quarter's earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company's long-term interest. We still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give American workers a voice. <p>But you know, things like childcare and sick leave and equal pay, things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage&mdash;these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families. That's a fact. And that's what all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, were sent here to do. <p>Now, second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills. America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of GIs to college, trained the best workforce in the world. We were ahead of the curve. But other countries caught on. And in a 21st-century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to up our game. We need to do more. <p>By the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education&mdash;two in three. And yet we still live in a country where too many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the education they need. It's not fair to them, and it's sure not smart for our future. And that's why I'm sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college to zero. <p>Keep in mind, 40 percent of our college students choose community college. Some are young and starting out. Some are older and looking for a better job. Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market. Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy without a load of debt. Understand, you've got to earn it. You've got to keep your grades up and graduate on time. <p>Tennessee, a State with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible. I want to spread that idea all across America so that 2 years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today. Let's stay ahead of the curve. And I want to work with this Congress to make sure those already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments so that student debt doesn't derail anyone's dreams. <p>Thanks to Vice President Biden's great work to update our job training system, we're connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding and nursing and robotics. Tonight I'm also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships, opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher paying jobs even if they don't have a higher education. <p>And as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend. Already, we've made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care. We're slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need. And we're making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs. And Joining Forces, the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;thank you, Michelle; thank you, Jill&mdash;has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get a new job. So to every CEO in America, let me repeat: If you want somebody who's going to get the job done and done right, hire a veteran. <p>Finally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill. Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined. <p>Our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs. Some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming. But there are also millions of Americans who work in jobs that didn't even exist 10 or 20 years ago, jobs at companies like Google and eBay and Tesla. <p>So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future. But we do know we want them here in America. We know that. And that's why the third part of middle class economics is all about building the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where businesses want to locate and hire. <p>Twenty-first century businesses need 21st-century infrastructure: modern ports and stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest Internet. Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this. So let's set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline. Let's pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than 30 times as many jobs per year and make this country stronger for decades to come. Let's do it. Let's get it done. [<i>Applause</i>] Let's get it done. <p>Twenty-first century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more American products overseas. Today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages. But as we speak, China wants to write the rules for the world's fastest growing region. That would put our workers and our businesses at a disadvantage. Why would we let that happen? We should write those rules. We should level the playing field. And that's why I'm asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren't just free, but are also fair. It's the right thing to do. <p>Look, I'm the first one to admit that past trade deals haven't always lived up to the hype, and that's why we've gone after countries that break the rules at our expense. But 95 percent of the world's customers live outside our borders. We can't close ourselves off from those opportunities. More than half of manufacturing executives have said they're actively looking to bring jobs back from China. So let's give them one more reason to get it done. <p>Twenty-first century businesses will rely on American science and technology, research and development. I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine, one that delivers the right treatment at the right time. <p>In some patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable. So tonight I'm launching a new precision medicine initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier. We can do this. <p>I intend to protect a free and open Internet, extend its reach to every classroom and every community and help folks build the fastest networks so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world. I want Americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs: converting sunlight into liquid fuel; creating revolutionary prosthetics so that a veteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kids again; pushing out into the solar system not just to visit, but to stay. Last month, we launched a new spacecraft as part of a reenergized space program that will send American astronauts to Mars. And in 2 months, to prepare us for those missions, Scott Kelly will begin a year-long stay in space. So good luck, Captain. Make sure to Instagram it. We're proud of you. <p>Now, the truth is, when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research, I know there's bipartisan support in this Chamber. Members of both parties have told me so. Where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments. As Americans, we don't mind paying our fair share of taxes as long as everybody else does too. But for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the Tax Code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight. They've riddled it with giveaways that the super-rich don't need, while denying a break to middle class families who do. <p>This year, we have an opportunity to change that. Let's close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad and reward those that invest here in America. Let's use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and to make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home. Let's simplify the system and let a small-business owner file based on her actual bank statement, instead of the number of accountants she can afford. And let's close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top 1 percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth. We can use that money to help more families pay for childcare and send their kids to college. We need a Tax Code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy, and we can achieve that together. [<i>Applause</i>] We can achieve it together. <p>Helping hard-working families make ends meet, giving them the tools they need for good-paying jobs in this new economy, maintaining the conditions of growth and competitiveness&mdash;this is where America needs to go. I believe it's where the American people want to go. It will make our economy stronger a year from now, 15 years from now, and deep into the century ahead. <p>Of course, if there's one thing this new century has taught us, it's that we cannot separate our work here at home from challenges beyond our shores. My first duty as Commander in Chief is to defend the United States of America. In doing so, the question is not whether America leads in the world, but how. When we make rash decisions, reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads, when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military, then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world. That's what our enemies want us to do. <p>I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership. We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy, when we leverage our power with coalition building, when we don't let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents. That's exactly what we're doing right now. And around the globe, it is making a difference. <p>First, we stand united with people around the world who have been targeted by terrorists, from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris. We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we have done relentlessly since I took office, to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies. At the same time, we've learned some costly lessons over the last 13 years. Instead of Americans patrolling the valleys of Afghanistan, we've trained their security forces, who have now taken the lead, and we've honored our troops' sacrifice by supporting that country's first democratic transition. Instead of sending large ground forces overseas, we're partnering with nations from South Asia to North Africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten America. <p>In Iraq and Syria, American leadership&mdash;including our military power&mdash;is stopping ISIL's advance. Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group. We're also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism. <p>Now, this effort will take time. It will require focus. But we will succeed. And tonight I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL. We need that authority. <p>Second, we're demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy. We're upholding the principle that bigger nations can't bully the small, by opposing Russian aggression and supporting Ukraine's democracy and reassuring our NATO allies. <p>Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies, as we were reinforcing our presence with frontline states, Mr. Putin's aggression, it was suggested, was a masterful display of strategy and strength. That's what I heard from some folks. [<i>Laughter</i>] Well, today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated with its economy in tatters. That's how America leads: not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve. <p>In Cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date. When what you're doing doesn't work for 50 years, it's time to try something new. [<i>Laughter</i>] And our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere. It removes a phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba. It stands up for democratic values and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people. And this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo. <p>As His Holiness Pope Francis has said, diplomacy is the work of \\"small steps.\\" And these small steps have added up to new hope for the future in Cuba. And after years in prison, we are overjoyed that Alan Gross is back where he belongs. Welcome home, Alan. We're glad you're here. <p>Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran, where, for the first time in a decade, we've halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material. Between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran, secures America and our allies, including Israel, while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict. There are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran. <p>But new sanctions passed by this Congress, at this moment in time, will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails: alienating America from its allies, making it harder to maintain sanctions, and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again. It doesn't make sense. And that's why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress. The American people expect us only to go to war as a last resort, and I intend to stay true to that wisdom. Third, we're looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century. No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids. So we're making sure our Government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to combat terrorism. <p>And tonight I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber attacks, combat identity theft, and protect our children's information. That should be a bipartisan effort. If we don't act, we'll leave our Nation and our economy vulnerable. If we do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe. <p>In West Africa, our troops, our scientists, our doctors, our nurses, our health care workers are rolling back Ebola, saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease. I could not be prouder of them, and I thank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts. But the job is not yet done, and the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics, invest in smart development, and eradicate extreme poverty. <p>In the Asia-Pacific, we are modernizing alliances while making sure that other nations play by the rules: in how they trade, how they resolve maritime disputes, how they participate in meeting common international challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief. And no challenge&mdash;no challenge&mdash;poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change. <p>Two thousand fourteen was the planet's warmest year on record. Now, 1 year doesn't make a trend, but this does: 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century. <p>Now, I've heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying they're not scientists, that we don't have enough information to act. Well, I'm not a scientist, either. But you know what, I know a lot of really good scientists&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;at NASA and at NOAA and at our major universities. And the best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we don't act forcefully, we'll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration and conflict and hunger around the globe. The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. We should act like it. <p>And that's why, over the past 6 years, we've done more than ever to combat climate change, from the way we produce energy to the way we use it. That's why we've set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history. And that's why I will not let this Congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts. I am determined to make sure that American leadership drives international action. <p>In Beijing, we made a historic announcement: The United States will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution. And China committed, for the first time, to limiting their emissions. And because the world's two largest economies came together, other nations are now stepping up and offering hope that this year the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we've got. <p>And there's one last pillar of our leadership, and that's the example of our values. As Americans, we respect human dignity, even when we're threatened, which is why I have prohibited torture and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained. It's why we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world. It's why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims, the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace. That's why we defend free speech and advocate for political prisoners and condemn the persecution of women or religious minorities or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. We do these things not only because they are the right thing to do, but because ultimately, they will make us safer. <p>As Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice. So it makes no sense to spend $3 million per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit. Since I've been President, we've worked responsibly to cut the population of Gitmo in half. Now it is time to finish the job. And I will not relent in my determination to shut it down. It is not who we are. It's time to close Gitmo. <p>As Americans, we cherish our civil liberties, and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and industry in our fight against terrorist networks. So while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs, I have not. As promised, our intelligence agencies have worked hard, with the recommendations of privacy advocates, to increase transparency and build more safeguards against potential abuse. And next month, we'll issue a report on how we're keeping our promise to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy. <p>Looking to the future instead of the past, making sure we match our power with diplomacy and use force wisely, building coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities, leading always with the example of our values&mdash;that's what makes us exceptional. That's what keeps us strong. That's why we have to keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of standards: our own. <p>You know, just over a decade ago, I gave a speech in Boston where I said there wasn't a liberal America or a conservative America, a Black America or a White America, but a United States of America. I said this because I had seen it in my own life, in a nation that gave someone like me a chance; because I grew up in Hawaii, a melting pot of races and customs; because I made Illinois my home, a State of small towns, rich farmland, one of the world's great cities, a microcosm of the country where Democrats and Republicans and Independents, good people of every ethnicity and every faith, share certain bedrock values. <p>Over the past 6 years, the pundits have pointed out more than once that my Presidency hasn't delivered on this vision. How ironic, they say, that our politics seems more divided than ever. It's held up as proof not just of my own flaws&mdash;of which there are many&mdash;but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided, naive, that there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it. <p>I know how tempting such cynicism may be. But I still think the cynics are wrong. I still believe that we are one people. I still believe that together, we can do great things, even when the odds are long. <p>I believe this because over and over in my 6 years in office, I have seen America at its best. I've seen the hopeful faces of young graduates from New York to California and our newest officers at West Point, Annapolis, Colorado Springs, New London. I've mourned with grieving families in Tucson and Newtown, in Boston, in West, Texas, and West Virginia. I've watched Americans beat back adversity from the Gulf Coast to the Great Plains, from Midwest assembly lines to the Mid-Atlantic seaboard. I've seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country, a civil right now legal in States that 7 in 10 Americans call home. So I know the good and optimistic and big-hearted generosity of the American people who every day live the idea that we are our brother's keeper and our sister's keeper. And I know they expect those of us who serve here to set a better example. <p>So the question for those of us here tonight is how we, all of us, can better reflect America's hopes. I've served in Congress with many of you. I know many of you well. There are a lot of good people here on both sides of the aisle. And many of you have told me that this isn't what you signed up for: arguing past each other on cable shows, the constant fundraising, always looking over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision. <p>Imagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns. Imagine if we did something different. Understand, a better politics isn't one where Democrats abandon their agenda or Republicans simply embrace mine. A better politics is one where we appeal to each other's basic decency instead of our basest fears. A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other, where we talk issues and values and principles and facts rather than \\"gotcha\\" moments or trivial gaffes or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people's daily lives. <p>A politics&mdash;a better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter and spend more time lifting young people up with a sense of purpose and possibility, asking them to join in the great mission of building America. <p>If we're going to have arguments, let's have arguments, but let's make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country. We still may not agree on a woman's right to choose, but surely we can agree it's a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing alltime lows and that every woman should have access to the health care that she needs. <p>Yes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student and agree that no one benefits when a hard-working mom is snatched from her child and that it's possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. I've talked to Republicans and Democrats about that. That's something that we can share. <p>We may go at it in campaign season, but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred, that it's being denied to too many, and that on this 50th anniversary of the great march from Selma to Montgomery and the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we can come together, Democrats and Republicans, to make voting easier for every single American. <p>We may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York. But surely we can understand a father who fears his son can't walk home without being harassed. And surely we can understand the wife who won't rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift. And surely we can agree that it's a good thing that for the first time in 40 years, the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform America's criminal justice system so that it protects and serves all of us. <p>That's a better politics. That's how we start rebuilding trust. That's how we move this country forward. That's what the American people want. And that's what they deserve. <p>I have no more campaigns to run. <p>[<i>At this point, some audience members applauded.</i>] <p>My only agenda&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <i>Audience member</i>. [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President. </i>I know because I won both of them. [<i>Laughter</i>] My only agenda for the next 2 years is the same as the one I've had since the day I swore an oath on the steps of this Capitol: to do what I believe is best for America. If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight, I ask you to join me in the work at hand. If you disagree with parts of it, I hope you'll at least work with me where you do agree. And I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger. <p>Because I want this Chamber, I want this city to reflect the truth: that for all our blind spots and shortcomings, we are a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides, to unite in common effort, to help our neighbors, whether down the street or on the other side of the world. <p>I want our actions to tell every child in every neighborhood, your life matters, and we are committed to improving your life chances, as committed as we are to working on behalf of our own kids. I want future generations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a great gift, that we're a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen: man and woman, young and old, Black and White, Latino, Asian, immigrant, Native American, gay, straight, Americans with mental illness or physical disability. Everybody matters. I want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true: that we are still more than a collection of red States and blue States, that we are the United States of America. <p>I want them to grow up in a country where a young mom can sit down and write a letter to her President with a story that sums up these past 6 years: \\"It's amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to. . . . We are a strong, tight-knit family who's made it through some very, very hard times.\\" <p>My fellow Americans, we too are a strong, tight-knit family. We too have made it through some hard times. Fifteen years into this new century, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking America. We have laid a new foundation. A brighter future is ours to write. Let's begin this new chapter together, and let's start the work right now. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless this country we love. Thank you.\" "
"16" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Boise State! Oh, it's good to be back! Can everybody please give Camille a big round of applause for that introduction? I love young people who are doing science. And I especially love seeing young women in sciences. And so we're very proud of what Camille is doing. <p>A couple other people I want to mention. Your mayor, Mayor Bieter, is here. Flew&mdash;where is he? Where is he? There he is. Flew back with me on Air Force One. And he didn't break anything. [<i>Laughter</i>] It was amazing though. When we were coming back, he was telling me the story about his grandfather, an immigrant from the Basque region, coming here and how he would herd sheep. And for 5 years, he would be up in the mountains and the hills, and then come down to town for, like, 2 months a year, and the rest of the time he was up there. And I figured, his dad was a pretty tough guy, because I'll bet it gets kind of cold up in the hills. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Another person I want to mention&mdash;this is somebody who I actually have known for a really long time. He was the Lieutenant Governor in Illinois, now is your outstanding president here at Boise State: President Kustra. Give him a big round of applause. There he is. It's good to see Illinoisans do something with their lives. [<i>Laughter</i>] We're proud of them. <p>Thanks to all the Broncos for having me. And thanks for the balmy weather. I thought it was going to be a little colder around here. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So last night I gave my State of the Union Address. And today I'm going to be shorter. It won't be too short, just a little shorter. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I focused last night on what we can do, together, to make sure middle class economics helps more Americans get ahead in the new economy. And I said that I'd take these ideas across the country. And I wanted my first stop to be right here in Boise, Idaho. <p>Now, there are a couple reasons for this. The first is because, last year, Michelle and I got a very polite letter from a young girl named Bella Williams, who is here today. Where's Bella? There she is right there. Wave, Bella. Bella is 13 now, but she was 12 at the time. So she wrote me a letter, and she said, \\"I know what you're thinking: Wow, what's it like in Boise, Idaho?\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] So she invited me to come visit. And she also invited me to learn how to ski or snowboard with her. Now, as somebody who was born in Hawaii, where there's not a lot of snow&mdash;let me put it this way&mdash;you do not want to see me ski. [<i>Laughter</i>] Or at least the Secret Service does not want to see me ski. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But what I do know about Boise is that it's beautiful. I know that because I've been here before. I campaigned here in 2008. It was really fun. And the truth is, because of the incredible work that was done here in Idaho, it helped us win the primary. And I might not be President if it weren't for the good people of Idaho. Of course, in the general election, I got whupped. [<i>Laughter</i>] I got whupped twice, in fact. But that's okay; I've got no hard feelings. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>In fact, that's exactly why I came back. Because I ended my speech last night with something that I talked about in Boston just over a decade ago, and that is, there is not a liberal America or a conservative America, but a United States of America. And today, I know it can seem like our politics are more divided than ever. And in places like Idaho, the only blue turf is on your field. And the pundits in Washington hold up these divisions in our existing politics and they show, well, this is proof that any kind of hopeful politics, that's just naive. But as I told you last night, I still believe what I said back then. I still believe that, as Americans, we have more in common than not. <p>I mean, we have an entire industry that's designed to sort us out. Right? Our media is all segmented now so that instead of just watching 3 stations, we got 600. And everything is market segmented, and you got the conservative station and the liberal stations. So everybody is only listening to what they already agree with. And then, you've got political gerrymandering that sorts things out so that every district is either one thing or the other. And so there are a lot of institutional forces that make it seem like we have nothing in common. <p>One of the great things about being President is you travel all across the country, and I've seen too much of the good and generous and big-hearted optimism of people, young and old, folks like Bella. I've seen how, deep down, there's just a core decency and desire to make progress together among the American people. That's what I believe. <p>So I've got 2 years less&mdash;left in office, and I am not going to stop trying make&mdash;trying to make our politics work better. That's what you deserve. That's how we move the country forward. And, Idaho, we've got big things to do together. I may be in the fourth quarter of my Presidency, but here, at the home of the team with the most famous \\"Statue of Liberty\\" play in history, I don't need to remind you that big things happen late in the fourth quarter. <p>So here's where we're starting in 2015. Our economy is growing. Our businesses are creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. Our deficits have been cut by two-thirds. Our energy production is booming. Our troops are coming home. We have risen from recession better positioned, freer to write our own future than any other country on Earth. <p>But as I said last night, now we've got to choose what future we want. Are we going to accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well? <p><i>Audience members.</i> No! <p><i>The President.</i> Or can we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and opportunities for everybody who's willing to try hard? <p>For 6 years, we've been working to rebuild our economy on a new foundation. And what I want people to know is, thanks to your hard work and your resilience, America is coming back. And you'll recall, when we were in the midst of the recession, right after I came into office, there was some arguments about the steps we were taking. There were questions about whether we were doing the right thing. But we believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing and draw new jobs back to America. And over the past 5 years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs. <p>We believed that with smart energy policies, we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet. Today, America is number one in oil production and gas production and wind production. And every 3 weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008. And meanwhile, thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the average family this year should save about 750 bucks at the pump. <p>We believed we could do better when it came to educating our kids for a competitive world. And today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record. Our high school graduation rate has hit an alltime high. More young people like folks right here at Boise State are finishing college than ever before. <p>We figured sensible regulations could encourage fair competition and shield families from ruin and prevent the kind of crises that we saw in 2007, 2008. And today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts. And in the past year alone, about 10 million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage, including right here in Idaho. <p>Now, sometimes, you'd think folks have short memories, because at every step of the way, we were told that these goals were too misguided, or they were too ambitious, or they'd crush jobs, or they'd explode deficits, or they'd destroy the economy. You remember those, right? Every step we took, it's, oh, this is going to be terrible. And instead, we've seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade. And we've seen the deficits, as I said, go down by two-thirds. And people's 401(k)s are stronger now because the stock market has doubled. And health care inflation is at the lowest rate in 50 years. Lowest rate in 50 years. <p>Here in Boise, your unemployment rate has fallen below 4 percent, and that's almost two-thirds from its peak 5 years ago. <p>So the verdict is clear. The ruling on the field stands. [<i>Laughter</i>] Middle class economics works. Expanding opportunity works. These policies will keep on working, as long as politics in Washington doesn't get in the way of our progress. We can't suddenly put the security of families back at risk by taking away their health insurance. We can't risk another meltdown on Wall Street by unraveling the new rules on Wall Street. I'm going to stand between working families and any attempt to roll back that progress. <p>Because today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives. Wages are finally starting to go up. More small-business owners plan to raise their employees' pay than at any time since 2007. So we need to keep on going. Let's do more to restore the link between hard work and opportunity for every single American. That's our job. [<i>Applause</i>] That's our job. Let's make sure all our people have the tools and the support that they need to go as far as their dreams and their effort will take them. <p>That's what middle class economics is: the idea that this country does best when everybody gets a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same set of rules. We don't want to just make sure that everybody shares in America's success, we actually think that everybody can contribute to America's success. And when everybody is participating and given a shot, there's nothing we cannot do. <p>So here's what middle class economics requires in this new economy. Number one, it means helping working families feel more secure in a constantly changing economy. It means helping folks afford childcare and college and paid leave at work and health care and retirement. And I'm sending Congress a plan that's going to help families with all of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families, putting thousands of dollars back into your pockets each year. Giving you some help. <p>Number two, middle class economics means that we're going to make sure that folks keep earning higher wages down the road, and that means we've got to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills. And that's what all of you are doing right here at Boise State. You heard Camille's story. She's a mechanical engineering major. She's a great example of why we're encouraging more women and more minorities to study in high-paying fields that traditionally they haven't always participated in: in math, in science, in engineering, in technology. Camille has done research for NASA. She's gotten real job experience with industry partners. She's the leader of your Microgravity Team. [<i>Laughter</i>] And by the way, she's a sophomore. So by the time she's done, she might have invented time travel by the time she's done here at Boise. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But the point is, I want every American to have the kinds of chances that Camille has. Because when we've got everybody on the field, that's when you win games. I mean, think about if we had as many young girls focused and aspiring to be scientists and astronauts and engineers. That's a whole slew of talent that we want to make sure is on the field. <p>And so we've been working to help more young people have access to and afford college, with grants and loans that go farther than before. And when I came into office, we took action to help millions of students cap payments on their loans at 10 percent of their income so that they could afford to, let's say, take a research job after graduation and not be overburdened by debt. That's why I want to work with Congress to make sure every student already burdened with loans can reduce your monthly payments by refinancing. <p>But there are a lot of Americans who don't always have the opportunity to study someplace like Boise State. They need something that's local; they need something that's more flexible. You've got older workers looking for a better job. Or you've got veterans coming back and trying to figure out how they can get into the civilian workforce. You've got parents who are trying to transition back into the job market, but they've got to work and pay the rent and look after their kids, but they still want to make something of themselves. So they can't always go full time at a 4-year institution. And that's why I'm sending Congress a bold, new plan to lower the cost of community college to zero to zero. <p>The idea is, in the new economy, we need to make 2 years of college as free and as universal in America as high school is today. Because that was part of our huge advantage back in the 20th century. We were the first out of the gate to democratize education and put in place public high schools. And so our workforce was better educated than any other country in the world. But the thing is, other countries caught up. They figured it out. They looked at America and said, why is America being so successful? Their workers are better educated. We were on the cutting edge then; now we've got to be pushing the boundaries for the 21st century. <p>And just like we pick up a tool to build something new, we can pick up a skill to do something new. And that's something that you're doing right here at Boise. Every year, you sponsor HackFort, which is, for those of you who are not aware, this is a tech festival that brings the community together to share knowledge and new skills with one another. And I know we've got some folks from some of Boise's dozen or so tech \\"meetups\\" here today. <p>Here at Boise State, innovation is a culture that you're building. And you're also partnering with companies to do two things: You help students graduate with skills that employers are looking for, and you help employees pick up the skills they need to advance on the job. So you're working together. And you're seeing progress, and it's contributing to the economic development of the city and the State, as well as being good for the students. <p>And that's why my administration is connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding or robotics, as well as traditional fields like nursing. And today, we're partnering with business across the country to \\"Upskill America\\": to help workers of all ages earn a shot at better, higher paying jobs, even if they don't have a higher education. We want to recruit more companies to help provide apprenticeships and other pathways so that people can upgrade their skills. We've&mdash;we're all going to have to do that in this new economy. But it's hard to do it on your own, especially if you're already working and supporting a family. <p>Now, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for those workers to fill. And that's why the third part of middle class economics is about building the most competitive economy in the world. We want good jobs being created right here in the United States of America, not someplace else. <p>And we've got everything it takes to do it. Just to go back to Bella's question&mdash;\\"Wow, what's it like in Boise, Idaho?\\"&mdash;well, one of the answers is, you're the cutting edge of innovation. <p>I had a chance to tour your New Product Development lab, and I've got to say, this was not the stuff I was doing in college. [<i>Laughter</i>] So one group was showing me how they 3-D-printed a custom handle that a local student with developmental disabilities could access his locker independently, without anybody's help. But this whole 3-D printing concept was creating prototypes so that if you have a good idea, you don't have to have a huge amount of money. You can come and students and faculty are going to work with you to develop a prototype that you may then be able to sell as a product at much lower cost. <p>Another group is working with a local company, Rekluse, to manufacture parts for high-performance motorcycles. Now, that excites Vice President Biden. [<i>Laughter</i>] I might bring him with me the next time I come to Boise. Some of your faculty and students are working with next-generation materials like graphene, which is a material that's thinner than paper and stronger than steel. It's amazing. <p>And the work you do here is one of the reasons why Boise is one of our top cities for tech startups. And that means we shouldn't just be celebrating your work, we should be investing in it. We should make sure our businesses have everything they need to innovate, expand in this 21st-century economy: the research dollars that leads to new inventions, the manufacturers who can make those inventions here in America, the best infrastructure to ship products and the chance to sell those products in growing markets overseas, a free and open Internet that reaches every classroom and every community so this young generation of innovators and entrepreneurs can keep on remaking our world. <p>Now, those of you who were watching last night know that I made these arguments before Congress. Most of these are ideas that traditionally were bipartisan. I was talking to Bob. Bob was a Republican Lieutenant Governor, but I'm not sure he'd survive now in a primary. But&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. But the ideas I just talked about, those are things that traditionally all of us could agree to. I mean, after all, the State we come from, Illinois, that's the \\"Land of Lincoln,\\" and Lincoln was the first Republican President. And he started land-grant colleges, and he built railroads and invested in the National Science Foundation. And he understood that this is what it takes for us to grow together. <p>But watching last night, some of you may have noticed, Republicans were not applauding for many of these ideas. [<i>Laughter</i>] They were kind of quiet. But when it comes to issues like infrastructure and research, I think, when you talk to them privately, when they're not on camera&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;they generally agree that it's important. Educating our young people, creating good jobs, being competitive&mdash;those things shouldn't be controversial. But where too often we run onto the rocks, where the debate starts getting difficult, is how do we pay for these investments? Because it requires dollars. I mean, the labs here and the infrastructure that we need, those things don't just pop up for free. And the private sector, which is the heartbeat of our economy, it doesn't build roads; it doesn't create ports; it doesn't lay down all the Internet lines that&mdash;or the broadband lines that are required to reach remote communities. So we have to make some investments; we've got to figure out how to pay for it. <p>And as Americans, we don't mind paying our fair share of taxes, as long as everybody else does. Where we get frustrated is when we know that lobbyists have rigged the Tax Code with loopholes, so you've got some corporations paying nothing while others are paying full freight. You've got the super-rich getting giveaways they don't need and middle class families not getting the breaks that they do need. <p>So what I said last night to Congress is, we need to make these investments, we need to help families, we need to build middle class economics. And here's how we can pay for it. Let's close those loopholes. Let's stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad; let's reward companies that are investing here in America. <p>Let's close the loopholes that let the top 1 or .1 or .01 percent avoid paying certain taxes and use that money to help more Americans pay for college and childcare. The idea is, let's have a Tax Code that truly helps working Americans&mdash;the vast majority of Americans&mdash;get a leg up in this new economy. <p>And that's what I believe in. That's what I believe in. I believe in helping hard-working families make ends meet. And I believe in giving all of us the tools we need so that if we work, hard we can get good-paying jobs in this new economy. And I believe in making sure that our businesses are strong and competitive and making the investments that are required. <p>That's where America needs to go. And I believe that's where Americans want America to go. And if we do these things, it will make our economy stronger, not just a year from now or 10 years from now, but deep into the next century. <p>Now, I know there are Republicans who disagree with my approach. I could see that from their body language yesterday. [<i>Laughter</i>] And if they do disagree with me, then I look forward to hearing from them how they want to pay for things like R&D and infrastructure that we need to grow. They should put forward some alternative proposals. <p>I want to hear specifically from them how they intend to help kids pay for college. It is perfectly fair for them to say, we've got a better way of meeting these national priorities. But if they do, then they've got to show us what those ideas are. And what you can't do is just pretend that things like childcare or student debt or infrastructure or basic research are not important. And you can't pretend there's nothing we can do to help middle class families get ahead. There's a lot we can do. <p>Some of the commentators last night said, well, that was a pretty good speech, but none of this can pass this Congress. But my job is to put forward what I think is best for America. The job of Congress, then, is to put forward alternative ideas, but they've got to be specific. It can't just be no. [<i>Laughter</i>] I just want&mdash;I'm happy to start a conversation. Tell me how we're going to do the things that need to be done. Tell me how we get to yes. <p>I want to get to yes on more young people being able to afford college. I want to get to yes on more research and development funding. I want to get to yes for first-class infrastructure to help our businesses succeed. I want to get to yes! But you've got to tell me, work with me here. Work with me! Come on! Don't just say no! You can't just say no. <p><i>Audience member.</i> <i>Si, se puede!</i> <i>The President.</i> <i>Si, se puede!</i> Yes, we can! <p>Look, we may disagree on politics sometimes. Not \\"may\\"&mdash;we often, all the time disagree. That's the nature of a democracy. But we don't have to be divided as a people. We're on the same team. When the football team divides up into offense and defense, they probably go at it pretty hard during practice, but they understand, well, we're part of the same team. We're supposed to be rooting for each other. If a quarterback controversy arises and there's a competition, I'm going to be fighting real hard to be&mdash;get that starting spot. But if I don't get it, I'm going to be rooting for the team. <p>Whoever we are&mdash;whether we are Republican or Democrat or Independent or young or old or Black, White, gay, straight&mdash;we all share a common vision for our future. We want a better country for your generation and for your kids' generation. And I want this country to be the one that shows the world what we still know to be true: that we are not just a collection of red states and blue States, we are still the United States of America. That's what we're fighting for. That's what we're pushing for. <p>And if you agree with me, then join me, and let's get to work. We've got a lot of stuff to do in this new century. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"17" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Kansas! Rock Chalk! Can everybody give Alyssa a big round of applause for the great introduction? It is good to be at KU! I've got to admit, I took a moment to meet with Coach Self and the KU basketball team. I mean, we're here for other business, but while I was here&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I thought I should talk to some basketball players. And it is January, so that means that the Jayhawks are at the top of the Big 12, hunting for your 11th straight conference title. <p>I want to thank your chancellor, Bernadette Gray-Little. I want to thank Mayor Amyx for having me. I recently heard from Bob Dole as well, who told me he's very proud of his Institute of Politics here. Any school of politics named for Bob Dole is one I'd be proud of too, because he is a great Kansan and a great American. <p>Now, it's good to be back in Kansas. I've got deep roots in Kansas. As you know, my mom was born in Wichita. Her mom grew up in Augusta. Her father was from El Dorado. So I'm a Kansas guy. [<i>Applause</i>] I'm a Kansas guy. <p>Now, that helped me in the caucus here in 2008. It didn't help me as much in the general election. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member.</i> We're sorry! <p><i>The President.</i> Coach Self won 10 straight. I lost two straight here. [<i>Laughter</i>] But that's okay. Listen, I love you, and I might have won sections of Lawrence. That's possible. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's a possibility. [<i>Laughter</i>] But look, this is exactly why I've come back to Kansas today. <p>On Tuesday, I gave my State of the Union Address. And I just want you to know, today I will be shorter. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I want to begin where I finished on Tuesday, because I talked about in the State of the Union how, over a decade ago, in Boston at the Democratic Convention, I gave a speech where I said there is no liberal America or conservative America, there's a United States of America. We're all supposed to be on the same team. <p>And I know it can seem sometimes like our politics is more divided than ever, that in places like Kansas, the only blue stands for KU. [<i>Laughter</i>] And so because of those divisions the pundits in Washington, they hold this up as proof that any vision of a more hopeful politics must be naive or misguided. But as I pointed out, I still believe what I said back then. I still believe that we, as Americans, have more in common than not. And I have seen too much of the good, generous, big-hearted optimism of the American people over these past 6 years to believe otherwise. <p>I will never stop trying to make our politics work better. That's what you deserve, and that's how we move this country forward. And, Kansas, we've got some big things to do together. [<i>Applause</i>] We've got some big things to do. <p>Now, we start this year with some good news. Our economy is creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. Our deficits are shrinking. Energy production is booming. Our troops are coming home. We have risen from recession in a better position, freer to write our own future than any nation on Earth. So now we've got to choose what our future will look like. And when I look out at this crowd, it's your generation in particular that's going to have to decide what this future looks like. Are we going to accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well? Or do we commit ourselves to an economy that generates opportunity and rising incomes for everybody who's willing to work hard and make an effort? That's a choice we've got to make. <p>For 6 years, we've been working to rebuild our economy on a new foundation. And what I want people to know is, thanks to your hard work, thanks to your resilience, America is coming back. We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing and draw new jobs to our shore. And over the past 5 years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs. <p>We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet at the same time. And today, America is number one in oil and gas, but we're also number one in wind power. And every 3 weeks, we bring as much solar power online as we did in all of 2008. We have doubled clean power production. And thanks not just to lower gas prices, but also higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save about 750 bucks at the pump. <p>We believed that we could prepare our kids for this more competitive world, a 21st-century economy. And today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record. Our high school graduation rate has hit an alltime high. And more young people like you are finishing college than ever before. <p>We believed that sensible regulations should encourage fair competition and shield families from ruin and prevent the kind of crisis that we saw in 2007, 2008. So today, we've got new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts. And in the past year alone, about 10 million uninsured Americans have finally gained the security of health coverage. We've gotten that done. <p>Now, at every step, we were told that we were misguided or too ambitious or the laws we passed would explode deficits or crush jobs or destroy the economy. I just want everybody to remember that. [<i>Laughter</i>] Roll back the tape. [<i>Laughter</i>] Roll back the tape. And instead, we've seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade. We've seen the deficits cut by two-thirds. People's 401(k)s are in better shape because the stock market has doubled. We have put ourselves in a position in which the economy potentially can grow not just for next year or the year after that, but over the next decade, and generate the kind of jobs that all of you will fill. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Thank you! <p><i>The President.</i> So the verdict is in: Middle class economics works. Providing opportunity for everybody works. The ruling on the field stands. [<i>Laughter</i>] And these policies are going to continue to work as long as we don't let politics get in the way, especially politics in Washington. We can't put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance. We're not going to get rid of the rules we put in place to check recklessness on Wall Street. If those efforts come to my desk, I will veto them, because we're moving in the right direction. <p>And here's what's most important. Today, because the economy is growing at a faster pace, we're starting to actually see wages tick up for the first time in a very long time. And a survey of small businesses showed, they are more likely to provide raises to their employees than any time since 2007. So we've got to make sure that all people have the tools and the support that they need to take advantage of this growing economy. It's not good enough just to not screw it up, let's build on the momentum and move it even further. Let's keep it going. Let's keep it going. That's what we've got to focus on. [<i>Applause</i>] That's what we've got to focus on. So how do we restore this link between hard work and being able to get ahead? How do we make sure that everybody is doing their fair share, everybody has a fair shot, and everybody is playing by the same set of rules? How do we make sure that everybody not only shares in success, but also is able to contribute to the success of the United States of America? That is middle economics&mdash;middle class economics. That's our project. And that's something that, by the way, shouldn't be a Democratic or a Republican issue. That should be an American issue. All of us should want that kind of success for the middle class and everybody who's willing to work hard to try to get into the middle class. <p>So what does middle class economics require? Well, the first thing is trying to give people a sense of security at a time when they economy is so rapidly changing, so dynamic, that people can't rely on being in one place, in one job for 30 years, 40 years. That's not going to be the career that young people like you have. You're going to be doing a whole range of things, and it's going to be fluid. And you're going to have to be taking advantage of opportunities, and you're going to have to adapt to new circumstances. <p>And so part of what we have to do is to make sure that we're giving families some sense of security in the midst of all this change. And that means helping folks afford childcare. It means helping folks afford college. It means helping folks get paid leave at work. It means making sure people have health care. It means helping the first-time homebuyer. It means helping folks save for retirement&mdash;although you guys don't have to worry about that for a while. [<i>Laughter</i>] I see he raised his hand, \\"Actually, I do.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And so I'm sending Congress a budget, a plan, that's going to help a family with all of these issues: lowering the taxes for working families by thousands of dollars, putting it&mdash;money back into their pockets so that they can have a little bit of cushion in their lives. We can do that. And today I want to focus on one of those ideas, and that's childcare. <p>Now, I mentioned my grandparents were from Kansas. Well, my grandfather, Stanley Dunham, he went to Europe to fight in World War II. And while he was gone, my grandmother, she was like Rosie the Riveter&mdash;Madelyn. She worked on an assembly plant for bombers. And because it was a national priority, having women in the workforce was critical. All right? My grandmother worked at a bomber assembly line in Wichita. And by that time, my mom had already been born. So this country provided universal health&mdash;childcare because they understood that if women are working, they're going to need some help. Right? They understood that. And research shows that it was good for the kids, good for the parents. But we stopped doing it, even though almost every other advanced country on Earth continued to do it&mdash;learned from us and did it. <p>Now, in today's economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, affordable, high-quality childcare and early childhood education, this&mdash;these aren't just nice-to-haves, this is a must-have. And studies show that children who get a high-quality early education earn more over their lifetimes than their peers who don't. <p>So think about that. You give somebody&mdash;you give parents support, and you give a child that little boost at the beginning, it lasts a lifetime, which means that the entire economy is more productive for a lifetime, for a generation. Young people who get that good early start are more likely to finish school; they're less likely to get in trouble with the law. And access to childcare can lead to higher employment and incomes for the moms, which means, the whole family is doing better. So the point is, if we knew how to do this back in 1943 and '44, and here we are in 2015, what's the holdup? It is time that we stop treating childcare as a side issue or a quote, unquote, women's issue. This is a family issue. This is a national economic priority for all of us. We can do better than we're doing right now. <p>And right now, in 31 States, high-quality childcare costs more than a year of tuition at a State university. Think about that. And by the way, this is personal for me because Michelle, and I remember what it was like trying to&mdash;and we had good jobs. But trying to figure out how to manage childcare costs was extraordinary, at the same as you're paying back student loans. So this is what&mdash;this is something you have a deep interest in, all of you. Because I'm assuming some of you are going to have a little bit of school debt. [<i>Laughter</i>] Just a little. And then, you start a family, and now you want to start saving for their college education. But in the meantime, you're already paying the equivalent of college tuition just to make sure that they're okay at home. This is a strain that cuts&mdash;and by the way, Republican families feel it just as much as Democratic families. [<i>Laughter</i>] They don't&mdash;there's no distinction. <p>I don't want any family to face the choice between not working or leaving their children in unsafe or poor-quality childcare. We are a better country than that. [<i>Applause</i>] We're a better country than that. <p>So that's why my plan will make quality childcare available and affordable to every middle class and low-income family in America with young children. We're going to expand access to high-quality care for more than 1 million children, and we're going to offer a tax cut of up $3,000 per child per year. I don't want anybody being \\"daycare poor.\\" <p>And we're going to build on a bipartisan law that I signed last year to improve the quality of childcare options so that parents know their children are well cared for, because we also want to lift up the quality of the facilities there. <p>And I just had the chance to visit the Community Children's Center, which is a Head Start center here in Lawrence. Had a chance to spend time with 48 lucky kids. [<i>Laughter</i>] Because they're teachers are wonderful, not because the&mdash;although, they all say, \\"I know you.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"I see you on TV.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] That's what they always say, \\"I seen you in&mdash;on TV.\\" I say, yes. Yes. [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"You're the President.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So you have these wonderful teachers, and the light in all of these children's eyes, the sense of possibility and potential for these kids, made me just that much more determined to keep strengthening and keep promoting and expanding early childhood education: to give all of our children a strong start. I want to support expectant mothers. I want to make sure we've got universal childcare to preschool for all. It's the best investment we can make. It is the right thing to do. We can do more to help families make ends meet. <p>Now, even as we're doing these things, there are some other things we've got to do to help families who are middle class or working their way into the middle class. Higher wages helps, which means Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work. I mean, come on now, it's 2015. This should be sort of a no-brainer. Congress still needs to raise the minimum wage. Like I said on Tuesday, if there are Members of Congress who really believe that they can work full time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, they should try it. And if not, they should vote to give millions of hard-working people across America the raise that they deserve. <p>And if we're going to make sure that more and more people are earning higher wages down the road as the economy continues to transform, then we've got to help to make sure that more Americans like all of you are in a position to upgrade your skills. That's what you're doing here. And that's the second part of middle class economics. That's why we've been working to help more young people access and afford college. That's why I took action to help millions of students cap payments on their loans at 10 percent of their income. So if you want to go into teaching or you want to go into public service or you want to go into basic research&mdash;any field that doesn't pay you a huge amount of money&mdash;you can do it. <p>I want to make&mdash;I want to work with Congress to make sure every student who's already burdened with loans can find a way to refinance and reduce your monthly payments. And that's why I'm sending Congress a bold, new plan to lower the cost of community college to zero. [<i>Applause</i>] Down to zero. In the new economy, 2 years of college should be as free and as universal as high school is today. <p>The third part of middle class economics means we've got to build the most competitive economy in the world, and that means building the best infrastructure, opening new markets so we can sell products around the world, and investing in research so we keep on being the creators of new products and businesses can keep creating jobs right here in Kansas and around the world&mdash;and sell them around the world. <p>Now, the good news is, Lawrence gets it. You're&mdash;that's why you're encouraging private companies to compete against one another to offer high-speed broadband at better prices. And now you've got networks as fast as some of the best in the world: There's Hong Kong, there's Tokyo, there's Paris, and there's Lawrence. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So helping families feel more secure, including helping with childcare costs and improving the quality of childcare options; making sure that you have the capacity to finance, constantly upgrading your skills; making sure that we've got a competitive economy, including not just roads and bridges and traditional infrastructure, but the new infrastructure of the 21st century&mdash;those are the things we need to do to keep the momentum going. <p>Now, Republicans in Congress may disagree with some of my ideas. You noticed that I didn't get as much applause from them as I was hoping. [<i>Laughter</i>] But the truth, is when it comes to infrastructure and research, both parties generally agree that it's important. They say that to me privately; they just can't applaud it publicly. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Yeah, right. <p>So, too often, where we get stuck is how to pay for these investments. Because these things cost money. Roads don't build themselves. Power grids and sewer lines and basic research and&mdash;those things don't pay for themselves. <p>And as Americans, we don't mind paying our fair share of taxes, as long as everybody else does too. The problem we've got is, we've got lobbyists that have rigged the Tax Code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others are paying full freight. We've got the super-rich getting giveaways they don't need and then middle class folks not getting the breaks that they do need for things like childcare. <p>So what I told Congress is, let's just close those loopholes. Let's stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad; reward companies that are creating jobs right here in the United States. Let's close loopholes that let the top 1 percent or .01 percent avoid paying certain taxes&mdash;use that money to help more Americans pay for college and childcare. Let's have a Tax Code that truly helps working Americans get a leg up in this new economy. It's a good investment that will ultimately be good for everybody. <p>So that's what I believe in: helping hard-working families make ends meet, giving everybody the tools they need to find good-paying jobs in the new economy, keeping our economy strong and competitive, making sure we've got a Tax Code that is fair so that we can get all these things done and grow the economy well into the future. That's where I think America needs to go. And that's where I believe Americans want to go. It's going to make our economy stronger not just a year from now or 10 years from now, but deep into the century ahead. <p>And I understand Republicans who disagree with my approach. So what I've said to them is, fine, show me your ideas to pay for things like R&D and infrastructure. Explain to me how you want to help families pay for college and for childcare. <p>It's perfectly fair for them to say, we've got a better way for meeting these national priorities, and then to specify what those ideas are. What you can't do is simply pretend that issues like childcare or student debt aren't out there, that they're not important. You can't pretend that there's nothing we can do to help middle class families get ahead, because I've seen how we've been able to help middle class families get ahead when we make an effort. <p>The answer can't just be no to everything. I don't mind hearing no to some things, but it can't be no to everything. At some point, you've got to say yes to something. I want to get to yes! Tell me what you want to do. Let's get to yes on helping more families get by. I want to get to yes on childcare. I want to get to yes on more young people going to college and not being loaded up with debt. That's what I want to get to. <p>I want to get to yes for folks like Steve Ozark, from right here in Lawrence. Where is Steve? I know I saw him. He was around here. There, that's&mdash;you're not Steve. [<i>Laughter</i>] There he is right there. <p>So last year, Steve wrote me a letter about his vision for this country: a place where every American, he said, has \\"a place at the table.\\" And 25 years ago, Steve and his girlfriend, now his wife, were living paycheck to paycheck, with a baby on the way. And for a while, they turned to food stamps to get by. And then, they took out students loans so that his wife could go to college and get a job and climb the ladder of success. And today, they spend their time helping others in their community find a place at the table, because, as Steve wrote in this letter, it's \\"what God and Grandma taught us to do.\\" God and Grandma, those&mdash;now, that's some good authority right there. <p>The point is, is that we're going to disagree on politics sometimes, but we don't have to be so viciously divided as a people. We all know what God and Grandma taught us to do. [<i>Laughter</i>] Whoever we are&mdash;Republican, Democrat, male, female, young, old, Black, White, gay, straight&mdash;we all share a common vision for our future. We want a better country for your generation and for your kids' generation, a place where, as Steve wrote, everybody has \\"a place at the table.\\" I want that country to be one that shows the world what I know is still to be true, that we are still not a collection of just red States and blue States, we are still the United States of America. <p>So we've made it through some hard times, but we've laid a new foundation, Jayhawks. We've got a new future to write. The young people here are going to write a new future for America. Let's get started right now. Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"18" "\"Thank you! Hey! Good to see you, mayors. Good to see you. All right, everybody, have a seat, have a seat. I would have thought that would bring back bad memories for Kevin, playing that song. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to thank Kevin for that introduction. I have to say that that introduction is longer than my remarks and more exciting. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I'm feeling a little outshone here by Kevin. But as everybody knows, Kevin has that flair about him; he did when he was a professional basketball player. He, not surprisingly, has brought that flair to his outstanding work in Sacramento, and we're very, very proud of him. So I just want to thank him for his outstanding leadership, as well as the introduction. Give Kevin a big round of applause. <p>I want to thank Stephanie Rawlings-Blake of Baltimore and Mayor Mick Cornett of Oklahoma City for their leadership as well. We are very proud of them. And I want to just thank all of you. <p>We've got&mdash;is that playing again, Kevin? [<i>Laughter</i>] We've got over 200 mayors here, representing tens of millions of Americans. And I think as you've seen today, we take our partnership with you seriously because you're often the place where change happens fastest. That's one of the reasons why I named&mdash;two of my Cabinet members happen to be former mayors; a former president of this conference, Jerry Abramson of Louisville, is one of my top advisers. <p>The other night, I talked about what we can do together to make sure that middle class economics helps more Americans get ahead in the new economy. And that's something we want to partner with you on as well. And in some areas&mdash;in fact, many areas&mdash;we already have. <p>Last year, we kicked off the Mayors' Maker Challenge to support local entrepreneurs working to create the industries and jobs of the future. And Mayor Greg Fischer of Louisville stepped up. Now students and engineers are creating smarter appliances at a community space in town, and hundreds of folks are getting trained for local software development jobs. <p>We've worked with some of you to raise the minimum wage without waiting for Congress. And more than 20 cities and counties have stepped up to raise the wage since 2013. Some have passed sick leave laws as well, and I want to help more of you do that. We launched the Mayors' Challenge To End Veterans Homelessness. And Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans stepped up. Just a few weeks ago, New Orleans became the first major city to wipe out homelessness among veterans, and we could not be prouder of them. Thank you. And Mayor Greg Stanton in Phoenix, Mayor Ralph Becker in Salt Lake City are closing in on that goal as well. <p>We issued a \\"My Brother's Keeper\\" Community Challenge to create more pathways of success for boys and young men of color, and all young people, and over 150 local and tribal leaders have stepped up. So in Birmingham, Mayor William Bell and business leaders have created a mentoring program. In New Haven, Mayor Toni Harp is canvassing neighborhoods along with police, teachers, and firefighters to connect kids with services and support. So that's what mayors do. They get things done. They make things happen. And on other urgent issues, like responding to climate change or getting more families insured, rebuilding infrastructure, making sure that our youngest Americans get the best start in life with quality pre-K, mayors like you are helping to get it done. And we want to help. <p>So I had a chance to meet some folks earlier before I came out here, and I just emphasized to them what I always do whenever I'm at a Mayors Conference, and that is to emphasize that we are here in large part to make sure that you are able to achieve your goals. Because if cities are successful, then America is going to be successful. That's not disrespect towards suburbs, that's not disrespect towards rural communities. The truth is, in every State of our Union, the city and its health becomes a bellwether for how well the State as a whole is doing. And that's true around the world as well. <p>What we know now is that successful cities and metropolitan areas end up being the engines by which communities and States and ultimately nations succeed. And what I also say whenever I meet with mayors is that I have confidence in you because the fact is that you can't afford to be ideological. I don't care whether you're Republican, Democratic, or Independent, the truth of the matter is, folks want to make sure that their garbage is picked up, that their roads are functioning properly and traffic isn't sucking away their days. They want to make sure that their schools are high quality, and they want to make sure that their streets are free from crime. <p>And so you don't have the luxury of just yacking instead of doing. [<i>Laughter</i>] Because at some point, people are going to ask, what are you getting done? And that, in this town, is always refreshing&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and I think presents enormous opportunities, which is part of the reason why our Cabinet members are always so excited to present to you what they're doing and to find out what's working for you. <p>Because my instructions to my Cabinet over these last 2 years is that we want to squeeze every possible opportunity to do some good from this fourth quarter. And a lot of stuff happens in the fourth quarter. [<i>Laughter</i>] And one of the most promising avenues for us is to partner with you and help you do some of the terrific things you're already doing and help you with visions of things that you want to do in the future. <p>And I can guarantee you that we will not only partner with you aggressively, but we're also going to be creative and show flexibility. And if you have ideas that don't neatly fit into what's already being done, we're going to try to come up with answers to make sure that you can succeed. <p>All right? So thank you all for being here. Thank you for the great work that you are doing. With that, I'm going to take a couple of questions, but I think we're going to ask our fourth estate just to step out 1 second so we can let our hair down, as they say. [<i>Laughter</i>]\" "
"19" "\"Hi, everybody. This week, in my State of the Union Address, I talked about what we can do to make sure middle class economics helps more Americans get ahead in the new economy. <p>See, after some tough years, and thanks to some tough decisions we made, our economy is creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. Our deficits are shrinking. Our energy production is booming. Our troops are coming home. Thanks to the hard work and resilience of Americans like you, we've risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth. <p>Now we have to choose what we want that future to look like. Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and rising chances for everyone who makes the effort? <p>I believe the choice is clear. Today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives. Wages are finally starting to rise again. Let's keep that going. Let's do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American. That's what middle class economics is: the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. <p>Middle class economics means helping workers feel more secure in a world of constant change, making it easier to afford childcare, college, paid leave, health care, a home, and retirement. Middle class economics means doing more to help Americans upgrade their skills through opportunities like apprenticeships and 2 years of free community college so we can keep earning higher wages down the road. Middle class economics means building the most competitive economy in the world by building the best infrastructure, opening new markets so we can sell our products around the world and investing in research so that businesses keep creating good jobs right here. <p>And we can afford to do these things by closing loopholes in our Tax Code that stack the decks for special interests and the super-rich and against responsible companies and the middle class. <p>This is where we have to go if we're going to succeed in the new economy. I know that there are Republicans in Congress who disagree with my approach, and I look forward to hearing their ideas for how we can pay for what the middle class needs to grow. But what we can't do is simply pretend that things like childcare or college aren't important or pretend there's nothing we can do to help middle class families get ahead. <p>Because we've got work to do. As a country, we have made it through some hard times. But we've laid a new foundation. We've got a new future to write. And I'm eager to get to work. <p>Thanks everybody, and have a great weekend.\" "
"20" "\"Good evening, President Mukherjee, Prime Minister Modi, distinguished guests. On behalf of Michelle and myself, I want to extend our deepest thanks for the extraordinary hospitality that you've shown us here today. We feel your friendship, your <i>dosti.</i> And I am deeply honored to be the first American President to join you in celebrating India's Republic Day. <p>I also want to thank you for not making me dance again. [<i>Laughter</i>] The last time we were here, we joined some children in Mumbai for Diwali, and we danced. It was pretty clear what the Indian press thought. One headline said, \\"President Obama Visits India.\\" The other said, \\"Michelle Obama Rocks India.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] It is true, Michelle is a better dancer than me. <p>Let me also thank my partner and friend, Prime Minister Modi. I've often said that my life story could only happen in America. But of course, Mr. Prime Minister, your story could only happen in India. Here this evening, we think back to all those years ago, to your father selling tea in the train station and your mother working at other families' homes to support her own. And tonight their son welcomes us as the Prime Minister of the world's largest democracy. <p>Now, we all know about the Prime Minister's legendary work ethic. He was explaining to me today how he only needed 3 hours' sleep, which made me feel bad. I thought, I was doing okay with 5. [<i>Laughter</i>] What I didn't know until now is that he once survived an attack by a crocodile. So he's tough. And he also has style. One of our newspapers back home wrote: \\"Move aside, Michelle Obama. The world has a new fashion icon.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Tonight I was thinking about wearing a Modi kurta myself. And while I do not want to use a dinner like this to make United States policy, let me just say that given the Prime Minister's advocacy at the United Nations, Michelle and I are looking forward to the first International Yoga Day. <p>Our visit reflects the deepest connections and long friendship between our peoples. One of America's greatest poets was Walt Whitman, and more than a century ago he wrote a poem, \\"Passage to India,\\" in which he celebrated the technological ingenuity and human spirit that joins our nations. He wrote,\\"Seest thou not God's purpose from the first? The earth to be spann'd, connected by network, the people to become brothers and sisters.\\" Here, in our time, these words have come to pass. <p>India and America have spanned the Earth, connected and networked by technology and by family, including millions of Indian Americans, among them our Nation's first Indian American Ambassador to India, Rich Verma. And in the shared work of our world, our purpose&mdash;lifting up our fellow citizens, advancing human dignity&mdash;we, as the poet predicted, have become brothers and sisters. <p>Tomorrow we will celebrate Republic Day. We will honor the generations of Indians who built this nation through toil and tears and iron will. And at the end of the day, I'm told the band will play that hymn that was dear to the heart of Mahatma Gandhi: <p>Abide with me; fast falls the eventide; <p>The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide. <p>When other helpers fail and comforts flee, Help of the helpless, O abide with me. <p>And so I propose a toast, if I can get a glass&mdash;ah, here we go. To the great partnership between our nations and the friendship&mdash;the <i>dosti</i>&mdash;between our peoples. Here in the eventide, Indians and Americans, let us know, in the darkness or day, in good times or bad, whenever one of us looks to the other, we will surely say, abide with me. <p>Cheers! <p>[<i>At this point, President Obama offered a toast.</i>]\" "
"21" "\"Good evening. Thank you so much, Madam Minister, for not only the introduction, but for the work that you're doing every day to bring our two countries closer together. Thank you all for the very warm welcome. I was proud to speak to the U.S.-India Business Council in Mumbai on my last visit to India. And it's good to be with you again. I thank you, CII, FICCI, and the Government of India for hosting us. <p>Now, I'm pleased to be joined on this visit by leaders from my administration who are dedicated to expanding the trade and investment between our two countries, and I just want to mention them briefly: Our Secretary of Commerce, Penny Pritzker; the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, Raj Shah; the President and CEO of our Overseas Private Investment Corporation, Elizabeth Littlefield; and the Director of the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, Lee Zak. <p>Prime Minister Modi, I want to thank you again, both for your invitation to join you on this incredible Republic Day and the wonderful hospitality that you've shown me over the past 2 days. Today's ceremonies and parade were truly spectacular. It was a moving tribute to India's founding, its democracy, its progress. After all those hours in the reviewing stand together, I figured that the President&mdash;the Prime Minister might be tired of me by now. But what's another speech between friends? [<i>Laughter</i>] I will not, by the way, ride a motorcycle today&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;after watching those incredible acrobats. <p>As I said yesterday, even as this visit is rich with symbolism, it's also a visit of great substance. We're advancing the vision that I laid out on my last visit: India and the United States as true global partners. And a core element of this vision is greater trade, investment, and economic partnership. Our two business communities&mdash;all of you&mdash;have some&mdash;have been some of the strongest champions for a closer relationship, and I want to thank you for your commitment. You understand better than anybody that in our globalized world, the fortunes of the United States and the fortunes of India are inextricably linked. We can grow and we can prosper together and establish a set of global norms in terms of how business is done that will benefit not just our two countries, but people around the world. And when I spoke to you on my last visit, I pledged to broaden and deepen our economic ties, and that's what we've done. <p>In the last few years, we've increased trade between our countries by some 60 percent. Today, it's nearly a hundred billion dollars a year, which is a record high. And this is a win-win. It's a win for America and our workers because U.S. exports to India are up nearly 35 percent, and those exports support about 170,000 well-paying American jobs. At the same time, Indian investment in our country is growing as well. And those Indian investments are supporting jobs across America. We've got high-tech jobs in Upstate New York, manufacturing jobs in North Carolina, engineering jobs in places like Michigan and Ohio. <p>And our growing trade is a win for India, because increased U.S. exports and investment here mean more American-made planes flying passengers on India's airlines all over the world, more American-made turbines generating the energy India needs to continue with its growth, more American-made machinery upgrading India's infrastructure. And because we've made it easier for foreign companies to sell and invest in America, India's exports to the United States are also increasing, and that means more jobs and opportunities here in India. In the end, that's the purpose of trade and investment: to deliver a better life for our people. And both Indian and American workers are and can benefit even more in the future from close ties between our two countries. <p>So we're moving in the right direction. I want to thank everybody here for the progress that we've achieved together. Now, that said, we all know that the U.S.-India economic relationship is also defined by so much untapped potential. Of all America's imports from the world, about 2 percent come from India. Of all of America's exports to the world, just over 1 percent go to India&mdash;1 percent to over a billion people. We do about a hundred billion dollars a year in trade with India, which is a great improvement since I took office. But we do about $560 billion a year with China. And that gives you some sense of the potential both for the kind of growth that India might unleash and the potential for greater trade between our two countries. So I think everybody here will agree, we've got to do better. I know Prime Minister Modi agrees, and he just shared his expansive vision on this issue with you. <p>As we announced yesterday, we've taken a number of concrete steps forward on this visit. New breakthroughs will help us overcome some key issues and move us toward fully implementing our civil nuclear agreement. We've taken another big step forward in our defense cooperation with a new technology and trade initiative so that Indian and American companies can jointly develop and produce new defense technologies. We've agreed to resume discussions that would move us toward a bilateral investment treaty that would facilitate Indian businesses making more investments in the United States and U.S. businesses making more investments here in India. <p>And we've agreed to step up our efforts with a new high-level U.S.-India Strategic and Commercial Dialogue to make sure we're taking concrete steps that build on our progress so that when two leaders share a vision and make agreements, we know that our agencies, our bureaucracies will follow through aggressively and we can hold them accountable. And President Modi&mdash;Prime Minister Modi, I want to thank you for your personal commitment to helping us advance all of these efforts. <p>Today I'm proud to announce additional steps: a series of U.S. initiatives that will generate more than $4 billion in trade and investment with India and support thousands of jobs in both of our countries. Specifically, over the next 2 years, our Export-Import Bank will commit up to $1 billion in financing to support \\"Made in America\\" exports to India. And OPIC will support lending to small and medium businesses across India that we anticipate will ultimately result in more than $1 billion in loans in underserved rural and urban markets. And our U.S. Trade and Development Agency will aim to leverage nearly $2 billion in investments in renewable energy in India. <p>So we're moving forward. There's new momentum, there's new energy, new hope that we can finally begin to realize the full potential of our economic relationship. And I want to close by suggesting several specific areas where we need to focus. <p>First, we have to keep working to make it easier to do business together in both our countries. For the past 2 years, business leaders like you have voted America as the best place in the world to invest. I'm pretty happy about that. [<i>Laughter</i>] And we're going to keep working through what we've called SelectUSA, an initiative to cut redtape, streamline regulations so that even more companies like yours&mdash;from India and around the world&mdash;come and set up shop in America. Now, here in India, as the Prime Minister just discussed, there are still too many barriers&mdash;hoops to jump through, bureaucratic restrictions&mdash;that make it hard to start a business or to export, to import, to close a deal, deliver on a deal. We hear this consistently from business leaders like you. And right before coming out here, the Prime Minister and I joined some of you in a roundtable where you described some of the challenges that you face. <p>Prime Minister Modi has initiated reforms that will help overcome some of these barriers, including a new government committee dedicated to fast-tracking American investment. And we enthusiastically support these efforts. We need to be incentivizing trade and investment, not stifling it. We need to be fostering a business environment that's more transparent and more consistent and more predictable. In knowledge-based economies, entrepreneurs and innovators need to feel confident that their hard work and, in particular, their intellectual property will be protected. <p>Second, we can work together to develop new technologies that help India leap forward. And I know I speak for the American companies represented here when they say they're ready to partner with Indian firms to build next-generation trains that run on cleaner energy and that&mdash;and to lay the new railways India needs for the future. They're ready to help upgrade roads and ports and airports to make it easier for Indians to connect with each other and with the world. They're ready to install broadband connections to give communities reliable access to the Internet and to help build the smart cities that Prime Minister Modi has called for. And on this visit, we've paved the way to mobilize American expertise and investment in three of these cities. And we'll send two trade missions to India this year focused specifically on upgrading India's infrastructure. <p>And finally&mdash;and I know this is something that is of great concern to Prime Minister Modi and it's of great concern to me and the United States&mdash;we need to make sure that economic growth in both our countries is inclusive and sustained. India's astonishing growth in recent decades has lifted countless millions out of poverty and created one of the world's largest middle classes. There's an important lesson in that. Growth cannot just be measured by the aggregate. It can't just be measured by GDP. It can't just be measured by the bottom line on a balance sheet. Growth, in the end, has to make people's lives better in real, tangible, and lasting ways. <p>Prime Minister Modi has laid out an ambitious vision for the future that lifts up India and its people. And I know that the Prime Minister has even taken to sweeping the street himself and that CEOs are following his lead. We might have to try that in the United States. [<i>Laughter</i>] The United States is ready to work with you to help every home and business in India have reliable access to electricity so more families can share in India's progress. <p>And as we announced yesterday, we want to support India's goal of expanding solar energy, help improve air quality in India's cities, and expand access to clean water. There's good business sense, by the way, in being environmentally sound. And one of the great potentials for India and one of the necessities for the world is that we find ways to lift people out of poverty and provide them power in ways that are sustainable and allow you to leapfrog over some of the dirty development strategies of the past directly into the clean strategies of the future. <p>As you work to give every Indian household a bank account, American companies are ready to help to make sure these accounts can help Indians in their day-to-day lives, by digitalizing retail transactions. As we grow, we have to do it responsibly and stay true to our values and uphold basic standards and rule of law. We have to keep striving to protect the rights of our workers, to make sure that our supply chains are sourced responsibly. <p>Today I'm also proud to announce a new public-private partnership to help millions of proud Indian Americans directly invest in India's future. Our new Indian Diaspora Investment Initiative will allow folks back home to generate a new stream of financing for Indian businesses that are investing in nontraditional&mdash;and too often overlooked&mdash;markets, whether it's providing health care to rural communities or improving water and sanitation, to opening up some of those new bank accounts. <p>And this can be another spark in India's economic engine. I know from talking with so many Indian Americans that they are very excited about this opportunity. They're ready to do even more to help unleash India's success. And it's just one more example of how much we can achieve, how much more good we can do if we keep working together, as governments and as business and as citizens. <p>Let's make it possible for a young woman in a rural village to start a business with a partner in America that will change both their lives. Let's encourage young scientists at American universities to collaborate with partners in India to develop new technologies that will reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and protect our planet. Let's make it easier for Indians and Americans to work together across the board&mdash;to buy from one another, to invest in one another, to create with one another&mdash;and in doing so, lift the fortunes of all of us. That's the future I believe in for our countries. And that's the future I know we can achieve, if we're willing to work for it together. <p>I know the Prime Minister has expressed his commitment. You have the commitment of the President of the United States and my administration. I'm looking forward to working with all of you. The next time I come to India, I expect we will have made more progress. All right? <p>Thank you very much.\" "
"22" "\"<i>Namaste!</i> Thank you so much. Thank you so much, Neha, for&mdash;what a wonderful introduction. Everybody, please have a seat. Nothing fills me with more hope than when I hear incredible young people like Neha and all the outstanding work that she's doing on behalf of India's youth and for representing this nation's energy and its optimism and its idealism. She makes me very, very proud. And I'm sure&mdash;I think that may be her&mdash;is that somebody related to you? Okay. Because I&mdash;we just had a chance to meet, and she's beaming with pride right now sitting next to you. Give Neha a big round of applause once again. <p>Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, to all the students and young people who are here today, to the people of India watching and listening across this vast nation, I bring the friendship and the greetings of the American people. On behalf of myself and Michelle, thank you so much for welcoming us back to India. <i>Bahoot dhanyavad.</i> <p>It has been a great honor to be the first American President to join you for Republic Day. With the tricolor waving above us, we celebrated the strength of your Constitution. We paid tribute to India's fallen heroes. In yesterday's parade, we saw the pride and the diversity of this nation, including the Dare Devils on their Royal Enfields, which was very impressive. Secret Service does not let me ride motorcycles. [<i>Laughter</i>] Especially not on my head. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I realize that the sight of an American President as your chief guest on Republic Day would have once seemed unimaginable. But my visit reflects the possibilities of a new moment. As I've said many times, I believe that the relationship between India and the United States can be one of the defining partnerships of the century. When I spoke to your Parliament on my last visit, I laid out my vision for how our two nations can build that partnership. And today I want to speak directly to you, the people of India, about what I believe we can achieve together and how we can do it. <p>My commitment to a new chapter between our countries flows from the deep friendship between our people. And Michelle and I have felt it ourselves. I recognized India with the first state visit of my Presidency, where we also danced to some pretty good Bhangra. [<i>Laughter</i>] For the first time, we brought Diwali to the White House. On our last celebration here, we celebrated the Festival of Lights in Mumbai. We danced with some children. Unfortunately, we were not able to schedule any dancing this visit. <i>Senorita, bade-bade deshon mein</i>. You know what I mean. So&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. Everybody said, by the way, how much better a dancer Michelle was than me&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;which hurt my feelings a little bit. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>On a more personal level, India represents an intersection of two men who have always inspired me. When Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was protesting racial segregation in the United States, he said that his guiding light was Mahatma Gandhi. When Dr. King came to India, he said that being here, in \\"Gandhi's land,\\" reaffirmed his conviction that in the struggle for justice and human dignity, the most potent weapon of all is nonviolent resistance. And those two great souls are why we can gather here together today, Indians and Americans, equal and free. <p>And there is another link that binds us. More than a hundred years ago, America welcomed a son of India, Swami Vivekananda. And Swami Vivekananda, he helped bring Hinduism and yoga to our country. And he came to my hometown of Chicago. And there, at a great gathering of religious leaders, he spoke of his faith and the divinity in every soul and the purity of love. And he began his speech with a simple greeting: \\"Sisters and brothers of America.\\" <p>So today let me say: Sisters and brothers of India, my confidence in what our nations can achieve together is rooted in the values we share. For we may have our different histories and speak different languages, but when we look at each other, we see a reflection of ourselves. <p>Having thrown off colonialism, we created constitutions that began with the three same words: \\"We the people.\\" As societies that celebrate knowledge and innovation, we transformed ourselves into high-tech hubs of the global economy. Together, we unlock new discoveries, from the particles of creation to outer space, and we are among the few nations to have gone to both the Moon and to Mars. And here in India, this dynamism has resulted in a stunning achievement. You've lifted countless millions from poverty and built one of the world's largest middle classes. <p>And nobody embodies this progress and this sense of possibility more than our young people. Empowered by technology, you are connecting and collaborating like never before: on Facebook and WhatsApp and Twitter. And chances are, you're talking to someone in America, your friends or your cousins. The United States has the largest Indian diaspora in the world, including some 3 million proud Indian Americans. And they make America stronger, and they tie us together, bonds of family and friendship that allow us to share in each other's success. <p>So for all these reasons, India and the United States are not just natural partners. I believe America can be India's best partner. I believe that. Of course, only Indians can decide India's role in the world. But I'm here because I'm absolutely convinced that both our peoples will have more jobs and opportunity and our nations will be more secure and the world will be safer and a more just place when our two democracies&mdash;the world's largest democracy and the world's oldest democracy&mdash;stand together. I believe that. <p>So here in New Delhi, Prime Minister Modi and I have begun this work anew. And here's what I think we can do together. America wants to be your partner as you lift up the lives of the Indian people and provide greater opportunity. So working together, we're giving farmers new techniques and data&mdash;from our satellites to their cell phones&mdash;to increase yields and boost incomes. We're joining you in your effort to empower every Indian with a bank account. <p>And with the breakthroughs we achieved on this visit, we can finally move toward fully implementing our civil nuclear agreement, which will mean more reliable electricity for Indians and cleaner, noncarbon energy that helps fight climate change. And I don't have to describe for you what more electricity means: students being able to study at night, businesses being able to stay open longer and hire more workers, farmers being able to use mechanized tools that increase their productivity, whole communities seeing more prosperity. In recent years, India has lifted more people out of poverty than any other country. And now we have a historic opportunity, with India leading the way to end the injustice of extreme poverty all around the world. <p>America wants to be your partner as you protect the health of your people and the beauty of this land, from the backwaters of Kerala to the banks of Ganges. As we deliver more energy, more electricity, let's do it with clean, renewable energy, like solar and wind. And let's put cleaner vehicles on the road and more filtration systems on farms and villages. Because every child should be able to drink clean water, and every child should be able to breathe clean air. We need our young people healthy for their futures. And we can do it. We have the technology to do it. <p>America wants to be your partner in igniting the next wave of Indian growth. As India pursues more trade and investment, we want to be first in line. We're ready to join you in building new infrastructure: the roads and the airports, the ports, the bullet trains to propel India into the future. We're ready to help design smart cities that serve citizens better, and we want to develop more advanced technologies with India, as we do with our closest allies. <p>We believe we can be even closer partners in ensuring our mutual security. And both our nations have known the anguish of terrorism, and we stand united in the defense of our people. And now we're deepening our defense cooperation against new challenges. The United States welcomes a greater role for India in the Asia-Pacific, where the freedom of navigation must be upheld and disputes must be resolved peacefully. And even as we acknowledge the world as it is, we must never stop working for the world as it should be: a world without nuclear weapons. That should be a goal for all of us. <p>I believe that if we're going to be true global partners, then our two nations must do more around the world together. So to ensure international security and peace, multilateral institutions created in the 20th century have to be updated for the 21st. And that's why I support a reformed United Nations Security Council that includes India as a permanent member. <p>Of course, as I've said before, with power comes responsibility. In this region, India can play a positive role in helping countries forge a better future, from Burma to Sri Lanka, where today, there's new hope for democracy. With your experience in elections, you can help other countries with theirs. With your expertise in science and medicine, India can do more around the world to fight disease and develop new vaccines and help us end the moral outrage of even a single child dying from a preventable disease. Together, we can stand up against human trafficking and work to end the scourge of modern day slavery. <p>And being global partners means confronting the urgent global challenge of climate change. With rising seas, melting Himalayan glaciers, more unpredictable monsoons, cyclones getting stronger, few countries will be more affected by a warmer planet than India. Now, the United States recognizes our part in creating this problem, so we're leading the global effort to combat it. And today I can say that America's carbon pollution is near its lowest level in almost two decades. <p>I know the argument made by some that it's unfair for countries like the United States to ask developing nations and emerging economies like India to reduce your dependence on the same fossil fuels that helped power our growth for more than a century. But here's the truth: Even if countries like the United States curb our emissions, if countries that are growing rapidly like India&mdash;with soaring energy needs&mdash;don't also embrace cleaner fuels, then we don't stand a chance against climate change. <p>So we welcome India's ambitious targets for generating more clean energy. We'll continue to help India deal with the impacts of climate change, because you shouldn't have to bear that burden alone. And as we keep working for a strong global agreement on climate change, it's young people like you who have to speak up so we can protect this planet for your generation. I'll be gone when the worst effects happen. It's your generation and your children that are going to be impacted. And that's why it's urgent that we begin this work right now. Development that lifts up the lives and health of our people, trade and economic partnerships that reduce poverty and create opportunity, leadership in the world that defends our security and advances human dignity and protects our planet&mdash;that's what I believe India and America can do together. So with the rest of my time, I want to discuss how we can do it. Because in big and diverse societies like ours, progress ultimately depends on something more basic, and that is, how we see each other. And we know from experience what makes nations strong. And Neha, I think, did a great job of describing the essence of what's important here. <p>We are strongest when we see the inherent dignity in every human being. Look at our countries, the incredible diversity even here in this hall. India is defined by countless languages and dialects and every color and caste and creed, gender and orientations. And likewise, in America, we're Black and White and Latino and Asian and Indian American and Native American. Your Constitution begins with the pledge to uphold \\"the dignity of the individual.\\" And our Declaration of Independence proclaims that \\"all men are created equal.\\" <p>In both our countries, generations have worked to live up to these ideals. When he came to India, Martin Luther King, Jr., was introduced to some schoolchildren as a \\"fellow untouchable.\\" My grandfather was a cook for the British Army in Kenya. The distant branches of Michelle's family tree include both slaves and slave owners. When we were born, people who looked like us still couldn't vote in some parts of the country. Even as America has blessed us with extraordinary opportunities, there were moments in my life where I've been treated differently because of the color of my skin. <p>Many countries, including the United States, grapple with questions of identity and inequality and how we treat each other, people who are different than us, how we deal with diversity of beliefs and of faiths. And right now, in crowded neighborhoods not far from here, a man is driving an autorickshaw or washing somebody else's clothes or doing the hard work no one else will do. And a woman is cleaning somebody else's house. And a young man is on a bicycle delivering lunch. A little girl is hauling a heavy bucket of water. And I believe their dreams, their hopes, are just as important, just as beautiful, just as worthy as ours. And so even as we live in a world of terrible inequality, we're also proud to live in countries where even the grandson of a cook can become President, or even a Dalit can help write a constitution, and even a tea seller can become Prime Minister. <p>The point is, is that the aim of our work must be not to just have a few do well, but to have everybody have a chance, everybody who is willing to work for it have the ability to dream big and then reach those dreams. <p>Our nations are strongest when we uphold the equality of all our people, and that includes our women. Now, you may have noticed, I am married to a very strong and talented woman. Michelle is not afraid to speak her mind or tell me when I'm wrong, which happens frequently. [<i>Laughter</i>] And we have two beautiful daughters, so I'm surrounded by smart, strong women. And in raising our girls, we've tried to instill in them basic values: a sense of compassion for others and respect for themselves and the confidence that they can go as far as their imaginations and abilities will carry them. And as part of Michelle's work as First Lady, she's met with women and girls around the world, including here in India, to let them know that America believes in them too. <p>In the United States, we're still working to make sure that women and girls have all the opportunities they deserve and that they're treated equally. And we have some great role models, including here today the former Speaker of our House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, who was the first woman Speaker of the House, and my great partner. And here in India, it's the wives and the mothers who so often hold families and communities together. Indian women have shown that they can succeed in every field, including government, where many of your leaders are women. And the young women who are here today are part of a new generation that is making your voice heard and standing up and determined to play your part in India's progress. <p>And here's what we know. We know from experience that nations are more successful when their women are successful. When girls go to school&mdash;no, this is one of the most direct measures of whether a nation is going to develop effectively is how it treats its women. When a girl goes to school, it doesn't just open up her young mind, it benefits all of us, because maybe someday, she'll start her own business or invent a new technology or cure a disease. And when women are able to work, families are healthier and communities are wealthier and entire countries are more prosperous. And when young women are educated, then their children are going to be well educated and have more opportunity. <p>So if nations really want to succeed in today's global economy, they can't simply ignore the talents of half their people. And as husbands and fathers and brothers, we have to step up, because every girl's life matters. Every daughter deserves the same chance as our sons. Every woman should be able to go about her day&mdash;to walk the streets or ride the bus&mdash;and be safe and be treated with respect and dignity. She deserves that. <p>And one of the favorite things about this trip for me has been to see all these incredible Indian women in the Armed Forces, including the person who commanded the Guard that greeted me when I arrived. It's remarkable, and it's a sign of great strength and great progress. <p>Our nations are strongest when we see that we are all God's children, all equal in His eyes and worthy of His love. Across our two great countries we have Hindus and Muslims, Christians and Sikhs and Jews and Buddhists and Jains and so many faiths. And we remember the wisdom of Gandhiji, who said, \\"For me, the different religions are beautiful flowers from the same garden, or they are branches of the same majestic tree.\\" Branches of the same majestic tree. <p>Our freedom of religion is written into our founding documents. It's part of America's very First Amendment. Your article 25 says that all people are \\"equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practice and propagate religion.\\" In both our countries&mdash;in all countries&mdash;upholding this fundamental freedom is the responsibility of government, but it's also the responsibility of every person. <p>In our lives, Michelle and I have been strengthened by our Christian faith. But there have been times where my faith has been questioned&mdash;by people who don't know me&mdash;or they've said that I adhere to a different religion, as if that were somehow a bad thing. Around the world, we've seen intolerance and violence and terror perpetrated by those who profess to be standing up for their faith, but in fact, are betraying it. No society is immune from the darkest impulses of man. And too often, religion has been used to tap into those darker impulses as opposed to the light of God. Three years ago, in our State of Wisconsin back in the United States, a man went to a Sikh temple and, in a terrible act of violence, killed six innocent people, Americans and Indians. And in that moment of shared grief, our two countries reaffirmed a basic truth, as we must again today, that every person has the right to practice their faith how they choose or to practice no faith at all and to do so free of persecution and fear and discrimination. The peace we seek in the world begins in human hearts. And it finds its glorious expression when we look beyond any differences in religion or tribe and rejoice in the beauty of every soul. And nowhere is that more important than India. Nowhere is it going to be more necessary for that foundational value to be upheld. India will succeed so long as it is not splintered along the lines of religious faith&mdash;so long it's not splintered along any lines&mdash;and is unified as one nation. <p>And it's when all Indians, whatever your faith, go to the movies and applaud actors like Shah Rukh Khan. And when you celebrate athletes like Milkha Singh or Mary Kom. And every Indian can take pride in the courage of a humanitarian who liberates boys and girls from forced labor and exploitation&mdash;who is here today&mdash;Kailash Satyarthi, our most recent winner of the Nobel Prize for Peace. <p>So that's what unifies us: Do we act with compassion and empathy? Are we measured by our efforts, by what Dr. King called \\"the content of our character,\\" rather than the color of our skin or the manner in which we worship our God? In both our countries, in India and in America, our diversity is our strength. And we have to guard against any efforts to divide ourselves along sectarian lines or any other lines. And if we do that well, if America shows itself as an example of its diversity and yet the capacity to live together and work together in common effort, in common purpose; if India, as massive as it is, with so much diversity, so many differences, is able to continually affirm its democracy, that is an example for every other country on Earth. That's what makes us world leaders: not just the size of our economy or the number of weapons we have or&mdash;but our ability to show the way in how we work together and how much respect we show each other. <p>And finally, our nations are strongest when we empower our young people. Because ultimately, you're the one who has to break down these old stereotypes and these old barriers, these old ways of thinking. Prejudices and stereotypes and assumptions&mdash;those are what happens to old minds like mine. I'm getting gray hair now. I was more youthful when I first started this office. [<i>Laughter</i>] And that's why young people are so important in these efforts. <p>Here in India, most people are under 35 years old. And India is on track to become the world's most populous country. So young Indians like you aren't just going to define the future of this nation, you're going to shape the world. Like young people everywhere, you want to get an education and find a good job and make your mark. And it's not easy, but in our two countries, it's possible. <p>Remember, Michelle and I don't come from wealthy backgrounds or famous families. Our families didn't have a lot of money. We did have parents and teachers and communities that cared about us. And with the help of scholarships and student loans, we were able to attend some of best schools of the world. Without that education, we wouldn't be here today. So whether it's in America or here in India or around the world, we believe young people like you ought to have every chance to pursue your dreams as well. <p>So as India builds new community colleges, we'll link you with our own so more young people graduate with the skills and training to succeed. We'll increase collaborations between our colleges and universities and help create the next Indian Institute of Technology. We'll encourage young entrepreneurs who want to start a business. And we'll increase exchanges, because I want more American students coming to India and more Indian students coming to America. And that way, we can learn from each other, and we can go further. Because one other thing we have in common: Indians and Americans are some of the hardest working people on Earth. And I've seen that&mdash;Michelle and I have seen that in a family here in India. I just want to tell you a quick story. On our last visit here, we visited Humayun's Tomb. And while we were there, we met some of the laborers who are the backbone of this nation's progress. We met their children and their families as well, and some wonderful young children with bright smiles, sparks in their eyes. And one of the children we met was a boy named Vishal. <p>And today, Vishal is 16 years old. And he and his family live in South Delhi, in the village of Mor Band. [<i>Applause</i>] This is Vishal. And his mother works hard in their modest home, and his sister is now in university; she wants to become a teacher. His brother is a construction worker earning his daily wage. And his father works as a stone layer, farther away, but sends home what little he makes so Vishal can go to school. And Vishal loves math, and mostly, he studies. And when he's not studying, he likes watching kabaddi. And he dreams of someday joining the Indian Armed Forces. And we're grateful that Vishal and his family joined us today. We're very proud of him, because he's an example of the talent that's here. And Vishal's dreams are as important as Malia and Sasha's dreams, our daughters. And we want him to have the same opportunities. <p>Sisters and brothers of India, we are not perfect countries. And we've known tragedy, and we've known triumph. We're home to glittering skyscrapers, but also terrible poverty; and new wealth, but also rising inequality. We have many challenges in front of us. But the reason I stand here today and am so optimistic about our future together is that, despite our imperfections, our two nations possess the keys to progress in the century ahead. We vote in free elections. We work and we build and we innovate. We lift up the least among us. We reach for heights previous generations could not even imagine. We respect human rights and human dignity, and it is recorded in our constitutions. And we keep striving to live up to those ideals put to paper all those years ago. <p>And we do these things because they make our lives better and safer and more prosperous. But we also do them because our moral imaginations extend beyond the limits of our own lives. And we believe that the circumstances of our birth need not dictate the arc of our lives. We believe in the father working far from home sending money back so his family might have a better life. We believe in the mother who goes without so that her children might have something more. We believe in the laborer earning his daily wage and the student pursuing her degree. And we believe in a young boy who knows that if he just keeps studying, if he's just given the chance, his hopes might be realized too. <p>We are all \\"beautiful flowers from the same garden . . . branches of the same majestic tree.\\" And I'm the first American President to come to your country twice, but I predict I will not be the last. Because, as Americans, we believe in the promise of India. We believe in the people of India. We are proud to be your friend. We are proud to be your partner as you build the country of your dreams. <p><i>Jai Hind!</i> Thank you. <i>Jai Hind!</i>\" "
"23" "\"Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Michelle and I, as some of you know, just spent the past few days in India. I returned about 3 o'clock this morning. So I don't know exactly what time it is&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;or what day it is. But I was determined to be here with you this afternoon to honor and celebrate a great friend: to me and to all of us. <p>In October of 1967, President Lyndon Johnson traveled to a military base in New Mexico to review a top-secret weapons program. And he went down to the White Sands Missile Range and out to the testing grounds. There, out in the desert, the President watched as soldiers demonstrated what would later become the famed Stinger missile. And one of those soldiers was a 21-year-old private from Nebraska named Charles Timothy Hagel. <p>Now, the Secret Service does not usually let me get too close to an active weapons system. It makes them nervous. But clearly, they did things a little differently back in LBJ's days. And, Chuck, I can only assume that you were careful not to point the missile at the President, because what followed was a life of dedicated service to our Nation spanning nearly 50 years. <p>With Vice President Biden, Members of Congress, General Dempsey, leaders from across this department, members of the Joint Chiefs, and service Secretaries; to the men and women of the greatest military in the world: We gather to pay tribute to a true American patriot. And let me assure you that I checked with the Secret Service, and Chuck will not be demonstrating any missile launchers today. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>As we all know, and we've heard again, Chuck loves Nebraska. The Cornhuskers. Red beer. Runzas&mdash;I don't know what those are, but I hear they taste pretty good. [<i>Laughter</i>] But above all, what Chuck loves most about his home State is the people, his fellow midwesterners. There are just under 2 million people in Nebraska; there are more than 7 billion people on the planet. But as so many of our troops have found out themselves, no matter where Chuck goes in the world, if you are from Nebraska, he will find you. [<i>Laughter</i>] And he'll talk with you and listen to you and ask you about your family back home. And chances are, he knows them too. <p>So today is a celebration of a quintessentially American life, a man from the heartland who devoted his life to America. Just imagine, in your mind's eye, the defining moments of his life. The kid from Nebraska who, as Marty said, volunteered to go to Vietnam. The soldier outside Saigon, rushing to pull his own brother from a burning APC. The deputy at the VA who stood up for his fellow Vietnam vets who were exposed to agent orange. The Senator who helped lead the fight for the post-9/11 GI bill, to give this generation of heroes the same opportunities that he had. <p>I asked Chuck to lead this Department at a moment of profound transition. And today we express our gratitude for the progress under his watch. After more than 13 years, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over, and America's longest war has come to a responsible and honorable end. Because of Chuck's direction, a strategic review has made difficult choices in a time of tight budgets, while still making sure that our forces are ready to be called on for any contingency. Today, our troops are supporting Afghan forces. They continue to face risks, and they remain relentless in their pursuit of Al Qaida networks. They're leading the coalition to destroy ISIL, a coalition that includes Arab nations, in no small measure because Chuck strengthened key partnerships in the Middle East. And under his leadership, our forces in West Africa are helping to lead the global fight against Ebola, saving lives and showing American leadership at its very, very best. <p>Even as we've met these pressing challenges, Chuck has helped us to prepare for the century ahead. In Europe, a stronger NATO is reassuring our allies. In the Asia-Pacific, one of my foreign policy priorities, Chuck helped modernize our alliances, strengthen partnerships, bolster defense posture, improve communications between the United States and Chinese militaries, all of which helps to ensure that the United States remains a strong Pacific power. <p>Because Chuck helped build new trust, we'll expand our defense cooperation with India. I just demonstrated during my visit there the degree to which that partnership is moving in a new direction. That's partly attributable to work that Chuck did. <p>And the reforms he launched will help make this Department more efficient and innovative for years to come. Thanks to Secretary Hagel's guiding hand, this institution is better positioned for the future. <p>But, Chuck, I want to suggest today that perhaps your greatest impact&mdash;a legacy that will be felt for decades to come&mdash;has been your own example. It's not simply that you've been the first enlisted combat veteran and the first Vietnam veteran to serve as Secretary of Defense. It's how your life experience&mdash;being down in the mud, feeling the bullets fly overhead&mdash;has allowed you to connect with our troops like no other Secretary before you. <p>You've welcomed our junior enlisted personnel to lunch in your office and made them feel at home, and they told you what was really on their minds. When you spoke to our newest sergeant majors about the true meaning of leadership and responsibility, they knew they were learning from one of their own. And in those quiet moments, when you've pinned a Purple Heart on a wounded warrior, you were there not just as Secretary of Defense, but as an old Army sergeant who knows the wages of war and still carries the shrapnel in your chest. <p>And these aren't fleeting moments, they reflect the driving force of Chuck Hagel's service: his love of our troops and his determination to take care of them after more than 13 years of war. Today, our military hospitals are getting stronger, our women are more integrated into the force than ever before. We're making progress in combating sexual assault. We'll bring home the remains of fallen heroes faster, and more Vietnam veterans will finally be eligible for the disability pay they deserved all along. And, Chuck, that's because of you. That's part of your legacy. <p>Of course, I'm grateful to Chuck on a very personal level. Exactly 10 years ago this month, I joined you in the United States Senate, along with the Vice President. I was new and green; you were a veteran legislator. I was the student, and you shared some of the lessons of your service. I was young, and you were&mdash;well. [<i>Laughter</i>] And though we came from different parties, we often saw the world the same way, including our conviction that even as we must never hesitate to defend our Nation, we must never rush into war. We both believed that America should only send her sons and daughters into harm's way when it is absolutely necessary. And when we do, we make sure they've got everything that they need to succeed; they've got a mission that is worthy of their sacrifice. In an era of politics that too often descends into spectacle, you've always served with decency and dignity. And in a town of outsized egos, you've never lost your midwestern humility. You've always been frank and honest and said what you thought. And I have so profoundly benefited from that candor. You represent a tradition of bipartisanship in national security that we need more of today. And Joe Biden reflects that. I see Dick Lugar in the stands; he reflects that. That's when we're at our best. And from sergeant to Secretary, you've always been guided by one interest: what you believe is best for America. And I thank you for your friendship and your counsel, and all of us thank you for your character and your integrity. <p>Of course, nobody serves alone. Lilibet, Allyn, Ziller, thank you for sharing your husband and father with us and for the sacrifices that your family has made for all of ours. And, Chuck, since our lives are so often the reflection of those closest to us, today I also want to acknowledge the service of your brother Tom; the World War II service of your father Charles; the sacrifices of your late mom Betty, who worked day and night to raise her four sons. We salute this American family. <p>Our men and women in uniform here today, those who stand where Chuck once stood, they don't ask for much. They volunteered; they accept the risks that come with military service. But they do ask this: that this Nation take care of them as well as they've taken care of us, that we provide them with the resources to do their jobs and meet the missions that we ask of them. After all that they've given for us, after all that they've sacrificed, they have the right to expect that we will meet our obligations as well. And that's my duty as Commander in Chief. And this will be the work of my nominee to be the next Secretary of Defense, Mr. Ash Carter. But this must be the work of us all, as Americans grateful to those who serve in our name. And that's the story of Chuck Hagel's life. <p>I'll close with a story that came about last year. I was going to tell the story about when we were traveling in Iraq, and Chuck wore these pair of sort of Hush Puppy bedroom slipper shoes out into the desert, and the flaps started opening up and his toes were sticking out. But I'm going to skip that story. [<i>Laughter</i>] He then ended up buying me a pair, which I have never worn, I'm proud to say. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>This is a different story. One day last year, I was in the Oval Office, and Chuck came in for what I thought would be our regular weekly meeting. But he had a guest, and he introduced us. And his name was Jerome \\"Skip\\" Johnson, a friendly guy, a grandfather, and he was from my hometown of Chicago. And Chuck explained that Skip&mdash;Lieutenant Johnson&mdash;had been his platoon commander in Vietnam. But they had lost touch, until Chuck tracked him down. This was the first time they had reunited in nearly 50 years. And Chuck just wanted to bring Skip to the Oval Office to say hello to the President&mdash;to meet his family, including his young grandsons. <p>And Chuck told me about how it had been 1968, with protests and race riots back home causing tensions among our troops in Vietnam. And Chuck's unit was mostly White, but Skip is African American, and as the platoon commander, he was not going to tolerate division or distrust. And he went to his men and made himself clear: We are all Americans. We're going to live together. We're going to take care of each other. We're fighting together. We're going to get each other's backs. Let's get it done. <p>And at that moment in the Oval Office, as these two soldiers stood before me&mdash;with Skip's grandsons looking on&mdash;it wasn't lost on any of us how far our Nation has come. And I want to thank Chuck for that moment, because part of the reason we've traveled that distance is, we've had men like Chuck Hagel serving and representing what's best in America. In moments when we are tested&mdash;as a military, as a nation&mdash;sometimes we get distracted by what divides us and lose sight of what unites us. And at those moments, we can draw strength from the example of a sergeant from Nebraska and a lieutenant from Chicago. We are all Americans. We live together. We sacrifice together. We take care of each other. Sometimes, we have to fight together. <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I want to introduce to you my friend, our 24th Secretary of Defense, and an outstanding American: Mr. Chuck Hagel.\" "
"24" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hey! Hello, hello, hello! Hello, Democrats! Hey! Thank you so much. Thank you. Everybody, sit down, sit down. It's good to be with you, Democrats. It's good to be in Philadelphia. My understanding is, we still have our host, Mayor Nutter, here. Where's Mayor Nutter? There he is right there. <p>I want to just remind the New England and Pacific Northwest contingents, this is the City of Brotherly Love. So regardless of what you think about Sunday, I want you all to keep it clean. [<i>Laughter</i>] The&mdash;I am not taking sides on that one. [<i>Laughter</i>] I want to begin by&mdash;oh, bring your own footballs&mdash; that was&mdash;oooh. [<i>Laughter</i>] Oooh. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Ooooh&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The President.</i> Wow. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member</i>. That's not overinflated. <p><i>The President.</i> This is&mdash;and you're, what, a Giants fan? <p><i>Audience member</i>. Jets fan. <p><i>The President</i>. See, that's why he's so resentful. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I&mdash;let me begin by just acknowledging your outstanding leadership, starting with someone who, somehow, can travel for 17 hours, come off the plane perfectly coiffed&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;not a wrinkle on her, happy as a clam&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;come back another 17 hours later, after 2&frac12;, 3 days of programs, and go straight to a retreat of her caucus, and never miss a beat. I don't know what she drinks along with that chocolate. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I want some of it. Your outstanding leader, Nancy Pelosi. Give Nancy a big round of applause. [<i>Applause</i>] Hey! <p>Joe Crowley also went on that trip and didn't look perfectly coifed when he got off the plane. [<i>Laughter</i>] But give Joe Crowley a big round of applause also. I want to thank Steny for the gracious introduction; Xavier, who helped obviously make this happen and is just providing outstanding leadership all the time; Jim Clyburn, one of my favorite people, just an extraordinary gentleman and leader. We love him. And Debbie Wasserman Shultz, our chairwoman of the DNC. Thank you so much. <p>And then, the guy who I had a chance to see before I came out just to let him know that he should not feel overly disappointed when his hair gets gray, because in this job it will&mdash;Ben Ray Luj&aacute;n, the DCCC chair. I used to be youthful and attractive like him. [<i>Laughter</i>] We'll see how long that lasts, brother. [<i>Laughter</i>] He's going to have hair like Steve Israel. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I'm not going to give a long speech because I just gave one, and I want to spend most of the time on questions. Let me summarize then what I said last week. <p>We have been through an extraordinarily challenging journey, worst financial crisis in our lifetimes. We've seen the incredible courage and sacrifice, but also the costs of two difficult wars. There's been ups and downs in every region of the country and people feeling as if the economy is churning in ways that defy their control. And yet, despite all the challenges, despite all the fears, despite all the difficulties, over the last 6 years, what we've seen is the American people fighting their way back. And because of them, because of their resilience and their grit and their hard work, and because you and I, together, made some really tough choices&mdash;some sometimes politically unpopular choices&mdash;America has come back. <p>We've seen 11 million jobs created, best job growth since the nineties, best job growth in manufacturing since the nineties; steepest drop in the unemployment rate in 30 years; deficit cut by two-thirds; over 10 million people with health insurance that didn't have it before. We've seen reading scores go up, high school graduation rates go up, more young people attending college than ever before. We're number one in oil production, number one in natural gas production; doubled clean energy production; solar power up tenfold; wind power up threefold; carbon pollution down. <p>There is no economic metric by which we are not better off than when I took office. And that is because of the extraordinary will and dedication of the American people, but also because all of you have done a terrific job. And I'm proud of you for that. <p>Now, what we also know is, we've now got some choices to make. Going forward, are we going to be an economy in which a few do spectacularly well, or are we going to be an economy in which everybody who's willing to work hard is getting a fair shot and can succeed? Are we going to be an economy that continues to invest in innovation and infrastructure, all the ingredients that are necessary to power this economy through the 21st century, or are we going to be neglectful of those very things that have made us an economic superpower? Are we going to do what's necessary to make sure that everybody gets the tools they need to succeed&mdash;the education, the childcare support, the help when it comes to minimum wages and paid sick leave&mdash;that gives people a basic baseline of stability, but also allows them to constantly adapt to an ever-changing world? <p>That's the set of choices that we now have to make. And because the economy has gotten better, wages are beginning to tick up, people are starting to feel better about the economy. But I think what everybody here understands is that the ground that middle class families lost over the last 30 years still has to be made up and the trends that have squeezed middle class families and those striving to get into the middle class, those trends have not been fully reversed. <p>And so as much as we should appreciate the progress that's been made, it shouldn't be a cause for complacency, because we've got more work to do. We've got a lot more work to do. And in my State of the Union, I laid out a series of specific proposals that would allow us to continue to control our deficit, but would also ensure that we were investing in the kind of quality education, including free community college, that is so necessary for people to move forward. Specific proposals to make sure that we provided some relief to middle class families in the form of a childcare credit and additional higher education credits so that somebody who is working hard and doing their best can get a little bit of relief, a little bit of help. <p>We talked about how important it is for us to rebuild our infrastructure in this country and put people back to work all across the country, something that everybody knows we need to do. And we've got very specific ways of paying for it, by closing loopholes that send jobs overseas and rewarding companies who are investing right here in the United States of America. <p>So I summarized all this as middle class economics. And what we know is, middle class economics works. That's been the history of this country. That's been the history of the last 6 years when we've implemented middle class economics. And the other side was telling us this would be a disaster and it would kill jobs and raise the deficit, health care costs would explode. And none of that happened. That's pretty rare where you have two visions, a vigorous debate, and then, you test who's right. And the record shows that we were right and middle class economics does work. <p>So the bottom line is this: We've got to make sure it continues to work. We should protect the progress we're making. <p>I hear Republicans are holding their 50th or 60th vote next year [week; White House correction.] to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act. I've lost count at this point. But here's something easy to remember: If that bill ever actually reached my desk, I would happily veto it. If they try to unravel new rules that we put in place to make sure Wall Street recklessness doesn't hurt American families again, I'll be happy to veto it. If, rather than try to solve the problem of a broken immigration system, they compound the problem, I'll veto it. <p>But my hope is that they join us. And one good piece of news is I noticed that even though their policies haven't quite caught up yet, their rhetoric is starting to sound pretty Democratic. [<i>Laughter</i>] I heard&mdash;Chris Van Hollen was telling me about one Republican Senator who shall go unnamed, but generally, doesn't agree with me on much, and he was suddenly shocked, shocked that the top 1 percent is doing really well and everybody else is getting squeezed, and we need to do something about it. And I think&mdash;I welcome that. I consider imitation the highest form of flattery. Come on board. Let's go help out that middle class family. Let's get something done. <p>We've got a former Presidential candidate on the other side who suddenly is just deeply concerned about poverty. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's great! Let's go! Come on! Let's do something about it! <p>I am glad that their rhetoric at least has shifted, but let's now make sure that the policies match up with the rhetoric. Let's make sure Americans are able to upgrade their skills for higher wages. Let's build the world's most competitive economy. Let's make sure that we end this across-the-board sequester that doesn't differentiate between smart Government spending and dumb Government spending. Let's take a scalpel and not a meat cleaver, and let's make sure that we're funding the things that we know help American families succeed. That's a smart thing to do. <p>I disagree with any Republican who says letting funding for the Department of Homeland Security lapse is \\"not the end of the world.\\" That's a quote from one of them. I mean, I tell you, these are the guys who are always saying they're concerned about the borders. These are the folks who say they're concerned about terrorism. Well, who do you think helps monitor our borders? Well, what do you mean, it's not at the end of the world? That's all you've been talking about. And now, suddenly, because you want to make a political point, you think that we can afford to have the Department of Homeland Security not functioning, because of political games in Washington? <p>I mean, we can pay for all of the proposals that I put forward in the State of the Union we can pay for by fixing a Tax Code that is riddled with loopholes for special interests. And if Republicans don't agree with my approach for paying for it, then they should put forward their own proposals. And I'm happy to engage them on that. I'm eager to engage with them on that. I think it's entirely fair for them to say, that's not the right way to fund higher education, that's not the right way to help families with childcare. And we can have a good, healthy debate. What we can't suggest is that childcare is not important to American families or that higher education costs are not relevant to folks who are currently in the middle class or trying to work their way into the middle class or hoping their children will be able to get in the middle class. Those things are important. So put forward alternatives. <p>And the good news is, is that I think there are some who want to work with us. And maybe the fact that I've now run my last election means that, instead of just blocking what we're trying to do, they may be interested in getting some stuff done. Of course, they'll then spend all their time attacking the next Democrat coming down the pike, but that's okay. <p>Because, ultimately, what this is about, the reason we are here, the reason so many of you make such extraordinary sacrifices&mdash;and your families make sacrifices&mdash;to be here, is because the story of the people that I mentioned in the State of the Union&mdash;people like Rebekah, who I talked about, from Minnesota&mdash;those people are us. They're our moms and our dads and our aunts and our uncles and our nephews and our cousins and our neighbors and our coworkers and our friends. And we remember some point in time where somebody gave us a little bit of a hand up. And we remember that scholarship that allowed us to go to school when it wasn't clear that our family might be able to afford it. And we remember what it was like to try to find childcare when you got two folks working and trying to pay the mortgage at the same time, just like Michelle and I had to do. We remember those things. <p>And the reason that we do this is so that those folks have the same extraordinary opportunities in the same extraordinary country as we did. And more importantly, so that our children and our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren have those same opportunities. And it is our obligation to make sure that we are crystal clear about what we stand for and who we are fighting for. <p>And I will just say, obviously, we were all disappointed with the outcome of the last election, and there are a lot of reasons for it, and I'm happy to take on some of the blame. But one thing I'm positive about is, when we're shy about what we care about, when we're defensive about what we've accomplished, when we don't stand up straight and proud and say, yes, we believe that everybody in this country should have health insurance, and we're glad that we are making that happen; yes, we believe that families shouldn't be torn apart, and we're glad that we're fighting for immigration reform; yes, we believe in middle class economics, and we don't apologize for wanting to make sure that some wonderful young man or young woman out there can actually afford to go to college even if their parents didn't go&mdash;we need to stand up and go on offense and not be defensive about what we believe in. That's why we're Democrats. <p>And I promise you, I'm not going out the last 2 years sitting on the sidelines. I am going to be out there making the case every single day, and I hope you join me. <p>Thank you.\" "
"25" "\"Good job! Well, thank you so much, Elana, for that wonderful introduction. Let me just be clear, when I was 19, I was not doing genetic testing. [<i>Laughter</i>] When I met Elana at the White House Science Fair last year, she tried to explain her research to me. And to help her explain her findings, she made these giant pink chromosomes out of swim noodles, which was helpful to me&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;because I know what swim noodles are, and I saw how they fit together. But I could not have been more impressed with Elana. <p>And she represents the incredible talent and energy and possibility of our young people, and so I'm so proud of her, and I'm so grateful that she introduced me here today. And she's doing great at Harvard from my&mdash;from what I understand. So those of you who are interested in purchasing stock in her&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I'm sure she has an agent of some sort that you can talk to. <p>We've got some folks here who are doing outstanding work to keep Americans healthy. We have America's Health and Human Services Secretary, Sylvia Burwell. You can give her a round of applause. [<i>Applause</i>] She's worthy of it. We've got our Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy. Where's Vivek? Stand up, Vivek. Our new Surgeon General. We haven't had one in a while. [<i>Laughter</i>] So we're really happy to have him here. And he looks sharp in his uniform. We have Dr. Harold Varmus of the National Cancer Institute. Harold. We have the singing scientist, Dr. Francis Collins, of NIH here. And we have my Science Adviser, Dr. John Holdren, who does not sing. For anyone wondering, \\"Is there a doctor in the house?\\"&mdash;we have got you covered. <p>We also have Members of Congress who are here. Lamar Alexander from the great State of Tennessee is one of the Senate's key supporters of encouraging medical innovation, and I'm so looking forward to working with him. Give Lamar a big round of applause. Senator Patty Murray is prepared to work with him on this issue. She couldn't make it here today. But we do have on the House side Congresswoman Diana DeGette, who is here and who is leading this effort in the House. And we're very proud of her. <p>Now, last week, in my State of the Union Address, I focused on what we need to do to make sure middle class economics helps more Americans get ahead in the new economy. We've got to help working families make ends meet and make them feel more secure in a constantly changing, dynamic, global economy. We have to offer more opportunities for people to upgrade their skills for better paying jobs in this economy. And we've got to build the world's most competitive economy so that businesses create jobs here in the United States and not someplace else. <p>And that last part is what I want to focus on today. We've invited some of America's brightest minds in medicine and technology, some of our strongest advocates for privacy. And perhaps most importantly, we've invited patients who have the most at stake in these efforts. And we're here to harness what is most special about America, and that is our spirit of innovation, our ability to dream and take risks and tinker and try new things. And as a result of that, not only improve our economy, but improve the lives of men and women and children for generations to come. And together, what's so exciting is, is that we have the possibility of leading an entirely new era of medicine that makes sure new jobs and new industries and new lifesaving treatments for diseases are created right here in the United States. <p>Because we shouldn't just celebrate innovation. We have to invest in innovation. We have to nurture innovation. We have to encourage it and make sure that we're channeling it in ways that are most productive. And that's especially true when it comes to medicine. After all, when American researchers developed a vaccine for polio, a program created by Congress helped to distribute it. A federally funded study helped American doctors discover the risk factors for heart disease. Grants from the National Science Foundation and NIH supported the early experiments that led to the invention of the MRI. <p>And these kinds of investments don't always pay off. Basic research, by definition, will sometimes lead us down blind alleys and&mdash;but it will also tell us what we don't know, which then helps us figure out new pathways. And when things do pay off, then they create economic opportunities in ways that we could never imagine. <p>So Francis&mdash;Dr. Collins here&mdash;helped lead the Human Genome Project, and we've got a number of people here who are deeply involved in that process. And one study found that every dollar we spent to map the human genome has already returned $140 to our economy. There's a huge economic stake in us tapping into this innovation. [<i>Applause</i>] Nothing wrong with clapping about that. Yes. <p>But as anybody who's ever watched a loved one battle with an illness, particularly a life-threatening illness&mdash;and I suspect that there's nobody here who hasn't been touched in some fashion by that experience&mdash;what everybody here understands is that the most important impact these investments can have can't be measured in dollars. If we have an opportunity to prevent hurt and heartbreak for more families; if we have the opportunity to help people live longer, happier, healthier lives; if we have the chance to make sure that a young person like Elana, who, stricken by a disease before their life has even really gotten going, if we have a chance to make sure that they're okay and cured and then able to make incredible contributions to our society, then we've got to seize that. We've got to go after that. <p>And that's why we're here today. Because something called precision medicine&mdash;in some cases, people call it personalized medicine&mdash;gives us one of the greatest opportunities for new medical breakthroughs that we have ever seen. Doctors have always recognized that every patient is unique, and doctors have always tried to tailor their treatments as best they can to individuals. You can match a blood transfusion to a blood type. That was an important discovery. What if matching a cancer cure to our genetic code was just as easy, just as standard? What if figuring out the right dose of medicine was as simple as taking our temperature? <p>And that's the promise of precision medicine: delivering the right treatments, at the right time, every time, to the right person. And for a small, but growing, number of patients, that future is already here. Eight out of 10 people with one type of leukemia saw white blood cell counts return to normal with a new drug targeting a specific gene. Genetic testing for HIV patients helps doctors determine who will be helped by a new antiviral drug and who will experience harmful side effects. <p>And advances in technology means these breakthroughs could be just the beginning. The year Dr. Collins helped sequence the first human genome, it cost about $100 million dollars, and today it costs less than $2,000. Wearable electronics make it easier than ever to record vital signs from your blood sugar to your heart rate. Electronic medical records let doctors and researchers across the country collaborate more closely than ever before. And more powerful computers help us analyze data faster than ever before. <p>So if we combine all these emerging technologies, if we focus them and make sure that the connections are made, then the possibility of discovering new cures, the possibility of applying medicines more efficiently and more effectively so that the success rates are higher, so that there's less waste in the system, which then means more resources to help more people&mdash;the possibilities are boundless. So the time is right to unleash a new wave of advances in this area, in precision medicine, just like we did with genetics 25 years ago. <p>And the really good news&mdash;this is how you know that the moment is right&mdash;is, there's bipartisan support for the idea&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;here in Washington. Which makes me very happy. [<i>Laughter</i>] When I was a Senator back in 2005, I worked with Republican Senator Richard Burr on a bill supporting precision medicine. Newly elected Republican Senator Bill Cassidy&mdash;who also happens to be a gastroenterologist&mdash;recently called precision medicine \\"an incredible area of promise.\\" <p>And that's why the budget I send this Congress on Monday will include a new precision medicine initiative that brings America closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes and gives all of us access, potentially, to the personalized information that we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier. <p>So let me just outline the facets of this. First, we're going to work with the National Cancer Institute. We want to find the genetic factors that can lead to cancer. And we want to use that knowledge to develop new and more effective approaches to help people beat this disease. <p>Second, we're going to work with the FDA to develop new approaches for evaluating next-generation genetic tests. The way we approve a new gene-sequencing technology is going to be different than the way we approve a new pacemaker or prosthetic device. And we need to make sure that our approach reflects the differences in technology. <p>Third, we're going to work with the National Institutes of Health to create a research group of 1 million volunteers. And just like analyzing our DNA teaches us more about who we are than ever before, analyzing data from one of the largest research populations ever assembled will teach us more about the connections between us than ever before. And this new information will help doctors discover the causes&mdash;and one day the cures&mdash;of some of the most deadly diseases that we face. So if we have a big data set, a big pool of people that's varied, then that allows us to really map out not only the genome of one person, but now we can start seeing connections and patterns and correlations that helps us refine exactly what it is that we're trying to do with respect to treatment. <p>And finally, we're going to make sure that protecting patient privacy is built into our efforts from day one. And I'm proud we have so many patients' rights advocates with us here today. They're not going to be on the sidelines. It's not going to be an afterthought. They'll help us design this initiative from the ground up, making sure that we harness new technologies and opportunities in a responsible way. <p>So the precision medicine initiative we're launching today will lay the foundation for a new generation of lifesaving discoveries. But in order for us to realize its potential, I'm asking more hospitals and researchers and privacy experts to join us in this effort. And I'm asking entrepreneurs and nonprofits to help us create tools that give patients the chance to get involved as well. Because we want every American ultimately to be able to securely access and analyze their own health data so that they can make the best decisions for themselves and for their families. <p>And ultimately, this has the possibility of not only helping us find new cures, but it also helps us create a genuine health care system as opposed to just a disease care system. Part of what we want to do is to allow each of us to have sufficient information about our particular quirks&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that we can make better life decisions. And that, ultimately, is one of the most promising aspects about this: making sure that we've got a system that focuses on prevention and keeping healthy, not just on curing diseases after they happen. <p>Medical breakthroughs take time, and this area of precision medicine will be no different. But the patients with us this morning are living proof that the dawn of a new era has arrived. If we start today and seize this moment and the focus and the energy and the resources that it demands, there is no telling how many lives we could change. And every single one of those lives matter. <p>Bill Elder was one of Michelle's guests at the State of the Union last week. Where's Bill? Here he is. Stand up, Bill. So Bill's a good-looking young guy. [<i>Laughter</i>] And about 20 years ago, Bill was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. But it turns out, Bill is one of 4 percent of cystic fibrosis patients whose disease is caused by a particular mutation in one gene. And a few years ago, the FDA fast-tracked a new drug targets&mdash;specifically targeting that mutation. And one night in 2012, Bill tried it for the first time. And just a few hours later, he woke up knowing something was different, and finally, he realized what it was: He had never been able to breathe out of his nose before. Think about that. <p>So Bill is now 27. When he was born, 27 was the median age of survival for a cystic fibrosis patient. Today, Bill is in his third year of medical school. \\"And for the first time in my life,\\" Bill said&mdash;for the first time in his life, he says, \\"I truly believe that I will live long enough to be a grandfather.\\" One day, Bill will be able to tell his grandchildren about how he used the miracle of his own life to not only serve as an example, but also an inspiration and ultimately a pathway for his own career to help save the lives of other people. <p>And that's the spirit of hope and resilience and community that's always carried America forward. We may disagree sometimes, especially here in Washington, but we do share a common vision for our future. We want an economy powered by the world's best innovations, the best ideas. We want a country that extends its promise of opportunity to everybody who's willing to work for it. We want to have a nation in which the accidents and circumstances of our birth aren't determining our fate, and that if born with a particular disease or a particular genetic makeup that makes us more vulnerable to something, that that's not our destiny, that's not our fate&mdash;that we can remake it. That's who we are as Americans, and that's the power of scientific discovery. <p>And we want Bill's generation and the generations that come after to inherit that most extraordinary gift anybody can imagine, and that is not just a chance to live a long and happy and healthy life in this greatest country on Earth, but also the chance to remake that world continuously, in ways that provide great promise for future generations. So I'm very excited about this. I hope you are too. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless the United States. Let's get to work.\" "
"26" "\"Hi, everybody. At a moment when our economy is growing, our businesses are creating jobs at the fastest pace since the 1990s, and wages are starting to rise again, we have to make some choices about the kind of country we want to be. Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well? Or will we build an economy where everyone who works hard has a chance to get ahead? <p>That was the focus of my State of the Union Address: middle class economics, the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. <p>This week, I will send a budget to Congress that's built on those values. We'll help working families' paychecks go farther by treating things like paid leave and childcare like the economic priorities that they are. We'll offer Americans of every age the chance to upgrade their skills so they can earn higher wages, with plans like making 2 years of community college free for every responsible student. And we'll keep building the world's most attractive economy for high-wage jobs, with new investments in research, infrastructure, manufacturing, and expanded access to faster Internet and new markets. <p>We can afford to make these investments. Since I took office, we've cut our deficits by about two-thirds, the fastest sustained deficit reduction since just after the end of World War II. We just have to be smarter about how we pay for our priorities, and that's what my budget does. It proposes getting rid of special interest loopholes in our Tax Code and using those savings to cut taxes for middle class families and reward businesses that invest in America. It refuses to play politics with our homeland security and funds our national security priorities at home and abroad. And it undoes the arbitrary, across-the-board budget cuts known as the sequester for our domestic priorities and matches those investments dollar for dollar in resources our troops need to get the job done. <p>Now, I know there are Republicans in Congress who disagree with my approach. And like I said in my State of the Union, if they have ideas that will help middle class families feel some economic security, I'm all in to work with them. But I will keep doing everything I can to help more working families make ends meet and get ahead&mdash;not just because we want everyone to share in America's success, but because we want everyone to contribute to America's success. <p>That's the way the middle class thrived in the last century, and that's how it will thrive again. <p>Thanks, everybody. And have a great weekend.\" "
"27" "\"<i>The President</i>. Thank you so much. Thank you, everybody. Please, have a seat. Well, good morning, everybody. <p><i>Audience members</i>. Good morning. <p><i>The President</i>. It is good to be here at the Department of Homeland Security. And let me thank Jeh Johnson not only for the outstanding job that's he's doing as Secretary of DHS, but also for a short introduction. I like short introductions. [<i>Laughter</i>] Give him a big round of applause. <p>This is a great way to start the week, because I get to do something I enjoy doing, which is saying thank you. Nobody works harder to keep America safe than the people who are gathered here today. And you don't get a lot of attention for it. That's the nature of the job. But I know how vital you are, and I want to make sure that more Americans know how vital you are. Because against just about every threat that we face&mdash;from terrorist networks to microscopic viruses, to cyber attacks, to weather disasters&mdash;you guys are there. You protect us from threats at home and abroad, by air and land and sea. You safeguard our ports, you patrol our borders. You inspect our chemical plants, screen travelers for Ebola, shield our computer networks, help hunt down criminals from around the world. You have a busy agenda, a full plate. And here at home, you are ready to respond to any emergency at a moment's notice. <p>It is simply extraordinary how much the Department of Homeland Security does every single day to keep our Nation, our people, safe. It's a critical job, and you get it done with not&mdash;without a lot of fanfare. And I want to make sure that you have what you need to keep getting the job done. Every American has an interest in making sure that the Department of Homeland Security has what it needs to achieve its mission, because we are reliant on that mission every single day. <p>Now, today I'm sending Congress a budget that will make sure you've got what you need to achieve your mission. It gives you the resources you need to carry out your mission in a way that is smart and strategic and makes the most of every dollar. It's also a broader blueprint for America's success in this new global economy. Because after a breakthrough year for America&mdash;at a time when our economy is growing and our businesses are creating jobs at the fastest pace since the 1990s and wages are starting to rise again&mdash;we've got some fundamental choices to make about the kind of country we want to be. <p>Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well? Or are we going to build an economy where everyone who works hard has a chance to get ahead? <p>And that was the focus of my State of the Union Address a couple weeks ago, what I called middle class economics: the idea that this country does best when everybody gets a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody plays by the same set of rules. <p>The budget that Congress now has in its hands is built on those values. It helps working families' paychecks go farther by treating things like paid sick leave and childcare as the economic priorities that they are. It gives Americans of every age the chance to upgrade their skills so they can earn higher wages, and it includes my plan to make 2 years of community college free for responsible students. It lets us keep building the world's most attractive economy for high-wage jobs, with new investments in research and infrastructure and manufacturing, as well as expanded access to faster Internet and new markets for goods made in America. <p>It's also a budget that recognizes that our economy flourishes when America is safe and secure. So it invests in our IT networks to protect them from malicious actors. It supports our troops and strengthens our border security. And it gives us the resources to confront global challenges, from ISIL to Russian aggression. <p>Now, since I took office, we have cut our deficits by about two-thirds. I'm going to repeat that, as I always do when I mention this fact, because the public oftentimes, if you ask them, thinks that the deficit has shot up. Since I took office, we have cut our deficits by about two-thirds. That's the fastest period of sustained deficit reduction since after the demobilization at the end of World War II. So we can afford to make these investments while remaining fiscally responsible. And in fact, we cannot afford&mdash;we would be making a critical error if we avoided making these investments. We can't afford not to. When the economy is doing well, we're making investments when we're growing. That's part of what keeps deficits low, because the economy is doing well. So we've just got to be smarter about how we pay for our priorities, and that's what my budget does. <p>At the end of 2013, I signed a bipartisan budget agreement that helped us end some of the arbitrary cuts known in Washington-speak as \\"sequestration.\\" And folks here at DHS know a little too much about sequestration&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;because many of you had to deal with those cuts and the uncertainty around them and it made it a lot harder for you to do your jobs. <p>The 2013 agreement to reverse some of those cuts helped to boost our economic growth. Part of the reason why we grew faster last year was we were no longer being burdened by mindless across-the-board cuts, and we were being more strategic about how we handled our Federal budget. And now we need to take the next step. So my budget will end sequestration and fully reverse the cuts to domestic priorities in 2016. And it will match the investments that were made domestically, dollar for dollar, with increases in our defense funding. <p>And just last week, top military officials told Congress that if Congress does nothing to stop sequestration, there could be serious consequences for our national security, at a time when our military is stretched on a whole range of issues. And that's why I want to work with Congress to replace mindless austerity with smart investments that strengthen America. And we can do so in a way that is fiscally responsible. <p>I'm not going to accept a budget that locks in sequestration going forward. It would be bad for our security and bad for our growth. I will not accept a budget that severs the vital link between our national security and our economic security. I know there's some on Capitol Hill who would say, well, we'd be willing to increase defense spending, but we're not going to increase investments in infrastructure, for example, or basic research. Well, those two things go hand in hand. If we don't have a vital infrastructure, if we don't have broadband lines across the country, if we don't have a smart grid, all that makes us more vulnerable. America can't afford being shortsighted, and I'm not going to allow it. <p>The budget I've sent to Congress today is fully paid for, through a combination of smart spending cuts and tax reforms. Let me give you an example. Right now our Tax Code is full of loopholes for special interests, like the trust fund loophole that allows the wealthiest Americans to avoid paying taxes on their unearned income. I think we should fix that and use the savings to cut taxes for middle class families. That would be good for our economy. <p>Now, I know there are Republicans who disagree with my approach. And I've said this before: If they have other ideas for how we can keep America safe, grow our economy, while helping middle class families feel some sense of economic security, I welcome their ideas. But their numbers have to add up. And what we can't do is play politics with folks' economic security or with our national security. You, better than anybody, know what the stakes are. The work you do hangs in the balance. <p>And just a few weeks from now, funding for Homeland Security will run out. That's not because of anything this Department did, it's because the Republicans in Congress who funded everything in Government through September, except for this Department. And they're now threatening to let Homeland Security funding expire because of their disagreement with my actions to make our immigration system smarter, fairer, and safer. <p>Now, let's be clear, I think we can have a reasonable debate about immigration. I'm confident that what we're doing is the right thing and the lawful thing. I understand they may have some disagreements with me on that, although I should note that a large majority&mdash;or a large percentage of Republicans agree that we needed comprehensive immigration reform and were prepared to act in the Senate and should have acted in the House. But if they don't agree with me, that's fine, that's how our democracy works. You may have noticed, they usually don't agree with me. [<i>Laughter</i>] But don't jeopardize our national security over this disagreement. <p>As one Republican put it, if they let your funding run out, \\"it's not the end of the world.\\" That's what they said. Well, I guess literally that's not&mdash;that's true; it may not be the end of the world. But until they pass a funding bill, it is the end of a paycheck for tens of thousands of frontline workers who will continue to get&mdash;to have to work without getting paid: over 40,000 Border Patrol and Customs agents, over 50,000 airport screeners, over 13,000 immigration officers, over 40,000 men and women in the Coast Guard. These Americans aren't just working to keep us safe, they have to take care of their own families. The notion that they would get caught up in a disagreement around policy that has nothing to do with them makes no sense. <p>And if Republicans let Homeland Security funding expire, it's the end to any new initiatives in the event that a new threat emerges. It's the end of grants to States and cities that improve local law enforcement and keep our communities safe. The men and women of America's homeland security apparatus do important work to protect us, and Republicans and Democrats in Congress should not be playing politics with that. <p>We need to fund the Department, pure and simple. We've got to put politics aside, pass a budget that funds our national security priorities at home and abroad and gives middle class families the security they need to get ahead in the new economy. This is one of our most basic and most important responsibilities as a government. So I'm calling on Congress to get this done. <p>Every day, we count on people like you to keep America secure. And you are counting on us as well to uphold our end of the bargain. You're counting on us to make sure that you've got the resources to do your jobs safely and efficiently and that you're able to look after your families while you are out there working really hard to keep us safe. <p>We ask a lot of you. The least we can do is have your backs. That's what I'm going to keep on doing for as long as I have the honor of serving as your President. I have your back. And I'm going to keep on fighting to make sure that you get the resources you deserve. I'm going to keep fighting to make sure that every American has the chance not just to share in America's success, but to contribute to America's success. That's what this budget is about. <p>It reflects our values in making sure that we are making the investments we need to keep America safe, to keep America growing, and to make sure that everybody is participating no matter what they look like, where they come from, no matter how they started in life, they've got a chance to get ahead in this great country of ours. That's what I believe. That's what you believe. Let's get it done. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"28" "\"Welcome to the White House! After Super Bowl Sunday, we thought we'd help America ease back into the work week with some more sports. [<i>Laughter</i>] So let's give it up for the Stanley Cup Champion L.A. Kings and the Major League Soccer Champion L.A. Galaxy. <p>We have NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman here; give him a big round of applause. MLS Commissioner Don Garber is in the house. We've got also Dan Beckerman, the president and CEO of AEG, the company that owns both of these championship teams. And of course, we've got Kings and Galaxy management and Kings Coach Darryl Sutter and Galaxy Coach Bruce Arena. Give them a big round of applause. <p>Now, as a Chicago fan, I'm a little resentful. [<i>Laughter</i>] You guys have an embarrassment of riches. Today feels a little like \\"Groundhog Day.\\" If you're feeling a little d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, you're not alone. Two years ago, we had the Galaxy and the Kings here together. So if you see Bill Murray playing the piano in the foyer, you know something weird is going on, and we're probably going to do this again. <p>This is actually three titles in 4 years for the Galaxy. It is their fifth Cup overall, more than any other franchise in MLS. And it will be the last one for the greatest soccer players America has ever produced, Landon Donovan, who unfortunately couldn't make it today. But everybody knows this team is a whole lot more than just Landon. There's league MVP Robbie Keane and Robbie Rogers. Apparently, there's some other guys not named Robbie&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;like Omar Gonzalez from Team U.S.A. And Juninho and Leonardo, two guys who've got that Brazilian one-name thing going, which is always very cool. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, this season wasn't a perfect storybook. The Galaxy started out the season in the cellar, then fought their way back into the playoffs. And then, in the MLS Cup against New England, the game went into extra time when Robbie Keane's goal gave them their latest title. <p>And I was just telling these guys backstage the degree to which they represent their sports so well, and America is starting to realize what the Beautiful Game is all about. And it is wonderful to see not just what's happening at the highest levels of professional sports, but how legions of young people are going to be continuing the traditions here in the United States with soccer for many years to come. <p>Now, like the Galaxy, the Kings needed overtime to win their championship; they needed two of them, in fact. And that was the easy part: Just to get to the Finals, the Kings had to win three straight Game Sevens&mdash;all on the road. They dug themselves out of a 3-0 hole against San Jose in the first round; they're laughing because they're thinking, man, let's try to do it easier next time. [<i>Laughter</i>] In the Conference Final, they beat my Blackhawks, which is unfortunate. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, first of all, in L.A., there's not even any ice really. [<i>Laughter</i>] So you'd think, like, Chicago, where it's probably 10 degrees below zero today, at least, we'd get some hockey. But I mean, we've won a couple, so I can't complain. <p>The Kings have done the unthinkable: They have turned a city with no snow and no ice and no winter into a hockey town&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;complete with an outdoor game in Dodgers Stadium. They have done it with a team that L.A. fans have embraced, guys like goalie Jonathan Quick, playoff MVP Justin Williams. The first line of Brown and Kopitar and Gaborik, and Jeff Carter and his \\"hockey smile.\\" And of course, Coach Sutter and his one-liners with the press. [<i>Laughter</i>] I've tried those one-liners, by the way, with the press, and it never seems to work. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I've also got to mention that in the middle of their season, a lot of these guys played for their national teams at Sochi, and we were proud to have Jonathan Quick and Dustin Brown wearing the red, white, and blue on behalf of team U.S.A. Very proud of them. <p>And that's just one example of how these teams represent more than the colors they wear for the Kings or the Galaxy. Both teams are major supporters of Children's Hospital Los Angeles. The Kings have partnered with Discovery Cube L.A., a local museum, on an exhibit called \\"The Science of Hockey\\" to give kids a mental and physical workout. Galaxy players served meals to more than 2,000 families at Thanksgiving, and the organization built a soccer field for the community to use in South L.A. <p>And finally, I want to recognize what Robbie Rogers of the Galaxy has done for a lot of people by blazing a trail as one of professional sports' first openly gay players. My guess is that, as an athlete, Robbie wants to win first and foremost. That's what competition is all about. But, Robbie, you've also inspired a whole lot of folks here and around the world, and we are very proud of you. So where's Robbie? There he is. <p>So congratulations to both of these teams, to the City of Los Angeles, and its fans. And best of luck when you are not playing Chicago. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Thank you, everybody. We're going to strike the podium and get some pictures. Come on.\" "
"29" "\"This is my first opportunity to bring all the Cabinet here together for this year. And I, first of all, am going to be thanking all of them for the outstanding work they did last year to make 2014 a breakthrough year for America. What we saw was job growth, unemployment coming down, energy production up, clean energy production up, reduction in deficits, continued expansion of exports. <p>And as I said at the State of the Union, we are now poised to not just have recovered from the recession, but really to move forward in the 21st century in a better position than just about any country on Earth. But that requires we make some smart choices. Are we going to have a country where just a few do spectacularly well, or are we going to have a country where prosperity is broad based and we're making sure everybody has got a shot if they're willing to work hard? And that middle class economics is going to be a central theme of the work that every single agency does not just in the coming weeks or in the coming months, but for the remainder of my Presidency. <p>The budget that we put forward reflects those priorities. It makes sure that we're investing in infrastructure, in research, to continue to make us grow. It makes sure that we are providing tax credits and tax breaks to middle class families for their childcare expenses, to make sure that they're able to afford college educations for their kids. That includes the proposal I put forward for free community college, which can reduce the debt burdens for young people who know that they need the skills to succeed in the 21st century. <p>It's fully paid for through smart spending cuts, as well as tax reforms. It fully reverses the arbitrary cuts of recent years to domestic priorities in 2016 with dollar-for-dollar increases for defense. It's full of ideas that Republicans should embrace, like cutting taxes for middle class families. And one idea that they need to embrace right away is making sure that we're funding the Department of Homeland Security. <p>I talked about this yesterday; I want to reemphasize it today: The Department of Homeland Security contains numerous agencies that every single day are keeping the American people safe. They're our front lines at our borders, at our airports, along our coasts. And they need certainty in order to do their jobs. The notion that we would risk the effectiveness of the department that is charged with preventing terrorism, controlling our borders, making sure that the American people are safe, makes absolutely no sense. The idea that we would have members of the Coast Guard or our Border Control or TSA not being paid, and expect them to still be able to perform as effectively as we need them to perform, makes no sense. And the idea that we would do that because of a separate disagreement between myself and the Republicans about the need for comprehensive immigration reform, certainly is something that is not going to make sense to the American people. <p>So I'm encouraging Congress to go ahead and get a budget done for the Department of Homeland Security, make sure it's properly funded. And then, I'm looking forward to engaging with all of them so that we can make sure that we've got a Government that is delivering for the American people and making sure that we are giving middle class families and everybody who's willing to work hard to get into the middle class the chance to get ahead. And we're also going to have an opportunity in our Cabinet to talk about some administrative actions that we're taking to continue to make Government more efficient, more effective, and more customer friendly. And we've made some real progress on that front in every single agency, from the Veterans Administration to the Small Business Administration. I'm really excited about some of the things that we're going to be doing, saving taxpayers money and making sure that our organizations are tight, streamlined, and effective. <p>So I appreciate all the good work that all of you are doing. And I want to thank our press pool very much so we can get to work. <p>Thank you, guys.\" "
"30" "\"Well, I've just had a chance to meet with these six wonderful young people who represent the very best that this country has to offer. What sets them apart is that they all came here&mdash;were brought here by their parents&mdash;and, up until recently, have had a very difficult situation because of their immigration status. <p>The stories you hear from these young people are parents who aspired for a better life for their children; these folks coming here at the age of 4 months or 7 months or 9-year-olds or 10-year-olds, oftentimes not realizing that their status was any different than their classmates and their friends and their neighbors. In some cases, they didn't discover until they were about to go to college that there was a difference that might prevent them from giving back to their community and their country. <p>And because of the executive actions that we took with respect to DREAM Act kids, and because of the executive actions that I announced late last year with respect to many of their parents, what I've heard is lives transformed. Young people who didn't think it would be possible for themselves to go to college suddenly are going to college. Young people who didn't think that it might be possible to start a business suddenly find themselves in a position to look at starting a business. Young people who have memories of their mothers weeping because they couldn't go to the funeral of their parent now are seeing the prospect, the hope, that their lives can stabilize and normalize in some way. <p>I don't think there's anybody in America who's had a chance to talk to these six young people or the young DREAMers all across the country who wouldn't find it in their heart to say these kids are American just like us and they belong here and we want to do right by them. <p>And so often in this immigration debate, it's an abstraction, and we don't really think about the human consequences of our positions. And part of the reason that I wanted to hear from these young people today, and part of the reason why I've heard from young DREAMers in the past, is because it's a constant reminder to me of why this is important. <p>Now, the House of Representatives recently passed a bill that would have these six young people deported. I think that's wrong. And I think most Americans would think it was wrong if they had a chance to meet these young people. And legislation is going to be going to the Senate that again tries to block these executive actions. I want to be as clear as possible: I will veto any legislation that got to my desk that took away the chance of these young people, who grew up here and who are prepared to contribute to this country, that would prevent them from doing so. And I am confident that I can uphold that veto. <p>So as we move forward in this debate over the next several months, the next year, the next year and a half, I would call on Members of Congress to think about all the talent that is already in this country, that is already working in many cases, is already making contributions&mdash;in some cases, are joining up in our military or are already starting businesses, are already attending school&mdash;and let's be true to our tradition as a nation of immigrants and as a nation of laws. My strong preference is going to be to pass comprehensive immigration reform. And I know that there are Republicans out there who want to pass comprehensive immigration reform. In the Senate, they've shown that they are prepared to do the right thing. And rather than continue trying to go back to a system that everybody acknowledges was broken, let's move forward with the incredible promise that these young people represent. <p>Last point I'll make: There have been suggestions that we will not fund the Department of Homeland Security&mdash;which is responsible for patrolling our borders, as well as keeping our air travel safe, as well as patrolling our coasts&mdash;there's been talk about not funding that Department because of the disagreement around immigration reform. There's no logic to that position. Particularly for Republicans who claim that they are interested in strong border security, why would you cut off your nose to spite your face by defunding the very operations that are involved in making sure that we've got strong border security, particularly at a time when we've got real concerns about countering terrorism? <p>So my strong suggestion would be that Congress go ahead, fund the Department of Homeland Security. We're doing a tremendous amount of work at the borders. The concerns that people had about unaccompanied children tragically traveling from Central America, that spike has now diminished. We are below the levels that we were 2 years ago. We are working diligently with the Central American countries to make sure that young people there have hope and that their parents are getting a clear message of not sending them on this extraordinarily dangerous journey. <p>Let's make sure the Department of Homeland Security is properlyfunded, we're doing the right things at the borders, we're doing the right things with respect to our airports. And then let's get back to first principles and remind ourselves that each of these young people here are going to be doing incredible things on behalf of this country. <p>And to all the DREAMers who are out there and all those who qualified for my executive action, moving forward, I want you to know that I am confident in my ability to implement this program over the next 2 years, and I'm confident that the next President and the next Congress and the American people will ultimately recognize why this is the right thing to do. So I'm going to want all of you to get information so you can sign up if you qualify as well. All right? <p>Thank you very much, everybody. And thank you, guys, for sharing your incredible stories.\" "
"31" "\"Hi, everybody. I'm talking with you today from Ivy Tech Community College in Indianapolis, where I just held a town hall and heard from everyday Americans about what we can do together to make their lives a little better. <p>This week, we got news that confirms what we already know: that our businesses continue to create jobs for hard-working folks all across the country. Last month, America's businesses added another 267,000 jobs. In 2014, our economy created more than 3.1 million jobs in all, the best year for job growth since the late 1990s. All told, over the past 59 months, the private sector has added 11.8 million new jobs, the longest streak on record. And in the single most hopeful sign for middle class families, wages are rising again. <p>So America is poised for another good year, as long as Washington works to keep this progress going. We have to choose: Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well, or will we build an economy where everyone who works hard can get ahead? <p>Because while we've come a long way, we've got more work to do to make sure that our recovery reaches more Americans, not just those at the top. That's what middle class economics is all about: the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. <p>This week, I sent Congress a budget built on middle class economics. It helps families afford childcare, health care, college, paid leave at work, homeownership, and saving for retirement. And it could put thousands of dollars back into the pockets of a working family each year. It helps more Americans learn new skills to earn higher wages, including by making 2 years of community college free for responsible students all across the country. It invests in the research and infrastructure our businesses need to compete and create high-paying jobs. And it pays for this with smart spending cuts and by fixing a Tax Code that's riddled with special-interest loopholes for folks who don't need them, allowing us to offer tax breaks to students and families who do need them. <p>I believe this is where we need to go to give working families more security in a time of constant economic change. And I'll work with anyone, Republican or Democrat, who wants to get to \\"yes\\" on these issues. We won't agree on everything, and that's natural. But we should stop refighting old battles and start working together to help you succeed in the new economy. <p>That's what you elected us to do: not to turn everything into another Washington food fight, but to have debates that are worthy of this country and to build an economy not just where everyone can share in America's success, but where everyone can contribute to America's success. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"32" "\"Good afternoon. Today, as part of an international coalition of some 60 nations, including Arab countries, our men and women in uniform continue the fight against ISIL in Iraq and in Syria. <p>More than 2,000 coalition airstrikes have pounded these terrorists. We're disrupting their command and control and supply lines, making it harder for them to move. We're destroying their fighting positions, their tanks, their vehicles, their barracks, their training camps, and the oil and gas facilities and infrastructure that fund their operations. We're taking out their commanders, their fighters, and their leaders. <p>In Iraq, local forces have largely held the line and, in some places, have pushed ISIL back. In Syria, ISIL failed in its major push to take the town of Kobani, losing countless fighters in the process, fighters who will never again threaten innocent civilians. And we've seen reports of sinking morale among ISIL fighters as they realize the futility of their cause. <p>Now, make no mistake, this is a difficult mission, and it will remain difficult for some time. It's going to take time to dislodge these terrorists, especially from urban areas. But our coalition is on the offensive, ISIL is on the defensive, and ISIL is going to lose. Its barbaric murders of so many people, including American hostages, are a desperate and revolting attempt to strike fear in the hearts of people it can never possibly win over by its ideas or its ideology, because it offers nothing but misery and death and destruction. And with vile groups like this, there is only one option: With our allies and partners, we are going to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group. <p>And when I announced our strategy against ISIL in September, I said that we are strongest as a nation when the President and Congress work together. Today my administration submitted a draft resolution to Congress to authorize the use of force against ISIL. I want to be very clear about what it does and what it does not do. <p>This resolution reflects our core objective to destroy ISIL. It supports the comprehensive strategy that we've been pursuing with our allies and our partners: a systemic and sustained campaign of airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq and Syria; support and training for local forces on the ground, including the moderate Syrian opposition; preventing ISIL attacks in the region and beyond, including by foreign terrorist fighters who try to threaten our countries; regional and international support for an inclusive Iraqi Government that unites the Iraqi people and strengthens Iraqi forces against ISIL; humanitarian assistance for the innocent civilians of Iraq and Syria, who are suffering so terribly under ISIL's reign of horror. <p>I want to thank Vice President Biden, Secretaries Kerry and Hagel, and General Marty Dempsey for their leadership in advancing our strategy. Even as we meet this challenge in Iraq and Syria, we all agree that one of our weapons against terrorists like ISIL&mdash;a critical part of our strategy&mdash;is the values we live here at home. One of the best antidotes to the hateful ideologies that try to recruit and radicalize people to violent extremism is our own example as diverse and tolerant societies that welcome the contributions of all people, including people of all faiths. <p>The resolution we've submitted today does not call for the deployment of U.S. ground combat forces to Iraq or Syria. It is not the authorization of another ground war, like Afghanistan or Iraq. The 2,600 American troops in Iraq today largely serve on bases, and yes, they face the risks that come with service in any dangerous environment. But they do not have a combat mission. They are focused on training Iraqi forces, including Kurdish forces. <p>As I've said before, I'm convinced that the United States should not get dragged back into another prolonged ground war in the Middle East. That's not in our national security interest, and it's not necessary for us to defeat ISIL. Local forces on the ground who know their countries best are best positioned to take the ground fight to ISIL, and that's what they're doing. <p>At the same time, this resolution strikes the necessary balance by giving us the flexibility we need for unforeseen circumstances. For example, if we had actionable intelligence about a gathering of ISIL leaders, and our partners didn't have the capacity to get them, I would be prepared to order our Special Forces to take action, because I will not allow these terrorists to have a safe haven. So we need flexibility, but we also have to be careful and deliberate. And there is no heavier decision than asking our men and women in uniform to risk their lives on our behalf. As Commander in Chief, I will only send our troops into harm's way when it is absolutely necessary for our national security. <p>Finally, this resolution repeals the 2002 authorization of force for the invasion of Iraq and limits this new authorization to 3 years. I do not believe America's interests are served by endless war or by remaining on a perpetual war footing. As a nation, we need to ask the difficult and necessary questions about when, why, and how we use military force. After all, it is our troops who bear the costs of our decisions, and we owe them a clear strategy and the support they need to get the job done. So this resolution will give our Armed Forces and our coalition the continuity we need for the next 3 years. <p>It is not a timetable. It is not announcing that the mission is completed at any given period. What it is saying is that Congress should revisit the issue at the beginning of the next President's term. It's conceivable that the mission is completed earlier. It's conceivable that after deliberation, debate, and evaluation, that there are additional tasks to be carried out in this area. And the people's representatives, with a new President, should be able to have that discussion. <p>In closing, I want to say that in crafting this resolution we have consulted with, and listened to, both Republicans and Democrats in Congress. We have made a sincere effort to address difficult issues that we've discussed together. In the days and weeks ahead, we'll continue to work closely with leaders and Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. I believe this resolution can grow even stronger with the thoughtful and dignified debate that this moment demands. I'm optimistic that it can win strong bipartisan support and that we can show our troops and the world that Americans are united in this mission. <p>Now, today, our men and women in uniform continue the fight against ISIL, and we salute them for their courageous service. We pray for their safety. We stand with their families who miss them and who are sacrificing here at home. But know this: Our coalition is strong, our cause is just, and our mission will succeed. And long after the terrorists we face today are destroyed and forgotten, America will continue to stand free and tall and strong. May God bless our troops, and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"33" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. Please, everybody, have a seat. Thank you. Well, thank you, Rear Admiral Giberson, not only for the introduction, but for your extraordinary leadership and your service. <p>Last summer, as Ebola spread in West Africa, overwhelming public health systems and threatening to cross more borders, I said that fighting this disease had to be more than a national security priority, but an example of American leadership. After all, whenever and wherever a disaster or a disease strikes, the world looks to us to lead. And because of extraordinary people like the ones standing behind me and many who are in the audience, we have risen to the challenge. <p>Now, remember, there was no small amount of skepticism about our chances. People were understandably afraid, and if we're honest, some stoked those fears. But we believed that if we made policy based not on fear, but on sound science and good judgment, America could lead an effective global response while keeping the American people safe and we could turn the tide of the epidemic. <p>We believed this because of people like Rear Admiral Giberson. We believed this because of outstanding leaders like Raj Shah at USAID and Tom Frieden at the CDC. We believed it because of the men and women behind me and the many others here at home and who are still overseas who respond to challenges like this one not only with skill and professionalism, but with courage and with dedication. And because of your extraordinary work, we have made enormous progress in just a few months. <p>So the main reason we're actually here today is for me to say thank you. Thank you to the troops and public health workers who left their loved ones to head into the heart of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, and many of them did so over the holidays. Thank you to the health care professionals here at home who treated our returning heroes like Dr. Kent Brantly and Dr. Craig Spencer. Thank you to Dr. Tony Fauci and Nancy Sullivan and the incredible scientists at NIH, who worked long days and late nights to develop a vaccine. All of you represent what is best about America and what's possible when we lead. <p>And we're also here to mark a transition in our fight against this disease&mdash;not to declare mission accomplished, but to mark a transition. Thanks to the hard work of our nearly 3,000 troops who deployed to West Africa, logistics have been set up, Ebola treatment units have been built, over 1,500 African health workers have been trained, and volunteers around the world have gained the confidence to join the fight. We were a force multiplier. It wasn't just what we put in. It's the fact that when we put it in, people looked around and said, all right, America has got our back, so we'll come too. And as a result, more than 1,500 of our troops have been able to return. <p>Today I'm announcing that by April 30, all but 100 who will remain to help support the ongoing response, all but those hundred, will also be able to come home, not because the job is done, but because they were so effective in setting up the infrastructure that we are now equipped to deal with the job that needs to be done in West Africa, not only with a broader international coalition, but also with folks who have been trained, who are from the countries that were most at risk. <p>So I want to be very clear here: While our troops are coming home, America's work is not done, our mission is not complete. Today we move into the next phase of the fight, winding down our military response while expanding our civilian response. That starts here at home, where we're more prepared to protect Americans from infectious disease, but still have more work to do. For as long as Ebola simmers anywhere in the world, we will have some Ebola-fighting heroes who are coming back home with the disease from time to time. And that's why we're screening and monitoring all arrivals from affected countries. We've equipped more hospitals with new protective gear and protocols. We've developed partnerships with States and cities, thanks to public servants like Mayor Mike Rawlings and Judge Clay Jenkins of Dallas, Texas, who were on the front lines when the first case appeared here on our shores. <p>A few months ago, only 13 States had the capability to even test for Ebola. Today, we have more than 54 labs in 44 States. Only three facilities in the country were qualified to treat an Ebola patient. Today, we have 51 Ebola treatment centers. We have successfully treated eight Ebola patients here in the United States. And we are grateful to be joined by six of these brave survivors today, including Dr. Richard Sacra, who received world-class care at Nebraska Medical Center and a plasma donation from Dr. Kent Brantly. Then he returned to Liberia to treat non-Ebola patients who still need doctors. That's the kind of commitment and the kind of people we're dealing with here. <p>Meanwhile, in West Africa, it's true that we have led a massive global effort to combat this epidemic. We mobilized other countries to join us in making concrete, significant commitments to fight this disease and to strengthen global health systems for the long term. In addition to the work of our troops, our USAID DART teams have directed the response. Our CDC disease detectives have traced contacts. Our health care workers and scientists helped contain the outbreak. Our team is providing support for 10,000 civilian responders on the ground. <p>That's what Brett Sedgewick did. Where's Brett? There here is. [<i>Laughter</i>] So Brett went to Liberia with Global Communities, which is an NGO that partnered with us to respond to Ebola. Brett supported safe-burial teams that traveled to farflung corners of Liberia to ensure that those who lost their lives to Ebola were carefully, safely, and respectfully buried so that they could not transmit the disease to anyone else. And Brett reflects the spirit of so many volunteers when he said, \\"If you need me, just say the word.\\" That's a simple, but profound statement. <p>That's who we are: big-hearted and optimistic, reflecting the can-do spirit of the American people. That's our willingness to help those in need. They're the values of Navy Lieutenant Andrea McCoy and her team. Andrea, raise your hand so that I don't look so&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. Andrea and her team deployed some 7 tons of equipment, processed over 1,800 blood samples. They're the values that drive Commander Billy Pimentel. Where's Billy? Raise your hand. <p><i>Commander Guillermo \\"Billy\\" Pimentel, USN</i>. Here, sir. <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you, sir. [<i>Laughter</i>] Like that Navy can-do attitude. <p>He led a team of Naval microbiologists to set up mobile laboratories that can diagnose Ebola within 4 hours. And he said, \\"It has been an honor for us to use our skills to make a difference.\\" These values, American values, matter to the world. At the Monrovia Medical Unit in Liberia, built by American troops, staffed by Rear Admiral Giberson and his team from the U.S. Public Health Service Corps, a nurse's aide named Rachael Walker went in for treatment and left Ebola-free. And I want you to listen to what Rachael's sister said about all of you. \\"We were worried at first,\\" she said, \\"but when we found out [Rachael] was being transferred to the American Ebola treatment unit, we thanked God first and then we thanked America second for caring about us.\\" <p>And the Americans who she was speaking of aren't just doctors or nurses or soldiers or scientists. You're what one lieutenant commander from the U.S. Public Health Service Corps called the \\"hope multipliers.\\" And you've multiplied a lot of hope. Last fall, we saw between 800 and 1,000 new cases a week. Today, we're seeing between 100 and 150 cases a week, a drop of more than 80 percent. Liberia has seen the best progress. Sierra Leone is moving in the right direction. Guinea has the longest way left to go. <p>Our focus now is getting to zero, because as long as there is even one case of Ebola that's active out there, risks still exist. Every case is an ember that, if not contained, can light a new fire. So we're shifting our focus from fighting the epidemic to now extinguishing it. <p>The reason we can do that is because of a bipartisan majority in Congress, including some of the Members who are here today, who approved funding to power this next phase of our response. And I want to thank those Members of Congress who are here for the outstanding work that they do&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;thank you. One of them, Chris Coons, recently traveled to the region and saw firsthand that we have to continue this fight in Africa. <p>So while our troops are coming home, plenty of American heroes remain on the ground, with even more on the way. Doctors and nurses are still treating patients, CDC experts are tracking cases, NIH teams are testing vaccines, USAID workers are in the field, and countless American volunteers are on the front lines. And while I take great pride in the fact that our Government organized this effort&mdash;and I particularly want to thank Secretary Burwell and her team at Health and Human Services for the outstanding work that they did&mdash;we weren't working alone. I just had a chance to meet with some leading philanthropists who did so much and are now committed to continuing the work and finding new ways in which we can build platforms not only to finish the job with respect to Ebola, but also to be able to do a more effective surveillance, prevention, and quick response for diseases in the future. <p>Other nations have joined the fight, and we're going to keep working together, because our common security depends on all of us. That's why we launched the Global Health Security Agenda last year to bring more nations together to better prevent and detect and respond to future outbreaks before they become epidemics. This was a wakeup call and why it's going to be so important for us to learn lessons from what we've done and sustain it into the future. <p>And in the 21st century, we cannot build moats around our countries. There are no drawbridges to be pulled up. We shouldn't try. What we should do is instead make sure everybody has basic health systems, from hospitals to disease detectives, to better laboratory networks, all of which allows us to get early warnings against outbreaks of diseases. This is not charity. The investments we make overseas are in our self-interest. This is not charity. We do this because the world is interconnected, in the same way that the investments we make in NIH are not a nice-to-do, they are a must-do. We don't appreciate basic science and all these folks in lab coats until there's a real problem and we say, well, do we have a cure for that, or can we fix it? And if we haven't made those investments, if we've neglected them, then they won't be there when we need them. So as we transition into a new phase in this fight, make no mistake: America is as committed as ever, I am as committed as ever, to getting to zero. And I know we can. And I know this because of the people who stand behind me and the people out in the audience. I know this because of people like Dr. William Walters. William, you here? <p><i>Dr. William Walters.</i> Sir. <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Dr. Walters is the Director of Operational Medicine at the State Department. Last summer, he was called to help move Dr. Kent Brantly, who's here, back to the United States for treatment. And Dr. Walters says the first thing he did was to Google Dr. Brantly. [<i>Laughter</i>] A little plug for Google there. I know we got some&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. And the first picture he saw was of Kent and his family. <p>Now, remember, the decision to move Kent back to the United States was controversial. Some worried about bringing the disease to our shores. But what folks like William knew was that we had to make the decisions based not on fear, but on science. And he knew that we needed to take care of our heroes who had sacrificed so much to save the lives of others in order for us to continue to get people to make that kind of commitment. They had to know we had their backs in order for us to effectively respond. And so, as William said, \\"We do the work we do to impact something bigger than ourselves.\\" We do the work we do to impact something bigger than ourselves. <p>That's the test of American leadership. We have this extraordinary military. We have an extraordinary economy. We have unbelievable businesses. But what makes us exceptional is when there's a big challenge and we hear somebody saying it's too hard to tackle, and we come together as a nation and prove you wrong. That's true whether it's recession or war or terrorism. There are those who like to fan fears. But over the long haul, America does not succumb to fear. We master the moment with bravery and courage and selflessness and sacrifice and relentless, unbending hope. That's what these people represent. That's what's best in us. And we have to remember that, because there will be other circumstances like this in the future. <p>We had 3 weeks in which all too often we heard science being ignored and sensationalism, but you had folks like this who were steady and focused and got the job done. And we're lucky to have them, and we have to invest in them. <p>So I want to thank all of you for proving again what America can accomplish. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you. Good job.\" "
"34" "\"Thank you so much. Everybody, please have a seat. Well, good afternoon, everybody. On behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the White House. And thank you, Jake, for a moving tribute to your friend and your brother-in-arms. I think it's clear that Clay Hunt lives on in you: in your devotion to his memory and your commitment to our country. So, Jake, on behalf of all of us, but especially, I think, on behalf of Clay's family and all his friends and fellow veterans who loved him too, thanks for your extraordinary service. <p>Today we honor a young man who isn't here, but should be here. Clay Hunt was a proud Texan. As a boy, I understand, he collected turtles&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;which was ironic for a kid who, by all accounts, never sat still. [<i>Laughter</i>] He loved the outdoors; he knew every inch of his grandparents' ranch, where he fished and hunted all year long. A decorated marine, he served with distinction in Iraq and Afghanistan. He suffered physical industries&mdash;injuries that healed, and he suffered invisible wounds that stayed with him. And by all accounts, he was selfless, and he was brave. And when he died in 2011, it was a heartbreaking loss for his family, his fellow marines, and our Nation. Because Clay had already done a great deal of good in the world, and the truth is, he was just getting started. <p>So we're here today to pick up where Clay left off. The best way to honor this young man who should be here is to make sure that more veterans like him are here for all the years to come and may&mdash;able to make extraordinary contributions, building on what they've already done for our safety and our security. <p>Clay was a passionate advocate for veterans. And now, more than ever, that's something we're all called to be. After 13 years, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over, and a new generation of veterans is coming home. And like Clay, they are talented, and they are ready to roll up their sleeves and begin the next chapter of their lives: starting companies, going back to school, reentering the workforce, raising families, becoming leaders in every field. And whether they found a new path or are just starting out on their new civilian life, one thing is certain: Every single veteran in America has something extraordinary to give to this country&mdash;every single one. <p>And at the same time, too many of our troops and veterans are still struggling. They're recovering from injuries. They're mourning fallen comrades. They're trying to reconnect with family and friends who can never fully understand what they went through in war theater. For many of them, the war goes on: in the flashbacks that come rushing forward and in the nightmares that don't go away. <p>And that tension between then and now, that struggle to make the transition from war to home, is one that Clay Hunt knew all too well. In Iraq and Afghanistan, he lost good friends. After one buddy died, Clay slept in his empty bunk for a while, to stay close just a little longer. A few weeks later, another friend was fatally shot right in front of him. There was nothing Clay could do to save him, but he was still wracked with grief and guilt. And when he got home, he found it hard to sleep and hard to go football games or anywhere that was loud or crowded. Now, part of what made him remarkable was, he was able to name the problem; he understood it. Like many of our troops and veterans, Clay had posttraumatic stress. And as a country, we've been doing more to help our troops and veterans deal with injuries like posttraumatic stress. We've been doing more awareness and more outreach, and more counselors have been put in place to improve access to care. We've been doing more research and prevention&mdash;into prevention and treatment. And we've been saying loud and clear to anyone out there who's hurting: It's not a sign of weakness to ask for help, it's a sign of strength. <p>And Clay Hunt was strong that way. He asked for help. In fact, he did everything that we urge people with posttraumatic stress to do. He reached out to his family; they embraced him with love. He opened up to other veterans, and they were there for him too. He sought treatment, and not once, but repeatedly. And he channeled his stress into service. As part of Team Rubicon, as Jake described, he went to Haiti after the earthquake to help families rebuild. He refurbished bikes for injured veterans so they could join wounded warrior rides. He even appeared in a public service announcement, encouraging veterans having a tough time to reach out for help, because he knew that even though you can't see it, posttraumatic stress is an injury just like any other and the stigma has to end. <p>And Clay received care through the VA, but he struggled to get the right medication and the right disability rating. And by the time the severity of his condition was recognized, it was too late, and Clay had taken his life just weeks before. And he was 28 years old. <p>Amid unimaginable grief, Clay's family, Jake, and his fellow veterans made it their mission to spare any more families the pain they endured. So they shared Clay's story far and wide. And they reached out to Members of Congress, and they lobbied, and they testified and made personal appeals. <p>And thanks to their tireless efforts&mdash;and we are particularly grateful to Clay's family being able to transform grief into action&mdash;today I will sign the Clay Hunt SAV Act into law. And SAV stands for \\"Suicide Prevention for American Veterans.\\" It helps fill critical gaps in serving veterans with posttraumatic stress and other illnesses. It increases peer support and outreach to servicemembers transitioning to civilian life. It recruits talented psychiatry students to work at the VA after graduation. It makes it easier for veterans to find the care they need when they need it. And it includes strict accountability measures so we can track and continually improve these efforts as we learn more. <p>Now, this law is not a complete solution. We've still got a lot more work to do. Our Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Bob McDonald, is here and is doing a terrific job pushing reforms to get our veterans the care that they deserve. But one of the messages I want to make sure to deliver today, and I know that the First Lady and Jill Biden and others have been delivering this continually through their Joining Forces effort: This is not just a job for government. Every community, every American, can reach out and do more with and for our veterans. This has to be a national mission. As a nation, we should not be satisfied&mdash;will not be satisfied&mdash;until every man and woman in uniform, every veteran, gets the help that they need to stay strong and healthy. <p>And this law will not bring Clay back, as much as we wish it would. But the reforms that it puts in place would have helped. And they'll help others who are going through the same challenging process that he went through. So this is a good day, and we pay tribute to everyone who helped to make it possible. We want to thank Clay's family, especially his mom and stepfather, Susan and Richard Selke; his father and stepmother, Stacy and Dianne Hunt. You guys never stopped fighting for Clay, and for all the families who have lost sons and daughters as well. And as a Commander in Chief and as a father, I can't think of a more beautiful and special way to honor your son. So we thank you very much. <p>We want to thank Jake and all those who served with Clay, who protected him and loved him like a brother, and all the veterans service organizations that fought for this law and who advocated so passionately for those who have served. We thank all the military families who have lost a loved one, families here today who channeled their grief into helping others. They believe, as we all do, that we have to end this tragedy of suicide among our troops and veterans. <p>I want to thank the Members of Congress, Republican and Democrat, who worked to get this done. I want to give a special acknowledgement to somebody who knows a little bit about service, Senator John McCain. Dick Blumenthal, we're grateful for your efforts. Representative Jeff Miller. My homegirl from the Chicago area&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;Tammy Duckworth. Couldn't be prouder of her. And, Tim Walsh&mdash;Tim Walz, thank you so much for the great work. <p>And just to be clear about the bipartisanship here, this is one of those areas where we can't have an argument. Clay's parents are Texas Republicans. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, that's just not run-of-the-mill Republican. [<i>Laughter</i>] And they worked with this entire spectrum: conservatives, liberals. And that's just a reminder of what we can accomplish when we take a break from the partisan bickering that so often dominates this town and focus on what really matters to the American people. <p>I wish I had gotten a chance to know Clay. But in a way, I feel that I do, because there are a lot of incredible men and women all across this country who, like Clay, just love their country and want to serve. Michelle and I have had a chance to meet so many of them, and it's such an incredible privilege. <p>I think of the soldiers I sat down with at Fort Bliss a few years ago, and they told me they were proud to serve, but struggled with challenges like posttraumatic stress. They told me about the challenges they had in getting support and treatment and managing their medications, staying strong for their families and their fellow soldiers, and most of all, the challenge of asking for help, which is hard to do for folks who are used to helping others. <p>I think of Staff Sergeant Ty Carter, whom I awarded the Medal of Honor. He survived an unimaginable battle in Afghanistan and carried a badly wounded comrade to safety. As tough as they come. But he too acknowledged before the ceremony&mdash;and talked about it publicly&mdash;his struggles with posttraumatic stress. At first, he resisted even seeking help, but eventually, he reached out for the care that he needed. Today, he is transitioning to civilian life. He's started his own business, and he travels across the country as an advocate, helping veterans and other Americans turn their struggles into a source of strength. <p>I think of the college student who recently wrote me a letter on Christmas Day. This is as tough a letter as I've received since I've been President. She talked about her father, who's a retired marine, and told me about how her dad used to love to hunt and fish and spend time with her and her little brother. But gripped with posttraumatic stress, he became less and less like himself and withdrew from the family. And yet, despite these struggles, she wrote: \\"I knew that my dad was still in there somewhere. . . . He is still my father. And I am still his little girl.\\" And she was writing, she said, to ask for help&mdash;help her father find his way back&mdash;\\"not for my family, Mr. President,\\" she said. \\"I'm asking you to help the others,\\" other families like hers. And she said, \\"Don't forget about them.\\" <p>And that's really what today is about: Don't forget. So today we say again, to every person in uniform, every veteran who has ever served: We thank you for your service. We honor your sacrifice. But sometimes, talk is cheap. And sometimes, particularly at a time when we've got an All-Volunteer Force and so often we can celebrate them at a ball game, but too many are insulated from the impacts, we've got to also act. We can't just talk. <p>So we're ready to help you begin the next chapter of your lives. And if you are hurting, know this: You are not forgotten. You are not alone. You are never alone. We are here for you. America is here for you, all of us. And we will not stop doing everything in our power to get you the care and support you need to stay strong and keep serving this country we love. We need you. We need you. You make our country better. <p>So I thank all of you. God bless our troops, our veterans, our military families. God bless the United States of America. <p>And with that, I want Michelle to&mdash;and Clay's family and our other guests to join us on stage so I can sign the Clay Hunt SAV Act into law.\" "
"35" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Stanford! Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you, everybody. Have a seat, have a seat. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Yes, we can! <p><i>The President.</i> Yes, we can! [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>First of all, let me thank President Hennessy for not just the introduction, but for your outstanding leadership at one of the great universities of the world. I've got to admit, like, I kind of want to go here. [<i>Laughter</i>] I was trying to figure out why it is that a really nice place like this is wasted on young people&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;who don't fully appreciate what you've got. It's really nice. And everybody here is so friendly and smart, and it's beautiful. And what's there not to like? <p>I want to thank you and everyone at Stanford for hosting this summit, especially Amy Zegart, George Triantis, and someone who served as a great adviser to me at the White House and as an outstanding Ambassador to Russia before coming back to the \\"Farm,\\" Mike McFaul. <p>It is great to be here at Leland Stanford Junior University. And I'm pleased to be joined by members of my team who bleed Cardinal red. We're infiltrated with Stanford people. We've got Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett, National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker. And let's face it, I like Stanford grads. I noticed Steve Chu was around here, who helped lead our Energy Department for a while. And he's not a&mdash;he's now hanging out. I'm also pleased to be joined by other members of my Cabinet: Our Secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, is here, and our Small Business Administrator, Maria Contreras-Sweet. And I want to acknowledge my tireless Homeland Security Adviser, who helped, and continues to shape, our cybersecurity efforts, Lisa Monaco. Thank you, Lisa. <p>So I'd always heard about this campus, and everybody is riding bikes and people hopping into fountains&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and the current holder of the Axe. This is the place that made \\"nerd\\" cool. [<i>Laughter</i>] I was thinking about wearing some black-rimmed glasses, some tape in the middle, but I guess that's not what you do anymore. Ambassador McFaul told me if I came to Stanford, you'd \\"talk nerdy to me.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But I'm not just here to enjoy myself. As we gather here today, America is seeing incredible progress that we can all be proud of. We just had the best year of job growth since the 1990s. Over the past 59 months, our businesses have created nearly 12 million new jobs, which is the longest streak of private sector job growth on record. And in a hopeful sign for middle class families, wages are beginning to rise again. <p>And meanwhile, we're doing more to prepare our young people for a competitive world. Our high school graduation rate has hit an alltime high, and more Americans are finishing college than ever before. Here at Stanford and across the country, we've got the best universities, we've got the best scientists, the best researchers, in the world. We've got the most dynamic economy in the world. And no place represents that better than this region. So make no mistake: More than any other nation on Earth, the United States is positioned to lead in the 21st century. <p>And so much of our economic competitiveness is tied to what brings me here today, and that is America's leadership in the digital economy. It's our ability&mdash;almost unique across the planet&mdash;our ability to innovate and to learn and to discover and to create and build and do business online and stretch the boundaries of what's possible. That's what drives us. And so when we had to decide where to have this summit, the decision was easy, because so much of our Information Age began right here, at Stanford. <p>It was here where two students, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, met and then, in a garage not far from here, started a company that eventually built one of the first personal computers, weighing in at 40 pounds. [<i>Laughter</i>] It was from here, in 1968, where a researcher, Douglas Englebart, astonished an audience with two computers, connected \\"online,\\" and hypertext you could click on with something called a \\"mouse.\\" <p>A year later, a computer here received the first message from another computer 350 miles away, the beginnings of what would eventually become the Internet. And by the way, it's no secret that many of these innovations built on Government-funded research is one of the reasons that if we want to maintain our economic leadership in the world, America has to keep investing in basic research in science and technology. It's absolutely critical. <p>So here at Stanford, pioneers developed the protocols and architecture of the Internet, DSL, the first webpage in America, innovations for cloud computing. Student projects here became Yahoo and Google. Those were pretty good student projects. [<i>Laughter</i>] Your graduates have gone on to help create and build thousands of companies that have shaped our digital society, from Cisco to Sun Microsystems, YouTube to Instagram, StubHub, Bonobos. According to one study, if all the companies traced back to Stanford graduates formed their own nation, you'd be one the largest economies in the world and have a pretty good football team as well. So&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>And today, with your cutting-edge research programs and your new cyber initiatives, you're helping us navigate some of the most complicated cyber challenges that we face as a nation. And that's why we're here. I want to thank all of you who have joined us today: Members of Congress, representatives from the private sector, government, academia, privacy and consumer groups, and especially the students who are here. Now, just as we're all connected like never before, we have to work together like never before, both to seize opportunities, but also meet the challenges of this information age. <p>And it's one of the great paradoxes of our time that the very technologies that empower us to do great good can also be used to undermine us and inflict great harm. The same information technologies that help make our military the most advanced in the world are targeted by hackers from China and Russia who go after our defense contractors and systems that are built for our troops. The same social media we use in Government to advocate for democracy and human rights around the world can also be used by terrorists to spread hateful ideologies. So these cyber threats are a challenge to our national security. <p>Much of our critical infrastructure&mdash;our financial systems, our power grid, health systems&mdash;run on networks connected to the Internet, which is hugely empowering, but also dangerous and creates new points of vulnerability that we didn't have before. Foreign governments and criminals are probing these systems every single day. We only have to think of real-life examples&mdash;an air traffic control system going down and disrupting flights or blackouts that plunge cities into darkness&mdash;to imagine what a set of systematic cyber attacks might do. So this is also a matter of public safety. <p>As a nation, we do more business online than ever before: trillions of dollars a year. And high-tech industries, like those across the Valley, support millions of American jobs. All this gives us an enormous competitive advantage in the global economy. And for that very reason, American companies are being targeted, their trade secrets stolen, intellectual property ripped off. The North Korean cyber attack on Sony Pictures destroyed data and disabled thousands of computers and exposed the personal information of Sony employees. And these attacks are hurting American companies and costing American jobs. So this is also a threat to America's economic security. <p>As consumers, we do more online than ever before. We manage our bank accounts. We shop. We pay our bills. We handle our medical records. And as a country, one of our greatest resources are the young people who are here today, digitally fearless and unencumbered by convention and uninterested in old debates. And they're remaking the world every day. But it also means that this problem of how we secure this digital world is only going to increase. <p>I want more Americans succeeding in our digital world. I want young people like you to unleash the next waves of innovation and launch the next startups and give Americans the tools to create new jobs and new businesses and to expand connectivity in places that we currently can't imagine, to help open up new worlds and new experiences and empower individuals in ways that would seem unimaginable 10, 15, 20 years ago. <p>And that's why we're working to connect 99 percent of America's students to high-speed Internet, because when it comes to educating our children, we can't afford any digital divides. And it's why we're helping more communities get across to the next generation of broadband faster, with cheaper Internet, so that students and entrepreneurs and small businesses across America, not just in pockets of America, have the same opportunities to learn and compete as you do here in the Valley. It's why I've come out so strongly and publicly for net neutrality, for an open and free Internet, because we have to preserve one of the greatest engines for creativity and innovation in human history. <p>So our connectivity brings extraordinary benefits to our daily lives, but it also brings risks. And when companies get hacked, Americans' personal information, including their financial information, gets stolen. Identity theft can ruin your credit rating and turn your life upside down. In recent breaches, more than a hundred million Americans had their personal data compromised, including, in some cases, credit card information. We want our children to go online and explore the world, but we also want them to be safe and not have their privacy violated. So this is a direct threat to the economic security of American families, not just the economy overall, and to the well-being of our children, which means, we've got to put in place mechanisms to protect them. <p>So shortly after I took office, before I had gray hair&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I said that these cyber threats were one of the most serious economic national security challenges that we face as a nation, and I made confronting them a priority. And given the complexity of these threats, I believe we have to be guided by some basic principles. So let me share those with you today. <p>First, this has to be a shared mission. So much of our computer networks and critical infrastructure are in the private sector, which means government cannot do this alone. But the fact is that the private sector can't do it alone either, because it's government that often has the latest information on new threats. There's only one way to defend America from these cyber threats, and that is through government and industry working together, sharing appropriate information as true partners. <p>Second, we have to focus on our unique strengths. Government has many capabilities, but it's not appropriate or even possible for government to secure the computer networks of private businesses. Many of the companies who are here today are cutting edge, but the private sector doesn't always have the capabilities needed during a cyber attack: the situational awareness or the ability to warn other companies in real time or the capacity to coordinate a response across companies and sectors. So we're going to have to be smart and efficient and focus on what each sector does best and then do it together. <p>Third, we're going to have to constantly evolve. The first computer viruses hit personal computers in the early 1980s, and essentially, we've been in a cyber arms race ever since. We design new defenses, and then hackers and criminals design new ways to penetrate them. Whether it's phishing or botnets, spyware or malware, and now ransomware, these attacks are getting more and more sophisticated every day. So we've got to be just as fast and flexible and nimble in constantly evolving our defenses. <p>And fourth, and most importantly, in all our work we have to make sure we are protecting the privacy and civil liberty of the American people. And we grapple with these issues in government. We've pursued important reforms to make sure we are respecting peoples' privacy as well as ensuring our national security. And the private sector wrestles with this as well. When consumers share their personal information with companies, they deserve to know that it's going to be protected. When government and industry share information about cyber threats, we've got to do so in a way that safeguards your personal information. When people go online, we shouldn't have to forfeit the basic privacy that we're entitled to as Americans. <p>In recent years, we've worked to put these principles into practice. And as part of our comprehensive strategy, we've boosted our defenses in government, we're sharing more information with the private sector to help those companies defend themselves, we're working with industry to use what we call a cybersecurity framework to prevent, respond to, and recover from attacks when they happen. <p>And by the way, I recently went to the National Cybersecurity Communications Integration Center, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, where representatives from government and the private sector monitor cyber threats 24/7. And so defending against cyber threats, just like terrorism or other threats, is one more reason that we are calling on Congress not to engage in politics&mdash;this is not a Republican or a Democratic issue&mdash;but work to make sure that our security is safeguarded and that we fully fund the Department of Homeland Security, because it has great responsibilities in this area. <p>So we're making progress, and I've recently announced new actions to keep up this momentum. Now, we've called for a single national standard so Americans know within 30 days if your information has been stolen. This month, we'll be proposing legislation that we call a Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights to give Americans some baseline protections, like the right to decide what personal data companies collect from you, and the right to know how companies are using that information. We've proposed the Student Digital Privacy Act, which is modeled on the landmark law here in California, because today's amazing educational technologies should be used to teach our students and not collect data for marketing to students. <p>And we've also taken new steps to strengthen our cybersecurity, proposing new legislation to promote greater information sharing between government and the private sector, including liability protections for companies that share information about cyber threats. Now, today I'm once again calling on Congress to come together and get this done. <p>And this week, we announced the creation of our new Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center. Just like we do with terrorist threats, we're going to have a single entity that's analyzing and integrating and quickly sharing intelligence about cyber threats across Government so we can act on all those threats even faster. <p>And today we're taking an additional step&mdash;which is why there's a desk here. You were wondering, I'm sure. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm signing a new Executive order to promote even more information sharing about cyber threats, both within the private sector and between government and the private sector. And it will encourage more companies and industries to set up organizations&mdash;hubs&mdash;so you can share information with each other. It will call for a common set of standards, including protections for privacy and civil liberties, so that government can share threat information with these hubs more easily. And it can help make it easier for companies to get the classified cybersecurity threat information that they need to protect their companies. <p>I want to acknowledge, by the way, that the companies who are represented here are stepping up as well. The Cyber Threat Alliance, which includes companies like Palo Alto Networks and Symantec, are going to work with us to share more information under this new Executive order. You've got companies from Apple to Intel, from Bank of America to PG&E, who are going to use the cybersecurity framework to strengthen their own defenses. As part of our BuySecure initiative, Visa and MasterCard and American Express and others are going to make their transactions more secure. Nationstar is joining companies that are giving their companies [customers; White House correction.] another weapon to battle identity theft, and that's free access to their credit scores. <p>And more companies are moving to new, stronger technologies to authenticate user identities, like biometrics, because it's just too easy for hackers to figure out usernames and passwords, like \\"password.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Or \\"12345&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;7.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Those are some of my previous passwords. [<i>Laughter</i>] I've changed them since then. <p>So this summit is an example of what we need more of: all of us working together to do what none of us can achieve alone. And it is difficult. Some of the challenges I've described today have defied solutions for years. And I want to say very clearly that, as somebody who is a former constitutional law teacher and somebody who deeply values his privacy and his family's privacy&mdash;although, I chose the wrong job for that&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but will be a private citizen again and cares deeply about this, I have to tell you that grappling with how government protects the American people from adverse events while, at the same time, making sure that government itself is not abusing its capabilities is hard. <p>The cyber world is sort of the wild, wild West. And to some degree, we're asked to be the sheriff. When something like Sony happens, people want to know what can government do about this. If information is being shared by terrorists in the cyber world and an attack happens, people want to know are there ways of stopping that from happening. By necessity, that means government has its own significant capabilities in the cyber world. But then people, rightly, ask, well, what safeguards do we have against government intruding on our own privacy? And it's hard, and it constantly evolves because the technology so often outstrips whatever rules and structures and standards have been put in place, which means that government has to be constantly self-critical and we have to be able to have an open debate about it. <p>But we're all here today because we know that we're going to have to break through some of these barriers that are holding us back if we are going to continue to thrive in this remarkable new world. We all know what we need to do. We have to build stronger defenses and disrupt more attacks. We have to make cyberspace safer. We have to improve cooperation across the board. And by the way, this is not just here in America, but internationally, which also, by the way, makes things complicated because a lot of countries don't necessarily share our investments&mdash;or our commitment to openness, and we have to try to navigate that. <p>But this should not be an ideological issue. And that's one thing I want to emphasize: This is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. This is not a liberal or a conservative issue. Everybody is online, and everybody is vulnerable. The business leaders here want their privacy and their children protected, just like the consumer and privacy advocates here want America to keep leading the world in technology and be safe from attacks. So I'm hopeful that through this forum and the work that we do subsequently, that we're able to generate ideas and best practices and that the work of this summit can help guide our planning and execution for years to come. <p>After all, we are just getting started. Think about it. Tim Berners-Lee, from his lab in Switzerland, invented the World Wide Web in 1989, which was only 26 years ago. The great epochs in human history&mdash;the Bronze Age, Iron Age, Agricultural Revolution, Industrial Revolution&mdash;they spanned centuries. We're only 26 years into this Internet Age. We've only scratched the surface. And as I guess they say at Google, \\"The future is awesome.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] We haven't even begun to imagine the discoveries and innovations that are going to be unleashed in the decades to come. But we know how we'll get there. <p>Reflecting on his work in the 1960s on ARPANET, the precursor of the Internet, the late Paul Baran said this: \\"The process of technological developments is like building a cathedral. Over the course of several hundred years, new people come along and each lays down a block on top of the old foundations, each saying, 'I built the cathedral.' And then comes along an historian who asks, 'Well, who built the cathedral?'\\" And Baran said: \\"If you're not careful, you can con yourself into believing that you did the most important part. But the reality is that each contribution has to follow on to previous work. Everything is tied to everything else.\\" <p>Everything is tied to everything else. The innovations that first appeared on this campus all those decades ago&mdash;that first mouse, that first message&mdash;helped lay a foundation. And in the decades since, on campuses like this, in companies like those that are represented here, new people have come along, each laying down a block, one on top of the other. And when future historians ask who built this Information Age, it won't be any one of us who did the most important part alone. The answer will be, \\"We all did, as Americans.\\" <p>And I'm absolutely confident that if we keep at this, if we keep working together in a spirit of collaboration, like all those innovators before us, our work will endure, like a great cathedral, for centuries to come. And that cathedral will not just be about technology, it will be about the values that we've embedded in the architecture of this system. It will be about privacy, and it will be about community. And it will be about connection. What a magnificent cathedral that all of you have helped to build. We want to be a part of that, and we look forward to working with you in the future. Thank you for your partnership. With that, I'm going to sign this Executive order. Thank you.\" "
"36" "\"Hi, everybody. In my State of the Union Address, I laid out my ideas to help working families feel more secure and earn the skills required to advance in a world of constant change. And in a new economy that's increasingly built on knowledge and innovation, a core element of this middle class economics is how we prepare our kids for the future. <p>For decades, we threw money at education without making sure our schools were actually improving or whether we were giving teachers the tools they need or whether our taxpayer dollars were being used effectively. And our kids too often paid the price. <p>Now, over the past few years, we've seen signs that our elementary and secondary school students are doing better. Last year, our younger students earned the highest math and reading scores on record. Last week, we learned that our high school graduation rate hit a new alltime high. So this is progress. <p>But in a 21st-century economy, our kids will only do better than we did if we educate them better than we were educated. So we have to do more to make sure they graduate from school fully prepared for college and a career. <p>This year, I want to work with both parties in Congress to replace No Child Left Behind with a smarter law that addresses the overuse of standardized tests, makes a real investment in preschool, and gives every kid a fair shot in the new economy. <p>Now, it's pretty commonsense that an education bill should actually improve education. But as we speak, there's a Republican bill in Congress that frankly would do the opposite. <p>At a time when we should invest more in our kids, their plan would lock in cuts to schools for the rest of this decade. We'd end up actually investing less in our kids in 2021 than we did in 2012. At a time when we should give our teachers all the resources they need, their plan could let States and cities shuffle education dollars into things like sports stadiums or tax cuts for the wealthy. At a time when we have to give every child, everywhere, a fair shot, this Congress would actually allow States to make even deeper cuts into school districts that need the most support, send even more money to some of the wealthiest school districts in America, and turn back the clock to a time when too many students were left behind in failing schools. <p>Denying a quality education to the children of working families is as wrong as denying health care or childcare to working families. We are better than this. <p>I have a different vision for the middle class. In today's world, we have to equip all our kids with an education that prepares them for success, regardless of what they look like or how much their parents make or the zip code that they live in. <p>And that means trying new things, investing in what's working, and fixing what's not. That means cutting testing down to the bare minimum required to make sure parents and teachers know how our kids and schools are doing from year to year and relative to schools statewide. That means giving the teachers and principals who do the hard work every day the resources they need to spend less time teaching to a test and more time teaching our kids the skills they need. Some of these changes are hard. They'll require all of us to demand more of our schools and more of our kids, making sure they put down the video games and iPhones and pick up the books. They'll require us to demand that Washington treat education reform as the dedicated progress of decades, something a town with a short attention span doesn't always do very well. <p>But I'm confident we can do this. When it comes to education, we are not a collection of States competing against one another, we're a single nation competing against the world. Nothing will determine our success as a nation in the 21st century more than how well we educate our kids. And we shouldn't accept anything less than the best. <p>So thanks, everybody. And before I go, happy Valentine's Day, Michelle. <p>Have a great weekend, everybody.\" "
"37" "\"Thank you. Thank you so much. Everybody, please have a seat. <p>Well, thank you, Lisa, for the introduction. Lisa is an example of the countless dedicated public servants across our Government, a number of who are here today, who are working tirelessly every single day on behalf of the security and safety of the American people. So we very much appreciate her. And thanks to all of you for your attendance and participation in this important summit. <p>For more than 238 years, the United States of America has not just endured, but we have thrived and surmounted challenges that might have broken a lesser nation. After a terrible Civil War, we repaired our Union. We weathered a Great Depression, became the world's most dynamic economy. We fought fascism, liberated Europe. We faced down communism and won. American communities have been destroyed by earthquakes and tornadoes and fires and floods, and each time we rebuild. <p>The bombing that killed 168 people could not break Oklahoma City. On 9/11, terrorists tried to bring us to our knees; today a new tower soars above New York City, and America continues to lead throughout the world. After Americans were killed at Fort Hood and the Boston Marathon, it didn't divide us; we came together as one American family. <p>In the face of horrific acts of violence&mdash;at a Sikh temple near Milwaukee or at a Jewish community center outside Kansas City&mdash;we reaffirmed our commitment to pluralism and to freedom, repulsed by the notion that anyone should ever be targeted because of who they are or what they look like or how they worship. <p>Most recently, with the brutal murders in Chapel Hill of three young Muslim Americans, many Muslim Americans are worried and afraid. And I want to be as clear as I can be: As Americans, all faiths and backgrounds, we stand with you in your grief and we offer our love and we offer our support. <p>My point is this: As Americans, we are strong and we are resilient. And when tragedy strikes, when we take a hit, we pull together, and we draw on what's best in our character: our optimism, our commitment to each other, our commitment to our values, our respect for one another. We stand up, and we rebuild, and we recover, and we emerge stronger than before. That's who we are. <p>And I say all this because we face genuine challenges to our security today, just as we have throughout our history. Challenges to our security are not new. They didn't happen yesterday or a week ago or a year ago. We've always faced challenges. And one of those challenges is the terrorist threat from groups like Al Qaida and ISIL. But this isn't our challenge alone. It's a challenge for the world. ISIL is terrorizing the people of Syria and Iraq, beheads and burns human beings in unfathomable acts of cruelty. We've seen deadly attacks in Ottawa and Sydney and Paris and now Copenhagen. <p>And so, in the face of this challenge, we have marshalled the full force of the United States Government, and we're working with allies and partners to dismantle terrorist organizations and protect the American people. Given the complexities of the challenge and the nature of the enemy&mdash;which is not a traditional army&mdash;this work takes time and will require vigilance and resilience and perspective. But I'm confident that, just as we have for more than two centuries, we will ultimately prevail. <p>And part of what gives me that confidence is the overwhelming response of the world community to the savagery of these terrorists, not just revulsion, but a concrete commitment to work together to vanquish these organizations. <p>At the United Nations in September, I called on the international community to come together and eradicate this scourge of violent extremism. And I want to thank all of you&mdash;from across America and around the world&mdash;for answering this call. Tomorrow at the State Department, governments and civil society groups from more than 60 countries will focus on the steps that we can take as governments. And I'll also speak about how our nations have to remain relentless in our fight&mdash;our counterterrorism efforts&mdash;against groups that are plotting against our counties. <p>But we are here today because of a very specific challenge, and that's countering violent extremism, something that is not just a matter of military affairs. By \\"violent extremism,\\" we don't just mean the terrorists who are killing innocent people. We also mean the ideologies, the infrastructure of extremists&mdash;the propagandists, the recruiters, the funders&mdash;who radicalize and recruit or incite people to violence. We all know there is no one profile of a violent extremist or terrorist, so there's no way to predict who will become radicalized. Around the world and here in the United States, inexcusable acts of violence have been committed against people of different faiths, by people of different faiths, which is, of course, a betrayal of all our faiths. It's not unique to one group or to one geography or one period of time. <p>But we are here at this summit because of the urgent threat from groups like Al Qaida and ISIL. And this week, we are focused on prevention: preventing these groups from radicalizing, recruiting, or inspiring others to violence in the first place. I've called upon governments to come to the United Nations this fall with concrete steps that we can take together. And today, what I want to do is suggest several areas where I believe we can concentrate our efforts. <p>First, we have to confront squarely and honestly the twisted ideologies that these terrorist groups use to incite people to violence. Leading up to this summit, there's been a fair amount of debate in the press and among pundits about the words we use to describe and frame this challenge. So I want to be very clear about how I see it. <p>Al Qaida and ISIL and groups like it are desperate for legitimacy. They try to portray themselves as religious leaders, holy warriors in defense of Islam. That's why ISIL presumes to declare itself the \\"Islamic State.\\" And they propagate the notion that America&mdash;and the West generally&mdash;is at war with Islam. That's how they recruit. That's how they try to radicalize young people. We must never accept the premise that they put forward, because it is a lie. Nor should we grant these terrorists the religious legitimacy that they seek. They are not religious leaders, they're terrorists. And we are not at war with Islam. We are at war with people who have perverted Islam. <p>Now, just as those of us outside Muslim communities need to reject the terrorist narrative that the West and Islam are in conflict or modern life and Islam are in conflict, I also believe that Muslim communities have a responsibility as well. Al Qaida and ISIL do draw, selectively, from the Islamic texts. They do depend upon the misperception around the world that they speak in some fashion for people of the Muslim faith, that Islam is somehow inherently violent, that there is some sort of clash of civilizations. Of course, the terrorists do not speak for over a billion Muslims who reject their hateful ideology. They no more represent Islam than any madman who kills innocents in the name of God represents Christianity or Judaism or Buddhism or Hinduism. No religion is responsible for terrorism. People are responsible for violence and terrorism. <p>And to their credit, there are respected Muslim clerics and scholars not just here in the United States, but around the world who push back on this twisted interpretation of their faith. They want to make very clear what Islam stands for. And we're joined by some of these leaders today. These religious leaders and scholars preach that Islam calls for peace and for justice and tolerance toward others; that terrorism is prohibited; that the Koran says, whoever kills an innocent, it is as if he has killed all mankind. Those are the voices that represent over a billion people around the world. <p>But if we are going to effectively isolate terrorists, if we're going to address the challenge of their efforts to recruit our young people, if we're going to lift up the voices of tolerance and pluralism within the Muslim community, then we've got to acknowledge that their job is made harder by a broader narrative that does exist in many Muslim communities around the world that suggests the West is at odds with Islam in some fashion. <p>The reality, which, again, many Muslim leaders have spoken to, is, is that there's a strain of thought that doesn't embrace ISIL's tactics, doesn't embrace violence, but does buy into the notion that the Muslim world has suffered historic grievances&mdash;sometimes, that's accurate&mdash;does buy into the belief that so many of the ills in the Middle East flow from a history of colonialism or conspiracy; does buy into the idea that Islam is incompatible with modernity or tolerance or that it's been polluted by Western values. <p>And so those beliefs exist. In some communities around the world, they are widespread. And so it makes individuals&mdash;especially young people who already may be disaffected or alienated&mdash;more ripe for radicalization. And so we've got to be able to talk honestly about those issues. We've got to be much more clear about how we're rejecting certain ideas. <p>So just as leaders like myself reject the notion that terrorists like ISIL genuinely represent Islam, Muslim leaders need to do more to discredit the notion that our nations are determined to suppress Islam, that there's an inherent clash in civilizations. Everybody has to speak up very clearly that no matter what the grievance, violence against innocents doesn't defend Islam or Muslims, it damages Islam and Muslims. <p>And when all of us, together, are doing our part to reject the narratives of violent extremists, when all of us are doing our part to be very clear about the fact that there are certain universal precepts and values that need to be respected in this interconnected world, that's the beginnings of a partnership. <p>As we go forward, we need to find new ways to amplify the voices of peace and tolerance and inclusion, and we especially need to do it online. We also need to lift up the voices of those who know the hypocrisy of groups like ISIL firsthand, including former extremists. Their words speak to us today. And I know in some of the discussions, these voices have been raised: \\"I witnessed horrible crimes committed by ISIS.\\" \\"It's not a revolution or jihad . . . it's a slaughter . . . I was shocked by what I did.\\" \\"This isn't what we came for, to kill other Muslims.\\" \\"I'm 28&mdash;is this the only future I'm able to imagine?\\" That's the voice of so many who were temporarily radicalized and then saw the truth. And they've warned other young people not to make the same mistakes as they did. \\"Do not run after illusions.\\" \\"Do not be deceived.\\" \\"Do not give up your life for nothing.\\" We need to lift up those voices. And in all this work, the greatest resource are communities themselves, especially like those young people who are here today. We are joined by talented young men and women who are pioneering new innovations and new social media tools and new ways to reach young people. We're joined by leaders from the private sector, including high-tech companies, who want to support your efforts. And I want to challenge all of us to build new partnerships that unleash the talents and creativity of young people&mdash;young Muslims&mdash;not just to expose the lies of extremists, but to empower youth to service and to lift up people's lives here in America and around the world. And that can be a calling for your generation. <p>So that's the first challenge: We've got to discredit these ideologies. We have to tackle them head on. And we can't shy away from these discussions. And too often, folks are, understandably, sensitive about addressing some of these root issues, but we have to talk about them, honestly and clearly. Because&mdash;and the reason I believe we have to do so is because I'm so confident that when the truth is out, we'll be successful. <p>Now, a second challenge is, we do have to address the grievances that terrorists exploit, including economic grievances. Poverty alone does not cause a person to become a terrorist, any more than poverty alone causes somebody to become a criminal. There are millions of people&mdash;billions of people&mdash;in the world who live in abject poverty and are focused on what they can do to build up their own lives and never embrace violent ideologies. <p>Conversely, there are terrorists who've come from extraordinarily wealthy backgrounds, like Usama bin Laden. What's true, though, is that when millions of people&mdash;especially youth&mdash;are impoverished and have no hope for the future, when corruption inflicts daily humiliations on people, when there are no outlets by which people can express their concerns, resentments fester. The risk of instability and extremism grow. Where young people have no education, they are more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and radical ideas, because it's not tested against anything else; they've got nothing to weigh. And we've seen this across the Middle East and North Africa. <p>And terrorist groups are all too happy to step into a void. They offer salaries to their foot soldiers so they can support their families. Sometimes, they offer social services&mdash;schools, health clinics&mdash;to do what local governments cannot or will not do. They try to justify their violence in the name of fighting the injustice of corruption that steals from the people, even while those terrorist groups end up committing even worse abuses, like kidnapping and human trafficking. <p>So if we're going to prevent people from being susceptible to the false promises of extremism, then the international community has to offer something better. And the United States intends to do its part. We will keep promoting development and growth that is broadly shared so more people can provide for their families. We'll keep leading a global effort against corruption, because the culture of the bribe has to be replaced by good governance that doesn't favor certain groups over others. <p>Countries have to truly invest in the education and skills and job training that our extraordinary young people need. And by the way, that's boys and girls and men and women, because countries will not be truly successful if half their populations&mdash;if their girls and their women&mdash;are denied opportunity. And America will continue to forge new partnerships in entrepreneurship and innovation and science and technology so young people from Morocco to Malaysia can start new businesses and create more prosperity. Now, just as we address economic grievances, we need to face a third challenge, and that's addressing the political grievances that are exploited by terrorists. When governments oppress their people, deny human rights, stifle dissent, or marginalize ethnic and religious groups or favor certain religious groups over others, it sows the seeds of extremism and violence. It makes those communities more vulnerable to recruitment. Terrorist groups claim that change can only come through violence. And if peaceful change is impossible, that plays into extremist propaganda. <p>So the essential ingredient to real and lasting stability and progress is not less democracy, it's more democracy. It's institutions that uphold the rule of law and apply justice equally. It's security forces and police that respect human rights and treat people with dignity. It's free speech and strong civil societies where people can organize and assemble and advocate for peaceful change. It's freedom of religion where all people can practice their faith without fear and intimidation. All of this is part of countering violent extremism. <p>Fourth, we have to recognize that our best partners in all these efforts, the best people to help protect individuals from falling victim to extremist ideologies are their own communities, their own family members. We have to be honest with ourselves. Terrorist groups like Al Qaida and ISIL deliberately target their propaganda in the hopes of reaching and brainwashing young Muslims, especially those who may be disillusioned or wrestling with their identity. That's the truth. The high-quality videos, the online magazines, the use of social media, terrorist Twitter accounts&mdash;it's all designed to target today's young people online, in cyberspace. <p>And by the way, the older people here, as wise and respected as you may be, your stuff is often boring&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;compared to what they're doing. You're not connected. And as a consequence, you are not connecting. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So these terrorists are a threat, first and foremost, to the communities that they target, which means, communities have to take the lead in protecting themselves. And that is true here in America, as it's true anywhere else. When someone gets&mdash;starts getting radicalized, family and friends are often the first to see that something has changed in their personality. Teachers may notice a student becoming withdrawn or struggling with his or her identity, and if they intervene at that moment and offer support, that may make a difference. <p>Faith leaders may notice that someone is beginning to espouse violent interpretations of religion, and that's a moment for possible intervention that allows them to think about their actions and reflect on the meaning of their faith in a way that's more consistent with peace and justice. Families and friends, coworkers, neighbors, faith leaders&mdash;they want to reach out; they want to help save their loved ones and friends and prevent them from taking a wrong turn. <p>But communities don't always know the signs to look for or have the tools to intervene or know what works best. And that's where government can play a role&mdash;if government is serving as a trusted partner. And that's where we also need to be honest. I know some Muslim Americans have concerns about working with government, particularly law enforcement. And their reluctance is rooted in the objection to certain practices where Muslim Americans feel they've been unfairly targeted. <p>So in our work, we have to make sure that abuses stop, are not repeated, that we do not stigmatize entire communities. Nobody should be profiled or put under a cloud of suspicion simply because of their faith. Engagement with communities can't be a cover for surveillance. We can't \\"securitize\\" our relationship with Muslim Americans, dealing with them solely through the prism of law enforcement. Because when we do, that only reinforces suspicions, makes it harder for us to build the trust that we need to work together. <p>As part of this summit, we're announcing that we're going to increase our outreach to communities, including Muslim Americans. And we're going to step up our efforts to engage with partners and raise awareness so more communities understand how to protect their loved ones from becoming radicalized. We've got to devote more resources to these efforts. <p>And as government does more, communities are going to have to step up as well. We need to build on the pilot programs that have been discussed at this summit already&mdash;in Los Angeles, in Minneapolis, in Boston. These are partnerships that bring people together in a spirit of mutual respect and create more dialogue and more trust and more cooperation. If we're going to solve these issues, then the people who are most targeted and potentially most affected&mdash;Muslim Americans&mdash;have to have a seat at the table where they can help shape and strengthen these partnerships so that we're all working together to help communities stay safe and strong and resilient. <p>And finally, we need to do what extremists and terrorists hope we will not do, and that is, stay true to the values that define us as free and diverse societies. If extremists are peddling the notion that Western countries are hostile to Muslims, then we need to show that we welcome people of all faiths. <p>Here in America, Islam has been woven into the fabric of our country since its founding. Generations of Muslim immigrants came here and went to work as farmers and merchants and factory workers, helped to lay railroads and build up America. The first Islamic center in New York City was founded in the 1890s. America's first mosque&mdash;this was an interesting fact&mdash;was in North Dakota. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Muslim Americans protect our communities as police officers and firefighters and first responders and protect our Nation by serving in uniform and in our intelligence communities and in homeland security. And in cemeteries across our country, including at Arlington, Muslim American heroes rest in peace having given their lives in defense of all of us. <p>And of course, that's the story extremists and terrorists don't want the world to know: Muslims succeeding and thriving in America. Because when that truth is known, it exposes their propaganda as the lie that it is. It's also a story that every American must never forget, because it reminds us all that hatred and bigotry and prejudice have no place in our country. It's not just counterproductive; it doesn't just aid terrorists. It's wrong. It's contrary to who we are. <p>I'm thinking of a little girl named Sabrina who last month sent me a Valentine's Day card in the shape of a heart. It was the first Valentine I got. [<i>Laughter</i>] I got it from Sabrina before Malia and Sasha and Michelle gave me one. [<i>Laughter</i>] So she's 11 years old. She's in the fifth grade. She's a young Muslim American. And she said in her Valentine, \\"I enjoy being an American.\\" And when she grows up, she wants to be an engineer or a basketball player. [<i>Laughter</i>] Which are good choices. [<i>Laughter</i>] But she wrote: \\"I am worried about people hating Muslims. . . . If some Muslims do bad things, that doesn't mean all of them do.\\" And she asked, \\"Please tell everyone that we are good people and we're just like everyone else.\\" Now, those are the words&mdash;and the wisdom&mdash;of a little girl growing up here in America, just like my daughters are growing up here in America. \\"We are just like everybody else.\\" And everybody needs to remember that during the course of this debate. As we move forward with these challenges, we all have responsibilities; we all have hard work ahead of us on this issue. We can't paper over problems, and we're not going to solve this if we're always just trying to be politically correct. But we do have to remember that 11-year-old girl. That's our hope. That's our future. That's how we discredit violent ideologies, by making sure her voice is lifted up, making sure she's nurtured, making sure that she's supported, and then recognizing, there are little girls and boys like that all around the world; and us helping to address economic and political grievances that can be exploited by extremists and empowering local communities; and us staying true to our values as a diverse and tolerant society even when we're threatened&mdash;especially when we're threatened. <p>There will be a military component to this. There are savage cruelties going on out there that have to be stopped. ISIL is killing Muslims at a rate that is many multiples the rate that they're killing non-Muslims. Everybody has a stake in stopping them, and there will be an element of us just stopping them in their tracks with force. But to eliminate the soil out of which they grew, to make sure that we are giving a brighter future to everyone and a lasting sense of security, then we're going to have to make it clear to all of our children&mdash;including that little girl in fifth grade&mdash;that you have a place. You have a place here in America. You have a place in those countries where you live. You have a future. <p>Ultimately, those are the antidotes to violent extremism. And that's work that we're going to have to do together. It will take time. This is a generational challenge. But after 238 years, it should be obvious: America has overcome much bigger challenges, and we'll overcome the ones that we face today. We will stay united and committed to the ideals that have shaped us for more than two centuries, including the opportunity and justice and dignity of every single human being. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"38" "\"Thank you very much. Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. I want to thank John Kerry not only for his introduction, but for the outstanding leadership of American diplomacy. John is tireless. If he has not visited your country yet, he will soon. And I want to thank you and everybody here at the State Department for organizing and hosting this ministerial here today. <p>Mr. Secretary-General, distinguished guests, we are joined by representatives from governments because we all have a responsibility to ensure the security, the prosperity, and the human rights of our citizens. And we're joined by leaders of civil society, including many faith leaders, because civil society, reflecting the views and the voices of citizens, is vital to the success of any country. I thank all of you, and I welcome all of you. <p>We come together from more than 60 countries from every continent. We speak different languages, born of different races and ethnic groups, belong to different religions. We are here today because we are united against the scourge of violent extremism and terrorism. <p>As we speak, ISIL is terrorizing the people of Syria and Iraq and engaging in unspeakable cruelty: the wanton murder of children, the enslavement and rape of women, threatening religious minorities with genocide, beheading hostages. ISIL-linked terrorists murdered Egyptians in the Sinai Peninsula, and their slaughter of Egyptian Christians in Libya has shocked the world. Beyond the region, we've seen deadly attacks in Ottawa, Sydney, Paris, and now Copenhagen. <p>Elsewhere, Israelis have endured the tragedy of terrorism for decades. Pakistan's Taliban has mounted a long campaign of violence against the Pakistani people that now tragically includes the massacre of more than a hundred schoolchildren and their teachers. From Somalia, al-Shabaab terrorists have launched attacks across East Africa. In Nigeria and neighboring countries, Boko Haram kills and kidnaps men, women, and children. <p>At the United Nations in September, I called on the international community to come together and eradicate violent extremism. And I challenged countries to come to the General Assembly this fall with concrete steps that we can take together. And I'm grateful for all of you answering this call. <p>Yesterday at the White House, we welcomed community groups from the United States, and some from your countries, to focus on how we can empower communities to protect their families and friends and neighbors from violent ideologies and recruitment. And over the coming months, many of your countries will host summits to build on the work here and to prepare for the General Assembly. Today I want to suggest some areas where I believe we can focus on as governments. <p>First, we must remain unwavering in our fight against terrorist organizations. And in Afghanistan, our coalition is focused on training and assisting Afghan forces. And we'll continue to conduct counterterrorism missions against the remnants of Al Qaida in the tribal regions. When necessary, the United States will continue to take action against Al Qaida affiliates in places like Yemen and Somalia. We will continue to work with partners to help them build up their security forces so that they can prevent ungoverned spaces where terrorists find safe haven and so they can push back against groups like al-Shabaab and Boko Haram. In Iraq and Syria, our coalition of some 60 nations, including Arab nations, will not relent in our mission to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. And as a result of a separate ministerial here yesterday, many of our governments will be deepening our cooperation against foreign terrorist fighters by sharing more information and making it harder for fighters to travel to and from Syria and Iraq. <p>Related to this, and as I said at the United Nations last fall, nations need to break the cycles of conflict, especially sectarian conflict, that have become magnets for violent extremism. In Syria, Asad's war against his own people and deliberate stoking of sectarian tensions helped to fuel the rise of ISIL. And in Iraq, the failure of the previous Government to govern in an inclusive manner helped to pave the way for ISIL's gains there. <p>The Syrian civil war will only end when there is an inclusive political transition and a government that serves Syrians of all ethnicities and religions. And across the region, the terror campaigns between Sunnis and Shia will only end when major powers address their differences through dialogue and not through proxy wars. So countering violent extremism begins with political, civic, and religious leaders rejecting sectarian strife. <p>Second, we have to confront the warped ideologies espoused by terrorists like Al Qaida and ISIL, especially their attempt to use Islam to justify their violence. I discussed this at length yesterday. These terrorists are desperate for legitimacy. And all of us have a responsibility to refute the notion that groups like ISIL somehow represent Islam, because that is a falsehood that embraces the terrorist narrative. <p>At the same time, we must acknowledge that groups like Al Qaida and ISIL are deliberately targeting their propaganda to Muslim communities, particularly Muslim youth. And Muslim communities, including scholars and clerics, therefore, have a responsibility to push back not just on twisted interpretations of Islam, but also on the lie that we are somehow engaged in a clash of civilizations, that America and the West are somehow at war with Islam or seek to suppress Muslims, or that we are the cause of every ill in the Middle East. <p>That narrative sometimes extends far beyond terrorist organizations. That narrative becomes the foundation upon which terrorists build their ideology and by which they try to justify their violence. And that hurts all of us, including Islam, and especially Muslims, who are the ones most likely to be killed. <p>Obviously, there is a complicated history between the Middle East, the West. And none of us, I think, should be immune from criticism in terms of specific policies, but the notion that the West is at war with Islam is an ugly lie. And all of us, regardless of our faith, have a responsibility to reject it. <p>At the same time, former extremists have the opportunity to speak out, speak the truth about terrorist groups. And oftentimes, they can be powerful messages&mdash;messengers in debunking these terrorist ideologies. One said, \\"This wasn't what we came for, to kill other Muslims.\\" Those voices have to be amplified. <p>And governments have a role to play. At minimum, as a basic first step, countries have a responsibility to cut off funding that fuels hatred and corrupts young minds and endangers us all. We need to do more to help lift up voices of tolerance and peace, especially online. <p>That's why the United States is joining, for example, with the U.A.E. to create a new digital communications hub to work with religious and civil society and community leaders to counter terrorist propaganda. Within the U.S. Government, our efforts will be led by our new coordinator of counterterrorism communications, and I'm grateful that my envoy to the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, Rashad Hussain, has agreed to serve in this new role. So the United States will do more to help counter hateful ideologies, and today I urge your nations to join us in this urgent work. <p>Third, we must address the grievances that terrorists exploit, including economic grievances. As I said yesterday, poverty alone does not cause a person to become a terrorist, any more than poverty alone causes someone to become a criminal. There are millions, billions of people who are poor and are law abiding and peaceful and tolerant and are trying to advance their lives and the opportunities for their families. <p>But when people, especially young people, feel entirely trapped in impoverished communities, where there is no order and no path for advancement, where there are no educational opportunities, where there are no ways to support families, and no escape from injustice and the humiliations of corruption, that feeds instability and disorder and makes those communities ripe for extremist recruitment. And we have seen that across the Middle East, and we've seen it across North Africa. So if we're serious about countering violent extremism, we have to get serious about confronting these economic grievances. <p>Here at this summit, the United States will make new commitments to help young people, including in Muslim communities, to forge new collaborations in entrepreneurship and science and technology. All our nations can reaffirm our commitment to broad-based development that creates growth and jobs, not just for the few at the top, but for the many. We can step up our efforts against corruption so a person can go about their day and an entrepreneur can start a business without having to pay a bribe. <p>And as we go forward, let's commit to expanding education, including for girls; expanding opportunity, including for women. Nations will not truly succeed without the contributions of their women. This requires, by the way, wealthier countries to do more. But it also requires countries that are emerging and developing to create structures of governance and transparency so that any assistance provided actually works and reaches people. It's a two-way street. <p>Fourth, we have to address the political grievances that terrorists exploit. Again, there is not a single perfect causal link, but the link is undeniable. When people are oppressed and human rights are denied, particularly along sectarian lines or ethnic lines, when dissent is silenced, it feeds violent extremism. It creates an environment that is ripe for terrorists to exploit. When peaceful, democratic change is impossible, it feeds into the terrorist propaganda that violence is the only answer available. <p>And so we must recognize that lasting stability and real security require democracy. That means free elections, where people can choose their own future, and independent judiciaries that uphold the rule of law and police and security forces that respect human rights and free speech and freedom for civil society groups. And it means freedom of religion, because when people are free to practice their faith as they choose, it helps hold diverse societies together. <p>And finally, we have to ensure that our diverse societies truly welcome and respect people of all faiths and backgrounds, and leaders set the tone on this issue. <p>Groups like Al Qaida and ISIL peddle the lie that some of our countries are hostile to Muslims. Meanwhile, we've also seen, most recently in Europe, a rise in inexcusable acts of anti-Semitism or, in some cases, anti-Muslim sentiment or anti-immigrant sentiment. When people spew hatred towards others, because of their faith or because they are immigrants, it feeds into terrorist narratives. If entire communities feel they can never become a full part of the society in which they reside, it feeds a cycle of fear and resentment and a sense of injustice upon which extremists prey. And we can't allow cycles of suspicions to tear at the fabric of our countries. <p>So we all recognize the need for more dialogues across countries and cultures. Those efforts are indeed important. But what's most needed today, perhaps, are more dialogues within countries, not just across faiths, but also within faiths. <p>Violent extremists and terrorists thrive when people of different religions or sects pull away from each other and are able to isolate each other and label them as \\"they\\" as opposed to \\"us,\\" something separate and apart. So we need to build and bolster bridges of communication and trust. <p>Terrorists traffic in lies and stereotypes about others: other religions, other ethnic groups. So let's share the truth of our faiths with each other. Terrorists prey upon young impressionable minds. So let's bring our youth together to promote understanding and cooperation. And that's what the United States will do with our virtual exchange program, named after Ambassador Chris Stevens, to connect 1 million young people from America and the Middle East and North Africa for dialogue. Young people are taught to hate. It doesn't come naturally to them. We adults teach them. <p>I'd like to close by speaking very directly to a painful truth that's part of the challenge that brings us here today. In some of our countries, including the United States, Muslim communities are still small, in&mdash;relative to the entire population. And as a result, many people in our countries don't always know personally of somebody who is Muslim. So the image they get of Muslims or Islam is in the news. And given the existing news cycle, that can give a very distorted impression. A lot of the bad, like terrorists who claim to speak for Islam, that's absorbed by the general population. Not enough of the good, the more than 1 billion people around the world who do represent Islam and are doctors and lawyers and teachers and neighbors and friends. <p>So we have to remember these Muslim men and women: the young Palestinian working to build understanding and trust with Israelis, but also trying to give voice to her people's aspirations; the Muslim clerics working for peace with Christian pastors and priests in Nigeria and the Central African Republic to put an end to the cycle of hate; civil society leaders in Indonesia, one of the world's largest democracies; Parliamentarians in Tunisia working to build one of the world's newest democracies.; business leaders in India, with one of the world's largest Muslim populations; entrepreneurs unleashing new innovations in places like Malaysia; health workers fighting to save lives from polio and from Ebola in West Africa; and volunteers who go to disaster zones after a tsunami or after an earthquake to ease suffering and help families rebuild; Muslims who have risked their lives as human shields to protect Coptic churches in Egypt and to protect Christians attending mass in Pakistan and who have tried to protect synagogues in Syria. <p>The world hears a lot about the terrorists who attacked Charlie Hebdo in Paris, but the world has to also remember the Paris police officer, a Muslim, who died trying to stop them. The world knows about the attack on the Jews at the kosher supermarket in Paris. We need to recall the worker at that market, a Muslim who hid Jewish customers and saved their lives. And when he was asked why he did it, he said: \\"We are brothers. It's not a question of Jews or Christians or Muslims. We're all in the same boat, and we have to help each other to get out of this crisis.\\" Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for being here today. We come from different countries and different cultures and different faiths, but it is useful for us to take our wisdom from that humble worker who engaged in heroic acts under the most severe of circumstances. We are all in the same boat. We have to help each other. In this work, you will have a strong partner in me and the United States of America. <p>Thank you very much.\" "
"39" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Chicago! Everybody, have a seat. Everybody, have a seat. Settle down. Also known as Chiberia! [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yeah! <p><i>The President.</i> It is good to be home. Even, even in February. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's always been a dream of mine to be the first President to designate a national monument in subzero conditions. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to thank your outstanding principal, D'Andre Weaver for his warm hospitality&mdash;and his adorable daughter&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and wonderful wife. I had a chance to talk to D'Andre, and one of the youngest principals, maybe ever, in Chicago and has just done extraordinary work. And the students and teachers who are here, way to go, because you guys are doing great. We're so proud of you. <p>I want to recognize some other people who braved the cold to join us. Governor Bruce Rauner is here. Our Secretary of the Interior, Sally Jewell, is here. Senator Mark Kirk is here. Outstanding Members of the House of Representatives: Robin Kelly, Bobby Rush, Mike Quigley, Bob Dold. We've got our Director of the National Park Service, Jon Jarvis. And we have our mayor, Mr. Rahm Emanuel. <p>Now, before Rahm was a bigshot mayor&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;he was an essential part of my team at the White House during some very hard times for America. And I relied on his judgment every day and his smarts every day and his toughness every day. And along with many of the local leaders and Members of Congress, like Robin, who are here this afternoon, Rahm hasn't just fought for a National Park in Pullman, he's fought for new opportunity and new jobs in Pullman and for every Chicagoan, in every neighborhood, making sure every single person gets the fair shot at success that they deserve. And I could not be prouder of him and the extraordinary service that he's provided. <p>Now, it's always fun coming home. But this is special for me. This exit right over here, either 111th or 115th&mdash;depending on what was going on that day&mdash;I took that just about every day for about 3 years. I drove by this site every day on my way to Holy Rosary Church, where my first office of my first job in Chicago was, right across from the park. This was Mendel then. This is the neighborhood where I made lifelong friends. This is the area where I became a man. I learned so much about love and work and loyalty and friendship. <p>And to be able to come back here today, a place where I cut my teeth in being&mdash;getting involved in politics and organizing, a place where my mother-in-law worked at what was then Heritage/Pullman Bank, that means a lot. The only difference is, back then, in weather like this, I had to shovel out my own car&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and chip off my own ice and try to warm up the car and stay warm, because the car didn't heat up real well. And I had a pretty raggedy coat. So I travel here with a little more comfort, better transportation. [<i>Laughter</i>] But it sure brings back a lot of good memories. But I'm not here just to reminisce. <p>[<i>At this point, a child in the audience screamed.</i>] <p><i>The President. </i>Yes! [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm here because next year is the 100th birthday of the National Park Service. For a century, rangers and interpreters and volunteers and visitors have kept alive what the writer Wallace Stegner once called \\"the best idea we ever had,\\" our belief that the country's most special places should belong not just to the rich, not just to the powerful, but belong to everybody, not just now, but for all time. <p>Conservation is a truly American idea. The naturalists and industrialists and politicians who dreamt up our system of public lands and waters did so in the hope that, by keeping these places, these special places in trust&mdash;places of incomparable beauty, places where our history was written&mdash;then future generations would value those places the same way as we did. It would teach us about ourselves and keep us grounded and keep us connected to what it means to be American. And it's one of our responsibilities, as Americans, to protect this inheritance and to strengthen it for the future. <p>And that's why I've used my authority to set aside more public lands and waters than any President in history. And that's why, starting next month, we're going to encourage every American to \\"Find Your Park,\\" because chances are, there's one closer than you think. <p>And that's why, starting this fall, we're going to help a new generation of Americans experience our God-given grandeur by giving every fourth grader in America what we're calling an \\"Every Kid in a Park\\" pass: a pass good for free admission to all public lands, for you and your family, for an entire year. We want every fourth grader to have the experience of getting out and discovering America. We want them to see the outside of a classroom too, see all the places that make America great: put down the smartphone for a second, put away the video games, breathe in some fresh air, and see this incredible bounty that's been given to us. <p>No matter who you are, no matter where you live, our parks and our monuments, our lands, our waters&mdash;these places are the birthright of all Americans. <p>And today, right here in Chicago, I'm using my powers as President to announce America's three newest national monuments, places that reflect our national history and our national heritage. <p>Now, first, we're announcing a new park in my home State&mdash;before I was adopted by Illinois&mdash;my home State of Hawaii. And the Honouliuli was once an internment camp for Japanese Americans during World War II. Going forward, it's going to be a monument to a painful part of our history so that we don't repeat the mistakes of the past. <p>Then there's Browns Canyon, Colorado, which is an outdoor paradise with world-class fishing, rafting, hiking, wildlife. And from now on, it will be protected so that future generations can enjoy this land without threatening the things that make it so special. <p>And there's a reason why we're here on the South Side, right next to the neighborhood known as Pullman. It's not as warm as it is in Hawaii, and the views aren't as spectacular as in Colorado. But what makes Pullman special is the role it's played in our history. And the mayor talked a little bit about this. This place has been a milestone in our journey toward a more perfect Union. <p>More than 150 years ago, a carpenter named George Pullman moved to Chicago from New York. And he didn't start out with much, but he built his railway car company into one of the largest of its day. And as part of his empire, he built an entire town from scratch. George Pullman wasn't just the namesake of the place where his workers lived, he was also their boss and their landlord and their mayor and their superintendent and their sheriff. <p>Now, Pullman lived out America's promise. An extraordinary entrepreneur, he lived out the notion that each of us deserves the chance to transcend circumstances of our birth and make of our lives what we will. But for all his success, Mr. Pullman and the other tycoons of that period, the Gilded Age, they weren't always that keen about making sure their workers were able to live out the same promise. <p>So in 1893, a recession struck America. Pullman slashed his workers' pay; some saw their wages fall dramatically. Pullman didn't take a pay cut himself, and he didn't lower the rents in his company town. So his workers organized for better pay and better working and living conditions. A strike started here in Pullman, and it spread across the country. Federal troops were called to restore order. And in the end, more than 30 workers were killed. <p>Eventually, they returned to their jobs. But the idea they had sparked, the idea of organizing and collectively bargaining, couldn't be silenced. [<i>Applause</i>] Could not be silenced. And so just 6 days after the strike ended, an act of Congress established Labor Day, a day to honor working men and women of America. And gradually, our country would add protections that we now take for granted: a 40-hour work week, the weekend, overtime pay, safe workplace conditions, and the right to organize for higher wages and better opportunities. <p>So this site is at the heart of what would become America's labor movement and, as a consequence, at the heart of what would become America's middle class. And bit by bit, we expanded this country's promise to more Americans. But too many still lived on the margins of that dream. <p>The White workers who built Pullman's rail cars won new rights. But those rights were not extended to the Black porters who worked on these cars: the former slaves and sons and grandsons who made beds and carried luggage and folded sheets and shined shoes. And they worked as many as 20 hours a day on less than 3 hours sleep just for a couple dollars a day. Porters who asked for a living wage, porters who asked for better hours or better working conditions were told they were lucky to have a job at all. If they continued to demand better conditions, they were fired. It seemed hopeless to try and change the status quo. <p>But a few brave men and women saw things differently. And one summer night in 1925, porters packed a hall in Harlem, and a young man there named A. Philip Randolph led the meeting. And what A. Philip Randolph said was, \\"What this is about,\\" he said, \\"is making you master of your economic fate.\\" Making you master of your economic fate. And so he and others organized the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters around the strategy that he would employ throughout his life: \\"If you stand firm and hold your ground, in the long run, you'll win.\\" <p>Now, that was easier said than done. Over the years, Brotherhood leaders and supporters were fired; they were harassed. But true to A. Philip Randolph's call, they stood firm, they held their ground. And 12 years to the day after A. Philip Randolph spoke in that hall in Harlem, they won, and Pullman became the first large company in America to recognize a union of Black workers. <p>And this was one of the first great victories in what would become the civil rights movement. It wouldn't be the last victory. It was his union that allowed A. Philip Randolph to pressure President Roosevelt to desegregate the defense industry. It was those Pullman porters who gave the base by which A. Philip Randolph could convince President Truman to desegregate the Armed Forces. It was those porters who helped lead the Montgomery Bus Boycott, who were the central organizers of the March on Washington. <p>And on the day of that historic march, under the shadow of the President who had freed the slaves, A. Philip Randolph, who was now about 40 years older, a little grayer, but still standing just as firm&mdash;it was A. Philip Randolph who was the first to speak at that March on Washington. \\"We are the advanced guard,\\" he said, \\"of a massive, moral revolution for jobs and freedom.\\" <p>\\"A massive, moral revolution for jobs and freedom.\\" And that's not just the story of a movement, that's the story of America. Because as Americans, we believe that workers' rights are civil rights. That dignity and opportunity aren't just gifts to be handed down by a generous government or by a generous employer, they are rights given by God, as undeniable and worth protecting as the Grand Canyon or the Great Smoky Mountains. <p>And that's why, throughout our history, we've marched not only for jobs, but also for justice, not just for the absence of oppression, but for the presence of opportunity. And ultimately, that wasn't just for African Americans any more than the original Pullman union was just for White workers. Eventually, that principle would be embraced on behalf of women and Latinos and Native Americans; for Catholics and Jews and Muslims; for LGBT Americans; for Americans with mental and physical disabilities. That's the idea that was embodied right here. <p>That's why we've acted to give our citizens a measure of protection from the cruelties of fate with Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid and, yes, the Affordable Care Act, things that we now take for granted or we will take for granted someday. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's why we keep fighting to give every citizen a fair shot with schools and colleges and the Internet, tools we need in order to go as far as our efforts will take us, tools that the young people here are going to need so that they then can lead this great country of ours. <p>It's why we keep fighting to help working families feel more secure in a constantly changing world with childcare and equal pay, a higher minimum wage, and paid sick days&mdash;something I know that's on the ballot here in Chicago. It's why we have to keep fighting to treat these issues like the economic priorities they are. But they're also ideas of&mdash;about justice and fairness and the worth of every individual. <p>That's the story of this place: that, together, we can do great things that we cannot accomplish alone. That's why today I'm designating Chicago's Pullman District as America's newest national monument. I want this younger generation, I want future generations, to come learn about their past. Because I guarantee you, there are a lot of young people right here in Chicago, just a few blocks away, living in this neighborhood who may not know that history. <p>I want future generations to know that while the Pullman porters helped push forward our rights to vote and to work and to live as equals, their legacy goes beyond even that: that these men and women without rank, without wealth or title, became the bedrock of a new middle class; these men and women gave their children and grandchildren opportunities they never had. <p>Here in Chicago, one of those porters' great-granddaughter had the chance to go to a great college and a great law school and had the chance to work for the mayor and had the chance to climb the ladder of success and serve as a leader in some of our city's most important institutions. And I know that because today she's the First Lady of the United States of America, Michelle Obama. So without this place, Michelle wouldn't be where she was. There's a reason why I've got one of the original copies of the program for the March on Washington, a march for jobs and justice, with A. Philip Randolph's name right there as the first speaker, framed in my office. Because without Pullman, I might not be there. Of course, without Michelle, I'd definitely not be there. [<i>Laughter</i>] Whoever she married would be there. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So to the young people here today, that's what I hope you take away from this place. It is right that we think of our national monuments as these amazing vistas and mountains and rivers. But part of what we're preserving here is also history. It's also understanding that places that look ordinary are nothing but extraordinary. The places you live are extraordinary, which means you can be extraordinary. You can make something happen, the same way these workers here at Pullman made something happen. <p>That's not to tell you that life is always going to be fair or even that America will always live up to its ideals. But it is to teach us that no matter who you are, you stand on the shoulder of giants. You stand on the site of great historic movements. And that means you can initiate great historic movements by your own actions. <p>Generations before you fought and sacrificed, and some lost their jobs and some lost their lives to give you a better chance to be what A. Philip Randolph called the master of your fate. And I think all they'd ask for in return is that you take advantage of that, and when your time comes, you'll fight just as hard to give somebody else that chance. <p>Because for all the progress that we've made&mdash;and we have made a lot of progress&mdash;our moral revolution is unfinished. And it's up to each of us to protect that promise of America and expand that promise of opportunity for all people. That long march has never been easy. This place, historic Pullman, teaches us we have to keep standing firm and together. That's the story of who we are. That's the story of our past. And I have no doubt that we will pass the torch from generation to generation so that it is the story of our future as well. <p>So thank you, everybody. Thank you, Chicago. Thank you, Pullman. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"40" "\"Hello, everybody! It is great to see all of you here on a phone bank. And I just want to first of all say Rahm Emanuel and Will Burns&mdash;where did Will go? Where is Will? Will, come on over here. <p>The reason I want to say something about Will is because it wasn't that long ago when Will was doing what you all are doing. He didn't have a fancy suit and pinstripes. [<i>Laughter</i>] And our office was a little smaller than this, and things were a little more raggedy and less organized. But when you see somebody who worked with you as a young person and then coming up and doing great things now as an alderman, we could not be prouder. And I would expect that he's going to do fine in my ward, because he's my own&mdash;and I hope my trees are being trimmed. [<i>Laughter</i>] Although, not right now, I guess. It's a little cold. <p>But the main reason I'm here is just to say thank you to all of you who are helping out Rahm. Rahm Emanuel is somebody who cares deeply about this city. He cares deeply about the children of this city. He's been willing to make some really hard decisions on behalf of those children and on behalf of our future. Everybody knows that he is passionate and he is tough and he is dogged in making sure that the city of Chicago is not just the coldest city&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but also the greatest city. <p>And you look at what's been accomplished in education, what's been accomplished in terms of the infrastructure, bringing jobs back to this city, I have confidence as a voter, and as a resident of Chicago, that he's going to continue to do a great job. <p>But the only way that happens is if people get out there and vote. So all of you are critical to the process. Those of us standing here, we benefit from your willingness to be involved and participate in this great civic exercise we call democracy. And you're doing it on behalf of not only a great mayor, but also a great friend of mine. I couldn't be prouder. I'm glad he's my mayor, and I'm glad he's going to be my mayor for another 4 years. <p>Keep on making calls! Don't stop! Don't stop!\" "
"41" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Democrats! Good to see all of you. Good to see you. This looks like a rowdy crowd. I think Donna got you all&mdash;you know, you always got to watch out for Donna. She's&mdash;she'll get you in trouble. <p>Everybody, have a seat. Have a seat. Have a seat. <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you, Obama! <p><i>The President.</i> Oh, I love you back. Good to see you. <p>I want to thank Debbie Wasserman Schultz for being an outstanding chair of our party. She is a great partner. I want to thank our CEO, Amy Dacey, for the hard work she is doing day in and day out. To the Governors and the legislators and the mayors, State party leaders, DNC members, officers, and whoever else is here&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;young Democrats&mdash;I am thrilled to be with you. <p>Most importantly, thank you to every American in all 50 States who helps our party thrive at the grassroots level every single day. Because that's part of who we are&mdash;grassroots. <p>It's been about a year since our last meeting, and as I had indicated, as I had predicted, it was a breakthrough year for America. Last year, our economy created more than 3 million new jobs, the single best year for job growth since the 1990s. Over the past 5 years, as said, the longest stretch of private-sector job creation in American history, businesses adding nearly 12 million new jobs. And in perhaps the single most hopeful sign for middle class families in a very long time, wages are beginning to rise again. <p>So America is coming back. We've risen from recession. We have the capacity to write our own future. We're better positioned than any other nation on Earth. And all that is thanks to the hard work and sacrifice of the American people who we serve. But it's also thanks to the values and the policies at the core of this party that all of you have fought for. <p>As Democrats, we believe in giving every child a world-class education. And today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record. Our high school graduation rate is at an alltime high. More Americans are graduating from college than ever before. <p>As Democrats, we believe in reducing our dependence on foreign oil and protecting our planet. Today, America is number one in oil, number one in gas, number one in wind power. Every 3 weeks, we bring on line as much solar power as we did in the entire year of 2008. And thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family should save about 750 bucks at the pump. <p>As Democrats, we believe in sensible rules that can prevent financial crisis and shield families from ruin and encourage fair competition. And today, we've got new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts, a new consumer watchdog to protect families from predatory lending, new law to protect families from getting ripped off by credit card companies. We've extended the security and fundamental right to affordable, accessible health care to more than 10 million uninsured Americans. And we are counting. Each and every day, folks are signing up and benefiting because of what we fought for. [<i>Applause</i>] Because of what we fought for. Because of what you fought for. <p>Now, sometimes, because the news cycle is so quick, we forget how all this came about and the debates that we had last year or 2 years or 4 years or 6 years ago. I just want everybody to remember that at every step as we made policies, as we made this progress, we were told by our good friends, the Republicans&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that our actions would crush jobs and explode deficits and destroy the country. I mean, I want everybody to do a fact-check&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and go back to 2009, 2010, '11, '12, '13&mdash;just go back and look at the statements that were made each year by these folks about all these policies. Because apparently, they don't remember. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But the facts are before us. The economy kept growing. The stock market has more than doubled, restoring the ten&mdash;the 401(k)s of millions of people. Our deficits are down by two-thirds. I always find it curious that when a Democrat is President, deficits go down; Republican is President, and then, deficits are going up. And yet they try to take on the mantle of fiscal probity. <p>Our auto industry is firing on all cylinders. None of this is an accident. It's not an accident that America is creating jobs faster than at any time since the last time a Democrat was President. It's not an accident that our manufacturers are creating jobs for the first time since the last time a Democrat was President. It's not an accident that health care inflation is running at the lowest rate in almost 50 years and that our deficits are falling faster than they have in 60 years. <p><i>Audience member.</i> I love you, Obama! <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>It's because we believe in middle class economics. We believe in the idea that this country does best when everybody gets a fair shot, everybody is doing their fair share, everybody has to play by the same rules. Not top-down economics. Not trickle-down economics. If we were actually to look at the evidence, it's pretty clear whose theory of how to grow the economy and make sure American people are prospering&mdash;which theory works. We know their ideas don't work. We remember. Middle class economics, that works. Expanding opportunity, that works. <p>Now, I say all this not to be complacent, but precisely because we've got more work to do. Our job is not done. We still have a lot of progress to make to ensure that prosperity reaches everybody who goes to work early or studying late into the night, who's scrimping and saving from every paycheck to try to send their kids to college or try to retire with dignity and respect. <p>Everybody who has the privilege of serving the American people has to ask him- or herself a fundamental question: Are we going to accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well, or will we build an economy that generates rising incomes and opportunities for everybody who's willing to work hard, everybody who's willing to make an effort? That's the question that we face at this moment. <p>And now that their grand predictions of doom and gloom and death panels and Armageddon haven't come true&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;the sky hasn't fallen, Chicken Little is quiet&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;the new plan, apparently, of congressional Republicans&mdash;and this is progress&mdash;the new plan is to rebrand themselves as the party of the middle class. I'm not making this up. [<i>Laughter</i>] Our Republican leader in the Senate, as he was coming in, after having tried to block every single thing that we have done to strengthen the economy, starts looking at the job numbers and says, you know, it's getting better because we just got elected&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and people are feeling more optimistic. Which&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;okay. I didn't know that's how the economy worked. But maybe? [<i>Laughter</i>] We'll call some economists. <p>We have a Republican Congresswoman who said she couldn't agree with me more that we need to be helping working moms and dads. That's good. That's progress. One Republican Senator wrote a policy memo saying that Republicans \\"must define themselves as the party of the American worker and the party of higher wages.\\" That's good. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm glad they feel that way. Rand Paul said&mdash;Rand is an interesting guy, and Rand&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;no, he is. And Rand Paul said the Republican Party needs to show up on the South Side of Chicago and shout at the top of its lungs that, \\"The GOP is the ticket to the middle class.\\" I think that's encouraging that he wants to go to the South Side of Chicago. [<i>Laughter</i>] I want&mdash;no, I want all&mdash;I want parties to compete everywhere. I think that's a good thing. <p>And I was just home on the South Side of Chicago yesterday. And I guarantee you that Senator Paul would be welcomed there. We are a friendly bunch. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, it's a little strange if people show up and just start shouting at the top of their lungs&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but we're friendly, and it would be okay. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I will say this. So I am encouraged that they're speaking about middle class and speaking about wages. But there is this old saying that you can't just talk the talk. Donna, you got to do what? <p><i>Democratic National Committee Vice Chair of Voter Registration and Participation Donna L. Brazile.</i> Walk the walk. <p><i>The President.</i> You got to walk the walk. We've been walking the walk. And if Republicans are serious about taking on the specific challenges that face the middle class, if they are prepared to walk the walk, we should welcome them. I'll welcome their ideas. There's nothing I'd like more than an opposition party that is willing to engage with us and work with us on these issues. <p>Maybe they've got different ideas, but genuine ideas about how young people can go to college or how we can make sure that workers are getting raises when the CEO of the company has seen their compensation go up 50 percent or 100 percent. If they've got concrete ideas on these issues, I want to hear them. I've been saying that to them since I came into office. But so far, at least, the rhetoric has not matched the reality. <p>If you want to help working moms and dads, you can't just dismiss things like childcare and paid leave. Work with us to treat them like the economic priorities that working families know they are. <p>If you want to be the party of higher wages, come on, join the dozens of cities and States, the companies like the Gap and now Walmart, raising wages, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it's good for business. Don't stand in the way. You've got votes in Congress. You've got votes in the House. You've got votes in the Senate. Work with us. Join the rest of the country. Give America a raise! Let's go. [<i>Applause</i>] Let's go. Let's go! I'm ready. I'm ready! <p>If you are serious, if you're really troubled with income inequality, then you can't put forward proposals that give more tax breaks to the folks who are doing the best and millionaires and billionaires and then propose more cuts to the very programs that help working Americans get ahead. If you want to be the party that's paving the way for people to get into the middle class, a good way to start is stop trying to strip health insurance from millions of Americans and preventive and contraceptive care for millions of women. And stop trying to deport millions of striving young kids who just want to earn their shot at the American Dream like the rest of us. Help us fix a broken immigration system. There are a lot of ways to help the middle class. <p>So look, I think the shift in rhetoric that they're engaging in is good if it actually leads them to take different actions. If it doesn't, then it's just spin. If it doesn't, if you're just trying to repackage the same top-down economics and use the words \\"middle class\\" attached to it, if you're just going to keep on cutting taxes at the top and not raise minimum wages for folks who are struggling, then it's just spin. You're trying to bamboozle folks. <p>And looking backward is not the answer. We've got to look forward, all of us as Americans. And, Democrats, we've got to be the party that recognizes and responds to what Americans really face in a 21st-century economy. Our brand of middle class economics is very specific. We detail it: Here's what we're going to do. We can show you how it's going to help middle class families and folks striving to get in the middle class. We want to offer young people a stronger start. We want to work to make sure that families have more security in a world of constant change. And so we list out how we're going to help folks afford college. We specify how we're going to provide health insurance to folks who don't have it. We talk about how we can help the young family buy a home or the family entering into the middle age&mdash;a retirement that they can count on. <p>And that means we have to stop treating things like childcare and paid leave as side issues or women's issues. We've got to treat them as economic priorities. It means we've got to stand up for unions. It means that we've got to make sure that women are earning what men do for doing the same job. It means we support a fair living wage. We're very specific about how we want to help ordinary folks. <p>When we talk about helping people earn higher wages and better skills, we put forward specific programs: Here's more opportunities for job training. Here are apprenticeship programs that give workers the chance to earn higher paying jobs even if they don't have a higher education. Here's how we are going to help Americans burdened with student loans reduce their monthly payments. Here's how we're going to make community college free for every responsible student who wants to improve their lot in life. <p>Here's our program. What's yours? Tell us how you're helping middle class families, because we've got an agenda, and we know it works. Don't just talk about it. <p>We know middle class economics means we've got to have the most competitive economy in the world. So we're very clear: Here's how we're going to help businesses churn out good jobs for Americans to fill. And that means working to build a modern transportation and communications system. It means helping more companies sell goods overseas with strong new trade agreements that aren't just free, but fair, and level the playing field for American workers. It means investing in the research and technology that unleashes new jobs and new industries right here in America. We're very clear and specific&mdash;it's right there&mdash;about how we can do it. And we know it works because we've seen it work before. <p>We know middle class economics means getting rid of special interest giveaways in our Tax Code for folks who don't need them so we can actually give tax breaks to middle class families who do need them. We know that if we close loopholes that reward companies that stash profits overseas, we can reward companies that invest here in America. We know that if we close loopholes that allow the top 1 percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth, we can use that money to help more middle class families pay for childcare and send their kids to college, and that will help the entire economy grow. We need a Tax Code that helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in this new economy, and that's worth fighting for. <p>And so we don't just talk the talk, we're walking the walk every day. I'm telling you, Democrats, we should never worry about fighting for these issues, because they are not only right, the American people stand right beside us on most of those issues. That&mdash;sometimes, that gets lost with all the money that's being spent by outside forces, the distortions and confusion. But when you actually look at do Americans agree with our policies, do they think these policies would help them, and when there's a fair presentation of the policies the other side is offering, the American people are with us every time. <p>But maybe we'll bring them around. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I think there are actual places where we can work together, like reforming America's criminal justice system so it protects and serves all of us and it is fair. And I'm looking forward to working with them. But until they start wanting to walk and not just talk, we're going to keep offering the American people something better. We're going to offer the American people a vision that believes in opportunity not just for a few, but for everybody. <p>We've got to be the party that believes nobody should be treated like a second-class person regardless of what you look like or where you come from or who you love. We've got to be the party that doesn't just recognize the threat of climate change, but actually does something about it for the sake of our kids. We're the party that's willing to make tough decisions. <p>We've got to be the party that practices a better kind of politics, not just in Washington, but in every community in America, and that appeals to the basic decency of the American people; that sees our differences as a source of strength; that give young people a sense of purpose and possibility and asks them to participate in our great democracy; that appeals not to fear, but to hope. <p>Because this is not just about us in this room. This is not just a sports contest. This is not just about who's up and down at any given point. It's not about notches on a belt. It's not about ideological battles or proving how smart you are. It's not about the back-and-forth of politics. It's about doing things that make people's lives better. It's about doing things that make us confident that America will continue on this upward trajectory that began so many years ago. It's about making this Nation we love more perfect. <p>We are Democrats. We don't just want people to share in America's success, we want to see everybody contributing to America's success and building a smarter and stronger economy, forging a better and kinder society and writing the next great chapter in this great country's amazing story. That's what we're doing together, still moving forward. <p>Thank you, Democrats. God bless you. God bless America. Let's get to work.\" "
"42" "\"<i>The President.</i> Well, I want to welcome the Democratic Governors to this meeting and thank them for all the outstanding work that they are doing. I am a little concerned that David Ige of Hawaii does not know what to do with this weather. [<i>Laughter</i>] I don't even know if he owns a winter coat. <p><i>Governor David Y. Ige of Hawaii.</i> I bought one in Colorado. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> But this gives me a chance to have an ongoing conversation with Governors. I've said in the past, and it continues to be true: Governors can't afford to just peddle an ideology, they've got to actually make things work on behalf of their constituencies. And this is where a lot of the rubber hits the road. <p>And the men and women around this table are doing some great work on the issues that are of uppermost priority to this administration. That is, making sure that we've got a strong brand of middle class economics, that we are giving opportunity for people who are working hard out there to succeed, and make sure that their wages and their retirement and their health care and the education for their kids&mdash;that those things are available and providing them pathways to be able to improve their lives. <p>We have made enormous progress over the last 6 years. As I've said before, last year, we saw the strongest job growth since the 1990s. We've had 59 straight months of uninterrupted private sector job growth, and manufacturing is stronger than it's been since the nineties. So we're seeing steady improvement in the economy. But we've got a lot more work to do. And every one of the Governors here would acknowledge that there are still people who are not being reached by the progress that's been made and that we've got to really tackle some of these issues. <p>We've got to make sure that we are providing the kind of job training that people need to fill the jobs of the future. We've got to make sure that education is affordable and that we're using, not only our 4-year colleges and universities, but also our community colleges, which is why I'm going to be talking to them about how we can promote this notion of the first 2 years of college&mdash;community college&mdash;free for kids who are willing to earn it. <p>We need to make sure that workers are getting paid a fair wage. And I want to congratulate a number of the people around this room that either have already been able to pass a strong minimum wage in their State or are in the process of doing so and are advocating for it in the future. <p>I know there are others around this table who are advancing an agenda for paid sick leave. We've got 43 million people in this country, if they get sick, they've got to make a decision about whether they go to work sick, which is probably not very good for their coworkers or their employers or losing their paycheck, something that they probably can't afford. And so whether it's the work that's being done by Governor Malloy, when it comes to being the first in the State to mandate paid leave, Governor Inslee fighting to do the same, Governor Shumlin signing a law to raise Vermont's minimum wage, others like newly elected Governor Raimondo, working to increase the minimum wage in Rhode Island, we're seeing a lot of great work being done around this table. And we're also going to be talking about some issues of national importance where we've had real leadership at the State level: clean energy, for example. Obviously, Governor Hickenlooper in Colorado has been doing a lot of work on those issues. We care about climate change, and we don't think it contradicts our need to also continually grow the economy and be energy independent. <p>So I want to thank everybody here. I'm looking forward to a great conversation. And all these folks are also then going to be putting on their dancing shoes, I think, on Sunday&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;when we have a chance to get all the Governors together for a little fellowship. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"43" "\"Hi, everybody. At a moment when our businesses are creating jobs at the fastest pace since the 1990s, we've still got to do everything we can to help workers and businesses succeed in the new economy, one that's competitive, connected, and changing every day. <p>One thing we know for certain about businesses in the 21st century is that they'll need to sell more goods and services made in America to the rest of the world. Now, our businesses already sell goods and services in other countries at record levels. Our farmers, our factory workers, and our small businesses are exporting more than ever before, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages. <p>More small businesses are using the Internet to grow their business by reaching new customers they couldn't reach before too. As an example, 9 in 10 American small businesses that use eBay as a platform to sell their products are exporters, with customers in more than 30 different countries on average. But there's a lot of room for growth. After all, 95 percent of the world's potential customers live outside our borders. <p>Many of them live in the Asia-Pacific, the world's fastest growing region. And as we speak, China is trying to write the rules for trade in the 21st century. That would put our workers and our businesses at a massive disadvantage. We can't let that happen. <p>We should write those rules. That's why Congress should act on something called trade promotion authority. This is bipartisan legislation that would protect American workers and promote American businesses with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren't just free, but are fair. It would level the playing field for American workers. It would hold all countries to the same high labor and environmental standards to which we hold ourselves. <p>Now, I'm the first to admit that past trade deals haven't always lived up to the hype. And that's why we've successfully gone after countries that break the rules at our workers' expense. But that doesn't mean we should close ourselves off from new opportunities and sit on the sidelines while other countries write our future for us. We should seize those opportunities. We should make sure the future is written by us. And if we do, we won't just keep creating good new jobs for decades to come, we'll make sure that this century is another all-American century. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"44" "\"<i>The President.</i> It's wonderful to see you all here tonight. Harry Truman once called the Presidency an \\"enlarged Governorship.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Of course, a few of you are hoping that he was right. [<i>Laughter</i>] But Michelle and I are thrilled to host our Nation's Governors and your loved ones here tonight. If it's your first visit, then welcome to the White House. We promise a good time. The only thing we can't conjure up from the past is Governor Schwarzenegger on the dance floor. [<i>Laughter</i>] And it was something. <p>We are glad that the weather held up after yesterday's storm. And we've been thinking about you Governors from New England and everything that your citizens have been through this winter. I want to make sure we're working with each other to get what you need. It is a good thing that you are not coming on a snowstorm like there was during the dinner of 1987. Now, hours into the dinner, the food was gone. Everybody was standing around. The snow seemed to keep falling harder and harder. And President Reagan looked out the window and turned to the First Lady and said, \\"Honey, do we have enough cots?\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] To which Nancy replied, \\"We have a few spare bedrooms.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But it looks like the weather has cleared up enough that there will not be a pajama party here in the Blue Room tonight. [<i>Laughter</i>] We are looking forward, though, to spending time with one another in fellowship and good food and good entertainment, and undoubtedly, we'll find that we have more in common than sometimes is assumed. And I&mdash;hopefully, that will inform the business that we do together tomorrow. <p>Our economy keeps improving. And I hope that we can seize on that momentum to keep improving the circumstances for every one of our citizens: keep building a country where every citizen can look around and see cause for optimism about the future, not only for themselves, but also for their children and their grandchildren; feel good about their own prospects and the country's prospects. <p>Within this room, we're not going to agree on everything, but I am committed to working with each and every one of you over the next 2 years to keep making progress. And we'll talk more about that tomorrow. Tonight I just want to express my appreciation to all of you, all of the hard work that you bring to bear. And I want to say thank you to the spouses as well, because I know that's a particularly difficult job, trying to keep us in line. <p>So let me propose a toast: To our citizens, to our spouses, to our families, and to what Thomas Jefferson once described as our country's precious blessings, \\"its soil, its climate, its equality, liberty, laws, people, and manners . . . which no other people on Earth enjoy.\\" <p>Cheers. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Cheers.\" "
"45" "\"Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you so much. Everybody, have a seat. Welcome to the White House once again. The only thing more glamorous than a black-tie dinner with Hall and Oates is a Q&A with Obama and Biden. [<i>Laughter</i>] So we save the best for last. I know you guys are excited. <p>I want to thank everybody for being here. I'm going to be very brief. As Joe said, last year was a breakthrough year for the United States. Last year, the economy created more than 3 million new jobs, and that's the best job growth in any single year since the 1990s. The same was true for manufacturing growth. In fact, manufacturing jobs grew even faster than the overall economy. Deficit cut by two-thirds. Energy production at an alltime high. All told, businesses have now created over 12 million jobs over the last 5 years. And the best news of all: Wages have started to go up. <p>So America is as well positioned as we've been in a very long time. And the question is, what kind of choices do we now make together to make sure that that momentum is sustained? I have talked about before, and I want to emphasize again during our conversations, the belief that middle class economics is what works: the idea that not only do we want the country as a whole to prosper, but we want to make sure that every single person in this country has opportunity; that if they work hard, they can get ahead; that prosperity is broadly shared; and not only is everybody sharing in that prosperity, but everybody is contributing to that prosperity. And in order to do that, we got to make sure that everybody has got a fair shot, that everybody does their fair share, and everybody is playing by the same set of rules. We've got to make sure that anybody out there who is scrimping and saving and trying to figure out how to send their kids to college and worrying about retirement, that they've got some sense of security and some sense that they can make it. <p>As Joe indicated, I think every one of the Governors here in every one the States of this great Union of ours cares about these same things and is doing a lot of creative work to enhance the opportunities for advancement for their citizens. You've got States like Oklahoma that are leading the way in making sure that we're educating our children at the earliest age with high-quality early childhood and pre-K education. <p>Since nine&mdash;2013, 17 States have joined companies like the Gap and now Walmart to raise their minimum wage, make sure that some of the hardest working people in America are able to support their families if they're working full time. States are leading the way in removing unnecessary licensing requirements so workers can start filling up some of the jobs that they already have the skills for. You've got States like California that are leading the way in providing paid leave so that mom or dad can take a day off to care for a sick child or an aging parent without having to give up a paycheck. <p>And States are leading the way in making sure more people have the security of health insurance. And today, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, more than 10 million Americans now have the peace of mind that comes with being covered. I want to thank all the Governors, Democrats and Republicans, supporters and some opponents of the ACA, who have expanded Medicaid to millions of people over the past 2 years. I think there's a recognition that it makes sense and it's bigger than politics. As Governor Kasich said for Ohio: \\"It saves lives. No question about it.\\" And if your State isn't one of the 28 that has already expanded Medicaid, I'd urge you to consider it, because our team is prepared to work with you to make it happen. <p>Because some of you may not always agree with my approach or policies, I think that we can all agree that it's a good thing when a family doesn't lose a home just because a member of that family gets sick. And surely, we can agree that it's a good thing when businesses have roads and bridges and ports and the kind of Internet connections that allow all of us to thrive. <p>Surely, we can all agree that when workers and management come together around helping families getting ahead, that's a good thing and that it's a good thing when workers and businesses can compete on a level playing field, with new agreements for fair and free trade in some of the world's fastest growing markets. <p>So that's going to be my agenda for the next 2 years. Congress may pass parts of that agenda, not others, but I'm going to keep on pushing for these ideas because I believe it's the right thing to do. I think it's right for America. <p>And I will keep urging Congress to move past some of the habits of manufactured crises and self-inflicted wounds that have so often bogged us down over the last 5 years. We've got one example of that right now. Unless Congress acts, one week from now, more than a hundred thousand DHS employees, Border Patrol, port inspectors, TSA agents, will show up to work without getting paid. Now, they all work in your States. These are folks who, if they don't have a paycheck, are not going to be able to spend that money in your States. It will have a direct impact on your economy, and it will have a direct impact on America's national security, because their hard work helps to keep us safe. And as Governors, you know that we can't afford to play politics with our national security. <p>So instead, let's try to focus on some of the things that we have in common and deliver real results. I want to thank Governor Inslee and his fellow West Coast Governors who have helped workers and management reach an agreement that reopened 29 ports and kept business flowing. I got to add a plug for Tom Perez, who went out there and, I think, really made an extraordinary contribution to that effort. That's going to make a big difference for the country's economy as a whole. That's the kind of thing that we can accomplish when we put aside divisions and focus on some commonsense steps to improve the economy for everybody. And it's an example that I hope Congress follows in the months ahead. <p>Keep in mind, though, even when Congress does not act or does not act fast enough, I think we can still work together to make a difference. And whether you're a Democrat or a Republican, what I've found is that the more specific we are on focusing on problems, less concerned we are about politics, the more we get accomplished. <p>Now, I'll give you one specific example, and that's in the criminal justice area. Last year was the first time in 40 years that the Federal incarceration rate and the crime rate went down at the same time. First time in 40 years. Let's keep that progress going and reform our criminal justice system in ways that protect our citizens and serves us all. In Georgia, Governor Deal has given judges new alternatives to harsh mandatory minimum sentencing. In Connecticut, Governor O'Malley [Malloy; White House correction.] announced his \\"Second Chance Society\\" plan to help former prisoners rejoin their communities. We want to be a partner in those efforts. <p>And that's what the American people expect. One of the great privileges of being President is, you get to travel everywhere and you get to meet people from just about every walk of life. And what I have found is the assumption that I made, that I think Joe made when we first ran for office, still holds true: The American people are good and decent, and they have a lot more in common than our politics would indicate. And if we can just focus on that, there's a lot of good stuff that we can get done. <p>So I'm in the fourth quarter of my Presidency, or as some of you might call it, the kickoff for your campaign season. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I think there's still a lot that we can get done together. I think we can build an America that is creating more opportunities for hard-working folks. I think we can make sure that the future for the next generation is even brighter than the one that we enjoyed. And I look forward to making progress together at the Federal and State levels. Okay? <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"46" "\"Thank you. It is great to be back here&mdash;not just to pick up my AARP card. [<i>Laughter</i>] I want to thank Jo Ann and everybody at AARP for the work you do every single day on behalf of seniors. I am especially grateful to all of you for the seniors work you're doing to help us prepare for the White House Conference on Aging, which will be coming up later this year and will cover a whole host of issues, including protecting one of the most critical components of middle class life, and that's a secure and dignified retirement. And that's what we're here to talk about today. <p>I want to thank some other people who care passionately about this issue: My energetic, tireless Secretary of Labor, Tom Perez; a couple of outstanding Senators, Cory Booker from New Jersey and Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts. And Congressmen John Delaney is here&mdash;proud of the work he is doing. <p>So 6 years after the financial crisis that shook a lot of people's faith in a secure retirement, the good news is, our economy is steadily growing and creating new jobs. Last year was the best year for job growth since the 1990s. And all told, over the past 5 years, the private sector has created nearly 2 million [12 million; White House correction.] new jobs. And since I took office, the stock market has more than doubled, which means that 401(k)s for millions of families have been replenished. <p>America is poised for another good year, as long as Washington doesn't screw it up, as long as we keep the progress going with policies that help and don't hinder the middle class, no stalemates, no standoffs, no self-inflicted wounds or manufactured crisis&mdash;if we stay away from those things, then the projections are that the economy can do very well again this year. <p>But we're going to have to choose whether we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well or whether we build an economy where everybody who works hard can get ahead and have some semblance of security in this ever-changing world. <p>Because while we've come a long way, we've got a lot more work to do to make sure that the recovery reaches every single American out there and not just those at the top. That's what I've been calling middle class economics: the idea that this country does best when everybody does their fair share and everybody gets a fair shot and everybody is playing by the same set of rules. <p>And that last part&mdash;everybody playing by the same set of rules&mdash;is why we passed historic Wall Street reform that put in place smarter, tougher, commonsense rules of the road to protect consumers and to end taxpayer-funded bailouts. And by the way, I know that there have been times where folks questioned whether or not Wall Street reform works. If you look at how the banking system has responded, if you look at what's happened on Wall Street, when you look at how the markets gauge what we've done, reform has been meaningful. It has been effective. <p>That's why we passed a credit card bill of rights that gives consumers a simpler credit card bill: no more hidden fees, no more shifting deadlines, no more sudden changes of terms or \\"any time, any reason\\" rate hikes. It's why we created a new consumer watchdog agency that protects hard-working Americans from everything from predatory mortgage practices to payday loans that can destroy people's finances. And I want to thank our outstanding CFPB Director Rich Cordray and his team. They are working day in, day out to protect working families, and when families are taken advantage of, they've been working hard to get them their hard-earned money back. <p>Today, we're going to build on these consumer protections for the middle class by taking a new action to protect hard-working families' retirement security. Because, in America, after a lifetime of hard work, you should be able to retire with dignity and a sense of security. <p>And in today's economy, that's gotten tougher. Most workers don't have a traditional pension. A Social Security check often isn't enough on its own. And while the stark&mdash;stock market is doing well right now, that doesn't help folks who don't have retirement accounts. As a consequence, too few Americans at or near retirement have saved enough to have peace of mind. <p>So in addition to keeping Social Security strong&mdash;and we will keep it strong as I&mdash;as long as I am President. That is going to be a priority for me. In addition to keeping Social Security strong, I've proposed ways to make it easy and automatic for workers to save for retirement through their employer, including offering tax incentives to small businesses that offer retirement plans. And these proposals, it's estimated, would expand workplace savings opportunities to 30 million more workers. We've also proposed paying for them by closing tax loopholes for the wealthy. <p>At the same time, we've got to make sure that Americans who are doing the responsible thing by preparing for retirement are getting a fair share of the returns on those savings. That's what I want to focus on today. If you are working hard, if you're putting away money, if you're sacrificing that new car or that vacation so that you can build a nest egg for later, you should have the peace of mind of knowing that the advice you're getting for investing those dollars is sound, that your investments are protected, that you're not being taken advantage of. <p>And the challenge we've got is, right now there are no uniform rules of the road that require retirement advisers to act in the best interests of their clients, and that's hurting millions of working and middle class families. There are a lot of very fine financial advisers out there, but there are also financial advisers who receive backdoor payments or hidden fees for steering people into bad retirement investments that have high fees and low returns. So what happens is, these payments, these inducements incentivize the broker to make recommendations that generate the best returns for them, but not necessarily the best returns for you. <p>They might persuade investors, individuals with savings, to roll over their existing savings out of a low-fee plan and into a high-cost plan. They might even recommend investments with worse returns simply because they get paid to recommend those products. And one study by professors at Harvard and MIT had researchers send people to pose as middle class investors seeking investment advice from advisers. In 284 client visits, advisers recommended higher fee funds about half the time. The lowest fee funds were recommended only 21 times. <p>So think about what that means. You've done the right thing. You've worked hard. You've saved what you could. You're responsibly trying to prepare for retirement, but because of bad advice, because of skewed incentives, because of lack of protection, you could end up in a situation where you lose some of your hard-earned money simply because your adviser isn't required to put your interests first. And the truth is, most people don't even realize that's happening. <p>We read a story in the paper about Merlin and Elaine Toffel, a retired couple from near my hometown of Chicago, Lindenhurst, Illinois. They had worked their whole lives so they could rest easy in their golden years. They got bad advice to invest in expensive annuities that made it hard for them to access their money. Suddenly, they were short on cash, which is exactly what they had tried to avoid by saving and acting responsibly all those years. They were taken advantage of by an adviser of an institution where they had been longtime clients, and it was an institution they trusted. And Merlin now lives in a nursing home, and he and Elaine aren't here today. As they get older, their children are trying to help them get all this sorted out. And that's just one family. They're not alone. <p>On average, conflicts of interest in retirement advice results in annual losses of 1 percentage point for affected persons. Now, I know 1 percent may not sound like a lot, but the whole concept of compounding interest, it adds up. It can cut your savings by more than a quarter over the course of 35 years&mdash;cut your savings by more than 25 percent. So instead of $10,000 in savings growing to more than $38,000, it will grow to just over $27,500. That's a big spread. And all told, bad advice that results from conflicts of interest costs middle class and working families about $17 billion a year&mdash;$17 billion every year. <p>So you can put a number on how this affects us. But it affects something else. It offends our basic values of honesty and fair play. The values that say, in America, responsibility is rewarded and not exploited. <p>Now, I want to emphasize once again, there are a whole lot of financial advisers out there who do put their clients' interests first. There are a lot of hard-working men and women in this field and got into this field to help people. They're folks like financial adviser Sheryl Garrett, from Arkansas, who says, \\"The role\\"&mdash;is Sheryl here? There she is. Sheryl, stand up just so we can give her a round&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. We're proud of Sheryl. So I'm quoting you, Sheryl. [<i>Laughter</i>] Sheryl says: \\"The role of a financial adviser is one of the most important jobs. But there is a segment of the industry today that operates like the gunslingers of the Wild West. We don't have the rules and regulations to protect those who we're supposed to be serving.\\" <p>Couldn't have said it better myself, which is why I quoted you. [<i>Laughter</i>] Sheryl is right. The rules governing retirement investments were written 40 years ago, at a time when most workers with a retirement plan had traditional pensions and IRAs were brand new and 401(k)s didn't even exist. So it's not surprising that the rules that existed 40 years ago haven't caught up to the realities of most families today. Now, outdated regulations, legal loopholes, fine print&mdash;all that stuff today makes it harder for savers to know who they can trust. Financial advisers absolutely deserve fair compensation for helping people save for retirement and helping people figure out how to manage their investments. But they shouldn't be able to take advantage of their clients. The system makes it harder, in fact, for those financial advisers like Sheryl who are trying to do the right thing, because if she's making really good advice, but somebody who is competing with her is selling snake oil, she's losing business. And ultimately, those clients are going to lose money. <p>So today I'm calling on the Department of Labor to update the rules and requirements that retirement advisers put the best interests of their clients above their own financial interests. It's a very simple principle: You want to give financial advice, you've got to put your client's interests first. You can't have a conflict of interest. And this is especially important for middle class families, who can't afford to lose even a penny of the hard-earned savings that they've put away. These folks aren't asking for any special help or special consideration. They just want to be treated with fairness and respect. And that's what this new rule would do. And for outstanding financial advisers out there, it levels the playing field so that they can do what they know is the right thing to do: putting their clients first. <p>Now, here's one last element of it I've got to emphasize. Just because we put forward a new rule doesn't mean that it becomes law. There are a lot of financial advisers who support these basic safeguards to prevent abuse, but there are also some special interests that are going to fight it with everything they've got, saying that these costs will skyrocket or services are going to be lost. <p>But it turns out that we can actually look at the evidence. These industry doomsday predictions have not come true in other countries that have taken even more aggressive action on this issue than we're proposing. And if your business model rests on taking advantage, bilking hard-working Americans out of their retirement money, then you shouldn't be in business. That's pretty straightforward. <p>So we welcome different perspectives and ideas on how to move forward. That's what the comment period for the rule is all about. What I won't accept is the notion that there's nothing we can do to make sure that hard-working, responsible Americans who scrimp and save somehow end up losing some of those savings to less than scrupulous practices. We should be able to make sure that folks are treated fairly and give every possible assistance we can so that they can retire with security and dignity. <p>So we're going to keep on pushing for this rule. It's the right thing to do for our workers. It's the right thing to do for our country. We are thrilled that AARP is supporting this, but AARP is not alone. We've got all kinds of organizations that are stepping up: consumer advocates, civil rights organizations, labor organizations. We've got a great coalition of people who understand that the strength of our economy rests on whether hard-working families can feel more secure, knowing that if they do the right thing, they can get ahead. And that's what I'm going to keep fighting for: an economy where not only everybody is sharing in America's success, but they're also contributing to America's success. This is a important component in that basic promise that makes America the greatest country on Earth. <p>So thank you so much, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "

[<i>Laughter</i>] Nothing like bragging about somebody's children. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We are joined this evening by Members of Congress, including Leader Nancy Pelosi; members of the Congressional Black Caucus. I want to congratulate the Association for the Study of African American Life and History&mdash;which is the group that gave us Black History Month&mdash;on your centennial. Give them a big round of applause. <p>All right, that guy, don't get carried away now. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The First Lady.</i> He can get carried away. <p><i>The President.</i> I don't know, he was&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. Now, as always, this month is a chance to celebrate the central role that African Americans have played in every aspect of American life: marching for freedom and equality, jobs and justice; making a profound contribution to our culture. And here at the White House, we're committed to honoring that legacy. Earlier this month, for example, we opened up the newly restored Old Family Dining Room to the public for the first time, and it now includes a painting by Alma Thomas called \\"Resurrection.\\" And that's the first in the White House Collection by an African American woman. Michelle made that happen, and we could not be prouder of her for that. <p>You don't get carried away either, dear. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But for the past couple of years, we've also been marking important milestones in that journey: the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, the 50th anniversary this year of the Voting Rights Act. <p>Next week, Michelle and I and the girls will be traveling to Selma to pay tribute&mdash;not just as a President or a First Lady or as African Americans, but as Americans&mdash;to those who changed the course of history at the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Not just the legends and the giants of the civil rights movement like Dr. King and John Lewis, but the countless American heroes whose names aren't in the history books, that aren't etched on marble somewhere; ordinary men and women from all corners of this Nation, all walks of life, Black and White, rich and poor, students, scholars, maids, ministers, all who marched and who sang and organized to change this country for the better. <p>We happen to be blessed to have some of those foot soldiers for justice here today, folks like Ms. Mattie Atkins. Ms. Mattie Atkins, wave just a little bit. She's right here. Early in 1965, Mattie&mdash;who was just 27 years old, mother of five&mdash;joined with others in her community to march around the Marion Courthouse for their right to vote. And tensions ran high. The threat of violence mounted. But at night, the protesters would gather in a church and resolve to come back the next day. <p>And Ms. Atkins remembers the terrible violence on the night protesters tried to march to the jail, the night that Jimmie Lee Jackson was shot. Ms. Atkins remembers running into the church for safety, wiping the blood from the face of a fellow protester, and then going home to her children who were sleeping safe and sound in their beds. <p>And she still went back the next day, because despite the doubts and the fears, she knew that she was doing the right thing for her children and their future. And Ms. Atkins went on to help register folks to vote. She ran for office herself, became the first woman elected to her local school board in Perry County. <p>Next week, the world will turn its eyes to Selma again. And when it does, I want everyone to remember that it was because of people like Ms. Atkins and all the others who are here today that we celebrate. But they also remind us, they stand as testimonials to the fact that one day a year is not enough to honor the kind of courage that they showed. One month a year is not sufficient to take on their example and to celebrate the power of a movement. That's something that we have to do, each and every one of us, every day, living up to their example, then handing it on to our children and our children's children. <p>And today, on the third anniversary of Trayvon Martin's death, showing all of our kids&mdash;all of them&mdash;every single day that their lives matter, that's part of our task. I want to thank Trayvon's parents for being here on what's a very difficult day for them. It takes all of us to show our young people, as Ms. Atkins puts it, that \\"where we are today didn't come easy, it came through thick and thin.\\" \\"That's what I tell my children,\\" she says, \\"to stand up for what's right.\\" It's a simple thing to say; sometimes, it's hard to do. But progress in this Nation happens only because seemingly ordinary people find the courage to stand up for what is right. Not just when it's easy, but when it's hard. Not just when it's convenient, but when it's challenging. <p>We don't set aside this month each year to isolate or segregate or put under a glass case Black history. We set it aside to illuminate those threads, those living threads that African Americans have woven into the tight tapestry of this Nation to make it stronger and more beautiful and more just and more free. <p>What happened in Selma is quintessentially an American experience, not just an African American experience. It speaks to what's best in this country. It reminds us that the history of America doesn't belong to one group or another, it belongs to all of us; that idea, this experiment built on a shared story of people bound together by shared ideas, shared ideals, certain inalienable rights of equality and justice and liberty for all people. <p>So I want to thank those who made that extraordinary contribution for setting such a wonderful example for each of us. And I know that when I take Malia and Sasha down with Michelle next week, down to Selma, part of what I'm hoping to do is to remind them of their own obligations. Because there are going to be marches for them to march and struggles for them to fight. And if we've done our job, then that next generation is going to be picking up the torch as well. <p>All right? Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"48" "\"Hi, everybody. In America, we believe that a lifetime of hard work and responsibility should be rewarded with a shot at a secure, dignified retirement. It's one of the critical components of middle class life. And this week, I took new steps to protect it. <p>Six years after the crisis that shook a lot of people's faith in a secure retirement, our economy is steadily growing. Last year was the best year for job growth since the 1990s. All told, over the past 5 years, the private sector has added nearly 12 million new jobs. And since I took office, the stock market has more than doubled, replenishing the 401(k)s of millions of families. <p>But while we've come a long way, we've got more work to do to make sure that our recovery reaches more Americans, not just those at the top. That's what middle class economics is all about: the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everybody does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. <p>That last part, making sure everyone plays by the same set of rules, is why we passed historic Wall Street reform and a credit card bill of rights. It's why we created a new consumer watchdog agency. And it's why we're taking new action to protect hard-working families' retirement security. If you're working hard and putting away money, you should have the peace of mind that the financial advice you're getting is sound and that your investments are protected. <p>But right now there are no rules of the road. Many financial advisers put their clients' interest first, but some financial advisers get backdoor payments and hidden fees in exchange for steering people into bad investments. All told, bad advice that results from these conflicts of interest costs middle class families and working families about $17 billion every year. <p>So this week, I called on the Department of Labor to change that, to update the rules and require that retirement advisers put the best interests of their clients above their own financial interests. Middle class families cannot afford to lose their hard-earned savings after a lifetime of work. They deserve to be treated with fairness and respect. And that's what this rule would do. <p>While many financial advisers support these basic safeguards to prevent abuse, I know some special interests will fight this with everything they've got. But while we welcome different perspectives and ideas on how to move forward, what I won't accept is the notion that there's nothing we can do to make sure that hard-working, responsible Americans who scrimp and save can retire with security and dignity. <p>We're going to keep pushing for this rule, because it's the right thing to do for our workers and for our country. After all, the strength of our economy rests on whether hard-working families can not only share in America's success, but can also contribute to America's success. And that's what I will never stop fighting for: an economy where everyone who works hard has the chance to get ahead. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"49" "\"Hi, everybody. Sunday is International Women's Day, a day to celebrate remarkable women and girls worldwide and to rededicate ourselves to defending the fundamental rights and dignity of all people. <p>That's why, this week, Michelle and I launched a new \\"initiative on a topic that's close to both our hearts: girls' education. It's called Let Girls Learn\\", and its goal is to help more girls around the world go to school and stay in school. Right now 62 million girls who should be in school are not. And that's not an accident. It's the direct result of barriers, large and small, that stand in the way of girls who want to learn. <p>Maybe their families can't afford the school fees. Maybe the risk of being hurt or kidnapped or even killed by men who will do anything to stop girls from learning is just too great. Or maybe they aren't in school because they're expected to get married and become mothers while they're still teenagers or even earlier. In too many parts of the world, girls are still valued more for their bodies than for their minds. That's just plain wrong. And we all have to do more to stop it. <p>That's the idea behind \\"\\"Let Girls Learn.\\" We're making it clear to any country that's our partner&mdash;or that wants to be our partner&mdash;that they need to get serious about increasing the number of girls in school. Our diplomats and development experts are already hard at work. Our Peace Corps volunteers will play a big role too. And we're putting our partnerships with NGOs, businesses, and foundations to work on behalf of girls everywhere. <p>I come to this issue as the leader of the world's largest economy and Commander in Chief of the world's most powerful military, and I am convinced that a world in which girls are educated is a safer, more stable, more prosperous place. When girls are educated, their future children are healthier and better nourished. Their future wages increase, which in turn strengthens their families' security. National economic growth gets a boost too. And places where women and girls are treated as full and equal citizens tend to be more stable and more democratic. <p>I also come to this issue as the father of two wonderful young women. And I know that there are lots of girls just like Malia and Sasha out there, girls who are funny and caring and inquisitive and strong and have so much to offer the world. <p>It's a privilege to be the parent of girls. And we want to make sure that no girl out there is denied her chance to learn, that no girl is prevented from making her unique contributions to the world. Because every girl&mdash;every girl&mdash;deserves our respect. And every girl deserves an education. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"50" "\"<i>Audience member.</i> We love you, President Obama! <p><i>The President.</i> Well, you know I love you back. <p>It is a rare honor in this life to follow one of your heroes. And John Lewis is one of my heroes. <p>Now, I have to imagine that when a younger John Lewis woke up that morning 50 years ago and made his way to Brown Chapel, heroics were not on his mind. A day like this was not on his mind. Young folks with bedrolls and backpacks were milling about. Veterans of the movement trained newcomers in the tactics of nonviolence, the right way to protect yourself when attacked. A doctor described what tear gas does to the body, while marchers scribbled down instructions for contacting their loved ones. The air was thick with doubt, anticipation, and fear. And they comforted themselves with the final verse of the final hymn they sung: \\"No matter what may be the test, God will take care of you; Lean, weary one, upon His breast, God will take care of you.\\" <p>And then, his knapsack stocked with an apple, a toothbrush, and a book on government&mdash;all you need for a night behind bars&mdash;John Lewis led them out of the church on a mission to change America. <p>President and Mrs. Bush, Governor Bentley, Mayor Evans, Congresswoman Sewell, Reverend Strong, Members of Congress, elected officials, foot soldiers, friends, fellow Americans: As John noted, there are places and moments in America where this Nation's destiny has been decided. Many are sites of war: Concord and Lexington, Appomattox, Gettysburg. Others are sites that symbolize the daring of America's character: Independence Hall and Seneca Falls, Kitty Hawk and Cape Canaveral. <p>Selma is such a place. In one afternoon 50 years ago, so much of our turbulent history&mdash;the stain of slavery and anguish of civil war, the yoke of segregation and tyranny of Jim Crow, the death of four little girls in Birmingham, and the dream of a Baptist preacher&mdash;all that history met on this bridge. <p>It was not a clash of armies, but a clash of wills; a contest to determine the true meaning of America. And because of men and women like John Lewis, Joseph Lowery, Hosea Williams, Amelia Boynton, Diane Nash, Ralph Abernathy, C.T. Vivian, Andrew Young, Fred Shuttlesworth, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., so many others, the idea of a just America and a fair America, an inclusive America and a generous America&mdash;that idea ultimately triumphed. <p>Now, as is true across the landscape of American history, we cannot examine this moment in isolation. The march on Selma was part of a broader campaign that spanned generations, the leaders that day part of a long line of heroes. <p>We gather here to celebrate them. We gather here to honor the courage of ordinary Americans willing to endure billy clubs and the chastening rod, tear gas and the trampling hoof; men and women who despite the gush of blood and splintered bone would stay true to their north star and keep marching towards justice. They did as Scripture instructed: \\"Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer.\\" And in the days to come, they went back again and again. When the trumpet call sounded for more to join, the people came: Black and White, young and old, Christian and Jew, waving the American flag, singing the same anthems full of faith and hope. A White newsman, Bill Plante, who covered the marches then and who is with us here today, quipped that the growing number of White people lowered the quality of the singing. [<i>Laughter</i>] To those who marched, though, those old gospel songs must have never sounded so sweet. <p>In time, their chorus would well up and reach President Johnson. And he would send them protection and speak to the Nation, echoing their call for America and the world to hear: \\"We shall overcome.\\" What enormous faith these men and women had: faith in God, but also faith in America. <p>The Americans who crossed this bridge, they were not physically imposing, but they gave courage to millions. They held no elected office, but they led a nation. They marched as Americans who had endured hundreds of years of brutal violence, countless daily indignities. But they didn't seek special treatment, just the equal treatment promised to them almost a century before. <p>What they did here will reverberate through the ages. Not because the change they won was preordained, not because their victory was complete, but because they proved that nonviolent change is possible, that love and hope can conquer hate. <p>As we commemorate their achievement, we are well served to remember that, at the time of the marches, many in power condemned rather than praised them. Back then, they were called Communists or half-breeds or outside agitators, sexual and moral degenerates, and worse. They were called everything but the name their parents gave them. Their faith was questioned, their lives were threatened, their patriotism challenged. <p>And yet what could be more American than what happened in this place? What could more profoundly vindicate the idea of America than plain and humble people&mdash;unsung, the downtrodden, the dreamers not of high station, not born to wealth or privilege, not of one religious tradition but many&mdash;coming together to shape their country's course? <p>What greater expression of faith in the American experiment than this? What greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished, that we are strong enough to be self-critical, that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this Nation to more closely align with our highest ideals? <p>That's why their Selma is not some outlier in the American experience. That's why it's not a museum or a static monument to behold from a distance. It is instead the manifestation of a creed written into our founding documents: \\"We the People . . . in order to form a more perfect Union.\\" \\"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\\" <p>These are not just words. They're a living thing, a call to action, a roadmap for citizenship, and an insistence in the capacity of free men and women to shape our own destiny. For Founders like Franklin and Jefferson, for leaders like Lincoln and FDR, the success of our experiment in self-government rested on engaging all of our citizens in this work. And that's what we celebrate here in Selma. That's what this movement was all about, one leg in our long journey toward freedom. <p>The American instinct that led these young men and women to pick up the torch and cross this bridge, that's the same instinct that moved patriots to choose revolution over tyranny. It's the same instinct that drew immigrants from across oceans and the Rio Grande; the same instinct that led women to reach for the ballot, workers to organize against an unjust status quo; the same instinct that led us to plant a flag at Iwo Jima and on the surface of the Moon. <p>It's the idea held by generations of citizens who believed that America is a constant work in progress, who believed that loving this country requires more than singing its praises or avoiding uncomfortable truths. It requires the occasional disruption, the willingness to speak out for what is right, to shake up the status quo. That's America. <p>That's what makes us unique. That's what cements our reputation as a beacon of opportunity. Young people behind the Iron Curtain would see Selma and eventually tear down that wall. Young people in Soweto would hear Bobby Kennedy talk about ripples of hope and eventually banish the scourge of apartheid. Young people in Burma went to prison rather than submit to military rule. They saw what John Lewis had done. From the streets of Tunis to the Maidan in Ukraine, this generation of young people can draw strength from this place, where the powerless could change the world's greatest power and push their leaders to expand the boundaries of freedom. They saw that idea made real right here in Selma, Alabama. They saw that idea manifest itself here in America. <p>Because of campaigns like this, a Voting Rights Act was passed. Political and economic and social barriers came down. And the change these men and women wrought is visible here today in the presence of African Americans who run boardrooms, who sit on the bench, who serve in elected office from small towns to big cities, from the Congressional Black Caucus all the way to the Oval Office. <p>Because of what they did, the doors of opportunity swung open not just for Black folks, but for every American. Women marched through those doors. Latinos marched through those doors. Asian Americans, gay Americans, Americans with disabilities&mdash;they all came through those doors. Their endeavors gave the entire South the chance to rise again, not by reasserting the past, but by transcending the past. What a glorious thing, Dr. King might say. And what a solemn debt we owe. Which leads us to ask, just how might we repay that debt? <p>First and foremost, we have to recognize that one day's commemoration, no matter how special, is not enough. If Selma taught us anything, it's that our work is never done. The American experiment in self-government gives work and purpose to each generation. <p>Selma teaches us, as well, that action requires that we shed our cynicism. For when it comes to the pursuit of justice, we can afford neither complacency nor despair. Just this week, I was asked whether I thought the Department of Justice's Ferguson report shows that, with respect to race, little has changed in this country. And I understood the question; the report's narrative was sadly familiar. It evoked the kind of abuse and disregard for citizens that spawned the civil rights movement. But I rejected the notion that nothing's changed. What happened in Ferguson may not be unique, but it's no longer endemic. It's no longer sanctioned by law or by custom. And before the civil rights movement, it most surely was. <p>We do a disservice to the cause of justice by intimating that bias and discrimination are immutable, that racial division is inherent in America. If you think nothing's changed in the past 50 years, ask somebody who lived through the Selma or Chicago or Los Angeles of the 1950s. Ask the female CEO who once might have been assigned to the secretarial pool if nothing's changed. Ask your gay friend if it's easier to be out and proud in America now than it was 30 years ago. To deny this progress, this hard-won progress&mdash;our progress&mdash;would be to rob us of our own agency, our own capacity, our responsibility to do what we can to make America better. <p>Of course, a more common mistake is to suggest that Ferguson is an isolated incident, that racism is banished, that the work that drew men and women to Selma is now complete, and that whatever racial tensions remain are a consequence of those seeking to play the \\"race card\\" for their own purposes. We don't need a Ferguson report to know that's not true. We just need to open our eyes and our ears and our hearts to know that this Nation's racial history still casts its long shadow upon us. <p>We know the march is not yet over. We know the race is not yet won. We know that reaching that blessed destination where we are judged, all of us, by the content of our character requires admitting as much, facing up to the truth. \\"We are capable of bearing a great burden,\\" James Baldwin once wrote, \\"once we discover that the burden is reality and arrive where reality is.\\" <p>There's nothing America can't handle if we actually look squarely at the problem. And this is work for all Americans, not just some. Not just Whites. Not just Blacks. If we want to honor the courage of those who marched that day, then all of us are called to possess their moral imagination. All of us will need to feel as they did the fierce urgency of now. All of us need to recognize as they did that change depends on our actions, on our attitudes, the things we teach our children. And if we make such an effort, no matter how hard it may sometimes seem, laws can be passed and consciences can be stirred and consensus can be built. <p>With such an effort, we can make sure our criminal justice system serves all and not just some. Together, we can raise the level of mutual trust that policing is built on: the idea that police officers are members of the community they risk their lives to protect. And citizens in Ferguson and New York and Cleveland, they just want the same thing young people here marched for 50 years ago: the protection of the law. Together, we can address unfair sentencing and overcrowded prisons and the stunted circumstances that rob too many boys of the chance to become men and rob the Nation of too many men who could be good dads and good workers and good neighbors. <p>With effort, we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to opportunity. Americans don't accept a free ride for anybody, nor do we believe in equality of outcomes. But we do expect equal opportunity. And if we really mean it, if we're not just giving lip service to it, but if we really mean it and are willing to sacrifice for it, then, yes, we can make sure every child gets an education suitable to this new century, one that expands imaginations and lifts sights and gives those children the skills they need. We can make sure every person willing to work has the dignity of a job and a fair wage and a real voice and sturdier rungs on that ladder into the middle class. <p>And with effort, we can protect the foundation stone of our democracy for which so many marched across this bridge, and that is the right to vote. Right now, in 2015, 50 years after Selma, there are laws across this country designed to make it harder for people to vote. As we speak, more such laws are being proposed. Meanwhile, the Voting Rights Act, the culmination of so much blood, so much sweat and tears, the product of so much sacrifice in the face of wanton violence, the Voting Rights Act stands weakened, its future subject to political rancor. <p>How can that be? The Voting Rights Act was one of the crowning achievements of our democracy, the result of Republican and Democratic efforts. President Reagan signed its renewal when he was in office. President George W. Bush signed its renewal when he was in office. One hundred Members of Congress have come here today to honor people who were willing to die for the right to protect it. If we want to honor this day, let that hundred go back to Washington and gather 400 more, and together, pledge to make it their mission to restore that law this year. That's how we honor those on this bridge. <p>Of course, our democracy is not the task of Congress alone or the courts alone or even the President alone. If every new voter suppression law was struck down today, we would still have, here in America, one of the lowest voting rates among free peoples. Fifty years ago, registering to vote here in Selma and much of the South meant guessing the number of jellybeans in a jar, the number of bubbles on a bar of soap. It meant risking your dignity and sometimes your life. <p>What's our excuse today for not voting? How do we so casually discard the right for which so many fought? How do we so fully give away our power, our voice, in shaping America's future? Why are we pointing to somebody else when we could take the time just to go to the polling places? We give away our power. <p>Fellow marchers, so much has changed in 50 years. We have endured war, and we've fashioned peace. We've seen technological wonders that touch every aspect of our lives. We take for granted conveniences that our parents could have scarcely imagined. But what has not changed is the imperative of citizenship, that willingness of a 26-year-old deacon or a Unitarian minister or a young mother of five to decide they loved this country so much that they'd risk everything to realize its promise. That's what it means to love America. That's what it means to believe in America. That's what it means when we say America is exceptional. <p>For we were born of change. We broke the old aristocracies, declaring ourselves entitled, not by bloodline, but endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights. We secure our rights and responsibilities through a system of self-government, of and by and for the people. That's why we argue and fight with so much passion and conviction, because we know our efforts matter. We know America is what we make of it. <p>Look at our history. We are Lewis and Clark and Sacajawea, pioneers who braved the unfamiliar, followed by a stampede of farmers and miners and entrepreneurs and hucksters. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's our spirit. That's who we are. <p>We are Sojourner Truth and Fannie Lou Hamer, women who could do as much as any man and then some. And we're Susan B. Anthony, who shook the system until the law reflected that truth. That is our character. <p>We're the immigrants who stowed away on ships to reach these shores, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free: Holocaust survivors, Soviet defectors, the Lost Boys of Sudan. We're the hopeful strivers who cross the Rio Grande because we want our kids to know a better life. That's how we came to be. <p>We're the slaves who built the White House and the economy of the South. We're the ranch hands and cowboys who opened up the West, the countless laborers who laid rail and raised skyscrapers and organized for workers' rights. <p>We're the fresh-faced GIs who fought to liberate a continent. And we're the Tuskeegee Airmen and the Navajo code talkers and the Japanese Americans who fought for this country even as their own liberty had been denied. <p>We're the firefighters who rushed into those buildings on 9/11, the volunteers who signed up to fight in Afghanistan and Iraq. We're the gay Americans whose blood ran in the streets of San Francisco and New York, just as blood ran down this bridge. We are storytellers, writers, poets, artists who abhor unfairness and despise hypocrisy and give voice to the voiceless and tell truths that need to be told. <p>We're the inventors of gospel and jazz and blues, bluegrass and country and hip-hop and rock and roll, and our very own sound with all the sweet sorrow and reckless joy of freedom. <p>We are Jackie Robinson, enduring scorn and spiked cleats and pitches coming straight to his head, and stealing home in the World Series anyway. <p>We are the people Langston Hughes wrote of who \\"build our temples for tomorrow, strong as we know how.\\" We are the people Emerson wrote of, \\"who for truth and honor's sake stand fast and suffer long,\\" who are \\"never tired, so long as we can see far enough.\\" <p>That's what America is. Not stock photos or airbrushed history or feeble attempts to define some of us as more American than others. We respect the past, but we don't pine for the past. We don't fear the future, we grab for it. America is not some fragile thing. We are large, in the words of Whitman, containing multitudes. We are boisterous and diverse and full of energy, perpetually young in spirit. That's why someone like John Lewis at the ripe old age of 25 could lead a mighty march. <p>And that's what the young people here today and listening all across the country must take away from this day. You are America, unconstrained by habit and convention, unencumbered by what is, because you're ready to seize what ought to be. <p>For everywhere in this country, there are first steps to be taken, there's new ground to cover, there are more bridges to be crossed. And it is you, the young and fearless at heart, the most diverse and educated generation in our history, who the Nation is waiting to follow. <p>Because Selma shows us that America is not the project of any one person. Because the single most powerful word in our democracy is the word \\"we.\\" \\"We the People.\\" \\"We Shall Overcome.\\" \\"Yes, We Can.\\" That word is owned by no one. It belongs to everyone. Oh, what a glorious task we are given, to continually try to improve this great Nation of ours. <p>Fifty years from Bloody Sunday, our march is not yet finished, but we're getting closer. Two hundred and thirty-nine years after this Nation's founding, our Union is not yet perfect, but we are getting closer. Our job's easier because somebody already got us through that first mile, somebody already got us over that bridge. When it feels the road is too hard, when the torch we've been passed feels too heavy, we will remember these early travelers and draw strength from their example and hold firmly to the words of the prophet Isaiah: <p>Those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. <p>They will soar on the wings like eagles. <p>They will run and not grow weary. <p>They will walk and not be faint. <p>We honor those who walked so we could run. We must run so our children soar. And we will not grow weary, for we believe in the power of an awesome God and we believe in this country's sacred promise. <p>May He bless those warriors of justice no longer with us and bless the United States of America. Thank you, everybody.\" "
"51" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you! Hello, mayors! Everybody, have a seat. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you, Mayor Becker, for the wonderful introduction and the great job that you are doing every single day. Everybody, have a seat. [<i>Laughter</i>] Sit down, take&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> I love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you too. <p>It is great to be with the National League of Cities. We have about 2,000 local leaders here. We've got mayors, we've got councilmembers. We've got Republicans, Democrats, Independents. <p><i>Audience member</i>. Independents&mdash;[<i>inaudible</i>]. <p><i>The President</i>. [<i>Laughter</i>] We've got some small-town leaders, we've got some bustling city leaders. But you all have something in common, and that is that every day you wake up ready to solve problems, and you know that people are depending on you to make sure your streets are safe, your schools are strong, trash gets picked up, roads getting cleared. You have to spend time thinking in very practical terms about whether people are getting good jobs and whether they're able to support a family. <p>So you don't have a lot of time for gridlock. You've got to get the job done. You don't have a lot of time for hot air. [<i>Laughter</i>] You&mdash;people are expecting you to deliver. And you're part of the reason why America is coming back. <p>Last month, our economy created nearly 300,000 new jobs. Unemployment rate ticked down to 5.5 percent, which is the lowest it's been since the spring of 2008. And all told, businesses have now created over 12 million jobs over the last 5 years&mdash;12 million. And the good news is, the pace has been picking up. Our businesses have now added more than 200,000 jobs a month over the last year, and we have not seen a streak like that in almost 40 years. <p>So we're well positioned, we're in a good spot to take advantage of not just next year or the year after, but decades to come. And we've got to keep positioning ourselves for a constantly changing global economy. That's something all of you understand. It doesn't matter whether you're the mayor of a big city or a small town. You understand that the economy is dynamic now, and you can't just stand still, you can't rest on your laurels. <p>And you also understand we've got to stay focused on middle class economics, the notion that our country does best when everybody is getting a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same set of rules. And I have to say, the National League of Cities has been a great partner in this work. A great partner. <p>We've worked with many of you to lift the minimum wage while we're waiting for Congress to do something. [<i>Laughter</i>] And over the past 2 years, more than 20 cities and counties have taken action to raise workers' wages. You've passed sick leave laws, you've answered the Mayors' Challenge To End Veterans Homelessness. Nearly 200 leaders have stepped up to answer what we're calling \\"My Brother's Keeper,\\" the challenge to create more pathways to success for our young people. Some of you are supporting our efforts to secure new agreements for trade that's free and fair in some of the world's fastest growing markets, because you know that there are businesses, large and small, in your communities that can be impacted, and we want to make sure our workers and our businesses can compete on a level playing field. <p>So there's a lot of work we've done together and a lot more we can do together to make sure that more Americans benefit from a 21st-century economy. And nobody knows for sure which industries are going to be generating all the good-paying jobs of the future. What we do know is we want them here in America, and we want them in your town, we want them in your cities, we want them in your counties. That's what we know. <p>So today I want to focus on something very specific, and that is, how can we work together to build a pipeline of tech workers for this new economy? Now, this doesn't just apply to San Francisco. This doesn't just apply to Boston. It applies across the board in every part of the country. Right now America has more job openings than at any point since 2001. So think of it&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;that's good news, we've got a lot of job openings. Here's the catch: Over half a million of those jobs are technology jobs. A lot of those jobs didn't even exist 10, 20 years ago, titles like Mobile App Developer&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;or Userface Designer. <p>Now, we tend to think that all these tech jobs are in Silicon Valley, at companies like Google and eBay, or maybe in a few spots like Austin, Texas, where you've seen a tech industry thrive. But the truth is, two-thirds of these jobs are in non-high-tech industries like health care or manufacturing or banking, which means they're in every corner of the country. <p>See, there's no industry that hasn't been touched by this technology revolution. And what's more, a lot of these jobs don't require a 4-year degree in computer science, they don't require you be an engineer. Folks can get the skills they need for these jobs in newer, streamlined, faster training programs. <p>What's more, these tech jobs pay 50 percent more than the average private sector wage, which means they're a ticket into the middle class. And you all know better than anybody, this is an economic development issue, because when companies have job openings that they cannot fill, that costs them money. It costs them market share; it costs them exports. So they go looking for where they can find the people they need. And if we don't have them, that makes it harder for us to keep and attract good jobs to our shores or to your communities. <p>When these jobs go unfilled, it's a missed opportunity for the workers, but it's also a missed opportunity for your city, your community, your county, your State, and our Nation. And here's something else: If we're not producing enough tech workers, over time that's going to threaten our leadership in global innovation, which is the bread and butter of the 21st-century economy. <p>America is where entrepreneurs come to start the greatest startups, where the most cutting-edge ideas are born and are launched. But historically, that's because we've got great universities, we've got great research, and we've got great workers. And if we lose those assets, they'll start drifting somewhere else, companies will get started somewhere else, and the great new industries of the future may not be here in America. <p>Now, I refuse to accept that future. I want Americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that release new jobs, whether it's converting sunlight into liquid fuel or leading a new era in personalized medicine or pushing out into the solar system, not just to visit, but to stay. We've got just this incredible set of opportunities, but we've got to have the workers for us to take advantage of it. <p>So today I'm announcing a new initiative that we're calling TechHire. TechHire. And it's going to be driven by leaders like you. So there are three big components to this. <p>First, we already have over 20 cities, States, and rural communities, from Louisville to Delaware, who have signed on to fill tech openings&mdash;they've already got more than 120,000 of them&mdash;in bold new ways. Let me give you an example. Employers tend to recruit people with technology degrees from 4-year colleges, and that means sometimes they end up screening out good candidates who don't necessarily have traditional qualifications; they may have learned at a community college, or they may have served in our military. They've got the talent, but employers are missing them. <p>So TechHire communities are going to help employers link up and find and hire folks based on their actual skills and not just their r&eacute;sum&eacute;s. It&mdash;because it turns out, it doesn't matter where you learned code, it just matters how good you are in writing code. If you can do the job, you should get the job. <p>And while 4-year degrees in engineering and computer science are still important, we have the opportunity to promote programs that we call, for example, coding boot camp, or online courses that have pioneered new ways to teach tech skills in a fraction of the time and the costs. And these new models have the potential to reach underserved communities: to reach women, who are still underrepresented in this sector; and minorities, who are still underrepresented in this sector; and veterans, who we know can do the job; and lower income workers, who might have the aptitude for tech jobs, but they don't know that these jobs are within reach. <p>Understand, within the tech sector, there are going to be tiers of jobs, all of which are tech, but they're not all the same. All right? There's still going to be the place&mdash;we still have to produce more engineers and advanced degrees in computer science at the upper tier, but there's all kinds of stuff that's being done within companies at different sectors that can create great careers for a long of people. <p>And so what TechHire is going to do is to help local leaders connect the job openings to the training programs to the jobs. And if you're not already involved in this, you've got to get involved, because your community needs this just like everybody else does. So that's the first component. <p>Second thing we're doing: We've got private-sector leaders who are supporting everything from scholarships to job-matching tools. So companies like LinkedIn are going to use data to help identify the skills that employers need. Companies like Capital One are going to help recruit, train, and employ more new tech workers, not out of charity, but because it's a smart business decision. All of this is going to help us to match the job to the worker. And the private sector will be involved in this out of self-interest, but it means that you, the leaders at the local level, are going to have to help create these platforms and facilitate this kind of job match. <p>Finally, we're launching a $100 million competition for innovative ideas to train and employ people who are underrepresented in tech. At a time when we all lead digital lives, anybody who has the drive and the will to get into this field should have a way to do so, a pathway to do so. So my administration is committed to this initiative. We've got a lot of private and nonprofit sectors leading the way. We want to get more onboard. But ultimately, success is going to rest on folks like you&mdash;on mayors, councilmembers, local leaders&mdash;because you've got the power to bring your communities together and seize this incredible economic development opportunity that could change the way we think about training and hiring the workers of tomorrow. And the good news is, these workers may emerge from the unlikeliest places. <p>So let me wrap up with just the example of one person, a woman named LaShana Lewis. Where's LaShana? She's here today. I hear she was here. There she is over there. There's LaShana. <p>Now, the reason LaShana's story is so relevant is, LaShana grew up in East St. Louis. She had a passion for computers. But because of circumstances, constraints&mdash;she wasn't born with a silver spoon in her mouth&mdash;she wasn't able to get a college degree, and because she didn't have a college degree, she couldn't even get an interview for a tech job, despite her coding skills. So she was working as a bus driver, and she was working in entry-level jobs. <p>But LaShana apparently is a stubborn person&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;which is good. Sometimes, you need to be stubborn. So she refused to give up on her dream, and she used her free time to teach herself new computer skills. And she started going to a coding \\"meetup\\" that was run by LaunchCode, which is a non-for-profit that finds talented people across St. Louis and gives them the training and credibility for the tech jobs employers are desperately needing to fill in&mdash;as we speak. So LaShana had the skills. LaunchCode went to bat for her. And today, she's a system engineer at MasterCard. <p>Now, LaShana&mdash;it's a great story, but understand this&mdash;MasterCard wants to hire more folks like LaShana. Moreover, 40 percent of LaunchCode's first class came in unemployed. Ninety percent of its graduates were hired full time, with an average starting salary of $50,000 a year. <p>So that's what's already happening, but it's happening at a small scale. And what we need to do is expand it. And in each of your communities, there is an opportunity to find talent like LaShana, help them get credentialed, help them focus the skills they've already got, work with non-for-profits, work with businesses, match them up. Next thing you know, you've got a systems engineer; they've got a good job. Companies are excited; they're able to expand. Your tax base is improving. You can reach out and train even more folks. You get on a virtuous cycle of change. <p>And it doesn't require huge amounts of money. It requires some planning and organization and coordination, and the Federal Government is going to be your partner in this process. <p>So we've got to create more stories like LaShana's. And if we do, then we are going to more effectively capture what is the boundless energy and talent of Americans who have the will, but sometimes need a little help clearing out the way. Help them get on a path to fill the new jobs of this new century. <p>And that's what middle class economics looks like. I said this weekend that Americans don't believe in anybody getting a free ride, and Americans don't believe in equality of outcomes. We understand that you've got&mdash;we've got to work hard in this country. You don't just sit around waiting for something to happen, you've got to go get it. But we do believe in equal opportunity. We do believe in expanding opportunity to everybody who's willing to work hard. We do believe that, in this country, no matter what you look like or where you come from, how you started out, if you're willing to put in some blood and sweat and tears, you should be able to make it and get a decent job and get a decent wage and send your kids to college and retire with dignity and respect and have health care you can count on and have a safe community. <p>You&mdash;we do believe that. And that's what I'm committed to doing these last 2 years. And I'm going to need the League of Cities to help me do it; work with you to build an economy where everybody shares in America's prosperity and everybody is contributing to America's prosperity. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you.\" "
"52" "\"Well, this is an opportunity to get a head start on what we're going to be talking about down in Atlanta, Georgia. One of the things that's been uppermost on my mind is, how do we make sure that every young person in this country who is willing to put in the effort can afford to go to college? And as part of that overall process, we're going to be talking today about a Student Bill of Rights. <p>This is part of it. It's an executive action that we're able to take to streamline and improve the manner in which the Federal Government interacts with students when it comes to student loans, and it will be part of a broader overview that I talk about while we're in Atlanta. All right? <p>[<i>At this point, the President signed the memorandum.</i>] <p>There you go. Thank you, everybody. Let's get on the plane. Thank you.\" "
"53" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Atlanta! Hello, Yellow Jackets! This is a pretty good-looking crowd here! <p><i>Audience member.</i> Thank you! <p><i>The President.</i> He says thank you. [<i>Laughter</i>] I wasn't directing it specifically at you, but you do look pretty good. What do you think? [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, I may not be the gauge. You should ask some of the ladies here. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Everybody, have a seat who has got a chair. If you don't have a chair, don't sit down. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, I understand George P. Burdell was supposed to introduce me today. [<i>Laughter</i>] But nobody could find him. <p>So I want to thank Tiffany for stepping in. [<i>Laughter</i>] What she did not mention is that her letter to me was not just to express her concern about student loans. She said&mdash;in her letter, she said it was also to procrastinate from doing her thermodynamics homework. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's a true story. That is true. It's okay. [<i>Laughter</i>] I procrastinate sometimes. [<i>Laughter</i>] As long as you got it done, Tiffany. Where is Tiffany? Did you get it done? <p><i>Georgia Institute of Technology student Tiffany Davis.</i> I got it done! <p><i>The President.</i> Okay. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Let's give it up for Buzz and the Georgia Tech Band for getting us fired up. [<i>Applause</i>] Yay! Also give it up for Governor Nathan Deal, who is here; Congressmen Hank Johnson and David Scott; Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed; and the President of this great institution, Georgia Tech, Bud Peterson. [<i>Applause</i>] Hey! That's good. You've got a high approval rating. [<i>Laughter</i>] You do. Absolutely. <p>We also have a special guest with us. This is a proud Georgia Tech alum, who just happens also to be the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff: Admiral Sandy Winnefeld is here. Where's Sandy? There he is. Before he was the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he was a Navy fighter pilot, which is cooler. Now he just goes to meetings. [<i>Laughter</i>] What's up with that? I told him he's got to get back on a plane. <p>The&mdash;it is great to be at one of the finest technical institutes in the world. One of the finest in the world. I mean, you've got to be if the Ramblin' Wreck is still running after all these years. Is that it? [<i>Laughter</i>] That's a Georgia Tech reference that some of you may not know. [<i>Laughter</i>] I also know that Georgia Tech is terrific because we've actually worked with you on several fronts, from promoting advanced manufacturing to unlocking the mysteries of the brain, to helping more students become entrepreneurs. <p>And the reason I wanted to come here today is because I believe that higher education, as you believe, is one of the best investments that anybody can make in their future. And it's also one of the best investments you can make in our country's future. So I'm here to say thank you and to tell you I'm proud of you, because I know that it's not always easy to do what you're doing. It takes perseverance. A lot of late nights in the library and the lab, and you're wrapping your minds around complex formulas and concepts that, frankly, I don't understand. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I know they're complex. [<i>Laughter</i>] And some of you are holding jobs down at the same time, which makes it even harder. <p>But as frustrating as it may be, and Tiffany expressed some frustrations on occasion, it is worth it. Higher education has never been more important. And the message I want to deliver today, not just to you, but to the entire country, is the entire Nation has to treat it as a priority. <p>Right now our economy is growing steadily. It's creating new jobs. You're going to be going into a job market that's much better than the one that existed when I came into office 6 years ago. After the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes, over the past 5 years, our businesses have now created 12 million new jobs. Unemployment continues to come down, and obviously, that's good news for those of you who are graduating soon. But&mdash;yes, that's right, you want a job. [<i>Laughter</i>] Okay. Your parents also want you to have a job. They don't want you on the couch. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But I didn't run for President just to get us back to where we were. I ran for President to get us to where we need to go. And where we need to go is a growing middle class with rising incomes and opportunities for everybody who's willing to work hard. An America where no matter who you are, what you look like, where you came from, how you started, who you love, what faith you're a part of, you can make it in this country if you try. That's what America is all about. <p>And today, a college degree is the surest ticket to the middle class and beyond. It's the key to getting a good job that pays a good income. And it offers a measure of security, because a college degree tells employers that you don't just have one set of skills, that you've got the continuous capacity to learn new skills, which is going to be particularly important for your generation because the economy is going to churn and change in ways that none of us can even anticipate. <p>Before we came out here, I was talking to a group, including Sandy Winnefeld and your mayor, Kasim Reed, and Tyler Perry, a buddy who's&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;he wasn't in \\"Madea,\\" he was Tyler. [<i>Laughter</i>] And we were talking about how rapidly the technology is transforming everything we understand, everything we know: everything from drones to artificial intelligence to driverless cars. And we don't yet know how all that is going to shape the Nation that you inherit, but we know it's going to shape it dramatically. And in order for you to be able to be successful, you're going to have to adapt continuously. The days where you work at one place for 30, 40 years, those days are over. <p>And so the skill sets you are getting now are going to keep you in that job market. You're going to have multiple jobs before you're 30. Some of you will have multiple careers. And we live in a 21st-century economy, where your most valuable asset is your imagination, your knowledge, your ability to analyze tough problems. And that's not just true for individual Americans, it's true for our whole country. <p>The ability to compete in the global economy depends on us having the world's most skilled, best educated workforce. And by the way, let me just add, it's also going to be critical for us to maintain our democracy in a complex, diverse society. Because&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>Sometimes, understandably, when I come to college campuses, there's a lot of just bread and butter, nuts and bolts, how does this translate into jobs, careers. But part of what has made America the exceptional nation that it is, is our diversity and our ability to draw from every corner of the world&mdash;all the talent, all the ideas&mdash;and create this amazing stew. And the more complex the society, the tougher that becomes. And so to have all of you possess the ability to listen and to learn from people who aren't like you, that's also what you're learning here, and that's going to make you more effective to every employer out there. So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. But it's also&mdash;it's going to make you better citizens, and it's going to make our democracy function better. <p>But back to the jobs thing. [<i>Laughter</i>] Jobs and businesses will go wherever the best workers are. And I don't want them to have to look any further than the United States of America. I want businesses investing here. I want Americans getting those new jobs. That's how we're going to lead the world in this century just like we did in the 20th century. <p>So here's the challenge: Higher education has never been more important, but it's also never been more expensive. The average undergrad who borrows money to pay for college graduates with about $28,000 in student loan debt. That's just the average; some students end up with a lot more than that&mdash;you know who you are. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm not telling you anything you don't know. <p>And let me say that it's been established time and time again that Georgia Tech is one of the best bargains around. You are getting a great education for a great value, so&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. Which is one of the reasons I'm here; obviously, I wouldn't go to a place that was a bad bargain and really expensive and gave no value. That would not make sense. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But even here at Georgia Tech, even with the great value it is, it's expensive. And I'm here to tell you, I'm with you. I believe that America is not a place where higher education is a privilege that is reserved for the few. America needs to be a place where higher education has to be available for every single person who's willing to strive for it, who's willing to work for it. <p>And I've said this before: I take this personally. And my grandfather had a chance to go to college because this country decided that when veterans returned home from World War II, they should be able to go to college. And this Government stepped up. <p>My mother was able to raise two kids by herself, in part because she got grants that helped pay for her education. And I am only standing here, and Michelle is only where she is today, because of scholarships and student loans and work-study. We did not come from families of means. I mean, we didn't come from families of means, but we knew that if we worked hard, there were&mdash;there was help out there to make sure we got a great education. That's what this country gave to us. <p>And that's why this has been such a priority for me. I take it personally because when I look out at all of you, I see myself. And I remember the fact that it took me 10 years to pay off all our student loans. We were paying more for our student loans than our mortgage, even after Malia and Sasha were born. We were supposed to be saving for their college education; we were still paying off ours. <p>And that's why we've acted again and again to make college more affordable. Five years ago this month, we enacted the largest reforms to the student loan program in history. We cut out the big banks that were taking taxpayer dollars and serving as middlemen in the student loan game, and we said, well, let's just give the money directly to the students like you. <p>So we saved&mdash;as a result of that change, we saved billions of dollars. We were able to expand tax credits and Pell grants and put college within reach for millions more middle class and low-income students across the country. Then, we fought to keep interest rates on student rates&mdash;interest rates on student loans low and capped how high those rates can rise. And as a result, the typical undergrad is saving about a hundred&mdash;$1,500. We also acted to let millions of graduates cap their loan payments at 10 percent of their incomes so they don't have to choose between paying the rent and paying back their debt. <p>And by the way, everybody here, if you don't already know about the income-based repayment program, you need to learn about it, because it's still underutilized. But it gives you an opportunity to make sure that if you make a career choice that doesn't make tons of money, you're still able to do the responsible thing and pay back your loans at a pace that also allows you to build a family and buy a home and to live your lives. <p>And graduates who go into lower paying fields like social work or teaching, they're not going to pay a price for following their dreams because they're going to have even better options in terms of how they repay their loans. So that's what we did on the student loan side. <p>Meanwhile, we're working to hold down the cost of a college education. So we're partnering with schools like Georgia Tech on innovative ways to increase value, like your online master's program in computer science, which costs just a fraction of the price of an in-classroom program. <p>And I sent Congress a bold new plan to bring down the cost of community college to zero. Because not everybody may be prepared right away to start a 4-year university. But also, in some cases, even if they could, they may choose to get 2 years of college free and then be able to transfer the credits for their 4-year education. We want to make community college, at minimum, just as free and universal as high school is today. That should be our new baseline. We want to get out ahead of the curve in terms of where we need to go. <p>Earlier today I took a new action to make it easier for students to pay for college and pay off their loans. We're creating a way for you to ask questions about your loans, file a complaint, cut through the bureaucracy, get a faster response. That's not just from the Government, that's also from the contractors who sometimes service your loans. We're going to require that the businesses that service your loans provide clear information about how much you owe, what your options are for repaying it, and if you're falling behind, help you get back in good standing with reasonable fees on a reasonable timeline. And if you're paying stuff off, you should be paying off the high-interest loans first, not the low-interest ones. We're going to take a hard look at whether we need new laws to strengthen protections for all borrowers, wherever you get your loans from. <p>So we're trying to tackle this problem from every angle. There's no silver bullet. But we're trying to make sure that across the board, more and more young people can afford to go to college and then, afterwards, aren't so burdened with debt that you can't do anything else. We want to make this experience more affordable because you're not just investing in yourselves, you're investing in your Nation. <p>But here's the thing: We've got more to do, all of us&mdash;universities, students, parents, financial institutions, and yes, the Government&mdash;to make sure that you're not saddled with debt before you even get started in life. That's something that's in all of our interests. <p>Now, my friends, the Republicans in Congress, are planning to unveil their budget soon. I'm hoping they have something to offer that will help hard-working young people. So far, the education bill that they've put forward a couple weeks ago is not a good template; it's not a good start. I'm hoping it will improve because right now, the way it's structured, it would let States and cities shuffle education dollars into things like sports stadiums or tax cuts for the wealthy instead of schools. And it would allow States to make even deeper cuts into school districts that need the most support, send even more money to the most well-off school districts. We'd invest less per child by the end of the decade than we do now. So it's the wrong approach. We've got to be working to make sure every child gets a quality education, college every student can afford. <p>And so we're going to be reaching out to them, trying to get them to see, this is a good investment in our economy, it's a good investment in our national security. The way that you keep America safe, one of the best, most important ways is to make sure we've got a strong economy with a strong workforce. And all of us have a role to play in making that happen. <p>So in order to spur more of a conversation to get more folks engaged, we're going to try something new to help do this. It's not a fancy new program. It's not&mdash;it doesn't have a complicated acronym. It doesn't involve new spending or bureaucracy. It's just a simple organizing principle that I want all of us to sign onto, a declaration of values, what I'm calling a Student Aid Bills of Rights&mdash;a Student Aid Bill of Rights. <p>And it says every student deserves access to a quality, affordable education. Every student should be able to access the resources to pay for college. Every borrower has the right to an affordable repayment plan. Every borrower has the right to quality customer service, reliable information, and fair treatment, even if they struggle to repay their loans. <p>It's a simple set of principles that if everybody signed onto&mdash;Republicans, Democrats, State legislators, university presidents, Members of Congress&mdash;it can focus our attention, all these different things that we're doing, into one simple, basic idea, which is, make sure that when you're doing the right thing, that your society has got your back and is looking out for you. <p>So based on this principle, we're going to make sure universities are using technology to help students learn at lower costs. We're going to make sure that loan servicers can find better ways to help borrowers keep up with monthly payments that they can afford. We as a country can do more to invest in Pell grants and community college to make sure quality education is affordable for everybody. <p>So we're going to just keep on moving on every front. And we want everybody who agrees with these principles to sit down and work with us and figure out how they can make these student rights real. And you've got a part to play as well. <p>You know, I&mdash;we had the great honor of being at Selma this past weekend for the 50th anniversary of the March from Selma. And one of the main points, I think, that all of us made was, change doesn't happen by itself; it happens because people get organized and mobilized and focused, and they push, and sometimes, they disrupt, and they make folks uncomfortable, and they ask questions about why is it this way instead of that way. <p>And I want us to think about access to higher education and affordability of higher education in that same way. I want us to all organize together, not on a partisan basis&mdash;it's not organizing around an election&mdash;it's organizing around a simple idea that everybody should be able to get behind. <p>And you're going to have to play the part. Because what we also made the point of this past weekend is, young people typically lead the pack: with new ideas, with new initiatives, with new focus, with a new vision. <p>So if you agree with the basic values that I outlined, if you believe in a Student Aid Bill of Rights that will help more Americans pay for a quality education, then sign your name to this declaration. You can go to a website, because you guys like tech stuff. [<i>Laughter</i>] You go to: whitehouse.gov/collegeopportunity&mdash;whitehouse.gov/collegeopportunity. Tell your families and classmates and professors to do it. I'm going to ask Members of Congress and lenders and as many business leaders as I can find to sign up. <p>We're going to mobilize a coalition around this country to get this process moving, because there are a lot of good ideas right now, but they're stalled, or they're happening piecemeal, or they're happening in one university, or they're happening in one State, and they have to happen everywhere. And we've got to mobilize the entire Nation to make that happen. And it's going to start with students themselves, because if you aren't asking for something different, if you aren't asking for help, if you're not getting mobilized, then folks aren't going to help you, and then, you'll just be complaining, especially once you graduate and you start having to write those checks. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So don't stop engaging in this issue, even after you graduate, because you'll be still impacted by it. And in the meantime, you've got to study hard and work hard and have fun. Make some new discoveries. Inspire us. Lead us. Be the Americans that we need you to be. <p>Every American should have the right to go as far as their talents and hard work will take them. That is what college is all about. That is what America is all about. And you embody that basic notion. You are that talent. You are an embodiment of what we hope for: A country that says that everybody, rich, poor, Black, White, Hispanic, Asian, gay, straight, man, woman, with disabilities, without&mdash;no matter who you are or where you come from, not only can you succeed but you can help everybody else succeed. That's the promise that helped us become the greatest nation in the world. That's the promise that I need you working for. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. Thank you, Georgia.\" "
"54" "\"Well, I want to thank everybody who is here for what's been an excellent conversation, not just about this particular facility or this particular State, but how do we make sure that the VA is working for every single veteran who's put on a uniform and has made enormous sacrifices on behalf of our country's security and freedom. <p>We all know that there have been significant problems at this facility, that the kind of cooking the books and unwillingness to face up to the fact that veterans were not being adequately served went on too long, and as a consequence, we didn't fix what needed to be fixed. <p>What I'm glad about is since Bob McDonald, working with Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson&mdash;have been able to do is to start making some progress and chipping away at the problems here. And we've brought in a new team that has been tackling these issues to make sure that wait times for scheduling, access to providers is greatly improved. <p>But what we know is that there is still more work to do. And this discussion allowed us to hone in on some problems that continue to crop up, and as a consequence, will allow us to fix them. <p>I want to thank the Members of Congress who are here. All of them have expressed great interest in how the Choice Act is being implemented. This legislation that Congress moved forward provided a lot of resources for us to be able to hire more clinicians and to beef up the services that are provided in many of the existing VA centers. But what it also did was, for folks who have difficulty getting to a VA facility, it gave them the possibility of getting a private sector provider for their care. <p>There have been some concerns expressed about whether that information is getting out to veterans as effectively as it should. There are some specific issues of implementation that Senator McCain, Senator Flake, and Congresswoman Sinema and all the Members of Congress here described. What I've committed to is making sure that we implement the Choice Act promptly and effectively and that some of the concerns that have been raised are addressed. And I know that Bob is committed to that same thing. <p>Some of the other issues that were expressed of concern revolved around mental health issues and suicide prevention. And this is an area that there's been great bipartisan work on, but there's still more to do. And I think there were some very positive suggestions that were received about how we can make progress there. <p>And the final issue that I heard a lot about today is the need to restore trust and confidence in the VA system. Trust is one of those things that you can lose real quick and then it takes some time to build. The good news is, is that there are outstanding folks here at this VA and all the VAs across the country who are deserving of trust. But it's important that veterans know that somebody has got their backs and that if there are problems that we're not being defensive about them, we're not hiding them. We're working together with the outstanding USOs and other organizations around the table to fix them. I think that process has begun, but we've got more work to do to make sure that there is a culture of customer service and there's enthusiasm and excitement and a sense of purpose and mission about serving our veterans. Because that's the kind of attitude that they brought to bear when they were out in theaters of war and serving our country, and that's what they deserve every single day up and down the chain. <p>So I'm very grateful to everybody for the input that they've provided. Last point I would make: Although we spent a lot of time talking about areas that needed improvement, although we are very pleased that we've got a outstanding former CEO from the private sector as well as a veteran in Joe Robles, who's going to be heading up our Advisory Committee to address some of these issues and work with Bob and Sloan around what we're calling MyVA, although we know that more problems will crop up because that's inevitable in an organization this large, every veteran who I talked to here today emphasized that when it came to the actual care that people were receiving once in the system, it was outstanding; that there were great doctors, great nurses, great staff who care deeply about our veterans. And obviously, a lot of those doctors, nurses, and staff are veterans themselves and understand the sacrifices that our veterans have made. <p>So there are systems that have to be fixed; there's management that has to continue to drive a renewed sense of purpose inside the VA. But we can't ignore that every single day, the VA is doing some outstanding work to provide care to our veterans. And that's not, I think, spin; that's something that we heard directly from a lot of veterans around this table. <p>And we want to thank everybody at the VA who's been doing their job and doing it well, because just the fact that there have been a few bad apples, some mistakes that have been made, systems that aren't designed to get the job done, I don't want that to detract from the outstanding work of a lot of people inside this organization. <p>So thank you very much, everybody, for what was a terrific conversation and your outstanding input. And I want to especially thank the Members of Congress who are here who, in a bipartisan fashion, have been constructive, stayed on the case, and have allocated resources to make sure that this problem gets fixed. <p>Thank you, everybody.\" "
"55" "\"Well, I just thought I'd stop by. I was in the neighborhood, and I hear there was a barbecue going on. [<i>Laughter</i>] I figured&mdash;I didn't bring my swim shorts, though. That's the only problem. I look at this pool and I&mdash;I'm thinking I wouldn't mind taking a dip. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I think a lot of folks know how I first met Cory and the relationship we've developed. There aren't that many people that I've met during the course of my Presidency or my life that have inspired me more. Cory already inspired me as a Ranger when he was fighting to keep this country safe. In some ways, I was even more inspired when he had to fight back against some devastating injuries that he received defending our freedom and our liberty, along with his fellow Rangers. <p>And to watch, day in, day out, the kind of effort and the kind of positive attitude, the kind of \\"never give up, never give in\\" heart that this guy had&mdash;that's the kind of thing that keeps me going every single day. <p>The greatest honor of my life is serving as Commander in Chief to the greatest military the world's ever known. To know that that spirit continues even after somebody has come back from war theater, and maybe is drawn on even more, that just makes me want to work that much harder. <p>To Craig and Annie and the whole family, the way they have helped to make sure that all that effort Cory has put in has resulted now in him not just walking and talking, but working and helping his fellow veterans with the care that they need is just remarkable. But then, to also see how the community has rallied to help him couldn't make me prouder to be an American. <p>And I just want to, in addition to Craig and Annie&mdash;and I should have mentioned Leo&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;the folks who helped make this incredible home possible, the Army Ranger Lead the Way Fund, and we are so grateful to you for that outstanding work. Jared Allen couldn't be here, but I know that the Homes for Wounded Warriors and everything that he's been doing; for the whole community of Gilbert and the folks who rallied around to make this possible; to the craftsmen&mdash;I mean, I was looking at some of the details inside this home&mdash;and people volunteering their time and their effort to make this an incredible place where Cory is going to be able to work out and, I suspect, watch quite a few sports programs&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;have the occasional libation&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;it speaks to who we are as a country and who we are as a people. <p>So I just want to say thank you to all of you. I'm obviously most proud of Cory. But in the same way that he served and protected us, it's good to know that we want to give back and make sure we're there for him too when it's needed. And I think this is a story that I hope everybody, not just in Arizona, but all across the country, remembers. <p>And that we know that there are a whole bunch of Corys out there. Not all the wounds are as easily seen. And we've got to be just as vigilant and just as generous and just as focused in making sure that every single one of our men and women in uniform, that they're getting what they've earned and what they deserve. So, Cory, God bless you, man. Rangers lead the way.\" "
"56" "\"Hi, everybody. Earlier this week, I visited with students at Georgia Tech to talk about the importance of higher education in the new economy and how we can make it more affordable. <p>In an economy increasingly built on innovation, the most important skill you can sell is your knowledge. That's why higher education is, more than ever, the surest ticket to the middle class. But just when it's never been more important, it's also never been more expensive. The average undergrad who borrows to pay for college ends up graduating with about $28,000 in student loan debt. <p>That's why my administration has worked hard to make college more affordable. We expanded tax credits and Pell grants, enacted the largest reform to student loan programs in history, and fought to keep interest rates on student loans low. We've acted to let millions of graduates cap loan payments at 10 percent of their income so they don't have to choose between paying the rent and paying back their debt. I've sent Congress my plan to bring the cost of community college down to zero, because 2 years of higher education should be as free and universal as high school is today. <p>But all of us, elected officials, universities, business leaders&mdash;everybody needs to do more to bring down college costs. Which is why this week, I unveiled another way that we can help more Americans afford college. It doesn't involve any new spending or bureaucracy. It's a simple declaration of values, what I call a Student Aid Bill of Rights. It says that every student deserves access to a quality, affordable education; every student should be able to access the resources to pay for college; every borrower has the right to an affordable repayment plan; and every borrower has the right to quality customer service, reliable information, and fair treatment, even if they struggle to repay their loans. <p>That's it, just a few simple principles. But if we all rally around these principles, there's a lot that colleges, lenders, and the people you sent to Washington and to your State legislatures can do to realize them across the country. <p>So if you believe in a Student Aid Bill of Rights that will help more Americans pay for a quality education, I'm asking you to visit whitehouse.gov/collegeopportunity. Sign your name to this declaration. Tell your families and your friends and fellow students&mdash;I'm going to ask Members of Congress and lenders and as many business leaders as I can find&mdash;because making sure that students aren't saddled with debt before they even get started in life is in all our interests. <p>In America, a higher education cannot be a privilege reserved for only the few. It has to be available to everybody who's willing to work for it. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"57" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you! [<i>applause</i>] Thank you so much. Thank you. Please have a seat. Thank you so much. What a beautiful evening. Everybody looks wonderful. It's like Downton Abbey, except less funny. [<i>laughter</i>] This is my third appearance at this dinner as President. And I predict you will laugh harder than ever. I'm not saying I'm any funnier. I'm saying weed is now legal in D.C. [<i>laughter and applause</i>] I know that's how you guys are getting through this dinner. That's why you ate the food. [<i>laughter</i>]<p>This is also my first gridiron with a new press secretary, Josh Earnest, who's doing a great job. [<i>applause</i>] The other day, Josh came into the Oval and he said, \\"I've got good news and bad news. The good news is that people are finally rallying around their charismatic African-American president. The bad news &mdash; it's Clarence Page.\\" [<i>laughter</i>]<p>Clarence and I go way back.<p><i>Mr. Page.</i> Way back.<p><i>The President.</i> Way back. Before he took office, he felt comfortable asking me for tips on a being a successful black president. [<i>laughter</i>] And I told him, you want to keep your birth certificate handy. [<i>laughter and applause</i>]<p>Now, let's face it, being President does age you. I mean, look at me. [<i>laughter</i>] I was hoping Fred Thompson would be the Republican speaker so I could buy a reverse mortgage. [<i>laughter and applause</i>] You start getting crankier as you get older. Next week, I'm signing an executive order to get off my lawn. [<i>laughter</i>] And getting older changes you. For example, coffee really disagrees with me these days &mdash; which is why John Boehner just invited coffee to address the joint House. [<i>laughter</i>]<p>It is amazing, though, how time flies. Just a few years ago, I could never imagine ever being in my fifties. And when it comes to my approval ratings, I still can't. [<i>laughter</i>] I mean, think about how things have changed since 2008. Back then, I was the young, tech-savvy candidate of the future. Now I'm yesterday's news and Hillary has got a server in her house. [<i>laughter</i>] I didn't even know you could have one of those in your house. [<i>laughter and applause</i>] I am so far behind. Did you know that? I would have gotten one.<p>On the bright side, by the time I'm done with this job, I will finally have enough life experience for a memoir. [<i>laughter</i>]<p>My Vice President isn't here tonight. He told me, \\"If I want to hear people talking for five hours straight, I'll just stay home alone.\\" [<i>laughter</i>] And, by the way, this is just a quick aside &mdash; Joe rubs my shoulders too. [<i>laughter</i>] I just wanted everybody to know. He does. It's not bad, it feels pretty good. I don't let him give me a pedicure, but &mdash; [<i>laughter</i>]<p>Of course, I want to acknowledge my fellow speakers tonight. Give it up for Terry McAuliffe &mdash; [<i>applause</i>] &mdash; the Governor of Virginia and the mayor of \\"This Town.\\" Terry loves fundraising. He's the first person who's actually been upset to learn you can't ask people for tons of money once you become the Governor of Virginia. Well, except maybe the previous Governor of Virginia. [<i>laughter</i>]<p>I also want to congratulate Scott Walker. He did a great job tonight. Give it up for him. [<i>applause</i>] Governor Perry, don't you think he did a great job tonight? I noticed you weren't clapping that much.<p>This lame duck stuff is fun. [<i>laughter</i>]<p>Despite a great performance tonight, Scott has had a few recent stumbles. The other week he said he didn't know whether or not I was a Christian. And I was taken aback, but fortunately my faith teaches us forgiveness. So, Governor Walker, as-salamu alaykum. [<i>laughter and applause</i>]<p>Scott also recently punted on a question of evolution, which I do think is a problem. I absolutely believe in the theory of evolution &mdash; when it comes to gay marriage.<p>And, finally, Governor Walker got some heat for staying silent when Rudy Giuliani said I don't love America &mdash; which I also think is a problem. Think about it, Scott &mdash; if I did not love America, I wouldn't have moved here from Kenya. [<i>laughter and applause</i>] Still trying to deal with the overstaying the visa thing. But hopefully the court is okay with the immigration initiatives.<p>Governors Walker and Perry are not the only possible 2016-ers here tonight. We also have Dr. Ben Carson. He wants to make it clear that being here was a choice. The fact is, Doctor, embracing homosexuality is not something you do because you go to prison. It's something you do because your Vice President can't keep a secret on \\"Meet the Press.\\" [<i>laughter</i>]<p>But for all the gaffes, all the slip-ups, I think 2016 will come down to the issues. For example, equal pay. Did you know that the average male presidential candidate earns $150,000 less per speech than a woman doing the same job? [<i>laughter</i>] It's terrible. We got to fix that.<p>And we can't just focus on 2016, people. We just had an election. This new Congress is just getting started, which is why I want to acknowledge the leader of the House Republicans &mdash; as soon as I figure out who that is. [<i>laughter</i>]<p>The fact is, I really genuinely like John Boehner. But from your press reports, I gather he may be in real trouble. Over the past several weeks, many of you have been writing about a possible conservative coup &mdash; or as Bill O'Reilly calls it, \\"reporting from the war zone.\\" He's been sniffing around. The good news is, Bill has an eyewitness who can back up some of his claims. The bad news, of course, is that it's Brian Williams. <p>And as much as I like to make fun of my friends in the GOP and the media, it's not like this is an easy time to be a Democrat. They're turning last year's midterms into a movie; it's called \\"50 Shades of Red.\\"<p>But, as was noted, we are determined to bounce back. The Democratic Party recently analyzed the midterm elections, and concluded we have to spend more time focused on older white voters &mdash; which is why I'm here. [<i>laughter and applause</i>]<p>Staying focused, moving forward &mdash; it's not always easy in this climate. I mean, you guys are always picking us apart. Recently, I made some comments about the Crusades, and people started blowing it all out of proportion, scrutinizing every single word. What is this, the Spanish Inquisition? [<i>laughter</i>]<p>And then I got flak for appearing on a video for BuzzFeed, trying to reach younger voters. What nonsense. You know, you don't diminish your office by taking a selfie. You do it by sending a poorly written letter to Iran. [<i>laughter and applause</i>] Really, that wasn't a joke. <p>Now, as with everyone else, I want to end the night by saying something a little more serious. We are producing and consuming news in ways that we couldn't have imagined a few years ago, let alone a few decades ago. But I believe that having access to more information than ever hasn't diminished people's hunger for understanding that news, and processing it. And they want to see an even deeper sense of what's going on in their world because of so much change.<p>And as much as politicians and the press go at it sometimes, I think that without the outstanding work that so many of you do every single day, then our need for understanding will not be met and our democracy will be poor.<p>When there's a crisis playing out around the world, or a milestone in our history like the one that we commemorated at Selma last week, we count on you to provide context, to see past the superficial, and in some cases, to risk everything in pursuit of the true story, and to hold us &mdash; those of us in power &mdash; to account.<p>So while the world of media may be changing, I am confident that our democracy will always be able to rely on the tradition represented by the reporters in this room: your persistence, your dedication, and your lifelong commitment to helping all of us better understand this world. That's how our democracy works. And we are very grateful for the job that you do.<p>So thank you, God bless you. And God bless one of the many countries that I love. [<i>laughter and applause</i>] Thank you.\" "
"58" "\"Okay, well, I want to thank the Council of the Great City Schools. This is an organization that represents superintendents and board members and educators from some of the largest school districts in the country. And we just had a terrific conversation about some of the extraordinary progress that's being made at the local levels. <p>The good news is that we are seeing, as a consequence of some of the reforms that we've initiated and partnered with at the State and local levels&mdash;we're seeing improved reading scores, improved math scores, improved graduation rates. We're seeing improvement in some of the previously lowest performing schools. <p>And this organization, I think, has taken on the challenge and has been able to begin a process of turning school districts around and making sure that young people are getting the kind of education that they need to be able to compete in the 21st century. That's the good news. <p>The challenge that we face is that this is a monumental task, and it requires resources. And I'm very proud of what we've been able to do in terms of helping schools to initiate improvements in how they train teachers, in how they engage kids in the classroom, in how they start moving education around math and science and technology, how they reach populations that are particularly difficult to reach, how they're bringing new technology into the classroom. But all that is dependent on a budget and an approach at the Federal level that says we care about all kids and not just some. <p>Now, the Republican House and Senate are about to put forward their budget. My hope is that their budget reflects the priorities of educating every child. But I can tell you that if the budget maintains sequester-level funding, then we would actually be spending less on pre-K to 12th grade in America's schools in terms of Federal support than we were back in 2000. And that's adjusting for inflation. The notion that we would be going backwards instead of forwards in how we're devoting resources to educating our kids makes absolutely no sense. <p>In addition, we've got a major debate obviously taking place about the reauthorization of the major education act that shapes Federal policy towards our schools. There is, I think, some useful conversations taking place between the chairman of the relevant committee, Lamar Alexander, and Patty Murray. But there's some core principles that all the leaders here believe in. Making sure that we continue to provide resources to the poorest school districts and not creating a situation where we can suddenly shift dollars from wealthy districts&mdash;or from poorer districts to wealthy districts, or alternatively, that education aid suddenly can start going to sport stadiums or tax cuts at the State level. That's something that these school districts feel very strongly about. <p>Making sure that we continue to focus on low-performing schools and that they are getting additional resources. Making sure that we are continuing to assess in a smart way, on an annual basis, how young people are performing, and that we're disaggregating so that we can see in various subgroups how young people are performing to make sure they're on track. That's something that people here care very much about. Making sure that we've got high standards and high expectations for all our kids, and making sure that we are providing the resources to teachers and principals to meet those high standards. That's going to be important. <p>Making sure that we are investing in special education and English learning for large portions of our student population that may need extra help. That's going to be critically important. <p>So there are a set of principles that are reflected in my budget and I hope will be reflected in the Republican budget. But if it is not, then we're going to have to have a major debate. We are making too much progress now in terms of graduation rates, improved reading scores, improved math scores, increasing standards, increasing access to the resources the kids need for us to be going backwards now. And this is something worth fighting for. <p>So I am very grateful for all the folks here for the work they're doing. I hope that people will get familiar with some of the stories of progress that have been made. If you look at what's happened in the DC public schools, or you look at the efforts that are being made in places like Fresno, which&mdash;it's a poor city in a poor school district, but despite that is seeing real strides. You look at what's going on in Cleveland, where I'll be visiting tomorrow [Wednesday]*. These are school districts that, despite enormous challenges, have made real progress.<p>And the idea that we'd go backwards on that progress, in some cases for ideological reasons, as opposed to because of what the evidence says, that's something that&mdash;that's not the kind of legacy we want to leave for the next generation. And I'm going to continue to fight to make sure that this progress continues. <p>So I want to thank everybody who's around this table and know that they're going to have a strong partner in my administration. <p>All right? Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"59" "\"Hello. To everyone celebrating Nowruz, across the United States and in countries around the world: <i>Nowruz Mubarak.</i> <p>For thousands of years, this has been a time to gather with family and friends and welcome a new spring and a new year. Last week, my wife Michelle helped mark Nowruz here at the White House. It was a celebration of the vibrant cultures, food, music, and friendship of our many diaspora communities who make extraordinary contributions every day here in the United States. We even created our own <i>Haft Seen</i>, representing our hopes for the new year. <p>This year, that includes our hopes for progress between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the international community, including the United States. So I want to take this opportunity once again to speak directly to the people and leaders of Iran. As you gather around the Nowruz table&mdash;from Tehran to Shiraz to Tabriz, from the coasts of the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf&mdash;you're giving thanks for your blessings and looking ahead to the future. <p>This year, we have the best opportunity in decades to pursue a different future between our countries. Just over a year ago, we reached an initial understanding regarding Iran's nuclear program. And both sides have kept our commitments. Iran has halted progress on its nuclear program and even rolled it back in some areas. The international community, including the United States, has provided Iran with some relief from sanctions. Now our diplomats&mdash;and our scientists&mdash;are engaged in negotiations in the hopes of finding a comprehensive solution that resolves the world's concerns with Iran's nuclear program. <p>The days and weeks ahead will be critical. Our negotiations have made progress, but gaps remain. And there are people, in both our countries and beyond, who oppose a diplomatic resolution. My message to you, the people of Iran, is that, together, we have to speak up for the future we seek. <p>As I have said many times before, I believe that our countries should be able to resolve this issue peacefully, with diplomacy. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has issued a fatwa against the development of nuclear weapons, and President Rouhani has said that Iran would never develop a nuclear weapon. Together with the international community, the United States has said that Iran should have access to peaceful nuclear energy, consistent with Iran's international obligations. So there is a way for Iran&mdash;if it is willing to take meaningful, verifiable steps&mdash;to assure the world that its nuclear program is, in fact, for peaceful purposes only. <p>In this sense, Iran's leaders have a choice between two paths. If they cannot agree to a reasonable deal, they will keep Iran on the path it's on today, a path that has isolated Iran and the Iranian people from so much of the world, caused so much hardship for Iranian families, and deprived so many young Iranians the jobs and opportunities they deserve. <p>On the other hand, if Iran's leaders can agree to a reasonable deal, it can lead to a better path, the path of greater opportunities for the Iranian people: more trade and ties with the world; more foreign investment and jobs, including for young Iranians; more cultural exchanges and chances for Iranian students to travel abroad; more partnerships in areas like science and technology and innovation. In other words, a nuclear deal now can help open the door to a brighter future for you, the Iranian people, who, as heirs to a great civilization, have so much to give the world. <p>This is what's at stake today. And this moment may not come again soon. I believe that our nations have an historic opportunity to resolve this issue peacefully, an opportunity we should not miss. As the poet Hafez wrote: \\"It is early spring. Try to be joyful in your heart. For many a flower will bloom while you will be in clay.\\" <p>For decades, our nations have been separated by mistrust and fear. Now it is early spring. We have a chance&mdash;a chance&mdash;to make progress that will benefit our countries and the world for many years to come. Now it is up to all of us, Iranians and Americans, to seize this moment and the possibilities that can bloom in this new season. <p>Thank you, and <i>Nowruzetan Pirooz.</i>\" "
"60" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello! Thank you so much, everybody! Have a seat. Well, hello, everybody, and welcome to the second annual White House Film Festival. It's like the Sundance or Cannes of film festivals that are open to the public through a Government website. [<i>Laughter</i>] It may also be the only film festival where one of the entrants has his tooth loose. [<i>Laughter</i>] And is&mdash;may pull it out right here at the ceremony. [<i>Laughter</i>] Everybody looks wonderful, of course. You'll be disappointed to know I will not be doing a musical number based on this year's films. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Aww. <p><i>The President.</i> That's the job of your emcees, Kalpen and Terrence J. Give them a big round of applause. I don't know if they'll be doing musical numbers either. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I do want to thank the folks at the American Film Institute and Participant Media for partnering with us on this event. Thank you very much. Give them a big round of applause. <p>I want to give a shout out to all the honorees' dates tonight, which I assume are either parents or teachers or somebody who's supported these outstanding young people every step of the way. And of course, most importantly, let's give it up to our outstanding young filmmakers! [<i>Applause</i>] Yay! Yay! <p>So I love this event. This is the second year that we've hosted the White House Student Film Festival, and it's a great example of what happens when we just unleash the skills and the imagination of America's young people. In this country, if we give all of our kids the best opportunities and technology and resources, there's no telling what they'll create, now and the years ahead. <p>This year, we received more than 1,500 submissions that came from all across the country, actually, even came as far as Azerbaijan. Our theme was \\"The Impact of Giving Back.\\" And today we are proud to honor our 15 official selections, because these aren't just great films, but they're great examples of how young people are making a difference all over the country. <p>Today we're celebrating a 6-year-old in Montana. [<i>Applause</i>] Is that you? He's the guy without&mdash;he's missing teeth and&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. But he's also challenging us to see conservation through a child's eyes. <p>We're honoring a young man's story of service to his family and our environment in his Navajo Nation, Navajo tradition; a teenager who started a wheelchair challenge and raised tens of thousands of dollars to make his school more accessible to folks with disabilities; a third-grade superhero who wears a cape as he delivers clothes and food to the homeless. You see, even in indie film festivals, superhero movies are infiltrating. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm going to have to see \\"Super Ewan 2\\" next summer. [<i>Laughter</i>] There's going to be a sequel. <p>And then there are two young women, Allyson Edwards and Madison Jaco, who adopted a highway to clean up the roads in their hometown of Hawkins, Texas. Where are these young ladies? Raise your hands. A little higher. There you go. So they decided they wanted to make an even bigger impact, so they reached out to young people all across the globe&mdash;and this is part of the power of the Internet&mdash;and now you've got groups in India, France, Nigeria, Benin, Argentina, all getting into the act&mdash;cleaning up their schools and beaches and roads&mdash;just because of these two young women. <p>And as Allyson and Madison say in their film, \\"In today's society, we're often told how much we are different and how much divides us, but through our shared community service, we realized how much brings us together.\\" That's a profound statement, guys. [<i>Laughter</i>] I don't think I was that smart when I was your age. <p>But that's the idea that lies at the heart of service: empathy, understanding, being able to make a connection. And as these young people are showing us, it's a message that can be told powerfully through film, because that's a media that connects us with people and stories we might otherwise never know. And it puts us in the shoes of people on&mdash;potentially on the other side of the world or a neighborhood very different than the one we grew up in. And that's true whether you're a middle schooler with a GoPro or a Hollywood director on a custom-made soundstage. <p>Now, we know that if today's middle schoolers are going to become those big-time directors&mdash;and we've got some big-time folks here. I mean, is Steve McQueen here? Has filmed \\"12 Years a Slave.\\" It was a big Oscar winner last year and a profound film. And we appreciate his presence here today. So you guys could get some tips. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But the next Steve McQueen or Scorsese or Spielberg or documentarian like Ken Burns&mdash;if we're going to make sure that these young people have those opportunities, then we've got to do our part to support them. <p>That means we've got to give them a world-class education, access to science and technology and engineering and math, as well as the arts. It means that they've got to have access to the technology they need to learn and explore and grow. <p>It's not optional to have access to that technology in today's world. That's one of the reasons I launched the ConnectED initiative: to connect 99 percent of our students to next-generation broadband and wireless. Because when we expect free WiFi with our coffee, then we should at least have it in our schools and our libraries too. <p>And the good news is, we're making great progress. More than 1,800 school districts have pledged to bring high-speed broadband and digital learning to their students. Companies have committed billions of dollars in free technology for schools and libraries around the country. And it's making a difference. Students in rural Alabama used software donated by Adobe to make a music video that won first place in a contest and then earned their school $10,000 of new musical equipment. So we know this can make a difference. <p>But we also know that it takes more than technology to help our kids thrive: parents, teachers, people who love and inspire them, coaches, mentors to help guide their way. So today, as part of our \\"United We Serve\\" effort, I'm proud to announce that AFI and the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists are pairing up to give each of the young filmmakers here a mentor who can bring out the best of them in the months ahead. Now, that's pretty cool. [<i>Applause</i>] What do you think? Right? <p>And the organizations are also reaching beyond these young people. They're going to pledge a million hours of educational and mentoring programs for young people across the country over the next 3 years, which is a remarkable commitment, so we want to thank AFI and SAG-AFTRA for that wonderful contribution. We've seen how impactful these mentoring experiences can be. I'll just take a minute to give you one example, the story of a young woman who we honored here last year named Shelly Ortiz. And Shelly made this wonderful video&mdash;is Shelly here? <p><i>Student filmmaker Shelly Ortiz.</i> Yes! <p><i>The President</i>. There you are. There's Shelly. Good to see you. So I'm going to brag about you for a second. <p>So Shelly made a great video about how technology in her classroom helped fuel her passion for filmmaking. But when Shelly came to the White House, she was still working on another project that meant a lot to her, which was a short documentary about how her father was abandoned by his mom as a child and all the ramifications, what that meant. <p>After the festival, AFI connected her with an accomplished documentarian, who served as her mentor, in giving Shelly detailed notes and the confidence to take risks as a director. A few months later, Shelly's documentary was featured at AFI's International Documentary Festival. Pretty cool. And today, she says that the mentoring she received and the technology she's been given didn't just help her become a better filmmaker, it helped her become closer than ever with her dad. <p>So that's the power of what is being done here. Experiences like these aren't just about a young person's future career. They're about helping them to connect in new and meaningful ways, whether it's somebody as close as your parents or somebody on an iPad halfway around the world who may share more in common with you than you think. <p>And we don't know what these new connections will produce down the road, but if these movies are any indication, I know that these young people are going to make an even bigger impact for their communities and their country in the years ahead. <p>So I'm proud of you. Keep up the great work. I can't stay to watch them all, but I'm going to get them all digitally. And I'm going to give them big thumbs-up. All right. Thank you. I'm really proud of you guys. Now it's time to begin our feature presentations. So see you guys!\" "
"61" "\"Hi, everybody. One of the most important positions in the President's Cabinet&mdash;and to our national security, our law enforcement, and our criminal justice system&mdash;is the Attorney General. <p>It's been more than 4 months since I nominated Loretta Lynch to serve as the next Attorney General of the United States. For 30 years, Loretta has distinguished herself as a tough, fair, and independent attorney. As the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, she successfully prosecuted the terrorists who plotted to bomb the Federal Reserve Bank and the New York City subway. She helped secure billions in settlements for people wronged by some of the world's biggest banks. She's been dogged in her pursuit of public corruption. She's jailed some of New York's most violent and notorious mobsters and gang members. And through it all, she's worked closely with law enforcement and local communities to get the job done. <p>In short, her qualifications are superb. That's why, in the past, the Senate easily confirmed Loretta to lead one of the most prominent U.S. attorney offices in the country, not once, but twice. <p>Still, it has been more than 4 months since I nominated Loretta Lynch to serve as Attorney General. And this time, Republican leaders in Congress won't even let her nomination come up for a vote. In fact, by Monday, Loretta will have been languishing on the Senate floor for longer than the seven previous Attorney Generals combined. Let me say that again: She will have been waiting for a simple yes-or-no vote on the Senate floor for longer than the seven previous Attorneys General combined. <p>No one can claim she's unqualified. No one's saying she can't do the job. Senators from both parties say they support her. This is purely about politics. First, Republicans held up her nomination because they were upset about the actions I took to make our broken immigration system smarter and fairer. Now they're denying her a vote until they can figure out how to pass a bill on a completely unrelated issue. But they could bring her up for a yes-or-no vote at any time. <p>Republicans promised that Congress would function smoothly with them in charge. Here's a small chance for them to prove it. Congress should stop playing politics with law enforcement and national security. They should support good people in both parties who want to reform our criminal justice system. And that means they should end the longest confirmation process for an Attorney General in three decades and give Loretta Lynch a vote. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"62" "\"Thank you so much. Thank you. Please have a seat. Well, thank you, everybody. And let me begin by thanking Penny Pritzker for her outstanding leadership. We've got six Cabinet Secretaries and dozens of U.S. Ambassadors here, which should tell you that SelectUSA is a major priority for this administration. Since I was here with you 17 months ago, this gathering has doubled in size. So I want to thank all 2,600 of you: elected officials and local leaders from across this country and business leaders from around the world. Thank you for making this a priority as well. <p>The fact is, there's never been a more exciting time for us to do business together. And today I want to talk about why America is not only the right place for you to invest, but why America is the safest, strongest, smartest place for you to invest than we've been in a very long time. <p>After the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, America is now in the midst of the longest streak of private sector job growth on record: 60 straight months, 12 million new jobs. Businesses in America have added more than 200,000 jobs each month for 12 straight months. That's the first time that's happened in nearly 40 years. <p>Our unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of 10 percent in 2009 to 5.5 percent today. After a decade of outsourcing, we're starting to bring good jobs back to America. Over the last 5 years, manufacturers have added jobs at a rate not seen since the 1980s. In fact, the manufacturing sector is actually growing faster than the rest of the economy. And last week, I announced nearly $500 million in new public and private investment in strengthening American manufacturing. <p>And even though the United States is already home to more foreign direct investment than any other country in the world, we've worked hard to address some of the challenges that held us back for too long. Our high school graduation rate is now at an alltime high. More young people are earning their college degrees than ever before. Our energy production is booming, our energy costs are low, our leadership on climate change is restored. On the fiscal front, our deficits have shrunk by two-thirds. Our health care costs are flattening out for the first time in half a century. <p>Over the past 6 years, we've worked hard to make ourselves a smarter place to invest and to do business than any other country in the world. So we've got a good story to tell. And that's one reason I created SelectUSA, the first-ever Government-wide initiative to encourage more companies from around the world to invest and create jobs right here in the United States. We've got a good story to tell, but we wanted to make sure all of you had a chance to hear it. And the SelectUSA team wakes up every morning with one mission: bringing job-creating investment to the United States of America. It's a kind of one-stop shop, sort of a match-making service for investment. <p>Economic development organizations from around the country can connect with foreign investors from around the world who are interested in bringing their businesses here. Now, understand, a lot of State and local leaders in this room have been working tirelessly for a long time to attract foreign investment. The idea behind SelectUSA is just to make it easier for you to do that and easier for our international partners to find the best opportunities. <p>And by the beginning of this year, SelectUSA had assisted more than a thousand clients, helping to generate more than $20 billion of investment in the United States, investment that has spurred economic growth and created jobs all across the country. The companies in this room have invested $13 billion over the last year, which will create an estimated 32,500 new jobs. <p>So what's great about SelectUSA is that everybody wins. Communities that welcome foreign investors see more jobs and economic activity, and they can reach more potential investors. The companies that invest in America have access to the largest market in the world, and it's a market that is strong and stable and growing. <p>And one thing I want to emphasize: It's not just big corporations or billion-dollar investments that make a difference. With the help of SelectUSA, for example, a Canadian company named Peds Legwear invested $7 million to rescue a failing sock company in Burke County, North Carolina. And that investment saved 45 jobs. They recently cut the ribbon on a new plant that will ultimately create more than 200 new jobs. [<i>Laughter</i>] Had a little cheer back there. [<i>Applause</i>] That's good. <p>With the help from SelectUSA, Reha Technology, a Swiss medical robotics firm, just announced its merger with an American company called Interactive Motion Technologies. The new company will headquarter in Watertown, Massachusetts, and today it's announcing a new $5 million investment to expand this year. <p>So we're seeing real results from SelectUSA, and we want to build on that momentum and get even more of you to invest. So today we're going to expand and improve our services. We're launching a new partnership between State and Federal economic development officials. We're launching the SelectUSA Academy, with online and onsite training programs for investors. We're improving our online investment tools, helping companies identify State-based incentives so that they can decide where to invest. <p>So for companies considering new investment here, I want to be as clear as possible. The United States of America is the best place in the world to do business. We've got the most skilled and productive workers, the best universities, the most innovative entrepreneurs in the world. We're the global leader in patents, home not only to more R&D investment than any other country, but to nearly one-third of all R&D investment in the world. Our access to global markets makes it easy to ship goods made in the U.S.A. around the world. Our commitment to the rule of law and strong intellectual property protections make America a dependable place to innovate and do business. <p>And we're a country that always believes we can do better, a country that adapts and advances and sets new standards for new times. It's one of the reasons why I have put forward a budget for this coming fiscal year that reflects the realities of the new economy. We're going to give workers and businesses the tools they need to succeed in a fast-paced, highly competitive, constantly changing world. And that means new investments in education, new investments in job training, including making 2 years of community college free, because we want to make sure that our workers continue to be prepared to fill the jobs that you intend to bring here. It means new investments in manufacturing and 21st-century infrastructure that 21st-century businesses need. We're modernizing ports, strengthening our bridges, making Internet and wireless and broadband far more accessible more quickly. Now, that's my budget. I recognize there's something called Congress here, and we've got&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;there are going to be some negotiations taking place. So far, Republicans in Congress have put forward a different kind of budget. But I'm confident that we can find a way forward. I'm confident that we can find a path that doesn't undermine our standing, but strengthens it. Because the things that help businesses grow are not partisan. There shouldn't be anything partisan about making sure that our kids get the best education possible or that we've got world-class infrastructure. <p>We're working together on a bipartisan trade promotion authority and strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren't just free but are also fair and reciprocal, trade deals that help businesses grow our exports and put American workers first. And I'm confident we can, together, reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United States, giving our businesses one more tool that they need to compete. <p>Today I'm pleased to announce a new action I'm also taking to make it easier for global companies who are present here today to launch and invest in the U.S. My administration is going to reform the L-1B visa category, which allows corporations to temporarily move workers from a foreign office to a U.S. office in a faster, simpler way. And this could benefit hundreds of thousands of nonimmigrant workers and their employers; that, in turn, will benefit our entire economy and spur additional investment. <p>Of course, as all of you know, one of the things that would make America even more attractive to businesses and that would grow our economy and shrink our deficits and keep this country safer, stronger, and smarter would be a comprehensive immigration reform package. And that's why I'm going to continue to push and prod and poke and cajole friends in the Republican Party to get on board and help us get this done. We need to get immigration reform done here in the United States of America. That's who we are. <p>So the bottom line is this: America is proudly open for business, and we want to make it as simple and as attractive for you to set up shop here as is possible. That is what this summit is all about. I hope you take full advantage of the opportunities that are here. This is a pretty good networking session. I can't even see the folks way out in the back. [<i>Laughter</i>] There is&mdash;there are a lot of deals to be done right here under this roof. And I hope that everybody is going to take full advantage of it. <p>Because we're committed to SelectUSA for the long haul. We are committed to building partnerships with you so that our companies and our communities can thrive together. And we intend to be with you not just today or tomorrow, but in the years and decades ahead. <p>That's my commitment to you. Because we are confident that if you invest in any of the communities that are represented here, what you will find is not only outstanding workers and not just outstanding infrastructure and not just an extraordinary market and not just cheap energy, but what you will find is that the American people like doing business and they respect business, and they're looking forward to working with you to make sure that your companies succeed, and that the faith that you place in those communities is ultimately going to result in outstanding results for your company. All right? <p>Thank you very much, everybody. Good luck.\" "
"63" "\"<i>The President</i>. Hello, everybody! Hello, hello! Thank you. Everybody, have a seat. Thank you. Hello, scientists. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Science Fair participants</i>. Hello! <p><i>The President</i>. So this is&mdash;got to be the most fun event of the year. [<i>Laughter</i>] At least in the top three. And before I go any further, though, I need to lay down some rules. We had to put these in place based on the previous science fairs. First of all, no taking your robots or electric go-carts for a spin on the South Lawn. [<i>Laughter</i>] You can't do that. Rule number two, if you're going to explode something, you have to warn us first. [<i>Laughter</i>] Actually, don't&mdash;just don't explode anything. [<i>Laughter</i>] Number three, no using a marshmallow air cannon in the house&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;unless you let me shoot it first. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>This is our fifth White House Science Fair. And every year, I walk out smarter than I walked in, because these young people have something to teach all of us, not just about batteries or attacking cancer cells or how to build a working robot or a rocket. I will say, though, the robots I see keep getting smarter every year. We are keeping an eye on that, by the way. [<i>Laughter</i>] You're on notice, Skynet. <p>But these young scientists and engineers teach us something beyond the specific topics that they're exploring. They teach us how to question assumptions, to wonder why something is the way it is and how we can make it better. And they remind us that there's always something more to learn and to try and to discover and to imagine, and that it's never too early or too late to create or discover something new. <p>That's why we love science. It's more than a school subject or the periodic table or the properties of waves. It is an approach to the world, a critical way to understand and explore and engage with the world, and then have the capacity to change that world and to share this accumulated knowledge. It's a mindset that says we that can use reason and logic and honest inquiry to reach new conclusions and solve big problems. And that's what we are celebrating here today with these amazing young people. <p>Now, first of all, I'm going to announce the people who are not that young, although some of them are youngish. We're joined by some of America's top scientists and engineers, starting with my Science Adviser, John Holdren. [<i>Applause</i>] Yay, John. The Director of the National Institutes of Health, Francis Collins, is here. The head of our Patent and Trademark Office&mdash;so, young people, if you've got something fancy, talk to Michelle Lee right here. She's ready to sign you up. The Acting Director of the U.S. Geological Survey, Suzette Kimball, is here. And somebody who has one of the coolest jobs in town, the head of NASA, Charles Bolden, is here. Where's Charlie? If there are any aspiring astronauts here, he's the man to impress. [<i>Laughter</i>] He's been in space himself. <p>We also have some outstanding guests who are here who have been participating in this on an ongoing basis. Bill Nye, the Science Guy, is here. Signature bow tie. So is Rush Holt, who's one of the few scientists to serve in Congress. We could probably use some more. There you go. Rush is now the head of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. And just so you knew that athletes think science is cool too, we've got Victor Cruz of the New York Giants here. He is a big fan of science. And he has to be. As an all-pro wide receiver, he's got to figure out trajectories and angles and velocities and the physics of doing the salsa. [<i>Laughter</i>] For those of you who don't know, he does a salsa every time he gets a touchdown, and he gets a lot of them. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, Victor has been here before to celebrate the New York Giants winning the Super Bowl. But as I've said many times before, we've got to celebrate the winners of our science fairs as much as we celebrate the winners of football or basketball or other athletic competitions, because young scientists, mathematicians, engineers, they're critical to our future. You guys are the ones who are going to define the contours of the 21st century. <p>And I just had a chance to meet some of these young people. And I fired a lot of questions at them, and they know their stuff. It is unbelievable what so many of these young people have accomplished at such an early age. And I wish I could talk about every single one of them because all of them were extraordinarily impressive. But I want to leave enough time for everybody else to explore some of their exhibits. John Holdren probably wants me to get some of their r&eacute;sum&eacute;s&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;in case we're hiring. But let me just mention a few of the young people that I had a chance to talk to, to give you a sense of the scope and depth and quality of the work that they're doing. <p>So, first of all, we've got Sophia S&aacute;nchez-Maes, who's here from Las Cruces, New Mexico. Where's Sophia? I just talked to her. Did she get in? [<i>Laughter</i>] There she is, right there. The&mdash;Sophia is a senior in high school, and she is crazy about algae. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, to the non-science buffs here, you might say, what's so great about algae? But Sophia knows that algae is fascinating, especially as a potential fuel source. <p>So scientists are already working to turn algae into fuel. One of the hurdles is to make the process more efficient so less energy gets wasted along the way. Sophia saw that was a challenge. She asked why. She has created a more efficient method. She's identified optimal algae to use in her method, and she's helping to bring the world closer to using algae as a clean, renewable, and even inexhaustible energy source. And it's already being tested in her hometown, the process that she's developing. It is amazing. So let's give Sophia a big round of applause. <p>Harry Paul is here from Port Washington, New York. Where's Harry? There's Harry, right here. So Harry graduated and is now in his first year at Tufts. But listen to this story, because I think it gives you a sense of the quality of the young people we've got here. Harry was born with a condition called congenital scoliosis, a curvature of the spine. So growing up, Harry endured more than a dozen operations. Rather than feel sorry for himself, he thought, there's got to be a better way of doing this. So he designed a new type of spinal implant. <p>Starting in his freshman year in high school, he started researching the processes that he himself had gone through&mdash;his doctor was an expert on this&mdash;and he decided, let's see if I can come up with something better, an implant that can grow along with the growing child so it doesn't have to be constantly replaced or adjusted, which means you don't need as many intrusive operations. And Harry's implant could reduce the number of surgeries that a child may need for more than a dozen to as few as five, which obviously would cut down medical costs, but more importantly, would save a lot of young people pain and time out from school and recovery time and the potential complications of an operation. <p>Unbelievable stuff. Give Harry a big round of applause. So Nikhil Behari is here from Pennsylvania. Where's Nikhil. There's Nikhil. He is a freshman&mdash;right?&mdash;in high school, interested in how we can better protect ourselves against hackers and data thieves online. So scientists are already using biometrics to prove that each of us walk in our own distinct ways. And Nikhil wondered, what if we each type in a distinctive ways? So he collected all kinds of data about how a person types&mdash;their speed, how often they pause, how much pressure they use&mdash;built a special keyboard to test it. And he proved that his hypothesis was correct: that even if somebody knows your password, they don't necessarily punch it in exactly the way you do. <p>And he asked why, and made discoveries that now could help keep our online accounts more secure. So in the future, if keystroke-based authentication keeps your siblings from breaking into your Facebook account&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;or your Instagram account, you will know who to thank. [<i>Laughter</i>] It will be Nikhil. [<i>Laughter</i>] Congratulations. <p>So those three are just samples of the extraordinary scientists that we've already&mdash;and engineers&mdash;that we've already got here. <p>I should give special mention to our Girl Scouts from Oklahoma. Where are those Super Girls? [<i>Applause</i>] Yes. You can't&mdash;they're standing up, but you can't really see them&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;because they're in kindergarten and first grade. They are today's youngest scientists, at 6 years old. They built their device out of Legos. They realized that some people who might be paralyzed or arthritic might have trouble turning pages on a book, so they invented this page turner. It was awesome. [<i>Laughter</i>] It was working so well, despite the fact, as they pointed out&mdash;this is a quote&mdash;they said, \\"This is just a prototype.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] That's what they said. So this is just a&mdash;I said, well, how'd you come up with the idea? They said, \\"Well, we had a brainstorming session.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] And then, one of them asked, \\"Mr. President, have you had brainstorming sessions?\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] I said, yes, but I didn't come up with something as cool as this&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;it's an automatic page turner. Unbelievable. <p>Ruchi Pandya&mdash;where's Ruchi? There's Ruchi. Found a way to use a single&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;Richi found a way to use a single drop of blood to test a person's heart function, much like a person with diabetes tests their blood sugar. <p>Anvita Gupta&mdash;where's Anvita? There she is. Used artificial intelligence and biochemistry to identify potential treatments for cancer, tuberculosis, Ebola. What she's done is, she's developed an algorithm that could potentially, significantly speed up the process of finding drugs that might work against these diseases. <p>Something smells like it's burning there&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and I don't think it's an experiment. [<i>Laughter</i>] I think it's somebody's camera. Do we have it under control? We don't see any flames bursting. Yes? All right. Okay, it sounds like a little electrical short, but let's keep monitoring that. [<i>Laughter</i>] Exits will be&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;in that direction, should anything happen. The last time there was a fire here, the British were invading. So&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>But Anvita's algorithm has the potential of speeding up pathways to discovering what drugs would work on what diseases and is consistent with some of the work that we announced around precision medicine that we are funding at a significant pace here at the White House. <p>Now, I should point out that, like several of the young people here, Anvita and Ruchi are first-generation Americans. Their parents came here, in part, so their kids could develop their talents and make a difference in the world. And we're really glad they did. So I want to congratulate all of you for your remarkable achievements. You've made a lot of people proud: your parents, your teachers, your friends, your mentors. And as President, I'm proud of you, because America is going to be stronger and smarter and healthier and a much more interesting place because of you. <p>But it's not enough for our country just to be proud of you. We've also got to support you. We've got to make sure that young people like you are going to keep on having what you need to discover and experiment and to innovate. So I've got three announcements to make that really were already kind of in the works before I met you guys, but it's a pretty good occasion to announce them because you're so inspiring. <p>First, four years ago, I set a national goal to provide 98 percent of Americans with high-speed wireless Internet so that any young scientist or entrepreneur could access the world's information. Today I can announce that we have achieved that goal, and we did it ahead of schedule. That's a big deal. <p>Second, to make sure that we keep expanding broadband across the country, I'm creating a new team called the Broadband Opportunity Council, made up of leaders across Government, who will work with business and communities to invest in next-generation Internet nationwide. Because this not just going to be a key for your ability to learn and create; it's also a key for America's ability to compete and lead in the world. <p>Number three, no young person in America should miss out on the chance to excel in these fields just because they don't have the resources. So 5 years ago, we launched a campaign called \\"Educate To Innovate,\\" to help more of our students explore science, technology, engineering and math. Today I'm pleased to announce $240 million in new contributions from businesses, from schools, from foundations across the country to help kids learn in these STEM fields. So we are very, very proud to make that announcement. <p>Corporations have pledged to help expand high-quality science and technology education to more than 1.5 million students. More than 120 universities have pledged to help train 20,000 new engineers to tackle the toughest challenges of this century. Foundations like the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Gates Foundation and the Simons Foundation will support scientists early in their careers with mentoring and funding. And all told, these new commitments bring our grand total up to $1 billion in commitments to our kids since we first got this initiative started 5 years ago. <p>And I was talking to some of the folks who are helping to finance our efforts, and one of the things that they've discovered is that it's not enough just to talk about STEM. Part of what's important to do is also to recognize that what you do in math and engineering and science has a purpose to it; that there are huge challenges that we have to solve in how we have clean energy and how do we clean up our environment and how do we solve crippling diseases like Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. And when we give students the inspiration not just of&mdash;that math and science are inherently interesting and technology and engineering are inherently interesting, but there's actual problems to solve, it turns out that young people, they rise to the challenge. And that's what's so exciting about it. <p>We don't want to just increase the number of American students in STEM, we want to make sure everybody is involved. We want to increase the diversity of STEM programs as well. And that's been a theme of this science fair. We get the most out of all our Nation's talent, and that means reaching out to boys and girls, men and women of all races, all backgrounds. Science is for all of us. And we want our classrooms and labs and workplaces and media to reflect that. <p>And this is something that Megan Smith, our Chief Technology Officer, is really keen about. Part of the problem is we don't tell the stories enough of the incredible scientists and inventors along the way who are women or people of color, and as a consequence, people don't see themselves as potential scientists. Except, the good news is, these young women and African American and Latino and Asian American folks, young people who are here today, you guys certainly see yourselves as scientists. So you're helping to inspire your classmates and kids who are coming up behind you to pursue these dreams as well. And that's what's so exciting. <p>Because the United States has always been a place that loves science. We've always been obsessed with tinkering and discovering and inventing and pushing the very boundaries of what's possible. That's who we are. It's in our DNA. Technological discovery helped us become the world's greatest economic power. Scientific and medical breakthroughs helped us become the greatest source of hope around the world. And that's not just our past, that's also our future, because of amazing young people like this. <p>So I want to thank you for inspiring me. You got me off to a good start today. [<i>Laughter</i>] Keep exploring. Keep dreaming. Keep asking why. Don't settle for what you already know. Never stop believing in the power of your ideas, your imagination, your hard work to change the world. <p>And to all the adults in the room, and to any Members of Congress who might be listening&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;just think about all&mdash;oh, Eddie Bernice Johnson is here, an outstanding Member of Congress, who's a big supporter of STEM education. Just remember, all these young people&mdash;to continue to pursue the research that might bring about a new clean energy source or might cure a disease, a lot of them are going to need the capacity to get research positions and fellowships and grants. And that&mdash;particularly when it comes to basic research&mdash;has typically been funded by the Federal Government. And my Federal budget promotes a significant increase in the kinds of research that needs to happen. Unfortunately, some of the budgets coming out of Congress don't make those same commitments. <p>So it's not enough for us to just lift up young people and say, great job, way to go. You also have to have labs to go to, and you've got to be able to support yourself while you're doing this amazing research. And that involves us as a society making the kind of investments that are going to be necessary for us to continue to innovate for many, many years to come. <p>So congratulations. Give all these young people a big round of applause. Go take a look at their outstanding stuff. It's really great.\" "
"64" "\"Thank you. Good. job. Keep up the good work. Thank you. Thank you so much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Everybody, have a seat. Thank you, Doctor, for that introduction. I want to thank Sylvia Burwell, our outstanding head of Health and Human Services. We've got some wonderful Members of Congress here today who helped make this happen. And I want to offer a heartfelt thanks to all of the top medical professionals who are here today. We've got hospital leaders, we've got health care CEOs, doctors, patients, advocates, consumer groups, Democrats and Republicans, who've all come together and spent time and effort to make the Affordable Care Act, and America's health care system, work even better. <p>What your efforts have meant is the start of a new phase, where professionals like you and organizations like yours come together in one new network with one big goal, and that is to continue to improve the cost and quality of health care in America. <p>A lot of you have already taken steps on your own. The American Cancer Society that's represented here is committed to teaching its members about how new patient-centered approaches can improve cancer care. Governor Markell of Delaware, who's here, has set a goal of having 80 percent of his citizens receive care through new and improved payment and delivery models within 5 years. And Dr. Glenn Madrid of Grand Junction, Colorado, is using a new care model that allowed him to hire case coordinators and use better technology so that patients have access to him 24/7. I don't know when that lets him sleep&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but his patients are sleeping better. <p>And these are examples of efforts that show we don't need to reinvent the wheel; you're already figuring out what works to reduce infections in hospitals or help patients with complicated needs. What we have to do is to share these best practices, these good ideas, including new ways to pay for care so that we're rewarding quality. And that's what this network is all about. <p>In fact, just 5 years in, the Affordable Care Act has already helped improve the quality of health care across the board. A lot of the attention has been rightly focused on people's access to care, and that obviously was a huge motivator for us passing the Affordable Care Act: making sure that people who didn't have health insurance have the security of health insurance. <p>But what was also a central notion in the Affordable Care Act was, we had an inefficient system with a lot of waste that didn't also deliver the kind of quality that was needed, that often put health care providers in a box where they wanted to do better for their patients, but financial incentives were skewed the other way. <p>And so the work that we've been able to do is already spurring the kinds of changes that we had hoped for. It's helped reduce hospital readmission rates dramatically. It's a major reason why we've seen 50,000 fewer preventable patient deaths in hospitals. And if you want to know what that means, ask Alicia Cole, who suffers&mdash;Alicia is right here&mdash;who suffers the long-term effects of a hospital-acquired infection. And she is here today because she doesn't want anybody else to endure what she has. And it's preventable if we set up good practices and financial incentives, reimbursement incentives, are aligned with those best practices. <p>So making sure that the Affordable Care Act works as intended, to not only deliver access to care, but also to improve the quality of care and the cost of care, that's something that requires all of us to work together. That's part of what the law is all about. It's making health coverage more affordable and more effective for all of us. And in a lot of ways, it's working better than many of us, including me, anticipated. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Wherever you are, here's why you should care about making this system more efficient, and here's why you should care that we keep the Affordable Care Act in place. If you get insurance through your employer, like most Americans do, the ACA gave you new savings and new protections. If you've got a preexisting condition like diabetes or cancer, if you've had heartburn or a heart attack, this law means that you can no longer be charged more or denied coverage because of a preexisting condition&mdash;ever. It's the end of discrimination against the sick in America, and all of us are sick sometimes. <p>If you don't have health insurance, you can go online to the marketplace and choose from an array of quality, affordable private plans. Every Governor was given the option to expand Medicaid for his or her citizens, although only 28 have chosen to do so so far. But after 5 years of the ACA, more than 16 million uninsured Americans have gained health care coverage&mdash;16 million. In just over 1 year, the ranks of the uninsured have dropped by nearly one-third&mdash;one-third. <p>If you're a woman, you can no longer be charged more just for being a woman. And you know, there are a lot of women&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;like, more than 50 percent. [<i>Laughter</i>] Preventive care, like routine checkups and immunizations and contraception, now come with no additional out-of-pocket costs. <p>If you're a young person, you can now stay on your parent's plan until you turn 26. And if you want to turn that new idea into a business, if you're going to try different jobs, even a different career, you now have the freedom to do it because you can buy health care that's portable and not tied to your employer. Most people have options that cost less than a hundred bucks a month. <p>If you're a business owner&mdash;because when we put forward the Affordable Care Act, there was a lot of question about how it would affect business&mdash;well, it turns out, employer premiums rose at a rate tied for the lowest on record. If premiums had kept growing at the rate we saw in the last decade, then either the average family premium, paid by the family or paid by the business, would be $1,800 higher than it is today. That's 1,800 bucks that businesses can use to higher and invest, or that's 1,800 bucks that stays in that family's bank account, shows up in their paycheck. <p>If you're a senior, more than 9 million seniors and people with disabilities have saved an average of $1,600 on their prescriptions, adding up to over $15 billion in savings. There were fears promoted that somehow this was going to undermine Medicare. Well, it turns out, the life of the Medicare Trust Fund has been extended by 13 years since this law has passed. <p>And, relevant to the topic today, we're moving Medicare toward a payment model that rewards quality of care instead of quantity of care. We don't want the incentives to be skewed so that providers feel obliged to do more tests, we want them to do the right tests. We want them, perhaps, to save&mdash;to invest some money on the front end to prevent disease and not just on the back end to treat disease. And so these changes are encouraging doctors and hospitals to focus on getting better outcomes for their patients. <p>As we speak, Congress is working to fix the Medicare physician payment system. I've got my pen ready to sign a good, bipartisan bill, which would be really exciting. I love when Congress passes bipartisan bills&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that I can sign. It's always very encouraging. And I want to thank everybody here today for their work in supporting new models of care that will benefit all Americans. <p>But the bottom line is this for the American people: The Affordable Care Act, this law, is saving money for families and for businesses. This law is also saving lives, lives that touch all of us. It's working despite countless attempts to repeal, undermine, defund, and defame this law. <p>It's not the \\"job killer\\" that critics have warned about for 5 years. When this law was passed, our business&mdash;our businesses began the longest streak of private-sector job growth on record: 60 straight months, 5 straight years, 12 million new jobs. <p>It's not the fiscal disaster critics warned about for 5 years. Health care prices are rising at the slowest rate in nearly 50 years, which has helped cut our deficit by two-thirds since I took office. Before the ACA, health care was the single biggest driver driving up our projected deficits. Today, health care is the single biggest factor driving those projections down. <p>I mean, we have been promised a lot of things these past 5 years that didn't turn out to be the case: death panels, doom&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;a serious alternative from Republicans in Congress. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>The budget they introduced last week would literally double the number of the uninsured in America. And in their defense, there are two reasons why coming up with their own alternative has proven to be difficult. <p>First, it's because the Affordable Care Act pretty much was their plan before I'd adopted it&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;based on conservative, market-based principles developed by the Heritage Foundation and supported by Republicans in Congress and deployed by a guy named Mitt Romney in Massachusetts to great effect. If they want to take credit for this law, they can. I am happy to share it. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And second, it's because health reform is really hard, and the people here who are in the trenches know that. Good people from both parties have tried and failed to get it done for 100 years, because every public policy has some tradeoffs, especially when it affects one-sixth of the American economy and applies to the very personal needs of every individual American. <p>And we've made our share of mistakes since we passed this law. But we also know beyond a shred of a doubt that the policy has worked. Coverage is up. Cost growth is at a historic low. Deficits have been slashed. Lives have been saved. So if anybody wants to join us in the spirit of the people who have put aside differences to come here today and help make the law work even better, come on board. <p>On the other hand, for folks who are basing their entire political agenda on repealing the law, you've got to explain how kicking millions of families off their insurance is somehow going to make us more free. Or why forcing millions of families to pay thousands of dollars more will somehow make us more secure. Or why we should go back to the days when women paid more for coverage than men or a preexisting condition locked so many of us out of insurance. And if that's your argument, then you should meet somebody like Anne Ha, who is here. Anne is 28 years old. Where's Anne? There you are. Anne runs her own business in Philadelphia. And she thought what many of us think when we're young&mdash;I no longer qualify&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that she was too young, too healthy to bother with health insurance. She went to the gym every day. She ate healthy, looks great, felt invincible. Why pay a doctor just to tell her she's okay? <p>But then her mom called, as moms sometimes do, and told Anne to get insured against the \\"what ifs\\" of life. What if you get sick? What if you get into a car accident? So Anne, dutiful daughter that she was, went to healthcare.gov, checked out her options in the marketplace. And thanks to the tax credits available to her under this law, she got covered for 85 bucks a month. Four months later, Anne was diagnosed with early-stage stomach cancer. Anne underwent surgery, endured chemo. Today, she's recovering. She looks great. She's here with us at the White House. She invited me to her wedding. I told her you don't want the President at her wedding. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>\\"If I didn't have insurance,\\" Anne wrote, \\"my stomach cancer would have gone undiscovered, slowly and silently killing me. But because I did have insurance, I was given a chance to live a long and happy life.\\" <p>And so in September, Anne is going to be marrying her fianc&eacute; Tom. And she's convinced him to get covered too. And I do appreciate, Michelle appreciates, the invitation. As I said, we have to mag people, if you&mdash;at the wedding, and it spoils the fun. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But here are two lessons from Anne's story. Number one: Listen to your mom. [<i>Laughter</i>] Number two: The Affordable Care Act works. And it's working not just to make sure that folks like Anne get coverage, but it's also working to make sure that the system as a whole is providing better quality at a better price, freeing up our providers to do the things that led them to get into health care in the first place, and that's help people. It works. <p>Five years ago, we declared that in the United States of America, the security of quality, affordable health care was a privilege&mdash;was not a privilege, but a right. And today, we've got citizens all across the country, all of you here today who are helping make that right a reality for every American, regardless of your political beliefs or theirs. And we're saving money in the process. And we're cutting the deficit in the process. And we're helping businesses in their bottom lines in the process. We're making this country more competitive in the process. <p>And it's not going to happen overnight. There are still all kinds of bumps along the way. This is&mdash;health care is complicated stuff. And the hospital executives who are here and the doctors who are here and the consumer advocates who are here can tell you, all the complications and the quirks not just to the Affordable Care Act, but just generally making the system more rational and more efficient, it takes some time. But we're on our way. We're making progress. <p>And if all of us summon the same focus, the same kind of courage and wisdom and hard work that so many of you in this room display, and if we keep working not against one another, but for one another, with one another, we will not just make progress in health care. We're going to keep on making sure that across the board, we're living up to our highest ideals. <p>So I very much am appreciative of what all of you are doing. I'm very proud of you. And why don't you guys get back to work? [<i>Laughter</i>] Thank you very much.\" "
"65" "\"Well, as I said in the State of the Union Address earlier this year, my top priority is to make sure that we continue the economic momentum that's been established, continue to grow businesses, create jobs, and make sure that we've got the kind of prosperity that is broad based and allows people not just to get into the middle class, but ultimately, to start their own businesses, start their own industries, in some cases, climb out of difficult circumstances and live out the American Dream. <p>And one of the major components to do that is to make sure that outstanding goods and services made right here in the United States of America have access to global markets. Ninety-five percent of the customers of the world are outside our borders, and we've got to make sure that we're able to sell to them. And when we do, our companies thrive. <p>This is one of the reasons why I am pursuing the kind of trade authority that allows me, working with Members of Congress, to pry open these markets and make sure there's a level playing field that's good for American businesses and American workers. <p>We already have one of the most open markets in the world. People are already selling to us. But oftentimes, it's not reciprocal. And what I want to do is make sure that those markets are as open to us, our businesses, American workers, American products, as our markets are open to them. <p>And one of the reasons that I brought this group together is because the perception sometimes is, is that the trade agenda is only important for big companies, big corporations, big Fortune 500 or 100 companies. Well, the group that's sitting around here is made up of small-businesspeople or medium-sized businesspeople who are seeing their businesses directly benefit from export, as well as a couple mayors, Mayor Nutter and Mayor Buckhorn, Philadelphia and Tampa, respectively, who can account for hundreds of thousands of jobs and tens of billions of dollars of sales coming out of their region as a consequence of exports. <p>So among the companies here, we've got companies that range from four employees to a couple hundred employees. Some are selling as much as 20 percent of their products and goods outside the United States; some are just getting started and are selling 7, 8, 10 percent of their goods outside the United States. In each case, what they know is that if the U.S. Government is getting their back, making sure that there's a level playing field, they can compete. <p>So I&mdash;just to tell one quick story: Jeff Hohman from Northwest Door makes big garage doors. And what he's finding is, is that when you have that stamp, \\"Made in America,\\" on it, customers like that, they value it, and there's a ready market out there. And because he's been able to sell in places like Saudi Arabia and Australia, he's been able to hire more workers. Because his sales, traditionally, had gone down during the wintertime when people aren't thinking about buying a new garage door. They want to keep the one they've got closed. [<i>Laughter</i>] And so it was&mdash;there was a seasonal business cycle. Well, it turns out that when it's winter here, it's summer in Australia, and he's able to keep more folks on the job and, in fact, hire more people because of those sales and those opportunities. Steve Basta with AlterG has created&mdash;or has a company that's created new technologies for medical rehabilitation. He's able to sell his products overseas, but what he's finding is, in some countries, you've got tariffs that make his products more expensive, and that means fewer sales. <p>And so this is not just the Boeings and the General Electrics that benefit, although they do benefit, and they've got a lot of suppliers up and down the chain, so small and medium-sized businesses benefit when the big companies are selling, because they're sourcing here in the United States. But it's also small businesses and medium-sized businesses directly benefit. <p>And I want to make sure that that story gets told, because we're going to make a big push to level the playing field. And I know that sometimes there's controversy around trade agendas. Trade deals have not always been good for American manufacturing. There have been times where because the trade deal was one way, American workers didn't benefit and somebody else did. Well, we intend to change that. We're not going to sit and settle for the status quo. <p>And that's why we're going to make sure that the trade deals of the future reflect the labor protections, the environment protections, the protection of property&mdash;or intellectual property that's so important to our businesses. But we're going to pry those markets open. I'm not going to settle for the status quo, because we think we can grow enormously. <p>And what we know is that people who export, their workers tend to get higher wages. Those businesses do better. And we want to make sure that \\"Made in America\\" is showing up in every country around the world. That's our goal. <p>And I appreciate very much the mayors who are here who, as Michael Nutter said, doesn't have time for a lot of abstract, ideological debates. What they know is, they want to make sure their businesses are able to access these markets. <p>You've got&mdash;Mayor Buckhorn has got the port in Tampa, which is the gateway for the entire southern part of our hemisphere. They know we've got to get this done. And so do these businesses as well. <p>So thank you very much, everybody. Appreciate it.\" "
"66" "\"Well, it's wonderful to be here at Lawson State Community College. I want to thank Dr. Ward for his hospitality. We're going to end up addressing a much larger crowd, but I wanted to take time while I was here to have a chance to talk to some people who are extraordinarily active here in Alabama around the issue of payday lending, title lending, and frankly, predatory lending. <p>Here in Alabama, like in many parts of the country, including my home city of Chicago, a lot of folks will come across some difficult times. Occasionally, something happens, somebody gets sick in the family, although, now they've got the Affordable Care Act&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;hopefully,<i> </i>to fall back on. The car may break down at a bad time; a child may need something. And if things are tight&mdash;and many of these communities don't have traditional banking services&mdash;too often, they get steered into payday loans. <p>And the challenge is that the interest rates that are so often charged on these short-term loans, they can be as high as 400 percent, 450 percent interest. It means that a $500 loan might require $1,000 in interest on top of the loan. <p>And I just was hearing a story from Stephen here about a family whose grandmother dies, and they take out a small loan for the funeral, aren't able to pay it back right away, lose their car, and two members of the family then lose their job, and the entire family's financial situation collapses. That's not who we are. That's not who we should be as a country. <p>And the good news is that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that was set up under Wall Street reform announced today that they're going to be initiating regulations to make sure that we're adhering to a basic principle, which is if we're going to have financial institutions provide loans to families and individuals, they've got to make sure that these individuals have the capacity to pay them back, that they're not going to be on the hook and burdened in perpetuity as a consequence of what was a short-term problem. We don't want that translated then into a long-term financial crisis for these families. <p>It's something that we know States around the country have been able to do, but unfortunately, too many States have not yet taken these steps. By having a Federal rule through the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, we're going to be able to make sure that more and more people get more protection. And in the meantime, these outstanding folks who are sitting around the table are going to continue to push efforts at the State level to try to make progress. <p>And it's important to note that this is not a partisan issue. There are Republicans as well as Democrats who care deeply about this issue. There are members of the faith community who see a biblical injunction&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;in not engaging in usury and taking advantage of people at moments where they're most vulnerable. And so we very much appreciate both the Democrats and Republicans here in the State of Alabama who are promoting State-based solutions. In the meantime, we're going to make sure that we continue to promote solutions at the Federal level as well. And I'm very proud of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau for promulgating these rules. There's going to be a comment period. There's going to be a lengthy debate. But I'm going to be on the side of making sure that these rules are as strong as possible. <p>Okay? Thank you, very much. Did I miss anything? [<i>Laughter</i>] Thank you, people.\" "
"67" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Alabama! Hello, Lawson State Community College! Well, it's good to be here. Thank you so much. <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you, Mr. President! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back! I do! Thank you. Everybody, have a seat. Have a seat. I'm going to talk for a second. Can everybody&mdash;everybody, please give Ollie a big round of applause, please. I felt a little bad because Ollie said \\"a man who needs no introduction,\\" so I started walking out. [<i>Laughter</i>] Then, it turned out, she had a little introduction. [<i>Laughter</i>] But it is wonderful to be here. <p>Let me just say, first of all, thank you to Dr. Ward, who is not only your president; we named him a White House \\"Champion of Change\\" for the very great work he's done here at Lawson State. We've got two outstanding public servants here as well. Congresswoman Terri Sewell is here. Where's Terri? I don't even see her. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Over here! <p><i>The President.</i> There she is. She's way over there. And your mayor, William Bell, is in the house. <p>So I'm here, Birmingham, to just acknowledge that I didn't have UAB making it out of the first round. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience members.</i> Oooh! [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> My bracket is so busted. [<i>Laughter</i>] But, UAB, that's a great accomplishment. I want to congratulate them. It's also great to be with students like those here at Lawson State, at community colleges. I'm proud of all of you. I'm proud of you making this investment in yourselves. What you're doing takes effort and persistence. And it takes faith in the idea that no matter how you started, no matter where you come from, no matter what zip code you were born in, in America, if you work hard, you can get ahead. <p>I think it was yesterday I saw a story where someone said that a visit from the President is a \\"potential game changer\\" for the neighborhood. I don't know if just one visit is a game changer, but it's nice to be with you. The real game changers for any neighborhood, for any community, are the people there, the folks who, day in, day out, are doing the work and raising families and participating in the community through their churches and faith institutions, are trying to provide that optimism and that lift. <p>And the young people who are here, you're the game changers, because what you're studying and your ability to then apply that learning, that's going to make a difference. The love we put into our families and our communities every day and embracing the joys of citizenship and participation, that's what is a game changer. That's what makes a difference. <p>Now, I won't deny, I can help a little bit. [<i>Laughter</i>] I can maybe make a little bit of difference. And today I want to talk about what we can do as a country to reward hard work and keep the economy growing and make sure that new jobs and opportunities exist. The good news is, right now we're on a 60-month streak of private sector job creation. Sixty months, so that's 5 years. That's a long time. We've created 12 million new jobs. Nationwide, the unemployment rate has fallen. When I came into office, that first year it was 10 percent; now it's 5.5 percent. There are more job openings than at any time since 2001. <p>Meanwhile, our high school graduation rate is up, at an alltime high. More than 16 million Americans have gained the security of health insurance. We're producing more energy than ever before: oil and gas, but also wind power and solar power. And meanwhile, lower gas prices should save the typical family this year about $700 at the pump. And the good news is, wages are even on the rise again, and that's going to help a lot of families. <p>So it's been a long, hard road. But thanks to the hard work of the American people, America is coming back. So the question now is, where do we go from here? Do we accept an economy where just a few people do really, really well? Or are we going to keep building an economy that generates opportunity for everybody who's willing to work? <p>And what I believe is, is that America does best when the middle class does better. And when ordinary folks who maybe were born into poverty are able to climb their way into the middle class, that's good for everybody. The economy grows best not from the top down, but from the bottom up and from the middle out. <p>So what we've been pushing is what I call middle class economics, the idea that the country does best when everybody has got a fair shot, and everybody is doing their fair share, everybody is playing by the same rules. And we want not only everybody to share in America's success, but contribute to it, because we know that if you field the team and only half the folks get to play, that team will be less successful. If everybody is playing a part, that team is going to be more successful. <p>So what does middle class economics mean in this new economy? It means that every American has to have the tools to get ahead in a fast-paced, constantly changing global economy. That means that we've got to make sure that working families feel more secure; that their paychecks can go a little farther; that they're getting things like paid leave and childcare not as luxuries, but because they help support families; that we treat those things as priorities for working moms and working dads. <p>It's time to follow the example of States and cities and companies that are raising America's minimum wage. That will make a difference. It means preparing Americans to earn good jobs and higher wages, which means every child getting a great education at the earliest age. Making college more affordable so young people can afford to go to college without getting burdened with debt. <p>It means working with businesses to provide apprenticeships and on-the-job training and other paths into the middle class. And I want to bring down the cost of community college to zero. Two years of community college should be as free and universal as high school is today. If we've got the best trained workforce in the world, then businesses will come to Alabama. They'll come to Birmingham. They'll come to America. And we will succeed. <p>Middle class economics means building the most competitive economy anywhere so we can keep churning out high-wage jobs for the workers to fill. I want to put more people back to work rebuilding our roads and our bridges, modern ports, faster trains, faster Internet. We should invest in those things. They pay off many times over. I want to invest in basic research so that jobs and industries of the future take root here because we've invented new products and new services and innovated. And we can pay for these investments without blowing up our deficits. We just need to reform our Tax Code so it helps middle class families get ahead instead of letting folks who've already got a lot get ahead. <p>And I have to say, these ideas are not about ideology. The reason I've proposed these ideas is because we know they work. <p>Now, let me talk about Washington for a second. [<i>Laughter</i>] Let me just talk about Washington for a second. The good news is that today the House of Representatives passed a bill. [<i>Laughter</i>] No, no. I&mdash;you think I'm joking. I'm not. [<i>Laughter</i>] It was a bipartisan bill designed to make sure that doctors in our Medicare system get paid on time, that the Children's Health Insurance Program continues to work. <p>I called the Speaker, John Boehner, and the Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, and I said, congratulations, this is how Congress is supposed to work. They came together; they compromised. They had a good idea. They didn't get everything they wanted. They passed a bill. Now the Senate, hopefully, will pass the bill, and I'll get to sign it, and the American people will be better off for it. And I thought, this is great. Let's do more of this. Let's make it happen. <p>I&mdash;so I want to give John Boehner and Nancy Pelosi credit. They did good work today. And they deserve credit, and the House of Representatives deserves credit for that. <p>So that was the good news. [<i>Laughter</i>] The bad news&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;is the Republicans in Congress unveiled their budget, and it represents the opposite of middle class economics, because it would hand out new tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires, let taxes go up for students and working families because it would eliminate their tax credits on a variety of things. It would cut investments in education to the lowest level since the year 2000. It would double the number of Americans without health insurance. <p>And so you look at it and you say, what are you trying to solve with this budget? They say the reason they wanted this budget is because we've got to do this to eliminate deficits and debt. Now, keep in mind, the deficit has come down by two-thirds since I've been President. It's come down by two-thirds. So&mdash;and the budget I put forward would continue to keep deficits low. <p>But let's take them at their word. They said they wanted to reduce the deficit. Before the ink was even dry on the budget that they put forward&mdash;that was already full of tax cuts for folks at the top&mdash;they rolled out their next big economic plan, which was another huge tax cut for folks at the top. This one would cost $250 billion. It would apply only to the top one-tenth of 1 percent of Americans. <p>In Alabama, this new tax cut they're proposing&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I've got to laugh because it would average $2 million per person in tax cuts, and it would apply to less than 50 people per year here in Alabama. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Oooh! <p><i>The President.</i> So 50 people would get an average tax break of $2 million. Not 50,000 people&mdash;50. <p><i>Audience member.</i> \\"Fiddy.\\" <p><i>The President.</i> \\"Fiddy.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Now&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;what would lead you&mdash;when you're saying you're concerned about the deficits, what would lead you to put in your budget and then propose right after your budget something like that? I mean, did they look at the budget? They already got tax cuts for the wealthy, for millionaires and billionaires, and then they say, you know what we forgot to put in here? Another deficit-busting tax cut for the top one-tenth of 1 percent of Americans. That's what's really going to move the country forward. Is that what they were thinking? I guess. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I don't think our top economic priority should be helping a tiny number of Americans who are already doing really, really well, and then asking everybody else to foot the bill. And keep in mind, I&mdash;one of the things about being President, you meet people from all walks of life. You meet folks with very modest incomes. You meet the wealthiest people in the world. And let me just say, some of the&mdash;these folks at the very top, the top one-tenth of 1 percent, are wonderful people. Warren Buffett is a great friend of mine. They've done amazing things. They've invested. They've created businesses. They deserve great success. But they really don't need a tax cut. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And if you talk to them, they'll tell you: \\"I've already got a couple planes. I've already got a boat.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"I've already got five or six houses. I'm okay.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] And the idea that you would do it at the same time as you're eliminating tax credits for students or working families&mdash;that doesn't make sense. <p>Our top priority should be helping everybody who works hard get ahead. It doesn't mean everybody is going to be equal. It doesn't mean that we're going to punish people who have started businesses and taken risks. They should be rewarded. But we want to make sure everybody has a chance to do okay if they're working hard. <p>And that brings me to one of the main reasons that I'm here in Birmingham today. One of the main ways to make sure paychecks to go farther is to make sure working families don't get ripped off. [<i>Applause</i>] Right? And that's why we've taken action to protect Americans from financial advisers who don't necessarily have the interests of their clients at heart. That's why we've taken steps to protect student borrowers from unaffordable debt. We want them to know before they owe. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>It's why, 5 years ago, we passed historic Wall Street reform to end this era of \\"too big to fail,\\" where banks on Wall Street, some of them would make reckless bets, and then everybody else would have to clean up after them. And why we've been working to protect people so that they understand mortgages and they don't buy homes they can't afford and end up in a situation not only hurting themselves, but hurting the financial system. <p>And that's why, as part of this reform, we created an independent consumer watchdog with just one mission, and that is to look out for all of you. And it's called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB. Now, these folks, the CFPB, it hasn't been around a long time, but because of the work they've done&mdash;it's not a big agency, but they've already put over $5 billion back into the pockets of more than 15 million families. Because they've taken on unfair lending practices and unscrupulous mortgage brokers. And they've gotten refunds for folks and are working with State and local officials to make sure that people are protected when it comes to their finances. Because if you work hard, you shouldn't be taken advantage of. <p>And today they're taking new steps towards cracking down on some of the most abusive practices involving payday loans and title loans. Now, Ollie was talking about this in a very personal way. I want to just break this down for folks. Every year, millions of Americans take out these payday loans. Here in Alabama, there are four times as many payday lending stores as there are McDonald's. Think about that. Because there are a lot of McDonald's. [<i>Laughter</i>] There are four times as many payday loan operations here in Alabama as there are McDonald's. <p>Now, what they'll say, the folks who run these things&mdash;in theory, what they'll say is these loans help you deal with a one-time expense. So your car breaks down, you got to get to work; you go there, cash a check real quick or get a quick loan, and then that's the end of it. In reality, most payday loans aren't taken out for one-time expenses. They're taken out to pay for previous loans. You borrow money to pay for the money you already borrowed. <p>As Ollie will tell you, before you know it, you find yourselves trapped in a cycle of debt. At first, it seems like easy money. But the average borrower ends up spending about 200 days out of the year in debt. You take out a $500 loan at the rates that they're charging in these payday loans&mdash;some cases, 450 percent interest&mdash;you wind up paying more than $1,000 in interest and fees on the $500 that you borrowed. <p>We were hearing a story from some of the advocates who were working here in Alabama, a story about a family, the grandmother died, matriarch of the family. She passed away. They don't have quite enough to pay for the funeral. They go to a payday loan, borrow for the funeral, can't pay back the loan in time. The family's car gets taken away. And the two folks who are the breadwinners in that family lose their jobs because they can't get to work. Right? So what started off as a short-term emergency suddenly becomes a catastrophic financial situation for that family. <p>And you don't need to be a math genius to know that it's a pretty bad deal if you're borrowing $500 and you have to pay back $1,000 in interest. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So I just met with faith leaders and consumer advocates and civil rights leaders here in Alabama who are coming together to change that. And I want to say that this is a bipartisan effort. You've got some very conservative folks here in Alabama who recognize&mdash;they're reading their Bible, they're saying, well, that ain't right. [<i>Laughter</i>] Right? I mean, they&mdash;they're saying the Bible is not wild about somebody charging $1,000 worth of interest on a $500 loan. Because it feels like you're taking advantage of somebody. If you're lending to somebody, knowing they can't pay you back, and you're going to put them on the hook and just squeeze them harder and harder and harder and take more and more money out of them, you're taking advantage of them. <p>And so I'm very proud of the bipartisan effort here in Alabama to try to change this. But I want everybody to know, they're not going to have to fight alone. Because at the Federal level, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, the CFPB, announced today that it's going to take important steps towards protecting consumers from getting stuck into these cycles of debt. <p>And the idea is pretty common sense: If you lend out money, you have to first make sure that the borrower can afford to pay it back. Don't lend somebody money if you know they can't pay it back. <p>As Americans, we don't mind seeing folks make a profit. And if somebody lends you money, then you&mdash;we expect you to charge interest on that loan. But if you're making that profit by trapping hard-working Americans into a vicious cycle of debt, you've got to find a new business model. You've got to find a new way of doing business. So this is just one more way that America's new consumer watchdog is making sure more of your paycheck stays in your pocket. And in the meantime, we're also going to be working to educate folks on how to think about their money. <p>We were talking to Dr. Ward, and through the community college process, through consumer advocates at the local level, in the high schools, we need to be teaching young people the dangers of taking out too much consumer debt. <p>And this is one more way that Wall Street reform&mdash;what we passed 5 years ago&mdash;is protecting working families and taxpayers. And that strengthens the economy. <p>And that's one more reason why it makes no sense that the Republican budget would make it harder for the CFPB to do its job and would allow Wall Street to go back to the kind of recklessness that led to the crisis in the first place and would allow these kinds of lenders who are not doing the right thing keep at it. <p>I have to be clear: If Republicans in Congress send me a bill that unravels the reforms we've put in place, if they send me a bill that unravels Wall Street reform, I will veto it. And this is not about politics. It's about basic values of honesty and fair play. It's about the basic bargain that says, here in America, hard work should pay off, responsibility should be rewarded. <p>One of the people who I met with was Reverend Shannon Webster of Birmingham's First Presbyterian Church. Where's pastor? He's here somewhere. There he is, in the back. Stand up so everybody can see you. So Pastor Webster is one of the pastors leading the effort to protect consumers here in Alabama. And at a public hearing a few years ago, he explained why he decided to work on this issue. \\"When our people are trapped in debt,\\" he said, \\"they cannot escape, and we're all hurt.\\" We're all hurt. And that's a simple statement, but it captures so much of what it means to be an American. <p>We are a country of rugged individuals. We don't expect folks to give us a handout. We expect people to work hard. We expect that hard work to be rewarded. If you're out there and you're working hard and starting a business and doing the right thing and looking after your family and not spending beyond yours means, we&mdash;folks like that shouldn't be punished or expected to pay for everybody else. We expect everybody to be responsible. <p>But we're also our brother's keeper. We're also our sister's keeper. We're also a country that was built on the idea that everybody gets a fair shot and that we put laws in place to make sure that folks aren't taken advantage of. When this country does not live up to its promise of fairness and opportunity for all people, we're all hurt. When we do live up to those promises, all of us are better off. <p>Back in 2008, I came to Birmingham as a candidate for this office, and I said, \\"There is nothing we cannot do if the American people decide it's time.\\" Seven years later, I still believe there is nothing we cannot do if we decide it is time. We're all in this thing together, Alabama. We've been through some tough times together, but we're coming back together. If we decide this is our time, then together, we're going to write the next great chapter in this country's history. We're going to do it not just because I came to town, but because of the wonderful people in this town who are already making it happen. <p>Thank you, Alabama. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"68" "\"I'm having an opportunity to meet with my science and technology advisory group, which has&mdash;works on an ongoing basis on a whole range of technology and science and research issues. And we're joined by a couple of Cabinet members, Secretary Burwell and Secretary Vilsack. <p>The reason I called you guys in here today before the meeting is, I wanted to talk about an issue that is of great importance to America's public health and the world's public health, and that is some of the problems that we're having in antibiotics becoming less effective and the need for us to deal with these drug-resistant bacteria. <p>This is a major public health issue. Some of you may have been reading and hearing recently about the problem. Drug-resistant bacteria are one of the most serious public health issues that we face today. They cause tens of thousands of deaths, millions of illnesses, and that's just in the United States. And the numbers are sure to climb unless we take some very clear, concrete, and coordinated action. <p>Last year, I issued an Executive order directing agencies across the Government to create a national action plan for combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria. And today we are releasing that plan. John, give me the plan. [<i>Laughter</i>] Just so we have a little prop. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>This is a product of extraordinary work from some of our top scientists and the private sector, research universities, and practitioners, doctors, and health professionals so that we can figure out how do we approach this problem. It is detailed, it is realistic, it covers the next five years, starting right now. <p>We've set some aggressive goals. First, we're going to slow the emergence of resistant bacteria and prevent the spread of resistant infections. Second, we're going to include surveillance; we want to know when it's happening and why it's happening. Third, we're going to develop better diagnostic tools. Fourth, we're going to accelerate research into new drugs. And fifth, we're going to improve global coordination, because this is going to end up being a global problem. <p>Last year, I also called for the creation of an Advisory Council for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria to advise me and future Presidents on how to see this mission through, because this is not something that we'll solve just in the next 20 or 22 months. Starting today, we're officially taking nominations for that Council. <p>The budget that I released earlier this year nearly doubles the investment in fighting antibiotic resistance. This plan spells out exactly where the money would go. So I'm going to be urging Congress to pass a budget that will ultimately help save lives. We can't do this without Congress. But to&mdash;in order for us to get it done we're also going to have to educate the public. And this is one of those problems that doesn't always rise to the top of people's day-to-day concerns until somebody in their family is impacted. We take antibiotics for granted for a lot of illnesses that can be deadly or debilitating, and we're extraordinarily fortunate to have been living in a period where our antibiotics work. If we start seeing those medicines diminish in effectiveness, we're going to have problems. And part of the solution here is not just finding replacements for traditional antibiotics; it's also making sure that we're using antibiotics properly, because part of the problem is that a lot of times we overdiagnose them. They're entering into our food chain through livestock. There are a whole range of reasons why bacteria is becoming more and more resistant to our traditional treatments. <p>And this is something that we have to take seriously now and invest in now. If we do, then I'm confident we're going to be able to deal with this effectively. If we don't, if we put this off, this is going to be a major public health problem, and it will be a lot harder to solve. <p>So all right? Thank you, everybody.\" "
"69" "\"Hi, everybody. Five years ago, after the worst financial crisis in decades, we passed historic Wall Street reform to end the era of bailouts and too big to fail. As part that reform, we created an independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with one mission: to protect American consumers from some of the worst practices in the financial industry. <p>They've already put $5 billion back in the pockets of more than 15 million families. And this week, they took an important first step towards cracking down on some of the most abusive practices involving payday loans. Millions of Americans take out these loans every year. In Alabama, where I visited this week, there are four times as many payday lending stores as there are McDonald's. But while payday loans might seem like easy money, folks often end up trapped in a cycle of debt. If you take out a $500 loan, it's easy to wind up paying more than $1,000 in interest and fees. <p>The step the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced this week is designed to change that. The idea is pretty common sense: If you're a payday lender preparing to give a loan, you should make sure that the borrower can afford to pay it back first. As Americans, we believe there's nothing wrong with making a profit. But there is something wrong with making that profit by trapping hard-working men and women in a vicious cycle of debt. <p>Protecting working Americans' paychecks shouldn't be a partisan issue. But the budget Republicans unveiled last week would make it harder, not easier, to crack down on financial fraud and abuse. And this week, when Republicans rolled out their next economic idea, it had nothing to do with the middle class. It was a new, more-than-250 billion tax cut for the top one-tenth of the top one percent of Americans. That would mean handing out an average tax cut of $4 million a year to just 4,000 Americans per year and leaving the rest of the country to pay for it. <p>I don't think our top economic priority should be helping a tiny number of Americans who are already doing extraordinarily well and asking everybody else to foot the bill. I think our top priority should be helping everybody who works hard get ahead. This country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. That's what middle class economics is all about, and as long as I'm your President, that's what I'll keep on fighting to do. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"70" "\"Thank you very much. Please, have a seat. Thank you. Thank you so much. To Vicki, Ted, Patrick, Curran, Caroline, Ambassador Smith, members of the Kennedy family: Thank you so much for inviting me to speak today. Your Eminence Cardinal O'Malley; Vice President Biden; Governor Baker; Mayor Walsh; members of Congress, past and present; and pretty much every elected official in Massachusetts&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;it is an honor to mark this occasion with you. <p>Boston, know that Michelle and I have joined our prayers with yours these past few days for a hero, former Army Ranger and Boston Police Officer John Moynihan, who was shot in the line of duty on Friday night. I mention him because, last year, at the White House, the Vice President and I had the chance to honor Officer Moynihan as one of America's \\"Top Cops\\" for his bravery in the line of duty, for risking his life to save a fellow officer. And thanks to the heroes at Boston Medical Center, I'm told Officer Moynihan is awake and talking, and we wish him a full and speedy recovery. <p>I also want to single out someone who very much wanted to be here, just as he was every day for nearly 25 years as he represented this Commonwealth alongside Ted in the Senate&mdash;and that's Secretary of State John Kerry. As many of you know, John is in Europe with our allies and partners, leading the negotiations with Iran and the world community and standing up for a principle that Ted and his brother, President Kennedy, believed in so strongly: \\"Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.\\" <p>And finally, in his first years in the Senate, Ted dispatched a young aide to assemble a team of talent without rival. The sell was simple: Come and help Ted Kennedy make history. And so I want to give a special shout-out to his extraordinarily loyal staff, 50 years later a family more than one thousand strong. This is your day as well. We're proud of you. Of course, many of you now work with me. [<i>Laughter</i>] So enjoy today, because we've got to get back to work. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Distinguished guests, fellow citizens: In 1958, Ted Kennedy was a young man working to reelect his brother Jack to the United States Senate. On election night, the two toasted one another: \\"Here's to 1960, Mr. President,\\" Ted said, \\"If you can make it.\\" With his quick Irish wit, Jack returned the toast: \\"Here's to 1962, Senator Kennedy, if you can make it.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] They both made it. And today, they're together again in eternal rest at Arlington. <p>But their legacies are as alive as ever, together right here in Boston. The John F. Kennedy Library next door is a symbol of our American idealism; the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate as a living example of the hard, frustrating, never-ending, but critical work required to make that idealism real. What more fitting tribute, what better testament to the life of Ted Kennedy, than this place that he left for a new generation of Americans: a monument not to himself, but to what we, the people, have the power to do together. <p>Any of us who have had the privilege to serve in the Senate know that it's impossible not to share Ted's awe for the history swirling around you, an awe instilled in him by his brother Jack. Ted waited more than a year to deliver his first speech on the Senate floor. That's no longer the custom. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's good to see Trent and Tom Daschle here, because they remember what customs were like back then. [<i>Laughter</i>] And Ted gave a speech only because he felt there was a topic&mdash;the Civil Rights Act&mdash;that demanded it. Nevertheless, he spoke with humility, aware, as he put it, that \\"a freshman Senator should be seen, not heard; should learn and not teach.\\" <p>Some of us, I admit, have not always heeded that lesson. [<i>Laughter</i>] But fortunately, we had Ted to show us the ropes anyway. And no one made the Senate come alive like Ted Kennedy. It was one of the great pleasures of my life to hear Ted Kennedy deliver one of his stem-winders on the floor. [<i>Laughter</i>] Rarely was he more animated than when he'd lead you through the living museums that were his offices. He could&mdash;and he would&mdash;tell you everything that there was to know about all of it. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And then, there were more somber moments. I still remember the first time I pulled open the drawer of my desk. Each Senator is assigned a desk, and there's a tradition of carving the names of those who had used it before. And those names in my desk included Taft and Baker, Simon, Wellstone, and Robert F. Kennedy. <p>The Senate was a place where you instinctively pulled yourself up a little bit straighter, where you tried to act a little bit better. \\"Being a Senator changes a person,\\" Ted wrote in his memoirs. As Vicki said, it may take a year or 2 years or 3 years, but it always happens: It fills you with a heightened sense of purpose. <p>That's the magic of the Senate. That's the essence of what it can be. And who but Ted Kennedy, and his family, would create a full-scale replica of the Senate Chamber and open it to everyone? <p>We live in a time of such great cynicism about all our institutions. And we are cynical about government and about Washington most of all. It's hard for our children to see, in the noisy and too often trivial pursuits of today's politics, the possibilities of our democracy, our capacity, together, to do big things. <p>And this place can help change that. It can help light the fire of imagination, plant the seed of noble ambition in the minds of future generations. Imagine a gaggle of school kids clutching tablets, turning classrooms into cloakrooms and hallways into hearing rooms, assigned an issue of the day and the responsibility to solve it. <p>Imagine their moral universe expanding as they hear about the momentous battles waged in that chamber and how they echo throughout today's society: great questions of war and peace; the tangled bargains between North and South, Federal and State; the original sins of slavery and prejudice; and the unfinished battles for civil rights and opportunity and equality. <p>Imagine the shift in their sense of what's possible. The first time they see a video of senators who look like they do: men and women; Blacks and Whites, Latinos, Asian-Americans; those born to great wealth, but also those born of incredibly modest means. <p>Imagine what a child feels the first time she steps onto that floor, before she's old enough to be cynical; before she's told what she can't do; before she's told who she can't talk to or work with; what she feels when she sits at one of those desks; what happens when it comes her turn to stand and speak on behalf of something she cares about and cast a vote and have a sense of purpose. <p>It's maybe just not for kids. What if we all carried ourselves that way? What if our politics, our democracy, were as elevated, as purposeful, as she imagines it to be right here? Towards the end of his life, Ted reflected on how Congress has changed over time. And those who served earlier, I think, have those same conversations. It's a more diverse, more accurate reflection of America than it used to be, and that is a grand thing, a great achievement. But Ted grieved the loss of camaraderie and collegiality, the face-to-face interaction. I think he regretted the arguments now made to cameras instead of colleagues, directed at a narrow base instead of the body politic as a whole; the outsized influence of money and special interests&mdash;and how it all leads more Americans to turn away in disgust and simply choose not to exercise their right to vote. <p>Now, since this is a joyous occasion, this is not the time for me to suggest a slew of new ideas for reform. [<i>Laughter</i>] Although, I do have some. [<i>Laughter</i>] Maybe I'll just mention one. What if we carried ourselves more like Ted Kennedy? What if we worked to follow his example a little bit harder? To his harshest critics, who saw him as nothing more than a partisan lightning rod, that may sound foolish, but there are Republicans here today for a reason. They know who Ted Kennedy was. It's not because they shared Ted's ideology or his positions, but because they knew Ted as somebody who bridged the partisan divide over and over and over again, with genuine effort and affection, in an era when bipartisanship has become so very rare. <p>They knew him as somebody who kept his word. They knew him as somebody who was willing to take a half a loaf and endure the anger of his own supporters to get something done. They knew him as somebody who was not afraid. And fear so permeates our politics, instead of hope. People fight to get in the Senate, and then they're afraid. We fight to get these positions and then don't want to do anything with them. And Ted understood, the only point of running for office was to get something done&mdash;not to posture; not to sit there worrying about the next election or the polls&mdash;to take risks. He understood that differences of party or philosophy could not become barriers to cooperation or respect. <p>He could howl at injustice on the Senate floor like a force of nature, while nervous aides tried to figure out which chart to pull up next. [<i>Laughter</i>] But in his personal dealings, he answered Edmund Randolph's call to keep the Senate a place to \\"restrain, if possible, the fury of democracy.\\" <p>I did not know Ted as long as some of the speakers here today. But he was my friend. I owe him a lot. And as far as I could tell, it was never ideology that compelled him, except insofar as his ideology said, you should help people; that you should have a life of purpose; that you should be empathetic and be able to put yourself in somebody else's shoes and see through their eyes. His tirelessness, his restlessness, they were rooted in his experience. <p>By the age of 12, he was a member of a Gold Star family. By 36, two of his brothers were stolen from him in the most tragic, public of ways. By 41, he nearly lost a beloved child to cancer. And that made suffering something he knew. And it made him more alive to the suffering of others. <p>While his son was sleeping after treatment, Ted would wander the halls of the hospital, meet other parents keeping vigil over their own children. They were parents terrified of what would happen when they couldn't afford the next treatment; parents working out what they could sell or borrow or mortgage just to make it just a few more months, and then, if they had to, bargain with God for the rest. <p>There, in the quiet night, working people of modest means and one of the most powerful men in the world shared the same intimate, immediate sense of helplessness. He didn't see them as some abstraction. He knew them. He felt them. Their pain was his as much as they might be separated by wealth and fame. And those families would be at the heart of Ted's passions. Just like the young immigrant, he would see himself in that child. They were his cause: the sick child who couldn't see a doctor, the young soldier sent to battle without armor, the citizen denied her rights because of what she looked like or where she came from or who she loves. <p>He quietly attended as many military funerals in Massachusetts as he could for those who fell in Iraq and Afghanistan. He called and wrote each one of the 177 families in this Commonwealth who lost a loved one on 9/11, and he took them sailing and played with their children, not just in the days after, but every year after. <p>His life's work was not to champion those with wealth or power or connections; they already had enough representation. It was to give voice to the people who wrote and called him from every State, desperate for somebody who might listen and help. And it was about what he could do for others. <p>It's why he'd take his hearings to hospitals in rural towns and inner cities, and push people out of their comfort zones, including his colleagues. Because he had pushed himself out of his comfort zone. And he tried to instill in his colleagues that same sense of empathy. Even if they called him, as one did, \\"wrong at the top of his lungs.\\" Even if they might disagree with him 99 percent of the time. Because who knew what might happen with that other 1 percent? <p>Orrin Hatch was sent to Washington in part because he promised to fight Ted Kennedy. And they fought a lot. One was a conservative Mormon from Utah, after all; the other one was, well, Ted Kennedy. [<i>Laughter</i>] But once they got to know one another, they discovered certain things in common: a devout faith, a soft spot for health care, very fine singing voices. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>In 1986, when Republicans controlled the Senate, Orrin held the first hearing on the AIDS epidemic, even hugging an AIDS patient, an incredible and very important gesture at the time. The next year, Ted took over the Committee and continued what Orrin started. When Orrin's father passed away, Ted was one of the first to call. And it was over dinner at Ted's house one night that they decided to try and insure the 10 million children who didn't have access to health care. <p>As that debate hit roadblocks in Congress, as apparently debates over health care tend to do&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;Ted would have his Chief of Staff serenade Orrin to court his support. When hearings didn't go Ted's way, he might puff on a cigar to annoy Orrin, who disdained smoking. [<i>Laughter</i>] When they didn't go Orrin's way, he might threaten to call Ted's sister Eunice. [<i>Laughter</i>] And when it came time to find a way to pay for the Children's Health Insurance Program that they, together, had devised, Ted pounced, offering a tobacco tax and asking, \\"Are you for Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man or millions of children who lack adequate health care?\\" <p>It was the kind of friendship unique to the Senate, calling to mind what John Calhoun once said of Henry Clay: \\"I don't like Clay. He is a bad man, an imposter, a creator of wicked schemes. I wouldn't speak to him, but, by God, I love him!\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So, sure, Orrin Hatch once called Ted \\"one of the major dangers to the country.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] But he also stood up at a gathering in Ted's last months and said, \\"I'm asking you all to pray for Ted Kennedy.\\" The point is, we can fight on almost everything. But we can come together on some things. And those \\"somethings\\" can mean everything to a whole lot of people. It was common ground that led Ted and Orrin to forge a compromise that covered millions of kids with health care. It was common ground, rooted in the plight of loved ones, that led Ted and Chuck Grassley to cover kids with disabilities; that led Ted and Pete Domenici to fight for equal rights for Americans with a mental illness. <p>Common ground, not rooted in abstractions or stubborn, rigid ideologies, but shared experience, that led Ted and John McCain to work on a patient's bill of rights, and to work to forge a smarter, more just immigration system. <p>A common desire to fix what's broken. A willingness to compromise in pursuit of a larger goal. A personal relationship that lets you fight like heck on one issue and shake hands on the next, not through just cajoling or horse-trading or serenades, but through Ted's brand of friendship and kindness, and humor and grace. <p>\\"What binds us together across our differences in religion or politics or economic theory,\\" Ted wrote in his memoirs, \\"[is] all we share as human beings&mdash;the wonder that we experience when we look at the night sky; the gratitude that we know when we feel the heat of the sun; the sense of humor in the face of the unbearable; and the persistence of suffering. And one thing more&mdash;the capacity to reach across our differences to offer a hand of healing.\\" <p>For all the challenges of a changing world, for all the imperfections of our democracy, the capacity to reach across our differences is something that's entirely up to us. May we all, in our own lives, set an example for the kids who enter these doors, and exit with higher expectations for their country. May we all remember the times this American family has challenged us to ask what we can do; to dream and say why not; to seek a cause that endures; and sail against the wind in its pursuit and live our lives with that heightened sense of purpose. <p>Thank you. May God bless you. May He continue to bless this country we love. Thank you.\" "
"71" "\"Well, I am about to sign a memorandum of disapproval. A while back, the National Labor Relations Board, the NLRB, put forward some commonsense, modest changes to streamline the voting process for folks who wanted to join a union. And unfortunately, the Republican Senate and House decided to put forward a proposal to reverse those changes. I think that's a bad idea. <p>Unions historically have been at the forefront of establishing things like the 40-hour work week, the weekend, elimination of child labor laws, establishing fair benefits and decent wages. And one of the freedoms of folks here in the United States is, is that if they choose to join a union, they should be able to do so. And we shouldn't be making it impossible for that to happen. <p>So not only am I going to be signing this memorandum of disapproval; I also want to announce that in the fall, we're going to host a summit on increasing the voice and the rights of workers here in the United States. We've had a terrific economic recovery. We've got more work to do. We're finally seeing wages begin to tick up after many consecutive years of job growth. Nevertheless, what's true is, is that we've got record corporate profits. Folks at the very top are doing very well. Middle class families and folks trying to work their way into the middle class still have some big difficulties. <p>And part of what we want to do is to make sure that we give workers the capacity to have their voices heard, to have some influence in the workplace, to make sure that they're partners in building up the U.S. economy, and that growth is broad-based, and that everybody is benefiting just as everybody is contributing. So that's something that I'm very much looking forward to. We'll have a wide range of voices from the business community, from small businesses, from the workers in a wide range of fields: academics, organizers. Because I think that everybody here in America wants to make sure that even as the economy is growing, everybody is playing a part in that growth and everybody is sharing and contributing to that success. <p>So with that, let me sign this memorandum of disapproval. Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"72" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. Today the United States, together with our allies and partners, has reached a historic understanding with Iran, which, if fully implemented, will prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon. <p>As President and Commander in Chief, I have no greater responsibility than the security of the American people. And I am convinced that if this framework leads to a final, comprehensive deal, it will make our country, our allies, and our world safer. <p>This has been a long time coming. The Islamic Republic of Iran has been advancing its nuclear program for decades. By the time I took office, Iran was operating thousands of centrifuges, which can produce the materials for a nuclear bomb, and Iran was concealing a covert nuclear facility. I made clear that we were prepared to resolve this issue diplomatically, but only if Iran came to the table in a serious way. When that did not happen, we rallied the world to impose the toughest sanctions in history, sanctions which had a profound impact on the Iranian economy. <p>Now, sanctions alone could not stop Iran's nuclear program, but they did help bring Iran to the negotiating table. Because of our diplomatic efforts, the world stood with us, and we were joined at the negotiating table by the world's major powers: the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China, as well as the European Union. <p>Over a year ago, we took the first step towards today's framework with a deal to stop the progress of Iran's nuclear program and roll it back in key areas. And recall that at the time, skeptics argued that Iran would cheat and that we could not verify their compliance and the interim agreement would fail. Instead, it has succeeded exactly as intended. Iran has met all of its obligations. It eliminated its stockpile of dangerous nuclear material. Inspections of Iran's program increased. And we continued negotiations to see if we could achieve a more comprehensive deal. <p>Today, after many months of tough, principled diplomacy, we have achieved the framework for that deal. And it is a good deal, a deal that meets our core objectives. This framework would cut off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon. Iran will face strict limitations on its program, and Iran has also agreed to the most robust and intrusive inspections and transparency regime ever negotiated for any nuclear program in history. So this deal is not based on trust, it's based on unprecedented verification. <p>Many key details will be finalized over the next 3 months, and nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed. But here are the basic outlines of the deal that we are working to finalize. <p>First, Iran will not be able to pursue a bomb using plutonium, because it will not develop weapons-grade plutonium. The core of its reactor at Arak will be dismantled and replaced. The spent fuel from that facility will be shipped out of Iran for the life of the reactor. Iran will not build a new heavy-water reactor. And Iran will not reprocess fuel from its existing reactors, ever. Second, this deal shuts down Iran's path to a bomb using enriched uranium. Iran has agreed that its installed centrifuges will be reduced by two-thirds. Iran will no longer enrich uranium at its Fordow facility. Iran will not enrich uranium with its advanced centrifuges for at least the next 10 years. The vast majority of Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium will be neutralized. <p>Today, estimates indicate that Iran is only 2 or 3 months away from potentially acquiring the raw materials that could be used for a single nuclear bomb. Under this deal, Iran has agreed that it will not stockpile the materials needed to build a weapon. Even if it violated the deal, for the next decade at least, Iran would be a minimum of a year away from acquiring enough material for a bomb. And the strict limitations on Iran's stockpiles will last for 15 years. <p>Third, this deal provides the best possible defense against Iran's ability to pursue a nuclear weapon covertly, that is, in secret. International inspectors will have unprecedented access not only to Iranian nuclear facilities, but to the entire supply chain that supports Iran's nuclear program, from uranium mills that provide the raw materials to the centrifuge production and storage facilities that support the program. If Iran cheats, the world will know it. If we see something suspicious, we will inspect it. Iran's past efforts to weaponize its program will be addressed. With this deal, Iran will face more inspections than any other country in the world. <p>So this will be a long-term deal that addresses each path to a potential Iranian nuclear bomb. There will be strict limits on Iran's program for a decade. Additional restrictions on building new facilities or stockpiling materials will last for 15 years. The unprecedented transparency measures will last for 20 years or more. Indeed, some will be permanent. And as a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Iran will never be permitted to develop a nuclear weapon. <p>In return for Iran's actions, the international community has agreed to provide Iran with relief from certain sanctions: our own sanctions and international sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council. This relief will be phased as Iran takes steps to adhere to the deal. If Iran violates the deal, sanctions can be snapped back into place. Meanwhile, other American sanctions on Iran&mdash;for its support of terrorism, its human rights abuses, its ballistic missile program&mdash;will continue to be fully enforced. <p>Now, let me reemphasize: Our work is not yet done. The deal has not been signed. Between now and the end of June, the negotiators will continue to work through the details of how this framework will be fully implemented, and those details matter. If there is backsliding on the part of the Iranians, if the verification and inspection mechanisms don't meet the specifications of our nuclear and security experts, there will be no deal. But if we can get this done and Iran follows through on the framework that our negotiators agreed to, we will be able to resolve one of the greatest threats to our security and to do so peacefully. <p>Given the importance of this issue, I have instructed my negotiators to fully brief Congress and the American people on the substance of the deal, and I welcome a robust debate in the weeks and months to come. I am confident that we can show that this deal is good for the security of the United States, for our allies, and for the world. <p>For the fact is, we only have three options for addressing Iran's nuclear program. First, we can reach a robust and verifiable deal, like this one, and peacefully prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. <p>The second option is, we can bomb Iran's nuclear facilities, thereby starting another war in the Middle East and setting back Iran's program by a few years, in other words, setting it back by a fraction of the time that this deal will set it back. Meanwhile, we'd ensure that Iran would race ahead to try and build a bomb. <p>Third, we could pull out of negotiations, try to get other countries to go along and continue sanctions that are currently in place or add additional ones, and hope for the best, knowing that every time we have done so, Iran has not capitulated, but instead has advanced its program and that in very short order, the breakout timeline would be eliminated and a nuclear arms race in the region could be triggered because of that uncertainty. In other words, the third option leads us very quickly back to a decision about whether or not to take military action, because we'd have no idea what was going on inside of Iran. <p>Iran is not going to simply dismantle its program because we demand it to do so. That's not how the world works, and that's not what history shows us. Iran has shown no willingness to eliminate those aspects of their program that they maintain are for peaceful purposes, even in the face of unprecedented sanctions. Should negotiations collapse because we, the United States, rejected what the majority of the world considers a fair deal, what our scientists and nuclear experts suggest would give us confidence that they are not developing a nuclear weapon, it's doubtful that we can even keep our current international sanctions in place. <p>So when you hear the inevitable critics of the deal sound off, ask them a simple question: Do you really think that this verifiable deal, if fully implemented, backed by the world's major powers, is a worse option than the risk of another war in the Middle East? Is it worse than doing what we've done for almost two decades, with Iran moving forward with its nuclear program and without robust inspections? I think the answer will be clear. <p>Remember, I have always insisted that I will do what is necessary to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, and I will. But I also know that a diplomatic solution is the best way to get this done and offers a more comprehensive and lasting solution. It is our best option by far. And while it is always a possibility that Iran may try to cheat on the deal in the future, this framework of inspections and transparency makes it far more likely that we'll know about it if they try to cheat and I&mdash;or future Presidents&mdash;will have preserved all of the options that are currently available to deal with it. <p>To the Iranian people, I want to reaffirm what I've said since the beginning of my Presidency: We are willing to engage you on the basis of mutual interests and mutual respect. This deal offers the prospect of relief from sanctions that were imposed because of Iran's violation of international law. Since Iran's Supreme Leader has issued a fatwa against the development of nuclear weapons, this framework gives Iran the opportunity to verify that its program is, in fact, peaceful. It demonstrates that if Iran complies with its international obligations, then it can fully rejoin the community of nations, thereby fulfilling the extraordinary talent and aspirations of the Iranian people. That would be good for Iran, and it would be good for the world. <p>Of course, this deal alone, even if fully implemented, will not end the deep divisions and mistrust between our two countries. We have a difficult history between us, and our concerns will remain with respect to Iranian behavior so long as Iran continues its sponsorship of terrorism, its support for proxies who destabilize the Middle East, its threats against America's friends and allies, like Israel. So make no mistake: We will remain vigilant in countering those actions and standing with our allies. <p>It's no secret that the Israeli Prime Minister and I don't agree about whether the United States should move forward with a peaceful resolution to the Iranian issue. If in fact Prime Minister Netanyahu is looking for the most effective way to ensure Iran doesn't get a nuclear weapon, this is the best option. And I believe our nuclear experts can confirm that. <p>More importantly, I will be speaking with the Prime Minister today to make clear that there will be no daylight&mdash;there is no daylight, when it comes to our support for Israel's security and our concerns about Iran's destabilizing policies and threats toward Israel. And that's why I've directed my national security team to consult closely with the new Israeli Government in the coming weeks and months about how we can further strengthen our long-term security cooperation with Israel and make clear our unshakeable commitment to Israel's defense. <p>Today I also spoke with the King of Saudi Arabia to reaffirm our commitment to the security of our partners in the Gulf. And I'm inviting the leaders of the six countries who make up the Gulf Cooperation Council&mdash;Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and Bahrain&mdash;to meet me at Camp David this spring to discuss how we can further strengthen our security cooperation, while resolving the multiple conflicts that have caused so much hardship and instability throughout the Middle East. <p>Finally, it's worth remembering that Congress has, on a bipartisan basis, played a critical role in our current Iran policy, helping to shape the sanctions regime that applied so much pressure on Iran and ultimately forced them to the table. In the coming days and weeks, my administration will engage Congress once again about how we can play a&mdash;how it can play a constructive oversight role. I'll begin that effort by speaking to the leaders of the House and Senate today. <p>In those conversations, I will underscore that the issues at stake here are bigger than politics. These are matters of war and peace, and they should be evaluated based on the facts and what is ultimately best for the American people and for our national security. For this is not simply a deal between my administration and Iran. This is a deal between Iran, the United States of America, and the major powers in the world, including some of our closest allies. If Congress kills this deal, not based on expert analysis and without offering any reasonable alternative, then it's the United States that will be blamed for the failure of diplomacy. International unity will collapse, and the path to conflict will widen. <p>The American people understand this, which is why solid majorities support a diplomatic resolution to the Iranian nuclear issue. They understand instinctively the words of President Kennedy, who faced down the far greater threat of communism and said: \\"Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.\\" The American people remember that at the height of the cold war, Presidents like Nixon and Reagan struck historic arms control agreements with the Soviet Union, a far more dangerous adversary, despite the fact that that adversary not only threatened to destroy our country and our way of life, but had the means to do so. Those agreements were not perfect, they did not end all threats, but they made our world safer. A good deal with Iran will do the same. <p>Today I'd like to express my thanks to our international partners for their steadfastness and their cooperation. I was able to speak earlier today with our close allies, Prime Minister Cameron and President Hollande and Chancellor Merkel, to reaffirm that we stand shoulder to shoulder in this effort. <p>And most of all, on behalf of our Nation, I want to express my thanks to our tireless&mdash;and I mean tireless&mdash;Secretary of State John Kerry and our entire negotiating team. They have worked so hard to make this progress. They represent the best tradition of American diplomacy. Their work&mdash;our work is not yet done, and success is not guaranteed. But we have an historic opportunity to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons in Iran, and to do so peacefully, with the international community firmly behind us. We should seize that chance. <p>Thank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\" "
"73" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! Hello! Please, please, have a seat. Have a seat, have a seat. Well, first of all, sorry I'm late. [<i>Laughter</i>] I had a couple things I had to do. [<i>Laughter</i>] And obviously, when you're the President, you've got&mdash;national security issues always take top priority. But I wanted to make sure that I still made it. And I'm so grateful that all of you were willing to come back and welcoming me in this way. <p>It is great to be back in Louisville. It is great to be here at Indatus. This is such a spiffy-looking company, I'm thinking about remodeling at the White House. [<i>Laughter</i>] Because everything is so hip and cool, and guys with, like, cool beards are&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;typing stuff. And it just looks wonderful. <p>But the reason I'm here is not just because it looks hip and cool, but because what's happening here is essential to America, and we want to lift it up, and we want people to see what's possible in developing the kind of innovation and job creation here in the 21st century, knowing that we can succeed. This company and the network that's been developed here in Louisville are helping to prepare people of all ages for the higher paying, in-demand jobs of the future. And we need to get more of that done. <p>I want to thank David for the introduction and his graciousness in hosting us. There are other folks that I want to acknowledge because they have been great friends and are doing a tremendous job on behalf of their constituencies: your outstanding Governor Steve Beshear is here. Congressman John Yarmuth is here. We love John. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, who not only gave me a Slugger, but also a really big suitcase full of bourbon. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, it's a really big case. [<i>Laughter</i>] And the man who served as mayor before him who now works with me at the White House, doing outstanding work with mayors and Governors and county officials all across the country: my dear friend, Jerry Abramson. Where's Jerry? There he is back there. <p>So, over the past 5 years, our businesses have created 12 million new jobs&mdash;over 12 million new jobs. Right now America has more open jobs than at any point since 2001. And more than half a million openings are in tech, nearly 2,000 here in Louisville alone. Tech jobs pay one-and-a-half times the average private sector wage. So they're great pathways to the middle class. And what's more, a highly trained workforce is vital for America's long-term global economic leadership. It attracts more entrepreneurship; it attracts investors from overseas, because they're looking for an outstanding workforce. <p>And that's the idea behind a new initiative of ours that we're calling TechHire. It's a pretty simple concept. It brings employers and local governments together to support innovative job training programs: like online classes, coding boot camps, community college courses designed by local employers. <p>So Eastern Kentucky is a TechHire Community. So is Louisville. More than 20 employers have joined it so far, including Indatus. You're mentoring students at Code Louisville and you've pledged to hire their graduates. And that's what smart training looks like: faster, cheaper, innovative, providing new pathways&mdash;less conventional pathways, in some cases&mdash;for careers in tech. And my administration is proud to be investing in Code Louisville, because we want more places to follow Kentucky's example. We should invest in what works: apprenticeships that give on-the-job training, gives them industry credentials that let anybody who can do the job get the job, whether they're self-taught or have a degree. And the budget that I sent to Congress includes these priorities. Today we're going to unveil workforce reforms that do the same. <p>And just to give you a specific example; I hope he doesn't mind. Maybe he's here, or maybe he's still back somewhere. The reason I remember this guy is because his name is Ben Kuhl&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;which is a really cool name. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, I kind of wish my name was Ben Kuhl. [<i>Laughter</i>] Ben doesn't have a college degree, but because of the work that's done is open-source, Ben essentially was able to teach himself. And because Indatus recognizes that not all talent goes through conventional pathways, it was able to set up a structure whereby Ben could show what he knew, how well he could do it, and Indatus was able to hire him and now they've got an outstanding coder and somebody who's providing enormous value to the company, which might have been missed had it not been for these kinds of different pathways. <p>And then, I just heard a story&mdash;if I'm not mistaken, Ben, you had a friend who came here and started working in, what, customer service? <p><i>Software developer Ben Kuhl.</i> Yes. <p><i>The President.</i> Also didn't have a degree in computer science or coding, but then he ended up taking an hour class a couple hours a week, teaching himself, getting trained, and now he's doing coding as well. So that's the idea here, is that there are a lot of different pathways that we create so that more and more people can get trained in the jobs of the future and we're not restricting ourselves to one narrow path. <p>And we're making sure that everybody has opportunity and everybody has a shot. And we're investing in the job training and apprenticeships and on-the-job training and online training that it's going to take to make sure that anybody can access a good job if they're willing to work hard and apply themselves and focus. <p>Now, this doesn't cost huge amounts of money, but it does cost some money to do it right and to do it well. And that's why it's reflected in my budget, for us to put more money into job training, apprenticeships, and these kinds of public-private partnerships that we're talking about. And there's going to be a big debate coming up around the budget. <p>Republicans in Congress have put forward their budget, and it provides tax cuts to folks like me and folks who are doing pretty darn well, but it would cut right now job training for 2.2 million people, including 28,800 right here in Kentucky. And that's just not the right way for us to plan in terms of long-term growth and stability. <p>Our economy has been growing. We've got momentum, but that momentum can stall. Because the economies in Europe are weak, the economies in Asia are weak, the dollar is becoming stronger because a lot of people want to park their money here. They think it's safer. They're investing here more. But that makes our exports more expensive. And so we've got to stay hungry. We can't just sit back and assume that growth continues at the kind of pace that we need to give opportunity for all the young people of the future. <p>And that's why this is so important. So we can't prioritize tax cuts for folks at the very top and sacrifice the kinds of job training efforts and apprenticeships that our young people are going to need. So, in case you're&mdash;you think I'm exaggerating, I mean, one of the laws that my friends on the other side of the aisle are trying to pass right now is a new, deficit-busting tax cut for a fraction of&mdash;the top one-tenth of 1 percent; that's fewer than 50 people here in Kentucky who would, on average, get a couple million dollars in tax breaks. For that amount of money, we can provide thousands of people the kind of training they need. And that has&mdash;that's just not the way that we're going to build an economy that strengthens our middle class and provides ladders for people getting into the middle class. <p>Our economy has grown since the crisis, but when you look at what's happened, middle class folks, their wages, their incomes just haven't gone up that much. And a lot of folks are still struggling to get by. And our economy works best when everybody has a stake and everybody is getting ahead. When that happens, we all do well. And by the way, when that happens, businesses do well, because they have more customers. And our economy grows best from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. And we've got to keep that in mind as we go forward. <p>But let me again just congratulate Indatus for the outstanding work that they're doing. I want to congratulate the mayor and the Governor and all the folks who are participating in making sure that TechHire gets off the ground, not just here in Louisville, but across the State and across the country. For all the young people who are&mdash;especially the really young ones&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;make sure to study math and science, because you guys are going to be our future. We're very, very proud of you. <p>And once again, thanks for being so patient with me, despite the delays. Thank you very much.\" "
"74" "\"Well, good morning, everybody. It is wonderful to be in the beautiful State of Utah. And I want to thank General Buhler and Colonel Jolly and everyone here at Hill Air Force Base, one of the most outstanding facilities that we have. <p>Every single day, your work keeps our Air Force ready to meet the many threats that are out there: threats like ISIL, the work that we're doing in Iraq. You support our troops, our humanitarian missions around the world, and you keep the American people safe. And so to all of our folks in uniform and the civilians who support them, I want to say thank you for the incredible work that you do every single day. And I think the American people want you to know how much they appreciate it as well. <p>I just had the opportunity to take a look at the solar installation on this base and to meet with some of your outstanding representatives, including Senator Orrin Hatch and Congressman Rob Bishop, Mayor Ralph Becker, who's doing outstanding work, and leaders in the solar industry as well as our community college system, who were talking about Salt Lake City's commitment to renewable energy, its impact on jobs, its impact on business, and its impact on the environment and climate change. <p>Since I took office, solar electricity has gone up twentyfold. And our investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency haven't just helped to cut carbon pollution, they've made us more energy independent. And they've helped us create a steady stream of high-wage, good-paying, middle class jobs. <p>This morning, we learned that our businesses created another 129,000 new jobs in March. And that adds up to 3 million jobs over the past year, more than 12 million new jobs over the past 5 years. And that's the longest stretch of private sector job creation on record. But we've got to be relentless in our work to grow the economy and create good jobs. <p>Parts of the globe have seen their economies weaken. Europe has had a weaker economy; Asia has been slowing down. We have had the strongest economy, but we're impacted by what happens around the world. And that's why we have to redouble our efforts to make sure that we're competitive, to make sure that we're taking the steps that are needed for us to be successful. <p>And I think everybody here at Hill understands that one of the most important aspects of national security is strong economic security. We can't maintain the best military that the world has ever known unless we also have an economy that's humming. And a lot of our men and women in uniform at some point are going to transition into civilian life, and we want to make sure that after they've fought for our freedom that they've got jobs to come home to. And that means that, working together&mdash;not only the private sector has to work, but government has to work to take the steps that we know will grow our economy. And I'm hoping that, working with Congress, we can get some things done this year. <p>Rebuilding our infrastructure all across the country. Those are jobs that can't be exported. And not only does it put people to work right now, it makes us competitive over the long term because businesses are going to locate where they've got topnotch infrastructure. Investing in education and job training to boost growth right here in the United States, because, again, businesses will locate where they've got a trained workforce. <p>Making sure that we are passing trade promotion authority. Orrin Hatch is working very hard on that. Utah is one of the leading exporting States in the country and part of the reason that this State has been so successful. And we're very grateful that Senator Hatch is working with Senator Wyden to make sure that we can get that deal done. <p>And what I'm doing here today is to highlight the fact that the solar industry is actually adding jobs 10 times faster than the rest of the economy. They're paying good jobs&mdash;they're good-paying jobs that are helping folks enter into the middle class. And today what we're going to try to do is to build on the progress that's already been made. <p>I'm announcing a new goal to train 75,000 workers to enter the solar industry by 2020. As part of this, we're creating what we're calling a Solar Ready Vets program that's modeled after some successful pilot initiatives that have already been established over the last several years. It's going to train transitioning military personnel for careers in this growing industry at 10 bases, including right here at Hill. <p>And as part of this effort, we're also going to work with States to enable more veterans to use the post-9/11 GI bill for solar job training. And it's one of the many steps that we're taking to help nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get a job. In fact, about 30 percent of the Federal workforce is now made up of veterans. I've said it before, and I think employers are starting to catch on: If you really want to get the job done, hire a veteran. <p>So Hill is leading by example. It is getting about 20 percent&mdash;maybe a little higher than that&mdash;of its overall energy through renewable energy sources, including this installation. DOD&mdash;Department of Defense, our military across the board&mdash;is becoming more and more efficient because that saves money. And it means that we've got more money for personnel, for training, for equipment, for making sure our fighting forces are able to get the job done. <p>What is true for DOD has to be true for the entire country. And it's going to provide enormous prospects for jobs and careers for a whole lot of folks out there&mdash;if we continue to make this investment. <p>So we've got to lead by example, invest in the future, train our workers for good, new jobs in the clean energy economy. That's how we're going to keep our economy growing, and that's how we're going to create new jobs and create more opportunity for the American people. <p>We're also, as a byproduct of that, going to make this country safer, and we're going to make the planet more secure. We're going to make sure that the environment that we're passing on and the incredible beauty of this remarkable State's passed on to future generations as well. <p>So thank you very much, all of you, for the great work you're doing. And thank you to the State of Utah for your wonderful hospitality. I was telling the Governor yesterday as we were riding from the airport that I'm going to make sure that I come back next time where I don't have to do so much work and I can visit some of these amazing national parks here and have a chance to visit with some of the wonderful people here in the great State of Utah. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"75" "\"This week, together with our allies and partners, we reached a historic understanding with Iran, which, if fully implemented, will prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon and make our country, our allies, and our world safer. <p>This framework is the result of tough, principled diplomacy. It's a good deal, a deal that meets our core objectives, including strict limitations on Iran's program and cutting off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon. <p>This deal denies Iran the plutonium necessary to build a bomb. It shuts down Iran's path to a bomb using enriched uranium. Iran has agreed that it will not stockpile the materials needed to build a weapon. Moreover, international inspectors will have unprecedented access to Iran's nuclear program because Iran will face more inspections than any other country in the world. If Iran cheats, the world will know it. If we see something suspicious, we will inspect it. So this deal is not based on trust, it is based on unprecedented verification. <p>And this is a long-term deal, with strict limits on Iran's program for more than a decade and unprecedented transparency measures that will last for 20 years or more. And as a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Iran will never be permitted to develop a nuclear weapon. <p>In return for Iran's actions, the international community, including the United States, has agreed to provide Iran with phased relief from certain sanctions. If Iran violates the deal, sanctions can be snapped back into place. Meanwhile, other American sanctions on Iran for its support of terrorism, its human rights abuses, its ballistic missile program, all will continue to be enforced. <p>As I said this week, many key details will need to be finalized over the next 3 months, and nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed. And if there is backsliding, there will be no deal. <p>Here in the United States, I expect a robust debate. We'll keep Congress and the American people fully briefed on the substance of the deal. As we engage in this debate, let's remember, we really only have three options for dealing with Iran's nuclear program: bombing Iran's nuclear facilities, which will only set its program back a few years, while starting another war in the Middle East; abandoning negotiations and hoping for the best with sanctions, even though that's always led to Iran making more progress in its nuclear program; or a robust and verifiable deal like this one that peacefully prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. <p>As President and Commander in Chief, I firmly believe that the diplomatic option&mdash;a comprehensive, long-term deal like this&mdash;is by far the best option, for the United States, for our allies, and for the world. <p>Our work&mdash;this deal&mdash;is not yet done. Diplomacy is painstaking work. Success is not guaranteed. But today we have a historic opportunity to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons in Iran and to do so peacefully, with the international community firmly behind us. And this will be our work in the days and months ahead in keeping with the best traditions of American leadership.\" "

"77" "\"<i>Vice President Joe Biden.</i> Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the White House. Religious leaders, lay faithful, it's an honor: It's an honor to join you in a morning of prayer and reflection, and it's a delight to have many of you back. <p>For me, reflection is what Holy Week is all about. And I never fail to get a renewed sense of hope and possibilities when I attend Mass on Easter Sunday. <p>I believe Pope Francis got it right in his Easter Vigil homily when he said, and I quote: \\"We cannot live Easter without entering into mystery. To enter into mystery means the ability to wonder, to contemplate, the ability to listen to the silence and hear the tiny whisper amid the great silence by which God speaks to us.\\" <p>I think that's who we are as Christians, and quite frankly, I think that's who we are as Americans. We're constantly renewed as a people and as individuals by our ability to enter into the mystery. We live our faith when we instill in our children the ability to wonder, to contemplate, and to listen to that tiny whisper amid the great silence. We live our faith when we nurture the hope and possibilities that has always defined us as a country. We live Easter&mdash;and to live Easter is to live&mdash;with the constant notion that we can always do better. We can always do better. <p>That's why I'm so grateful for what everyone in this room does to transform hope into possibilities and possibilities into opportunity. And that's why I've been so honored to work every single day for the last 6-plus years with a man who encompasses that faith to his core. A man who knows what it is to enter into the mystery with a deep and unyielding conviction that it's within each of our reach to make real the promise of the ongoing miracle that is the United States of America. <p>Ladies and gentlemen, it is my great honor to introduce you to my friend, the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama. <p><i>The President.</i> Everybody, have a seat. Thank you. Oh, well, we give thanks for this day that the Lord has made. Good morning, everybody. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Good morning. <p><i>The President.</i> Welcome to the White House. It is wonderful to see so many friends from all across the country. My first concern was whether you actually got something to eat. [<i>Laughter</i>] Sometimes, prayer breakfasts are advertised&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and then, you get there and there's like a little muffin. [<i>Laughter</i>] A couple berries. [<i>Laughter</i>] And though your soul may be nourished, you leave hungry. So I hope that is not happening here. <p>I want to thank everybody here for their prayers, which mean so much to me and Michelle. Particularly at a time when my daughters are starting to grow up&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and starting to go on college visits, I need prayer. [<i>Laughter</i>] I start tearing up in the middle of the day, and I can't explain it. [<i>Laughter</i>] Why am I so sad? [<i>Laughter</i>] They're leaving me. <p>And I want to thank everybody here for the wonderful work that you do all across the country with your remarkable ministries. We hold this Easter Prayer Breakfast every year to take a moment from our hectic lives for some fellowship, friendship, prayer, and reflection. And I know pastors here have had a very busy Holy Week, and so for you to travel here and take the time to spend with us is extraordinary after what I know is difficult. I can't say that our work during this season is comparable, but you should try dealing with thousands of people in your backyard on an Easter Egg Roll. [<i>Laughter</i>] After that you need quiet reflection, particularly because I had some of my nephews who&mdash;6 and 4&mdash;in my house all weekend. And you need quiet reflection after that. [<i>Laughter</i>] Girls are different than boys. <p>This morning we also remember a man of God who we lost this weekend, a man known and loved by many of you, the dean of American preaching: Dr. Gardner C. Taylor. Anybody who had the privilege of hearing him speak knows what power he had. He was a civil rights hero. He was a friend of Dr. King, who used his spellbinding sermons to spread the Gospel and open people's hearts and minds. He taught and mentored countless young ministers. So as we mourn his absence today, we also take solace knowing that he leaves a living legacy and that he is in a better place. <p>I am no preacher. I can't tell anything to this crowd about Easter that you don't already know. I can offer just a couple of reflections very quickly before we begin the program. <p>For me, the celebration of Easter puts our earthly concerns into perspective. With humility and with awe, we give thanks to the extraordinary sacrifice of Jesus Christ, our Savior. We reflect on the brutal pain that He suffered, the scorn that He absorbed, the sins that He bore, this extraordinary gift of salvation that He gave to us. And we try, as best we can, to comprehend the darkness that He endured so that we might receive God's light. <p>And yet, even as we grapple with the sheer enormity of Jesus' sacrifice, on Easter we can't lose sight of the fact that the story didn't end on Friday. <p><i>Audience members</i>. Amen! That's right. <p><i>The President</i>. The story keeps on going. On Sunday comes the glorious Resurrection of our Savior. <p>\\"Good Friday may occupy the throne for a day,\\" Dr. King once preached, \\"but ultimately, it must give way to the triumphant beat of the drums of Easter.\\" Drums that beat the rhythm of renewal and redemption, goodness and grace, hope and love. Easter is our affirmation that there are better days ahead and also a reminder that it is on us, the living, to make them so. <p>Through God's mercy, Peter the Apostle said, we are given \\"an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you.\\" It's an inheritance that calls on us to be better, to love more deeply, to serve \\"the least of these\\" as an expression of Christ's love here on Earth. <p>That's the spirit we feel in the example of His Holiness Pope Francis, who encourages us to seek peace, to serve the marginalized, and be good stewards of God's creation. Like millions of Americans, I'm honored that we will be welcoming him to our country later this year. <p>I want to quote him. He says that we should strive \\"to see the Lord in every excluded person who is thirsty, hungry, naked; to see the Lord present even in those who have lost their faith . . . in the imprisoned, sick, unemployed, persecuted; to see the Lord in the leper&mdash;whether in body or soul&mdash;who encounters discrimination.\\" Isn't that how Jesus lived? Isn't that how He loved? Embracing those who were different; serving the marginalized; humbling Himself to the last. This is the example that we are called to follow: to love Him with all our hearts and mind and soul and to love our neighbors&mdash;and all of our neighbors&mdash;as ourselves. As it says in the first letter of John, \\"Let us not love with words or speech, but with actions and in truth.\\" <p>On Easter, I do reflect on the fact that as a Christian, I am supposed to love. And I have to say that sometimes, when I listen to less than loving expressions by Christians&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> Well, well. Preach! <p><i>The President</i>. &mdash;&mdash;I get concerned. But that's a topic for another day. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Where there is injustice&mdash;I was about to veer off. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm pulling it back. Where there is injustice, we defend the oppressed. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Preach! <p><i>The President</i>. [<i>Laughter</i>] Where there is disagreement, we treat each other with compassion and respect. Where there are differences, we find strength in our common humanity, knowing that we are all children of God. <p>So today, we celebrate the magnificent glory of our risen Savior. I pray that we will live up to His example. I pray that I will live up to His example. I fall short so often. Every day, I try to do better. I pray that we will be strengthened by His eternal love. I pray that we will be worthy of His many blessings. <p>With that, I'd like to invite Reverend Dr. Amy Butler to offer our opening prayer.\" "
"78" "\"<i>The President.</i> I just had the opportunity to have a terrific conversation with our outstanding new Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, our EPA Administrator, Gina McCarthy, but also some incredible activists from different walks of life in the public health arena. And the discussion really centered around the fact that climate change is having a impact on our public health. <p>We've got nurses. We've got deans of medical schools. We have residents and public health officials, primary care physicians and moms, most importantly. And what we know is that the temperature of the planet is rising. And we know that in addition to the adverse impacts that may have when it comes to more frequent hurricanes or more powerful storms or increased flooding, we also know that it has an impact on public health. <p>We know that if there are more wildfires, a consequence of rising temperatures, that there are going to be more particulates in the air. We know that potentially, it extends the allergy season and can induce greater incidents of asthma or more severe incidents of asthma. We know that, potentially, as temperatures rise, that we're going to start seeing insect-borne diseases that are not traditional to North America start moving up from the south. <p>And so there are a whole host of public health impacts that are going to hit home. And the great thing about this conversation is to see all the work that's already being done by public health officials, the medical community, nurses, and families to start raising awareness around these issues. <p>The Pentagon has already said that climate change is a primary national security threat that we're going to face, and we are working with the Department of Defense to start preparing for that and mitigating for that. And a lot of our international policy and national security policy is centered around the very real concerns that that's going to raise. <p>But we also know that it's going to have an impact on our public health. And through the efforts of these individuals and organizations around the country, I think we're going to be able to start having an impact. <p>We'll just use the example of Charlotte Wallace, a pediatric nurse in Maryland for 18 years, treated kids with asthma. And as a nurse and a mom, she understands that climate change is going to be making a difference. Dr. Bryant-Stephens, who is a primary care physician, has seen firsthand how rising asthma rates, particularly in lower-income communities, can have a terrible impact. <p>So we've got to do better in protecting vulnerable Americans. Ultimately, though, all of our families are going to be vulnerable. You can't cordon yourself off from air or from climate. <p>And that's why today we're making more than 150 data sets on climate change in public health from agencies like the CDC open to the public. Companies across the country like Google and Microsoft plan to use the data to generate apps and tools that can help communities educate and protect themselves. We have medical schools, including Howard, and public health schools pledging to train their students in the health impacts of climate change. And later this week, some of those educators will come to the White House to talk about how they're incorporating climate change into their teachings, into their curriculum. And this spring, we'll have a climate change and health summit at the White House. <p>So the bottom line is, we all need to do our part. Obviously, this administration has been aggressive in using the administrative authorities that we currently have to increase fuel efficiency standards to make sure that we are taking more carbon out of the emissions from our power plants. But we've got a lot more work to do if we're going to deal with this problem in an effective way and make sure that our families and our kids are safe. <p>And one of the key leaders in this is going to be our Surgeon General, Dr. Murthy. So, Vivek, why don't you say a few words. <p><i>United States Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy.</i> Sure. Well, thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Administrator McCarthy. And my thanks to all of you who joined us here today. <p>We had a really enriching conversation today talking about the impact of climate change on public health from a number of different perspectives. It was very helpful to us. And I'd like to expand a little on what the President said and speak a little bit more about the relevance of climate change to clinicians and to patients. <p>We know that climate change means higher temperatures overall, and it also means longer and hotter heat waves. We also know that higher temperatures can mean worse air in cities and more smog and more ozone. We know that more intense wildfires will mean increased smoke in the air. And we know that earlier springs and longer summers mean longer allergy seasons. <p>If you put all of this together, this means that we have more people exposed to triggers that can cause asthma attacks, and more asthma attacks mean more days of school missed. They mean more days of work missed. They mean more costly trips to the doctor. And they most importantly mean more scary moments for parents and for children. <p>This is a personal issue for me because when I was young one of my favorite uncles&mdash;actually, he was very dear to me as a child&mdash;he died from a severe asthma attack. And it's also personal to me because I have cared for many patients over the years who have suffered from asthma and have seen firsthand how frightening it can be to suddenly be wheezing and fighting for every breath. Asthma can be very difficult for patients, but also for their families. And the impacts of climate change could make this situation worse. <p>Additionally, the longer summers and hotter heat waves will also expose more Americans to heat stroke and to heat stress, especially those who work in outdoor settings in industries like farming and construction. And it means that elderly Americans will be even more vulnerable to respiratory distress and possible death from extreme heat, a problem that we already experience in our cities, particularly among the poor and minority populations who don't always have easy access to air conditioning. <p>An underlying principle of public health that I want to emphasize is that of prevention. Indeed, prevention of disease should be the driving force in our efforts to improve health in America. And whether it's promoting heart health through nutrition and physical activity or preventing disease outbreaks through vaccinations, prevention really is our goal, and that is true here with climate change as well. As Surgeon General, one of my larger messages to our country is that we all have a stake in health. And as a result, we all have a responsibility to protect it. Health isn't just the responsibility of doctors and nurses and individual patients, it's a community responsibility. That means that businesses and faith groups, civic organization, schools and universities like this&mdash;all of American society has a hand in keeping our people healthy and preventing disease not just treating it, and in making sure that every American, no matter who they are or where they're from, has a shot at a healthy life. <p>So again, we're very grateful to have had this opportunity to speak with our community leaders here today. And we're excited to continue this conversation as we think about how to address some of the challenges that we now see with climate change and public health. <p>Thank you all very much. <p><i>The President.</i> Last point I'll make, because Vivek touched on this&mdash;when we have, as Dr. Bryant-Stephens mentioned, a child who visits the emergency room six times because of asthma, there's a cost associated to that. We as a society pay for that. And even if the child has insurance, it is still resources that are being devoted to treating a child that could have avoided an emergency room visit if we took better care of the environment in which they were growing up. <p>And the reason I think this is important is because sometimes you'll hear the debate when it comes to climate change that this is going to be too costly to address. Well, the fact of the matter is, we know that the costs of clean energy have rapidly come down and are increasingly competitive; that when&mdash;in historically, we have dealt with problems like smog or acid rain or the ozone, it's turned out that things are cheaper to fix than we anticipated, and&mdash;&mdash; <p>[<i>At this point, a cellular phone rang</i>.] <p><i>The President</i>. Whoa! Who's calling there, Ms. Miller? <p><i>Moms Clean Air Force volunteer Eneshal Miller.</i> My husband. <p><i>The President.</i> Uh-oh. Tell your husband I'm in the middle of a press conference. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm teasing. <p>So the&mdash;what has turned out typically is, is that the costs have been lower than anticipated. The benefits have been extraordinary. Hard to put a price on in some cases, and in some cases, we can be very clear about how much it costs. And when it comes to public health issues, when we're doing effective work on prevention, and we are preventing tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of asthma incidents, or we are preventing thousands of deaths as a consequence of asthma, that is something that we know is not only preventable when it comes to the individual, but it's something where we could be saving money as a society as a whole. <p>And so I want everybody to start recognizing the costs of inaction and recognize that the costs of inaction are even higher than the costs of action. In the same way that there are costs associated when you have severe drought or significant wildfires or the kinds of storm surges that we saw in Hurricane Sandy, well, there are public health costs as well. And we're ultimately going to be better off being proactive, getting out in front of this thing, as opposed to reactive where we pay a whole lot more in pain and suffering as well as in terms of trying to deal with the back end of the problem. All right? <p>Thank you, everybody.\" "
"79" "\"Well, thank you very much. Let me begin, once again, by thanking Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller for&mdash;and the people of Jamaica for their wonderful hospitality, as well as the University. I want to thank the Chair of CARICOM, Prime Minister Christie of the Bahamas, and all the leaders and their teams that are here today. <p>As has already been mentioned, the bonds between us are extraordinarily strong. The Caribbean is a place of extraordinary beauty, people of enormous spirit, unique talents, a wonderful culture. We are bound by friendship and shared values and by family. And we have a great stake in each other's success. <p>We last met as a group at the Summit of the Americas in Cartagena. We work together every Summit of the Americas, as we will again in Panama. And I wanted to meet today so that we could take some time to focus on the unique opportunities and challenges that this region faces. <p>We're going to have a chance to talk about the issues that have already been mentioned: making sure that we deepen our cooperation in economic growth and how we can further integrate the region; making sure that our governments are open and transparent, and upholding human rights for all citizens; combating transnational crime through our Caribbean Basin Security Initiative. And a particular focus today is going to be one of the greatest barriers to development in the Caribbean, and that is expensive, often unreliable, and carbon-intensive energy. <p>This region has some of the highest energy costs in the world. Caribbean countries are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, and we have to act now. This is an example of&mdash;large countries and small countries have to work together, because without collective action, we're not going to be able to address these challenges. <p>The Vice President hosted a summit on this in January. Our Caribbean Energy Security Initiative aims to help move the region toward cleaner more affordable energy. Today we're announcing new partnerships, including a new fund to mobilize private investment in clean energy projects in the Caribbean and in Central America. And I'm confident that given the commitment of the CARICOM countries and the U.S. commitment, that this is an issue in which we can make great strides over the short term and even greater strides over the long term. <p>Finally, let me mention the issue of youth. As you indicated, if there's one thing that I've been convinced of during the course of my 6&frac12; years in office, it is that wherever we are able to harness the spirit and innovation and boldness of our youth and channel that in a positive direction, those countries succeed, and our futures will be bright. And that is true here in the Caribbean and throughout the Americas. <p>And so I'm very much looking forward to a town hall meeting I'll be hosting in which young leaders from all your countries will attend. But more importantly, we're going to be very interested in building some concrete programs that give them the kind of education and training that will ultimately help to benefit not only your countries, but will benefit the world. And with that, let me suggest that we get to work. Thank you very much.\" "
"80" "\"Well, thank you, Luis. First of all, let me not only thank you but thank our host and the people of Panama, who have done an extraordinary job organizing this summit. <p>It is a great pleasure to be joined by leaders who I think have done extraordinary work in their own countries. And I've had the opportunity to work with President Rousseff and Pe&ntilde;a Nieto on a whole host of regional, international, and bilateral issues and very much appreciate their leadership. And clearly, President Varela is doing an outstanding job here in Panama as well. <p>A lot of important points have already been made. Let me just say this. When I came into office, in 2009, obviously, we were all facing an enormous economic challenge globally. Since that time, both exports from the United States to Latin America and imports from Latin America to the United States have gone up over 50 percent. And it's an indication not only of the recovery that was initiated&mdash;in part by important policies that were taken and steps that were taken in each of the countries in coordination through mechanisms like the G-20&mdash;but also the continuing integration that's going to be taking place in this hemisphere as part of a global process of integration. <p>And I'll just point out some trends that I think are inevitable. One has already been mentioned: that global commerce, because of technology, because of logistics, it is erasing the boundaries by which we think about businesses not just for large companies, but also for small and medium-sized companies as well. That's point number one. <p>Point number two is that technology is going to continue to be disruptive. I'm glad that my friend, Mark Zuckerberg, is here. Obviously, what he's done with Facebook has been transformative. But what's important to recognize is, is that it's not just companies like Apple and Google and Facebook that are being transformed by technology. Traditional industries are being changed as well. Small businesses are being changed as well. How we buy, sell, market&mdash;all that's shifting. And that's not going to go away. <p>And what that means is, is that going forward, for the hemisphere to continue to experience the growth that's necessary, I think there are a couple of principles that we just have to follow. And some of them have already been mentioned, so I'll just speak to them very quickly. <p>The first is, our people have to be the best trained in the world. We have to not only educate our children, but we have to give our people the capacity to continue to learn throughout their lives, because the economy is changing and workers have to adapt. It's going to be very rare where somebody works at one place for 30 years with just one skill. So the investments that all of us have to make in education, not just through primary or secondary schools, but if young people are not going to universities, they can still at least get technical training and advanced degrees. <p>And this is where technology can be our friend. We initiated something called 100,000 Strong to improve the exchanges between students in Latin America and the United States. And part of what we're doing is starting to figure out how can we use technology to reach more young people, not just the folks who are at the top of the economic pyramid, but reach down and access remote areas where suddenly, a young person in a small village, if they are linked through the Internet, have access to the entire world. And companies, I think, can play an important role because public-private partnerships will make these kinds of investments more effective. <p>Point number two: the issue of infrastructure has already been mentioned. We have a lot of infrastructure we need to build in the United States, and obviously, there's a lot of infrastructure that needs to be built throughout the region. The more we can coordinate and work together on infrastructure, the better off we're going to be. <p>Just one example: I came from SICA, the meeting of Central American leaders. Their energy costs are typically three times higher than what we pay in the United States. It's a huge impediment to their development. To the extent that we can create a single regional energy market, then the costs of, of transmission, distribution of energy becomes cheaper for all the countries involved, and you get certain economies of scale. And so part of what a Summit of the Americas can accomplish is to try to work on a regional basis around some key infrastructure projects that will help us all grow. <p>Number three, as has already been mentioned, the issue of broad-based economic development. I was very interested in speaking with President Varela about Panama. They're seeing outstanding growth, and yet there are still some remote areas where I know the President has a priority. How do I reach those communities that are isolated, that are not part of that growth process? All of us have to deal with that. <p>And that includes in the United States, by the way. Because one of the challenges that we're all facing, when you look at global growth patterns, is that even when economies are growing, the gaps between rich and poor oftentimes are accelerating, and not only is that not good for social stability, not only is that not good for opportunity, it's not good for business. Because the truth of the matter is, is that when you have a growing middle class and an aspirational poor that are able to access their way into the middle class, then those become the consumers that drive the marketplace much more so than folks at the very top. <p>There's only so much food you can eat. There's only so many cars you can buy. And at a certain point, if only folks at the top are doing well, and we're not focused on broad-based growth, then growth starts to stall. And so taking the steps to train, to educate, to give access to opportunity, to make sure that infrastructure is reaching everyplace and not just some places&mdash;that becomes a very high priority. <p>And the last point I'll make is the issue of governance. It&mdash;President Varela mentioned the issue of violence, and this is obviously something that is of deep concern in many parts of the world and, sadly, is still a problem in portions of the hemisphere. And a lot of it has to do with lack of opportunity. But part of it also has to do with the difficulties of establishing strong security if we also are not combining that with transparency, with government accountability, with a criminal justice system and a judicial system that is perceived as fair and legitimate. <p>And so the work that we've begun to do together&mdash;for example, Brazil and the United States and Mexico, we're working on an Open Government Partnership that makes sure that records are available and people understand how their government is spending their money, how contracts are let, reinforcing norms around rule of law. Not only does that give us more tools to combat violence, but it also, I suspect, makes investors a lot more interested in investing in a country, if they know what the rules are and they have certainty and political risk is reduced. And again, this is an area where we have to work regionally as opposed to separately. Because the narcotraffickers don't distinguish between borders. Well, that means we can't either. And fortunately, we have some outstanding partners who've been working together. Panama is one of our best partners. President Pe&ntilde;a Nieto has been doing outstanding work with us and seeing how we can coordinate more effectively. But issues of personal security, reducing corruption, governance&mdash;those are economic agendas. Those are not simply security agendas.\" "
"81" "\"First of all, I want to thank the business leaders who are all here represented, and you had some great spokespersons in the front row. <p>I'll just comment on a couple of themes that ran through a number of the questions. One of the advantages that we may have today that we didn't have, let's say, 15 or 20 or 30 years ago is, I think it used to be viewed as either you have a government status economic model or you have a complete free market, and everything was very ideological sometimes in this region in discussing how economic development went forward. <p>And I think, by virtue of wisdom and some things that didn't work and some things that did, everybody around the region, throughout the hemisphere, I think has a very practical solution&mdash;or a practical orientation. Maybe not everybody, but almost everybody. [<i>Laughter</i>] The&mdash;certainly, all the people on this stage. And so the question then becomes, what's the appropriate role for government, what's the appropriate role for the private sector, and how do we fill gaps to get results? <p>So I believe that the free market is the greatest wealth generator and innovator and is a recipe for success for countries. And I think it's very important for us to initiate reforms that can free up the entrepreneurship and the talents of our people. But I also think that there are going to be market failures. There are times where the market isn't meeting a social need that is necessary in order for businesses to thrive and societies to thrive. And so on&mdash;when Stanley talked about public-private partnerships, one way to think about it is where is it that both businesses and government can work together to address a gap or a market failure. <p>One area is in education. I think that we have to make a public investment through good schools, paying our teachers, training them properly, building infrastructure for schools. But one of the things that we've learned in the United States, for example, is that we have an outstanding community college system, not just the fancy universities at the top, but we also have community colleges throughout every State. But for too long, we weren't talking to businesses&mdash;and these community colleges weren't talking to businesses&mdash;to ask, what should we be training people for and how should we train them? And by soliciting input from business, suddenly the training programs in these community colleges became much more effective and were much more likely to lead to jobs in the future. That's the kind of collaboration that's, I think, very important. <p>The same is true with respect to connectivity that Mark raised. Look, the Internet wouldn't have been created without government investment. It didn't just kind of spring to life on its own. But now that in every country we recognize there's an infrastructure that has to be built, we also have to be working together with the private sector to make sure that it's built in a way that anticipates how rapidly things are changing, because there may be circumstances here where people can entirely leapfrog old technologies and go straight to new technologies. <p>And so one of the questions, I think, all of us&mdash;as leaders and regionally&mdash;should be asking is, to what extent are we making joint investments that aren't protecting the old models, but rather are opening up new models that may be more efficient and reach more people. Third point is, regulatory issues came up a number of times. Look, technology and globalization are disruptive. And usually, somebody is doing well with the status quo, and they don't want change, and so sometimes, breaking down regulations is painful politically. And that's why I'm very admiring of the work that Enrique did with respect to the energy sector in Mexico. That's a very sensitive thing and a very difficult thing. But what he recognized&mdash;and ultimately, what all of Mexico recognized&mdash;is that that sector will not be as efficient if it does not get the kind of private input and investment and innovation that's required. <p>So part of, I guess, our strategy has to be to recognize that there are going to be some regulatory barriers and we have to work in concert to try to break some of those down and harmonize regulations across countries and across, in some cases, industries. But in some cases, we may need new regulations to adapt to new times. <p>And I'll use just the example of climate change to make this point. I visited the Panama Canal today, an amazing feat of human ingenuity. And the expansion that's going to be taking place here in Panama is going to be good for Panama, it's going to be good for world trade, it's going to be good for the region. But it turns out that the Panama Canal really depends on rain in Panama. If water is not coming down at a certain level, if seasonal rain patterns change radically, that can have an enormous impact on economic development not just for Panama, but for the United States and for the entire region. <p>So there's a circumstance where even as we end old regulations that no longer make sense or are inhibiting innovation and growth and investment, in some cases, we may need new regulatory approaches to, for example, limit and reduce carbon. And we should do it in an efficient way so that we're harnessing the ingenuity of the private sector; we set a bar, we set a price, and we say, you tell us how you are you going to reduce carbon, but we need to reduce carbon to make sure that the rains still come so that the canal still works. <p>And that approach to regulation, it's not so much you're for regulation or against regulation, but you're thinking what regulations work today in a practical way to meet our goals, and how do we do it in a way that is the least bureaucratic and the least disruptive, but recognizing that there are still goals that have to be met. <p>And the last point I would make is, in terms of specific actions&mdash;this was raised earlier&mdash;the United States is very committed to working with all the countries that are participating in this summit. We are consulting intensively on a bilateral basis, but we're also very interested in working on a regional level. I mentioned Central America. I've put forward a budget of $1 billion in investment in Central America to deal specifically with some of the issues of human investment in capital and youth so that rather than young people feeling a sense of desperation and the only recourse they have is to join gangs or leave their country, that they can start an Internet company using social media and start marketing goods that are produced in their own countries in places all around the world. <p>There is so much talent, and there's so much ingenuity, but it does require some joint investment and recognizing that we have to think beyond our borders in order to do the right thing for our people. It is good for the United States for some young person in Honduras to have access to the Internet, have access to education, and have access to opportunity. It's good for the United States if Brazil is growing at a rapid pace. It's good for the United States if Panama continues to thrive or Mexico is continuing to succeed. <p>And the more we see our economies as mutually dependent rather than a zero-sum game, I think the more successful all of us will be. And so we'll take the list of all the business leaders, and we'll work through those lists. I guarantee you that the United States will be more than open to making as much as progress as we can before the next Summit of the Americas. And I'm confident that at least the four&mdash;the three leaders on this stage, they'll be with me&mdash;and Luis also. [<i>Laughter</i>]. All right.\" "
"82" "\"<i>Buenas tarde</i>s. Thank you, President Varela, and thank you very much, Panama, for hosting this Summit of the Americas and, most importantly, for hosting this civil society forum. And I thank everybody who's traveled here from across the region for the courageous work that you do to defend freedom and human rights and to promote equality and opportunity and justice across our hemisphere and around the world. <p>I am proud to be with you at this first-ever official gathering of civil society leaders at the Summit of the Americas. And I'm pleased to have Cuba represented with us at this summit for the very first time. <p>Now, we're here for a very simple reason. We believe that strong, successful countries require strong and vibrant civil societies. We know that throughout our history, human progress has been propelled not just by famous leaders, not just by states, but by ordinary men and women who believe that change is possible; by citizens who are willing to stand up against incredible odds and great danger, not only to protect their own rights, but to extend rights to others. <p>I had a chance to reflect on this last month when I was in the small town of Selma, Alabama. Some of you may have heard of it. It's a place where, 50 years ago, African Americans marched in peaceful, nonviolent protest, not to ask for special treatment but to be treated equally, in accordance with the founding documents of our Declaration of Independence, our Bill of Rights. They were part of a civil rights movement that had endured violence and repression for decades and would endure it again that day, as many of the marchers were beaten. <p>But they kept marching. And despite the beatings of that day, they came back, and more returned. And the conscience of a nation was stirred. Their efforts bent, in the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, the arc of the moral universe towards justice. And it was their vision for a more fair and just and inclusive and generous society that ultimately triumphed. And the only reason I stand here today as the President of the United States is because those ordinary people&mdash;maids and janitors and schoolteachers&mdash;were willing to endure hardship on my behalf. <p>And that's why I believe so strongly in the work that you do. It's the dreamers&mdash;no matter how humble or poor or seemingly powerless&mdash;that are able to change the course of human events. We saw it in South Africa, where citizens stood up to the scourge of apartheid. We saw it in Europe, where Poles marched in Solidarity to help bring down the Iron Curtain; in Argentina, where mothers of the disappeared spoke out against the Dirty War. It's the story of my country, where citizens worked to abolish slavery and establish women's rights and workers' rights and rights for gays and lesbians. <p>It's not to say that my country is perfect; we are not. And that's the point. We always have to have citizens who are willing to question and push our government and identify injustice. We have to wrestle with our own challenges: from issues of race to policing to inequality. But what makes me most proud about the extraordinary example of the United States is not that we're perfect, but that we struggle with it and we have this open space in which society can continually try to make us a more perfect Union. <p>We've stood up, at great cost, for freedom and human dignity, not just in our own country, but elsewhere. I'm proud of that. And we embrace our ability to become better through our democracy. And that requires more than just the work of government. It demands the hard and frustrating, sometimes, but absolutely vital work of ordinary citizens coming together to make common cause. <p>So civil society is the conscience of our countries. It's the catalyst of change. It's why strong nations don't fear active citizens. Strong nations embrace and support and empower active citizens. And by the way, it's not as if active citizens are always right; they're not. Sometimes, people start yelling at me or arguing at me, and I think, you don't know what you're talking about. [<i>Laughter</i>] But sometimes, they do. And the question is not whether they're always right; the question is, do you have a society in which that conversation, that debate, can be tested and ideas are tested in the marketplace? <p>And because of the efforts of civil society, now, by and large, there's a consensus in the Americas on democracy and human rights and social development and social inclusiveness. Now, I recognize there's strong differences about the role of civil society, but I believe we can all benefit from open and tolerant and inclusive dialogue. And we should reject violence or intimidation that's aimed at silencing people's voices. <p>The freedom to be heard is a principle that the Americas at large is committed to. And that doesn't mean, as I said, that we're going to agree on every issue. But we should address those issue candidly and honestly and civilly and welcome the voices of all of our people into the debates that shape the future of the hemisphere. <p>Now, just to take one example: As the United States begins a new chapter in our relationship with Cuba, we hope it will create an environment that improves the lives of the Cuban people, not because it's imposed by us, the United States, but through the talent and ingenuity and aspirations and the conversation among Cubans from all walks of life so they can decide what the best course is for their prosperity. <p>As we move toward the process of normalization, we'll have our differences, Government to Government, with Cuba on many issues, just as we differ at times with other nations within the Americas, just as we differ with our closest allies. There's nothing wrong with that. But I'm here to say that when we do speak out, we're going to do so because the United States of America does believe, and will always stand for, a certain set of universal values. And when we do partner with civil society, it's because we believe our relationship should be with governments and with the peoples that they represent. <p>It's also because we believe that your work is more important than ever. Here in the Americas, inequality still locks too many people out of our economies. Discrimination still locks too many out of our societies. Around the world, there are still too many places where laws are passed to stifle civil society, where governments cut off funding for groups that they don't agree with; where entrepreneurs are crushed under corruption; where activists and journalists are locked up on trumped-up charges because they dare to be critical of their governments; where the way you look or how you pray or who you love can get you imprisoned or killed. <p>And whether it's crackdowns on free expression in Russia or China or restrictions on freedom of association and assembly in Egypt or prison camps run by the North Korean regime, human rights and fundamental freedoms are still at risk around the world. And when that happens, we believe we have a moral obligation to speak out. <p>We also know that our support for civil society is not just about what we're against, but also what we're for. Because we've noticed that governments that are more responsive and effective are typically governments where the people are free to assemble and speak their minds and petition their leaders and hold us accountable. <p>We know that our economies attract more trade and investment when citizens are free to start a new business without paying a bribe. We know that societies are more likely to succeed when all our people&mdash;regardless of color or class or creed or sexual orientation or gender&mdash;are free to live and pray and love as they choose. That's what we believe. <p>And increasingly, civil society is a source of ideas about everything from promoting transparency and free expression to reversing inequality and rescuing our environment. And that's why, as part of our \\"Stand With Civil Society\\" initiative, we've joined with people around the world to push back on those who deny your right to be heard. I've made it a mission of our government not only to protect civil society groups, but to partner with you and empower you with the knowledge and the technology and the resources to put your ideas into action. And the U.S. supports the efforts to establish a permanent, meaningful role for civil societies in future Summits of the Americas. <p>So let me just say, when the United States sees space closing for civil society, we will work to open it. When efforts are made to wall you off from the world, we'll try to connect you with each other. When you are silenced, we'll try to speak out alongside you. And when you're suppressed, we want to help strengthen you. As you work for change, the United States will stand up alongside you every step of the way. We are respectful of the differences among our countries. The days in which our agenda in this hemisphere so often presumed that the United States could meddle with impunity, those days are past. <p>But what it does mean&mdash;but we do have to be very clear that when we speak out on behalf of somebody who's been imprisoned for no other reason than because they spoke truth to power, when we are helping an organization that is trying to empower a minority group inside a country to get more access to resources, we're not doing that because it serves our own interests, we're doing it because we think it's the right thing to do. And that's important. <p>And I hope that all the other countries at the Summit of the Americas will join us in seeing that it's important. Because sometimes, as difficult as it is, it's important for us to be able to speak honestly and candidly about&mdash;on behalf of people who are vulnerable and people who are powerless, people who are voiceless. I know, because there was a time in our own country where there were groups that were voiceless and powerless. And because of world opinion, that helped to change those circumstances. We have a debt to pay, because the voices of ordinary people have made us better. That's a debt that I want to make sure we repay in this hemisphere and around the world. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you.\" "
"83" "\"Well, thank you, President Molina. Let me, first of all, thank our friend, the President of Panama and the people of Panama, Vice President of Panama, for the incredible hospitality and the outstanding arrangements for this summit. <p>It is good to see all of you again. The last time we met was in Costa Rica, and we, I thought, had a very productive discussion. And rather than just talk, I think our goal was to make sure that we had concrete actions that we could take that would improve our economies, the opportunities for our people, security in the region. <p>And this is very important to the United States, not just because of proximity, not just because our neighbors who are represented here are very close by, but because we have incredible bonds as people. There are Americans who make enormous contributions to our society every single day who come from Nicaragua and El Salvador and Belize and all the countries that are represented here today. <p>And so we have ties of family. We have ties of commerce. We share incredible heritage and incredible history. And so it is very important for us to make sure that the United States stands in solidarity and has a partnership with each of the countries that are represented around this table. <p>I will not be long. As President Molina indicated, since the last time we've met, it has been the determination of my administration that we find ways that we can more concretely assist many of the countries in Central America so that people in those countries feel that they have opportunity and development. That is in our interests, and that is in your interests as well. <p>We know, for example, that criminal elements and narcotrafficking thrives where people feel that they have no other pathways to success. If we can make sure that they feel that their efforts are rewarded in their own countries, then we're going to be much more successful with the security arrangements and coordination that we are involved with. <p>We know that the issue of migration does not just affect the United States, it also affects the countries in the region themselves. And the more that people, where they live, feel that they can find opportunity and raise families and be successful, the less disruptions there are and the less tensions there are at our borders. <p>As a consequence, in my budget, I've requested $1 billion to support U.S. engagement across Central America. Some of these dollars would be designed to strengthen regional cooperation on security, but some of it, as President Varela and I spoke about during our earlier bilateral, is really focused on human development: education, providing young people pathways to success, focusing on what's happening at the community level. And we are very excited to work with you to find what you think will be most effective in your countries, and then to have a coordinated process moving forward in order for us to succeed. <p>We do believe that regional integration on issues like energy, electricity, improving trade flows all can be incredibly valuable for the region as a whole and ultimately will be valuable for the United States as well. We continue to believe that part of that regional agenda should focus on governance issues and transparency. And we're in a city right now and a country that I think has done an excellent job on many of those fronts and, as a consequence, the high growth rates in Panama, I think, should serve as a useful model for so many countries not just in this region, but around the world that business will be attracted where there are skilled workers and where there's rules that people understand and can follow and there's accountability and transparency. <p>So the bottom line is, I think we have a strong, common agenda. This is something that we do because what's good for this region will ultimately good&mdash;be good for the United States, as well. <p>Before I came in, I signed&mdash;me and President Varela witnessed the signing of a deal between Boeing and Copa Airlines. It is going to create 12,000 jobs in the United States and 6,000 in Panama. And that's an example of what happens when we work together. So we want to seize this opportunity. <p>I'm very grateful for the opportunities to dialogue with you. I want to spend most of my time listening and not just talking. And we are very, very grateful to all of you for the cooperation and partnership that we already have. We think we can make it even stronger and even better. <p>Thank you.\" "
"84" "\"Let me begin by thanking President Varela and the Panamanian Government for their leadership in hosting this seventh Summit of the Americas. Mr. President, to you and the people of Panama City and all the people of Panama, thank you for your extraordinary hospitality and your outstanding arrangements. <p>I too want to express my thoughts and prayers are with the people of Chile as they're managing through a very difficult time. And I look forward to seeing President Bachelet at a future summit. <p>When I came to my first Summit of the Americas 6 years ago, I promised to begin a new chapter of engagement in this region. I believed that our nations had to break free from the old arguments and the old grievances that had too often trapped us in the past, that we had a shared responsibility to look to the future and to think and act in fresh ways. I pledged to build a new era of cooperation between our countries, as equal partners, based on mutual interests and mutual respect. And I said that this new approach would be sustained throughout my Presidency; it has, including during this past year. I've met that commitment. <p>We come together at a historic time. As has already been noted, the changes that I announced to U.S. policy toward Cuba mark the beginning of a new relationship between the people of the United States and the people of Cuba. It will mean, as we're already seeing, more Americans traveling to Cuba, more cultural exchanges, more commerce, more potential investment. And most of all, it will mean more opportunity and resources for the Cuban people. We hope to be able to help on humanitarian projects, to provide more access to telecommunications and the Internet and the free flow of information. <p>We continue to make progress towards fulfilling our shared commitments to formally reestablish diplomatic relations, and I have called on Congress to begin working to lift the embargo that's been in place for decades. The point is, the United States will not be imprisoned by the past. We're looking to the future and to policies that improve the lives of the Cuban people and advance the interests of cooperation in the hemisphere. <p>Now, this shift in U.S. policy represents a turning point for our entire region. The fact that President Castro and I are both sitting here today marks a historic occasion. This is the first time in more than half a century that all the nations of the Americas are meeting to address our future together. I think it's no secret&mdash;President Castro, I'm sure, would agree&mdash;that there will continue to be significant differences between our two countries. We will continue to speak out on behalf of universal values that we think are important. I'm sure President Castro will continue to speak out on the issues he thinks are important. <p>But I firmly believe that if we can continue to move forward and seize this momentum in pursuit of mutual interests, then better relations between the United States and Cuba will create new opportunities for cooperation across our region for the security and prosperity and health and dignity of all our people. <p>Now, alongside our shift toward Cuba, the United States has deepened our engagement in in America&mdash;in the Americas across the board. Since I took office, we've boosted U.S. exports and also U.S. imports from the rest of the hemisphere by over 50 percent. And that supports millions of jobs in all of our countries. I've proposed $1 billion to help the peoples of Central America strengthen governance and improve security and help to spark more economic growth and, most importantly, provide new pathways for young people who too often see their only prospects in an underground economy that too often leads to violence. <p>We're partnering with countries across the region to develop clean, more affordable and reliable energy that helps nations to combat the urgent threat of climate change, as President Rousseff already noted. Our 100,000 Strong in the Americas initiative is working to bring 100,000 students from Latin America to the United States and 100,000 students from the United States to Latin America. The new initiatives that I announced in Jamaica will help empower a new generation of young people across the Americas with the skills and job training that they need to compete in the global economy. <p>And during the course of my meetings with CARICOM, as well as my meetings with SICA, as well as the discussions that I've had with many of you bilaterally, there have been additional ideas that we're very interested in: finding ways in which we can expand access to the Internet and broadband; how we can structure private-public partnerships to rebuild infrastructure across the region; and to expand our commercial ties in a broad-based and inclusive way. Because I am firmly of the belief that we will only succeed if everybody benefits from the economic growth, not just a few at the top. <p>At home, I've taken executive actions to fix as much of our broken immigration system as I can, which includes trying to help people come out of the shadows so that they can live and work in a country that they called home. And that includes hundreds of thousands of young people we call DREAMers, who have already received temporary relief. And I'm remaining committed to working with our Congress on comprehensive immigration reform. <p>So the bottom line is this: The United States is focused on the future. We're not caught up in ideology&mdash;at least I'm not. I'm interested in progress, and I'm interested in results. I'm not interested in theoretic arguments; I'm interested in actually delivering for people. We are more deeply engaged across the region than we have been in decades. And those of you have interacted with me know that if you bring an issue to my attention, I will do my best to try to address it. I will not always be able to fix it right away, but I will do my best. <p>I believe the relationship between the United States and the Americas is as good as it has ever been. And I'm here today to work with you to build on this progress. Now, let me just mention a few areas in which I think we can make more progress. <p>First, we've&mdash;we will continue to uphold the Inter-American Democratic Charter, which states that \\"the peoples of the Americas have a right to democracy.\\" I believe our governments, together, have an obligation to uphold the universal freedoms and rights of all our citizens. I want to again commend President Varela and Panama for making civil society groups from across the region formal partners in this summit for the first time. I believe the voices of our citizens must be heard. And I believe, going forward, civil society should be a permanent part of these summits. <p>Second, we have to focus on reigniting economic growth that can fuel progress further in those communities that have not been reached. And that means making the Americas more competitive. We still have work to do to harmonize regulations, encourage good governance and transparency that attracts investment, invest in infrastructure, address some of the challenges that we have with respect to energy. The costs of energy in many communities&mdash;or in many countries, particularly in Central American and the Caribbean, are so high that it presents a great challenge to economic development, and we think that we can help, particularly around clean energy issues. <p>We have to confront the injustice of economic inequality and poverty. And I think that collectively, we are starting to identify what programs work and which programs do not work. And we should put more money in those things that do work and stop doing those things that don't. We don't have money to waste, because there are too many young people out there with enormous need. I think President Varela is right to focus particularly on education and skills building. And this is an agenda which we should all tackle collectively. <p>Third, we have to keep investing in the clean energy that creates jobs and combats climate change. The United States is today leading this global effort, along with many of you. And I should point out that America's carbon pollution is near its lowest level in almost two decades. Across the Americas, I think, we have the opportunity to expand our clean energy partnerships and increase our investments in renewables. <p>And finally, we have to stand firm for the security of our citizens. We must continue to join with our partners across the region, especially in Central America, but also in the Caribbean, to promote an approach, a holistic approach that applies rule of law, respects human rights, but also tackles the narcotraffickers that devastate so many communities. This is a shared responsibility. And I've said before that the United States has a responsibility to reduce the demand for drugs and to reduce the flow of weapons south, even as we partner with you to go after the networks that can cause so much violence. <p>So a new relationship with Cuba; more trade and economic partnerships that reduce poverty and create opportunity, particularly focusing on education; increased people-to-people exchanges; more investment in our young people; clean energy that combats climate change; security cooperation to protect our citizens and our communities&mdash;that's the new chapter of engagement that the United States is pursuing across the Americas. <p>I want to make one last comment addressing the&mdash;some of the points that President Correa raised and I'm sure will be raised by a few others during this discussion. I always enjoy the history lessons that I receive when I'm here. I'm a student of history, so I tend to actually be familiar with many of these episodes that have been mentioned. I am the first one to acknowledge that America's application of concern around human rights has not always been consistent. And I'm certainly mindful that there are dark chapters in our own history in which we have not observed the principles and ideals upon which the country was founded. <p>Just a few weeks ago, I was in Selma, Alabama, celebrating the 50th anniversary of a march across a bridge that resulted in horrific violence. And the reason I was there, and the reason it was a celebration, is because it was a triumph of human spirit in which ordinary people, without resort to violence, were able to overcome systematic segregation. Their voices were heard, and our country changed. <p>America never makes a claim about being perfect. We do make a claim about being open to change. And so I would just say that we can, I suppose, spend a lot of time talking about past grievances, and I suppose that it's possible to use the United States as a handy excuse every so often for political problems that may be occurring domestically. But that's not going to bring progress. That's not going to solve the problems of children who can't read or don't have enough to eat. It's not going to make our countries more productive or more competitive in a global economy. So I just want to make very clear that when we speak out on something like human rights, it's not because we think we are perfect, but it is because we think the ideal of not jailing people if they disagree with you is the right ideal. <p>Perhaps President Correa has more confidence than I do in distinguishing between bad press and good press. There are a whole bunch of press that I think is bad, mainly because it criticizes me, but they continue to speak out in the United States because I don't have confidence in a system in which one person is making that determination. I think that if we believe in democracy it means that everybody has the chance to speak out and offer their opinions and stand up for what they believe is right and express their conscience and pray as they would and organize and assemble as they believe is appropriate, as long as they're not operating violently. <p>So we will continue to speak out on those issues, not because we're interested in meddling, but because we know from our own history. It's precisely because we're imperfect that we believe it's appropriate for us to stand up. When Dr. King was in jail, people outside the United States spoke up on his behalf. And I would be betraying our history if I did not do the same. <p>The cold war has been over for a long time. And I'm not interested in having battles that, frankly, started before I was born. What I am interested in is solving problems, working with you. That's what the United States is interested in doing. That's why we've invested so much in our bilateral relationships, and that's why I will continue to invest in creating the kind of spirit of equal partnership and mutual interest and mutual respect upon which I believe progress can advance. <p>Thank you very much.\" "
"85" "\"<i>The President. </i>Thank you so much. Everybody, have a seat. <p>[<i>At this point, the President sang briefly as follows.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Well&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>[<i>The President then made remarks as follows.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> I hope everybody is in the spirit tonight. Bringing some church&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;to the White House. <p>Good evening, everybody. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Good evening. <p><i>The President.</i> Tonight we continue one of my favorite traditions here at the White House by celebrating the music that has helped to shape our Nation. And over the years, we've had the quintessential sounds of America fill this room, from jazz to Motown to blues to country. So it is fitting that tonight we honor the music that influenced all those genres, gospel. <p>I want to start by thanking tonight's amazing performers: Shirley Caesar, Darlene Love, Rhiannon Giddens, Rance Allen, Emmylou Harris, Rodney Crowell, Tamela Mann, Lyle Lovett, and the Morgan State University Choir. And I also want to thank tonight's MC, Robin Roberts, who we love. <p>Now, I've got to say, you're having a pretty good night when T-Bone Burnett and the Queen of Soul herself, Aretha Franklin, show up at your house to jam. So we've got royalty here tonight. It's a state visit tonight. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We don't know everything about the origins of gospel, but we do know that this music is rooted in the spirituals sung by the slaves, which W.E.B. Du Bois called \\"the most beautiful expression of human experience born this side of the seas.\\" <p>Even though they were often forbidden to read or write or even speak freely, slaves were permitted to sing. Songs were where their dreams took flight, where they expressed faith and love, as well as pain and fear and unimaginable loss. Songs were also how they conveyed information: the locations of safe houses for runaway slaves or directions for a path towards freedom, buried in the coded language of divine lyrics. They sang songs of liberation, if not for their bodies in this world, then for their souls in the next. <p>And over time, those spirituals blended with hymns and sacred songs to become the music of the Black church. In the decades after the Civil War, as free men and women streamed north in record numbers searching for a new life, they brought those tunes with them. <p>But the gospel music we know today really started in the 1930s, when jazz musician Thomas A. Dorsey combined the sounds of the church he grew up in with the jazz and blues that he loved. By the 1960s, gospel music had become central to the civil rights movement&mdash;not just through the political activism of legends like Mahalia Jackson and the Staple Singers, but through the songs themselves, from hymns like \\"Take My Hand, Precious Lord,\\" a favorite of Dr. King's, to the anthem of the movement, \\"We Shall Overcome.\\" <p>Gospel music has evolved over time, but its heart stays true. It still has an unmatched power to strike the deepest chord in all of us, touching people of all faiths and of no faith. As Mahalia Jackson herself once said, \\"Blues are the song of despair, but gospel songs are the songs of hope.\\" Hope that we might rise above our failures and disappointments. Hope that we might receive His redemption. Hope that, in lifting our voices together, we too might one day reach the Promised Land. <p>So tonight we will hear from musicians who helped to shape this singular American art form and musicians who are taking gospel to great new heights. <p>And to get us started, I'd like to introduce an extraordinary singer, a woman who reaches millions with her music and preaches to her flock from her North Carolina pulpit every Sunday. Please give it up for Reverend, Doctor, Pastor Shirley Caesar.\" "
"86" "\"Well, I want to welcome Presidents Sirleaf, Koroma, and Cond&eacute;. The United States has a long partnership with Liberia and Sierra Leone and Guinea, partnerships that proved to be critical in the fight against Ebola. We're here to assess progress today and to look ahead. <p>We begin by noting the incredible losses that took place in all three countries. More than 10,000 people have died from Ebola: men, women, and children. On behalf of the American people, we want to express our deepest condolences to the families and recognize how challenging this has been for all the countries involved. <p>Under extraordinary circumstances, the people of these three countries have shown great courage and resolve, treating and taking care of each other, especially children and orphans. The United States has been proud to lead an international effort to work with these three countries in a global response. <p>Last week, there were fewer than 40 new cases, so we've seen major progress. In Liberia right now, there are zero cases. In Sierra Leone and Guinea combined, there were fewer than 40 new cases last week, and that's around the lowest number in a year. Now we're focused on a shared goal, and that is getting to zero. We can't be complacent. This virus is unpredictable. <p>We have to be vigilant, and the international community has to remain fully engaged in a partnership with these three countries until there are no cases of Ebola in these countries. Health systems also have to be rebuilt to meet daily needs: vaccines for measles, delivering babies safely, treating HIV/AIDS and malaria. And with our Global Health Security Agenda, we intend to do more to prevent future epidemics. <p>So the Ebola epidemic has been also an economic crisis. That's part of the reason why these three Presidents are here. They're going to be meeting with a number of the multilateral institutions&mdash;the IMF and World Bank&mdash;here in Washington. There's the challenge of restoring markets and agricultural growth, promoting investment and development. So I'm going to be looking forward to hearing from them, how the United States can stand shoulder to shoulder with them to work hard to take this crisis and turn it into an opportunity to rebuild even stronger than before: to strengthen administrative systems, public health systems; to continue the work that they've done in rooting out corruption, reinforcing democratic institutions&mdash;all of which will be the foundation stones for long-term progress and prosperity. <p>So, Madam President, Mr. Presidents, we are very grateful for the hard work that you've done. We're proud to partner with you, and we intend to see this through until the job is done. <p>All right? Thank you, everybody.\" "
"87" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. Good morning, everybody. What a gorgeous day! I will just point out, it is always beautiful at this particular event. It is gorgeous every single day. And I want to thank Vice President Biden and VA Secretary Bob McDonald for being here. <p>This is the sixth time that we've welcomed the Soldier Ride to the White House. This is one of our favorite events every single year. You all know the story. Over 10 years ago, a young Long Island bartender, a civilian named Chris Carney, dreamed up the idea of biking coast to coast to raise money and support for our wounded warriors. And back then, he probably would not have predicted how far the Soldier Ride would go, how thousands of Americans would join the cause, how a nation would be inspired by all of you. <p>We've got a number of folks here who are currently serving or have served in uniform. We've got Army. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> We've got Navy. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President. </i>Air Force. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President. </i>We've got Marines. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> And we've got some Coast Guard. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Yeah! [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> That's it, man. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We've got some extraordinary military families who support you every single mile. So we are among heroes here today. All the riders, I just had a chance to say hi to them, and they look great. Don't get too comfortable though. You've got a lot of miles ahead. This is just a pit stop so we can all cheer you on. <p>Just to give you a&mdash;some sense of who these riders are, we've got heroes like Sergeant William Armstrong. Where's William? There he is in the back. William was 24 years old and serving in Afghanistan when a roadside bomb tore the ligaments in his knee and broke the bones in his leg. As a lifelong distance runner, he was devastated that he might never run again. But he didn't give up. His caretakers at Walter Reed got him a bike so he could get into shape. After a lot of surgeries, months of physical therapy, 2 weeks ago, William ran a marathon. <p><i>Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert A. McDonald</i>. Incredible. <p><i>The President</i>. And I want to quote what William said here. He said, \\"This Army put me back together,\\" he says. But it was being \\"with people with similar life experiences . . . that exhilarated and motivated me.\\" Thank you, William, for your incredible service. We've got Specialist Teresa Ann Jackson. Where's Teresa? There she is right there. Two years ago, while serving as a medic at Fort Campbell, Teresa fell ill with a rare disease that affected her arteries. Doctors had to amputate both her feet. She remembers the shock and isolation she and her husband felt afterwards. And it&mdash;again, I want to quote her. \\"I wasn't expecting to be in a wheelchair at 30,\\" she says. And at first, her&mdash;at her first Wounded Warrior event, she found a community of people who welcomed her, who understood what she was going through, who continue to support her today through her recovery. And today, Teresa wants to study to be a social worker so that she can give back to others. Teresa, we thank you for&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>And we've got Captain Vincent Cerchione. Where's Vincent? There he is right there. In 2003, Vincent led a dozen soldiers of the Third Infantry Division into battle in Iraq, taking rocket fire on a daily basis. He served two tours there and then came home with the kind of wound you can't always see: posttraumatic stress. But with courage and the support of his wife, Vincent reached out for help, which is what we want all of our warriors to do. He says that when he found the Wounded Warrior Project&mdash;and I'm quoting here&mdash;\\"It was the first time since I returned that I'd ever talked to anybody and felt like I wasn't alone.\\" Vincent, you are never alone. And because of your service, we also know that we are never alone and we're always safe. Thank you so much for everything you've done. <p>So that's what these riders represent here today, that sense of community and support and love for each other. And that's what binds everyone who serves proudly under our flag and all the Americans who cheer you on. It's our chance to say to all our returning heroes that you're not alone, that we've got your back, we're going to be with you every step of the way. We will be with you all that long journey that it often takes to recover every single mile. <p>You and all the men and women of our Armed Forces represent what's best in America. And for me and Michelle and the girls, for Joe Biden and Jill, and I know Bob and his family, time with you has been some of the most inspiring parts of our jobs. We could not be prouder of you or more grateful to you and your families for everything you've done to protect our freedom. <p>And that's why, as Commander in Chief, I'm going to keep doing everything in my power to make sure that we serve you as well as you serve us. That means getting you the care and benefits that you deserve and have earned, including wounds like traumatic brain injury and posttraumatic stress. It means making sure our veterans have the education and the jobs and opportunities that you have to have in order to get your shot at the American Dream that you helped to defend. It means recognizing and supporting the incredible families and caregivers who sacrifice so much. They serve as well. We've got to be there for those families. <p>So I want to encourage every American along the route to get out and cheer for these men and women. And I want all of our riders&mdash;and all those that you're riding for, including some who were left behind on the field of battle&mdash;we want all of you to know that we're not just going to be with you for 3 days and these 60 miles. As a nation, as Americans grateful for your sacrifices, we're going to be with you on all the roads of your life ahead. <p>So God bless you and your families, all who serve. God bless America. With that, I'm going to do my favorite part, which is blow the horn. [<i>Laughter</i>] Let's get this ride started. <p>[<i>At this point, the President was given an air horn by a member of his staff.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Ya'll ready? <i>Audience members. </i>America! <p><i>The President.</i> America! [<i>Laughter</i>] Okay. On your marks! Get set! <p>[<i>The President sounded the horn, and the ride began.</i>]\" "
"88" "\"<i>The President</i>. Hey! Hello, everybody. Thank you so much. Thank you. Everybody, have a seat, have a seat. <p>Well, welcome to the White House, everybody. Picked a nice day to visit. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I want to thank Satya not only for the introduction, but also for the great work Microsoft is doing on behalf of working families. It is critical that we recognize that government has a role, but community, business, faith groups, civil society&mdash;we all have a part to play in making sure that everybody has got a fair shot in this society. <p>I want to thank all of our guests, including Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, who is a long-time believer in these issues, from the great State of Texas. <p>Every so often, we bring together a group of ordinary people from across America who are making extraordinary contributions to their communities. They're not doing it with a lot of fanfare, but they are driven by a simple desire to make things better, one step at a time, and I suppose this is my bias, as somebody who worked in communities for quite some time, even before I went to law school: a strong belief that change happens not from the top down, but from the bottom up. <p>We say&mdash;we call these folks Champions of Change. You help us raise our own ambitions by showing us what is possible. You create models and templates for success in expanding opportunity or increasing equality or promoting diversity and tolerance. And as a consequence, we learn from your experiences, and we draw inspiration from what you've achieved. And days like this give us a chance to say thank you. <p>So today we honor 12 Champions who've helped make our Nation move forward in a particular area, and that is supporting working families in a 21st-century economy. <p>Now, in&mdash;thanks partly to the decisions that we made early in the worst financial crisis in our lifetimes, our businesses have now created more than 12 million new jobs over the past 5 years. Unemployment has fallen from a high of 10 percent down to 5&frac12; percent. More kids are graduating. More folks are saving money at the pump because of increased fuel efficiency standards and greater energy production, doubling of clean energy production, reduction of carbon pollution. <p>More Americans know the security of health care: over 16 million people have health insurance. Our uninsured rate is the lowest that it's been perhaps since we started keeping the kinds of records we do about who's got health insurance and who doesn't. The recovery is reaching more Americans each and every day. More Microsoft stuff is sold, and more Patagonia coats are sold, and&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;which means that folks are interested in seeing how they can expand their businesses. <p>Now, the question we now face is, how do we make sure that this growth and the recovery benefits everybody and not just some? How do we make sure it's broad based and hence sustainable? Do we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well, or do we want an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everybody who's willing to put in the effort? And in case you weren't sure what the right answer was&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I believe in the latter approach. I believe in broad-based economic growth with a growing, thriving middle class and ladders of opportunity for folks who are trying to get into the middle class. That's why we call it middle class economics: the idea that the country does best when everybody gets a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same set of rules. <p>And I believe in this in my gut not simply because of ideas of basic fairness, not just because it's more consistent with our democracy, not only because, personally, I wouldn't be here had the country not given me opportunity and so I'm biased in that way, but because there's good, sound economic evidence that when everybody's incomes are going up and working people have more money in their pockets to spend, businesses do better. And we all prosper, and we all thrive, and we're less subject to the bubbles and the speculation, the ups and downs that can throw a modern economy off. <p>So a key part of middle class economics is helping working families feel more secure in a constantly changing economy. And we do that by bringing workplaces stuck into the last&mdash;in the last century into this century, and this is something that I've made a priority as President. Because our workplaces have changed, we have to change with them. So, for example, women now make up about half of America's workforce. More women are their family's main breadwinners than ever before. But our policies haven't completely caught up to that reality. We are still the only advanced country on Earth without paid leave. So when a baby arrives or&mdash;and I&mdash;there have been a lot of babies in the White House lately&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;see, we have another one coming right here, right in the front row. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So when a baby arrives or an aging parent gets sick, too often, workers have to make gut-wrenching choices about whether they can afford to be there when their families need them most. Too many women face unnecessary difficulties on the job, like the difficulty of being paid less than a man for doing the same work. That's a difficulty. Or being reprimanded or fired for taking too many bathroom breaks when you're pregnant. [<i>Laughter</i>] Clearly, that's a man making that decision, because they don't have a&mdash;5 pounds of kicks pressing down on their bladder. [<i>Laughter</i>] Or being forced to take leave when they're still being&mdash;perfectly capable of doing their work. <p>Women can't even depend, by law, on getting a paid day off to give birth. So yesterday I traveled to Charlotte for a conversation with working women about the issues they care about most, heard a lot about the wage gap and how it impacts families. And as I pointed out, ensuring equal pay for women is a no-brainer. There are some things that are really complicated. Satya and I had lunch before we came out here, and we were talking about some very complicated issues around sort of the future of technology. Paying women the same as men for doing the same job, that's not hard. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's not hard. <p>And it's not a women's issue. As I said yesterday, right now Michelle is not getting paid anything, and she points that out. [<i>Laughter</i>] But before we got to the White House, when she was working, I wanted her to get paid the same as a man did because if she was getting paid, that money accrued to our account. [<i>Laughter</i>] Just as her expenses accrued to our account. [<i>Laughter</i>] So this is a family issue. And obviously, as a dad, this is personal for me, because when Sasha and Malia start their careers, the idea that they'd be treated different as somebody's sons is unacceptable. <p>And in today's economy, having both parents in the workforce is an economic reality for many families. And yet, in 31 States, high-quality childcare costs are higher than in-State college tuition. Down in North Carolina, where we were yesterday, average cost of childcare, $16,000. If you're making 50, which is middle class, that's hard to manage. Mom and dads deserve to be able to focus on work when they're at work because they've got a safe place for their kids to learn and to grow and it doesn't cost them an arm and a leg. <p>So things like paid leave, paid sick days, childcare, equal pay&mdash;these are family issues, and these are economic issues. Sometimes in this town, they're treated as women's issues or side issues. We have to recognize them for what they are: They are national economic priorities. At a time when women are playing a bigger role in the economy than ever before, anything that holds women back holds back the entire country. When women succeed, America succeeds. That's my belief. <p>So that's why in my State of the Union Address I challenged Congress to take action on these issues. And I'm going to keep putting the pressure on, and I need you to join me, because America deserves a Congress that doesn't just talk about supporting working families, but actually supports working families. <p>And while we're waiting for Congress, a lot of Americans are saying, we're just going to go get stuff done on our own. You've got mayors and State legislators and Governors that are moving forward, passing paid leave, raising their State's minimum wage, ending pregnancy discrimination. And business leaders are joining them, because they know&mdash;as Satya said&mdash;that family-friendly policies are not frills, they are good for the bottom line. <p>So behind the scenes of all this progress are Champions of Change like the ones that we honor here today. Some have worked on these issues for years, far from the limelight, oftentimes against great odds. <p>Just to take&mdash;I'm just going to cite a few examples so you have a sense of who these people are. More than a decade ago, Netsy Firestein, where's Netsy? [<i>Laughter</i>] Raise your hand&mdash;there you go. Netsy led a campaign in California for paid family leave. People said it was a long shot. But in 2002, California became the first State in the Nation to guarantee that workers can take time off to care for family without losing their whole paycheck. And 13 years later, only two other States have done the same. But Netsy has proved that it's possible. California is growing; businesses are being created. Not only is it possible, it's the right thing to do. It's patriotic. We should learn from her example and get those numbers up. We need more States to join in. <p>Renee Stromme is here. Where's Renee? You're right there&mdash;there's Renee, right there. Renee lobbied North Dakota to require that employers extend reasonable accommodations to pregnant workers, like being able to sit instead of stand or take more frequent water breaks. And next week, she will watch that bill signed into law. Way to go, Renee. <p>A few years ago, ReShonda Young joined her family's business in Waterloo, Iowa. I've&mdash;I know Waterloo. [<i>Laughter</i>] First day of my campaign, or was it the second day? It was the second day. Second day of my campaign, I was in Waterloo, Iowa. It's a great town. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm sorry, I got interrupted. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And so she discovered that the women were paid less than men for doing the same work. And so, as she puts it, she stuck her neck out, had some uncomfortable conversations with her old-school dad. And today, thanks to ReShonda, the family business pays workers fairly. And so ReShonda, right back here&mdash;and ReShonda, if I'm not mistaken, turnover has gone down, and employee loyalty is up since they made this change. And the business is doing well. Selling popcorn, right? [<i>Laughter</i>] <i>Popcorn Heaven Founder ReShonda Young.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President</i>. Yes. <p>And as we just heard from Satya, Microsoft recently made history by announcing that not only does it already have family-friendly policies&mdash;sometimes, you hear the argument, well, it's big companies, we don't have to do the same thing&mdash;but now Microsoft says no, no, we want contractors to provide paid leave to employees if you want to do work with Microsoft. And for a company as big as Microsoft, that one change will mean greater security and peace of mind for thousands of families and, hopefully, inspire more companies to do the same for their workers. <p>But Microsoft is not the only company that is a change agent. We've got the CEO of Patagonia, Rose Marcario, who is here. Patagonia sounds like a cool company to work for, by the way. [<i>Laughter</i>] And you get&mdash;I assume you get a good discount on good, nice gear? [<i>Laughter</i>] But in addition to the nice gear, it offers its new mothers and new fathers 2 months of paid leave. And they have a childcare center on site at their corporate headquarters. <p>So employees can take paid time off to volunteer for a cause that they believe in. They can spend time at their children's school. People don't have to choose between paying the bills and seeing their kids shine in the class play. And that means that that worker will do whatever it takes to help the company succeed the next time out because they know that Rose and others at the very top are looking out for them. <p>So not only do we have grassroots activists as Champions of Change, we also have CEOs who are Champions of Change and small-business leaders who are Champions of Change. And I do hope that business leaders across the country follow their example. These companies are making the business case for supporting working families, showing that it's good for the bottom line. <p>The key to staying competitive in the global economy is going to be our workforce. And the government has a role to play in making sure that we're providing great education at the start, more affordable access to college. But family-friendly policies like these can attract brilliant, hard-working talent. We shouldn't have to choose between rewarding work and raising a family. And we've got to fight for that change. Right now there are too many talented people who are being sidelined, there are too many hard-working people being held back. We make it too hard to both work and have a family. <p>These Champions of Change have made a difference in this area. Netsy and Renee, they did not give up. ReShonda was willing to endure a little tension. [<i>Laughter</i>] Families across the country are better off because of their efforts. <p>So to all of you, these Champions on stage, we thank you for your commitment to American families. We thank you for your vision and your determination. And as long as I have the privilege of being President, I will be right there with you, shoulder to shoulder. And that goes for the advocates and business leaders and elected officials across the country who are, as we speak, working to give all of our citizens the chance to pursue their dreams. That's what this is all about. That's what I intend to keep fighting for. I could not be prouder of you. Give them a big round of applause once again. <p>God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"89" "\"I decided that on a day like today, we shouldn't be inside. So I am very pleased to mark a significant bipartisan achievement, and I want to congratulate Speaker Boehner and Leader Nancy Pelosi for the work they did to help make this happen. <p>For the last 13 years, we have been confronted with what's called a doc fix. Basically, the way the law was written, to deal with Medicaid payments to doctors, there was always the danger each year that suddenly, arbitrarily, doctor payments would get cut off, and that was going to be a significant danger to Medicare patients. And obviously, the doctors would have had a lot of trouble continuing to provide services. <p>Not only does this legislation permanently fix payments to doctors, but it also improves it, because what it starts doing is encouraging payments based on quality and not the number of tests that are provided or the number of procedures that are applied, but whether or not people actually start feeling better. And it encourages us to continue to make the health care system smarter without denying service. As a consequence, it's going to be good for people who use Medicare, it's going to be good for our seniors. Ultimately, it's going to be good for all of us because what we've seen is, over the last 3, 4 years, the cost of health care has slowed to the lowest levels in 50 years, and part of that's because we're starting to do health care smarter. <p>This is going to build on that progress that we've already made. It also expands the Children's Health Insurance Program that provides health insurance to young people all across the country, and when our kids are healthy, that means they're going to be healthy adults. Ultimately, that's going to put less strain on the system as well. So this was a bipartisan effort: Republicans and Democrats coming together to do something that's smart and common sense. And my hope is, is it becomes a habit. <p>But I want to congratulate all of the folks involved. And because we wanted to make sure doctors' payments didn't cut off, I'm signing it now rather than wait for getting Members of Congress down here. Hopefully, sometime next week or the week after, we'll be able to have a reception where I can acknowledge the great work that they did while they're enjoying White House hospitality. <p>With that, I will start signing the bill. <p>[<i>At this point, the President signed the bill.</i>] <p>There you go. It's done. Good work.\" "
"90" "\"Thank you. Thank you so much. Everybody, please have a seat. Well, first of all, let me thank Madeleine for the wonderful introduction. [<i>Laughter</i>] And Madeleine is going to be going to Princeton next year, so her and Michelle were exchanging how special they were, backstage. [<i>Laughter</i>] And you know, \\"President\\" is a cool title, but \\"former teen poet\\"&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that is a pretty good title as well. And I'm proud to be both. I have to say my poems are not as good as yours, Madeleine. But I was going to recite some poetry, but Michelle said no. [<i>Laughter</i>] She said, don't do that. [<i>Laughter</i>] No. <p>Anyway, April is National Poetry Month. So Michelle and I figured what better way to celebrate than with some of America's brilliant young poets. And we've invited poetry fans of all ages to join us as well. And we have one of America's most gifted and accomplished poets, my dear friend, Elizabeth Alexander, who's going to share some of work with us. So I'm not going to speak long. <p>Poetry matters. Poetry&mdash;like all art&mdash;gives shape and texture and depth of meaning to our lives. It helps us know the world. It helps us understand ourselves. It helps us understand others: their struggles, their joys, the ways that they see the world. It helps us connect. In the beginning, there was the word. And I think it's fair to say that if we didn't have poetry, that this would be a pretty barren world. In fact, it's not clear that we would survive without poetry. As Elizabeth once wrote, \\"We encounter each other in words, words spiny or smooth, whispered or declaimed, words to consider, reconsider.\\" That's the power of poetry. <p>Sometimes, it's only after reading a poem or writing a poem that we understand something that we already went through, that we felt, that we experienced. And that's why we often reach for poetry in the big moments: when we fall in love or lose somebody close to us or leave behind one stage of life and enter into another. A good poem can make hard times a little easier to survive and make good times a lot sweeter. <p>But poetry does not just matter to us as individuals, it matters to us as a people. The greatness of a country is not just the size of its military or the size of its economy or how much territory it controls. It's also measured by the richness of its culture. And America is America in part because of our poets and our artists and our musicians, all those who have shared their ideas and their stories and helped make us the vibrant and passionate and beautiful country that we are today. <p>It's not every nation that produces poets like Elizabeth or like Madeleine. There are parts of the world where poets are censored or they are silenced. But that's not how we do it here. That's one of the many reasons why we're such a special place. If you want to understand America, then you'd better read some Walt Whitman. [<i>Laughter</i>] If you want to understand America, you need to know Langston Hughes. Or it&mdash;otherwise, you're missing something fundamental about who we are. <p>And now, for the very special poet here today. I met Elizabeth when we were professors together at the University of Chicago. She and Michelle and I have been friends ever since. So when we were planning my first Inauguration, we decided we better have a poet, and we thought we should have a poet that we know and we love. And she penned this extraordinary poem called \\"Praise Song for the Day.\\" You all should read it. On a day full of unforgettable moments, hearing Elizabeth read that poem was one of my favorite moments. And she has just written a amazing book that technically is not a poem, but is full of poetry, and I could not be prouder of her. <p>So congratulations to all the young poets. I look forward to reading your work or hearing your work. But right now I want to introduce Ms. Elizabeth Alexander. <p>[<i>At this point, Elizabeth Alexander, Frederick Iseman Professor of Poetry at Yale University, made brief remarks followed by readings from her works. The First Lady then made concluding remarks.</i>]\" "
"91" "\"Hi, everybody. Wednesday is Earth Day, a day to appreciate and protect this precious planet we call home. And today, there's no greater threat to our planet than climate change. <p>Two thousand fourteen was the planet's warmest year on record. Fourteen of the 15 hottest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century. This winter was cold in parts of our country&mdash;as some folks in Congress like to point out&mdash;but around the world, it was the warmest ever recorded. <p>And the fact that the climate is changing has very serious implications for the way we live now: stronger storms, deeper droughts, longer wildfire seasons. The world's top climate scientists are warning us that a changing climate already affects the air our kids breathe. Last week, the Surgeon General and I spoke with public experts about how climate change is already affecting patients across the country. The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. <p>And on Earth Day, I'm going to visit the Florida Everglades to talk about the way that climate change threatens our economy. The Everglades is one of the most special places in our country, but it's also one of the most fragile. Rising sea levels are putting a national treasure and an economic engine for the South Florida tourism industry at risk. <p>So climate change can no longer be denied or ignored. The world is looking to the United States&mdash;to us&mdash;to lead. And that's what we're doing. We're using more clean energy than ever before. America is number one in wind power, and every 3 weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008. We're taking steps to waste less energy, with more fuel-efficient cars that save us money at the pump and more energy-efficient buildings that save us money on our electricity bills. <p>So thanks in part to these actions, our carbon pollution has fallen by 10 percent since 2007, even as we've grown our economy and seen the longest streak of private-sector job growth on record. We've committed to doubling the pace at which we cut carbon pollution, and China has committed, for the first time, to limiting their emissions. And because the world's two largest economies came together, there's new hope that, with American leadership, this year, the world will finally reach an agreement to prevent the worst impacts of climate change before it's too late. <p>This is an issue that's bigger and longer lasting than my Presidency. It's about protecting our God-given natural wonders and the good jobs that rely on them. It's about shielding our cities and our families from disaster and harm. It's about keeping our kids healthy and safe. This is the only planet we've got. And years from now, I want to be able to look our children and grandchildren in the eye and tell them that we did everything we could to protect it. <p>Thanks, everybody, and have a great weekend.\" "

[<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> That last one was a little weak there. The&mdash;everybody, please have a seat. Welcome to the White House. And give it up for the 2014 college football National Champions, the Ohio State Buckeyes! <p>You may have noticed, we have a lot of Buckeye fans here today, including some Members of Congress. Representative Joyce Beatty was once a leader in the OSU community, and now she represents the OSU community here in Congress. <p>I want to thank the Ohio State University president, Michael Drake, who is here; Athletic Director Gene Smith; and of course, Coach Urban Meyer. So this is Ohio State Football's eighth National Championship. It's Coach Meyer's third time winning it, with his second team, which is pretty impressive. I've only done it twice. [<i>Laughter</i>] And for the same team both times. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>This was an historic year in college football. The country got to enjoy its first-ever college football playoffs. And I will say it: It was about time. I cannot claim full credit&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I will point out that I pushed for a playoff system in 2008. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'd say I threw my weight around. Political&mdash;PolitiFact, which keeps track of whether politicians keep their promises, this is a promise kept by me. [<i>Laughter</i>] So you're welcome, America. It was a great playoffs. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>It was an exciting season from start to finish. And to say that Ohio State's path to the title felt improbable at times would be an understatement. At one point last year, the Buckeyes were ranked as low as 23d in the Nation. But they kept on battling back, with the help of not one, not two, but three quarterbacks. First, they lost Braxton Miller, a Heisman contender, before the season even started. Then, J.T. Barrett, Big Ten Quarterback of the Year, steps in, has an extraordinary run, but then breaks his ankle against a certain team up north&mdash;I guess I'm not allowed to&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. I'm not allowed to&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. And then, we learned that Cardale Jones is not your average third-string quarterback. [<i>Laughter</i>] Anybody with a nickname like Twelve Gauge has to be taken seriously. [<i>Laughter</i>] I told him that I could throw a football 75 yards also, but he didn't believe me. [<i>Laughter</i>] So he's&mdash;he clearly is a smart kid. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But the Buckeyes hit their stride when it mattered most, pitched a 59-0 shutout in the Big Ten Championship, earning their way into the playoff spot, beat top-ranked Alabama in the first round, then rolled up a decisive win against the Oregon Ducks for the eighth National Championship. <p>At critical moments throughout the season, we learned about the character of this football team. And we met the characters who made up the football team along the way. Like Joey Bosa, Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year. Joey&mdash;where's Joey? Right there. A consensus All-American, led the conference in sacks in 2014, including the one that ended the double-overtime game against Penn State. Followed each one with his signature celebration: a shrug. [<i>Laughter</i>] Just saying. I use that move sometimes. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, Joey's hair may be short now&mdash;and he looks good. I actually like it shorter. <p><i>Defensive lineman Joey Bosa.</i> I look good for you. <p><i>The President.</i> See, I appreciate that. [<i>Laughter</i>] But he assures us that the shrug would be back next year. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Wide receiver Evan Spencer was named team MVP in 2014 for his selfless play, great blocking and even a perfectly thrown touchdown pass to Michael Thomas in the Sugar Bowl. Evan, go ahead and wave. And in addition to rushing for over 1,800 yards behind an extraordinary offensive line&mdash;as good as we've seen in a very long time&mdash;and earning the championship game MVP, Ezekiel Elliott made the NCAA fashion police take a close look at their midriff policies. [<i>Laughter</i>] Where's Zeke? Thanks for tucking in your shirt today. We appreciate that. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Running back Ezekiel Elliott</i>. You need to get that rule changed. <p>He said I needed to get the rule changed. Did you see that? [<i>Laughter</i>] Look, I already got the playoff, all right? [<i>Laughter</i>] I've got other stuff to do now. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But in all seriousness, this was a team of true character, of true resilience. As I said to them when I had a chance to shake the hands of all the players, everybody is going to go through ups and downs in life, and how folks handle it, how the quarterbacks on this team supported each other, that's what every organization wants to see&mdash;is people stepping up for each other. And not only did they do it on the field; they made Ohio proud off the field. Each year, the Buckeyes pay forward their good fortune with more than a thousand hours of community service and charitable efforts in Central Ohio: visiting young patients in hospitals, helping second graders improve their reading, building playgrounds, supporting the Special Olympics, stocking shelves for the Mid-Ohio Foodbank. <p>So the love between this team and their community is mutual. I will say when you get a hundred thousand fans to show up to a practice&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I think it's fair to say that your fans are a little crazy. [<i>Laughter</i>] But obviously it's working for them and it's working for this extraordinary team. <p>So, Coach Meyer, congratulations to you and the Ohio State University for your National Championship. Good luck this season coming up.\" "
"93" "\"Hello, everybody! Please have a seat. Welcome to the White House on this beautiful day. And congratulations to Kevin Harvick, the 2014 NASCAR Sprint Cup Champion. Hey! It is always wonderful to have the NASCAR family here. We've got huge fans in the White House, and we've got some big fans, including some Members of Congress who are here. <p>It's great to have Kevin's crew chief, Rodney Childers, who is here. We've also got Greg Zipadelli&mdash;almost messed it up there; it's like Obama, too many vowels&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and the team from Stewart-Haas Racing. NASCAR's leadership is here as well. Brian France is here, and Mike Helton. Welcome back. <p>And even though the Budweiser Chevy got the White House parking pass this year, I am sure Tony Stewart doesn't mind adding another Owner's Championship to his collection. So congratulations to Tony. <p>I also want to offer my condolences to everybody in the NASCAR community on the passing of a legendary reporter and broadcaster, Steve Byrnes. And I know a lot of fans' thoughts and prayers today are with his wife Karen and his son Bryson. <p>We are here to celebrate, though, Kevin Harvick. This was an exciting year for the \\"Four Car.\\" As the season started, Kevin had a new team, a new crew chief to adjust to. It usually takes a little time for a driver and a crew chief to find their groove, but Kevin and Rodney seemed to figure out each other in a hurry, sort of like when Joe Biden joined my team. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So they had an instant chemistry. And as Kevin can tell you, when you have a trusted partner shouting world-class advice into your ear at every turn, you can't lose. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>It wasn't long before Kevin and Rodney and the team behind Budweiser Chevy were firing on all cylinders. But the season was not without its ups and downs. By the second race in the season, Kevin had picked up his first checkered flag with Stewart-Haas. And then, came a tough stretch, the kind where most champion seasons are forged. There were blown tires, engine failures, cut oil lines, a slew of obstacles that held the \\"Four Car\\" from finishing any higher than 36th out of&mdash;in three out of four straight races. <p>But Kevin and Rodney stuck with it, and by the time the Chase rolled around, this team was ready. A win at Homestead capped a season where Kevin picked up five wins, led more laps than anybody on the grid, picking up his first Sprint Cup champion&mdash;Championship. And by the looks of it, with two quick wins and the points lead already in place, 2015 isn't shaping up to be too much different. <p>Kevin has also found the time to match his contributions on the track with his commitment to family and community away from racing. His wife DeLana and his son Keelan are constant presences on the track. And I know at one point, DeLana even had her own fire suit. I'm sure it looked better than it did on Kevin. And I'm sure that if Michelle decided we were going to start wearing matching outfits, it would be me who adapted to her style. [<i>Laughter</i>] Together, Kevin and DeLana run the Kevin Harvick Foundation, which aims to help underprivileged youth to excel both as students and as athletes. From helping his hometown Boys and Girls Club in Bakersfield, California, renovate a gym and a playground to supporting programming which prevents bullying and violence in his former high school, Kevin&mdash;like so many others across NASCAR&mdash;is working to make a difference. <p>So, Kevin, congratulations to you again for an outstanding season. The whole team at Stewart-Haas Racing, keep up the great work. NASCAR, looking forward to seeing more excitement on the track. <p>Thank you so much.\" "
"94" "\"Hello, everybody. What a spectacular day! The Rose Garden is especially beautiful this time of year, and I thought what better place to have Members of Congress and members of the Cabinet and some outstanding advocacy groups come to celebrate something else that is gorgeous, and that is a bipartisan piece of legislation. <p>The main reason I'm here is to say thank you. I want to thank everybody who's here who helped to pass the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act, otherwise known as the permanent doc fix. [<i>Laughter</i>] This law finally solves a serious problem. As all of you know, almost every year for the past 13 years, doctors who care for Medicare patients faced the possibility of an arbitrary cut in their pay. In 2010 alone, it happened five times, and Congress repeatedly scrambled to stop it from happening and patch it over. I remember being involved in a few of those patches myself. All of us said again and again, let's just try to fix this once and for all. <p>And this time, we finally did. No more temporary patches. I am really excited about it. I actually signed the bill into law last week just to make sure that America's doctors didn't get hit by any deep cuts, even if it was just for a day. And so I wanted to make sure we signed it, without the fanfare. But I figured we could all still enjoy each other's company, because we did not just settle for fixing an old formula, we replaced it with a better one. <p>We're moving away from the old model, which incentivized more treatment over better treatment, something that costs a lot more money. From now on, we're going to compensate doctors based more on how well they help their patients get healthy and stay healthy. And that's a smarter approach, and it's going to get better results for patients. And I'm confident it's also going to be more cost effective. <p>I shouldn't say this with John Boehner here&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but that's one way that this legislation builds on the Affordable Care Act. [<i>Laughter</i>] But let's put that aside for a second. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>This legislation also extends funding for the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Programs, which&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. Yay! Which helps connect tens of thousands of new moms to nurses and social workers and critical support that they need for the first months after a child's birth. That means it's a big victory for working families and a big victory for our children. <p>It extends funding for community health centers, which is a vital resource for families and communities nationwide. And finally, it funds the Children's Health Insurance Program, which ensures millions of kids get the care that they need to grow up healthy and strong. And there's nothing more important than that. <p>So obviously, a lot of people were involved in this process, but a couple of special thank yous. First of all, this would not have happened without the Speaker of the House, John Boehner, and we very much appreciate his leadership on this. It would not have happened without the Democratic Leader, Nancy Pelosi. It wouldn't have happened without Senators Orrin Hatch and Ron Wyden and Representatives Fred Upton, Frank Pallone, Paul Ryan, Sandy Levin. I see McCarthy there. He counted votes. [<i>Laughter</i>] We're grateful for that, as well. <p>But most importantly, I just want to thank everybody for showing that Republicans and Democrats can come together and put aside partisanship for something important, not just on small things, not just on the must-dos, but on things that actually make the country work better. We did not, in this case, simply kick the can down the road; we solved a problem, and we made life better for a lot of people. And we crossed one of Washington's perennial cliffs off the list for good. And we proved that's possible. And my hope is, is that that helps build a little more momentum to get some other good stuff done. <p>We're&mdash;I've said this before: We're not going to agree on everything. I mean, there are some areas where&mdash;that's why we have a party system&mdash;there are strong disagreements. But where we can find areas of agreement, where we can focus on common sense and focus on the people who sent us here, I think there's nothing the American people would rather see than us be able to make this town work. And this was a great start and a great example. <p>So I want to thank everybody. Appreciate it. Enjoy this beautiful day. Thank you, everybody.\" "
"95" "\"Hello, everybody! Please have a seat. It's good to be back in Florida. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I can't think of a better way to spend Earth Day than in one of our Nation's greatest natural treasures, the Everglades. And anybody who comes here to visit&mdash;and I advise everybody who's watching who hasn't been down here to come on down&mdash;you can see what makes this unique landscape so magical, what the poet Emma Lazarus called \\"the savage splendor of the swamp.\\" Although, I was informed, it's not technically a swamp. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to thank our outstanding Secretary of the Interior, Sally Jewell, who's here. Her entire team at the Interior Department and the National Park Service Director Jonathan Jarvis for helping to protect places like this. The Everglades National Park Superintendent Pedro Ramos is doing outstanding work. I want to thank Congressmens Murphy and Carvalho who are here doing outstanding work, as well as Debbie Wasserman Schultz. You'll be pleased to know that they are all in when it comes to protecting the Everglades, and we're very proud of the good work that they're going. We even have the Science Guy, Bill Nye, here. There's Bill. <p>Now, they're all here&mdash;we're all here&mdash;because this 1.5 million acres is unlike any place on Earth. It's no wonder that over a million people visited last year alone. The sawgrass prairies and mangrove forests are home to an incredible diversity of wildlife: bald eagles, herons, hundreds of plant species, from pine trees to wild orchids. Believe it or not, South Florida is the only place in the world where you can find both alligators and crocodiles in the same habitat. I'm told this is a good thing. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>In the words of Marjory Stoneman Douglas, who helped preserve this land, \\"There are no other Everglades in the world.\\" But part of the reason we're here is because climate change is threatening this treasure and the communities that depend on it, which includes almost all of South Florida. And if we don't act, there may not be an Everglades as we know it. <p>Two thousand fourteen was the planet's warmest year on record. Fourteen of the 15 hottest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century. Yes, this winter was cold in parts of our country, including Washington. Some people in Washington&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;helpfully used a snowball to illustrate that fact. But around the world, in the aggregate, it was the warmest winter ever recorded. <p>This is not a problem for another generation. Not anymore. This is a problem now. It has serious implications for the way we live right now: stronger storms, deeper droughts, longer wildfire seasons. The world's top climate scientists are warning that a changing climate already affects the air that our children are breathing. The Surgeon General and I recently met with doctors and nurses and parents who see patients and kids grappling with the health impacts. The Pentagon says that climate change poses an increasing set of risks to our national security. <p>And here in the Everglades, you can see the effect of a changing climate. As sea levels rise, salty water from ocean flows inward. And this harms freshwater wildlife, which endangers a fragile ecosystem. The saltwater flows into aquifers, which threatens the drinking water of more than 7 million Floridians. South Florida, you're getting your drinking water from this area, and it depends on this. And in terms of economic impact, all of this poses risks to Florida's $82 billion tourism industry on which so many good jobs and livelihoods depend. So climate change can no longer be denied. It can't be edited out. It can't be omitted&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;from the conversation. And action can no longer be delayed. And that's why I've committed the United States to lead the world in combating this threat. <p>The steps that we've taken over the last several years are already making a difference. We're using more clean energy than ever before. America is number one in wind power, and last year, we generated 20 times more electricity from sunlight than we did in all of 2008&mdash;20 times. <p>We've committed to doubling the pace at which we cut carbon pollution. China, in part because of our actions, has now committed for the first time to limit their emissions. And this means that there's new hope that this year, the world will finally reach an agreement to prevent the worst impacts of climate change before it's too late. We're wasting less energy, with more fuel-efficient cars that save people money at the pump and more energy-efficient buildings that save us money on our electricity bills. <p>So more clean energy, improved energy efficiency&mdash;these steps can help us avoid some of the worst effects of climate change down the road. But we also have to prepare for the effects of climate change that we're already too late to avoid. If you think about it, this is like we're hitting the brakes on a car, but the car is not going to come to a complete halt right away. So some of these changes are already happening, and even if we take the right steps, we're going to have to make some adaptations. <p>And that's why we've been working with cities and States to build more resilient infrastructure and restore natural defenses like wetlands. And today I want to announce new actions to protect our national parks and our public lands and the communities that rely on them. <p>First, we're releasing a report showing that every dollar invested in the National Park Service generates $10 for the economy. That's a good investment. I don't run a private equity fund, but I know that if you invest a dollar and you get $10 back, that's a good investment. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>In 2014, almost 300 million visitors to our national parks spent almost $16 billion and supported 277,000 jobs. So protecting our parks is a smart thing to do for our economy. That's why I've set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history. <p>Here in the Everglades, we've already invested $2.2 billion in restoration efforts. With the support of some outstanding Members of Congress, I've proposed another $240 million this year. We want to restore the natural water flow of the Everglades, which we know is one of the best defenses against climate change and rising sea levels. And I'm calling on Congress to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which supports this work across the country. <p>I'm also announcing $25 million in public and private money for restoration projects at our national parks. And this is part of our broader effort that we've launched to encourage every American to \\"Find Your Park.\\" Chances are, there's one closer than you think. <p>Just last weekend, Michelle and I took the girls for a hike in a national park just 20 minutes outside of Washington, DC. As we were walking a trail along the Everglades, we saw a group of schoolkids&mdash;couldn't have been more excited about mostly seeing the gators, not seeing me&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but also learning about the science of the planet that they live on. And I want every child to have that opportunity. So starting this fall, we're going to give every fourth grader in America an \\"Every Kid In A Park\\" pass, and that's a pass good for free admission to all our public lands for you, your families for an entire year. Because no matter who you are, no matter where you live, our parks, our monuments, our lands, our waters&mdash;these places are your birthright as Americans. <p>And today I'm designating America's newest national historic landmark, the Marjory Stoneham Douglas House in Miami so that future generations will know how this amazing woman helped conserve the Everglades for all of us. <p>We're also working with farmers and ranchers and forest landowners to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions. I'm going to keep doing everything I can to prepare and protect America from the worst effects of climate change, including fighting for clean air, clean water. Because in places like this, folks don't have time, we don't have time, you do not have time to deny the effects of climate change. Folks are already busy dealing with it. And nowhere is it going to have a bigger impact than here in South Florida. No place else. It has to be paying closer attention to this and acknowledging it and understanding that if we take action now we can do something about it. <p>This is not some impossible problem that we cannot solve. We can solve it if we've got some political will. And we can solve it in a way that creates jobs. We can solve it in a way that doesn't disrupt our economy, but enhances our economy. And it's a bipartisan issue. <p>On the way in, I was talking to some folks about the fact that Teddy Roosevelt&mdash;he's a Republican&mdash;started our National Park System. Richard Nixon started the EPA. George H.W. Bush was the first President, globally, to acknowledge the impacts of climate change and that we needed to do something about it. This is not something that historically should be a partisan issue. <p>Five years ago, local leaders down here, Republicans and Democrats, formed the bipartisan Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact, an agreement to work together to fight climate change. And it's become a model not just for the country, but for the world. <p>It's the type of mission that Americans from all walks of life are taking on, from the CEOs of some of our biggest corporations and utilities to student organizations across the country. Because they know that simply refusing to say the words \\"climate change\\" doesn't mean that climate change isn't happening. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And we know that in our own lives. If you've got a coming storm, you don't stick your head in the sand; you prepare for the storm. You make sure our communities are prepared for climate change. And that's an economic imperative. Protecting the one planet we've got is what we have to do for the next generation. I want Malia and Sasha not only to be able to enjoy this amazing view. I want my grandchildren&mdash;way, way long time from now&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;to enjoy this amazing view. And their children, and their children after that. That's what we do as Americans: take responsibility and leave behind for our children something special. <p>And we are blessed with the most beautiful God-given landscape in the world. It's an incredible bounty that's been given to us. But we've got to be good stewards for it. We have to take care of it. We only get to enjoy things like our amazing national parks because great Americans like Teddy Roosevelt and Marjory Stoneman Douglas and a whole bunch of ordinary folks whose name aren't in the history books, they fought to protect our national inheritance. And now it's our turn to ensure that this remains the birthright of all Americans for generations to come. So many people here are active in your communities, doing what's needed. The young people who are here, the next generation, they're way ahead of us in understanding how important this is. Let's make sure we don't disappoint them. Let's stand up and do what's right before it's too late. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.\" "
"96" "\"This morning I want to express our grief and condolences to the families of two hostages: one American, Dr. Warren Weinstein, and an Italian, Giovanni Lo Porto, who were tragically killed in a U.S. counterterrorism operation. Warren and Giovanni were aid workers in Pakistan devoted to improving the lives of the Pakistani people. After Warren was abducted by Al Qaida in 2011, I directed my national security team to do everything possible to find him and to bring him home safely to his family. And dedicated professionals across our Government worked tirelessly to do so. We also worked closely with our Italian allies on behalf of Giovanni, who was kidnapped in 2012. <p>Since 9/11, our counterterrorism efforts have prevented terrorist attacks and saved innocent lives both here in America and around the world. And that determination to protect innocent life only makes the loss of these two men especially painful for all of us. Based on information and intelligence we have obtained, we believe that a U.S. counterterrorism operation targeting an Al Qaida compound in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region accidently killed Warren and Giovanni this past January. <p>Yesterday I spoke with Warren's wife Elaine and Prime Minister Renzi of Italy. As a husband and as a father, I cannot begin to imagine the anguish that the Weinstein and Lo Porto families are enduring today. I realize that there are no words that can ever equal their loss. I know that there is nothing that I could ever say or do to ease their heartache. And today I simply want to say this: As President and as Commander in Chief, I take full responsibility for all our counterterrorism operations, including the one that inadvertently took the lives of Warren and Giovanni. I profoundly regret what happened. On behalf of the United States Government, I offer our deepest apologies to the families. <p>As soon as we determined the cause of their deaths, I directed that the existence of this operation be declassified and disclosed publicly. I did so because the Weinstein and Lo Porto families deserve to know the truth. And I did so because even as certain aspects of our national security efforts have to remain secret in order to succeed, the United States is a democracy committed to openness in good times and in bad. <p>Our initial assessment indicates that this operation was fully consistent with the guidelines under which we conduct counterterrorism efforts in the region, which has been our focus for years because it is the home of Al Qaida's leadership. And based on the intelligence that we had obtained at the time, including hundreds of hours of surveillance, we believed that this was an Al Qaida compound, that no civilians were present, and that capturing these terrorists was not possible. And we do believe that the operation did take out dangerous members of Al Qaida. What we did not know, tragically, is that Al Qaida was hiding the presence of Warren and Giovanni in this same compound. <p>It is a cruel and bitter truth that in the fog of war generally and our fight against terrorists specifically, mistakes&mdash;sometimes deadly mistakes&mdash;can occur. But one of the things that sets America apart from many other nations, one of the things that makes us exceptional, is our willingness to confront squarely our imperfections and to learn from our mistakes. Already, I have directed a full review of what happened. We will identify the lessons that can be learned from this tragedy and any changes that should be made. We will do our utmost to ensure it is not repeated. And we will continue to do everything we can to prevent the loss of innocent lives&mdash;not just innocent Americans, but all innocent lives&mdash;in our counterterrorism operations. <p>Today we join their families and friends in honoring Warren and Giovanni, two humanitarians who came from different countries, but who were united by a spirit of service. For decades, Warren lived the ideals of our country, serving with the Peace Corps and later with the United States Agency for International Development. He devoted his life to people across Africa and South Asia. He was a loving husband, father, and grandfather who willingly left the comforts of home to help the people of Pakistan. At the time of his abduction, he was a USAID contractor focusing on helping Pakistani families escape poverty and give a better life to their children. <p>Giovanni's humanitarianism also took him around the world to the Central African Republic, to Haiti, and ultimately, Pakistan. Like Warren, he fell in love with Pakistan and its people and believed passionately that he could made a difference in their lives. Giovanni's service reflected the commitment of the Italian people, our great allies and friends, to the security and dignity of people around the world. And today is a reminder of the bonds of friendship between our countries and the shared values that bind Americans and Italians together. <p>There could be no starker contrast between these two selfless men and their Al Qaida captors. Warren's work benefited people across faiths. Meanwhile, Al Qaida boasted to the world that it held Warren, citing his Jewish faith. Al Qaida held both men for years, even as Warren's health deteriorated. They deprived these men of precious, irreplaceable years with family who missed them terribly. <p>Amid grief that is unimaginable, I pray that these two families will find some small measure of solace in knowing that Warren and Giovanni's legacy will endure. Their service will be remembered by the Pakistani men, women, and children whose lives they touched and made better. Their spirit will live on in the love of their families, who are in our thoughts and prayers today, especially Warren's wife Elaine, their daughters Alisa and Jennifer, and their families. <p>And the shining example of these two men will stand as a light to people the world over who see suffering and answer with compassion, who see hatred and offer their love, who see war and work for peace. <p>May God bless these two brave men, and may He watch over and comfort their families for all the years to come.\" "
"97" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody. Welcome to the White House. Please have a seat. And well, maybe before you have a seat, give it up for the Super Bowl Champion New England Patriots! All right, now you can have a seat. <p>A couple of points I'd make at the outset. First of all, it's usually warmer on the South Lawn this time of year, but given the kind of winter that Boston and New England had, I guess this feels pretty balmy to you. [<i>Laughter</i>] Second of all, for some reason that I don't fully understand, there is a disproportionate number of Patriots fans in the White House. [<i>Laughter</i>] I obviously did not screen properly when I was hiring&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but there are a lot of Patriot fans in the White House, and there are also a lot of Patriot fans in Congress. I just also want to point out that, despite the fact that he travels probably more than any human on Earth, somehow, my Secretary of State, John Kerry, found a front row seat to be here today. [<i>Laughter</i>] So give it up for John Kerry. <p>I want to offer my congratulations, first of all, to Patriots owner Robert Kraft, and I also want to acknowledge Coach Bill Belichick. I said to the team, and I think even those of us who have other teams we root for, the Patriots organization is as good as an organization as there has ever been in professional sports. And to be able to maintain that kind of consistent excellence is a rare thing in any field, including on the football field. And that's a testament to outstanding ownership. It's a testament to a Hall of Fame coach. And I'm particularly grateful that Coach decided to dress up today. [<i>Laughter</i>] We had some scissors if he wanted to cut the sleeves off. [<i>Laughter</i>] Formal hoodies are allowed. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I usually tell a bunch of jokes at these events, but with the Patriots in town, I was worried that 11 out of 12 of them would fall flat. [<i>Laughter</i>] All right, all right, all right. That whole story got blown a little out of proportion. [<i>Laughter</i>] All right. Where were we? <p><i>New England Patriots Owner</i> <i>Robert Kraft</i>. The Jets gave it to you. <p><i>The President</i>. Right, right, right. Here's what makes the Patriots the Patriots. Even in the midst of huge distraction during the biggest media circus of the sports year, they stayed focused. As Coach Belichick would say, it was simply \\"on to Seattle.\\" <p>Against the Seahawks, they gave us one of the greatest finishes in Super Bowl history. The Patriots became the first team ever to win the Super Bowl after trailing by 10 points going into the fourth quarter. All game long, you saw what made this team so special. <p>There was, of course, Tom Brady, an alltime great who couldn't be with us here today, but who engineered a pair of surgical fourth-quarter touchdown drives. You had Julian Edelman playing an unbelievable game after an unbelievable playoffs, clawing for extra yards. Darrelle Revis shutting down receivers like nobody else can. Gronkowski, just being Gronkowski. [<i>Laughter</i>] He's not making rabbit ears back there, is he? [<i>Laughter</i>] I told him to keep his shirt on. [<i>Laughter</i>] So he asked me what would happen if he took it off. I said Secret Service probably wouldn't like it. He said, what could they do to me? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But this team came out on top not just because of big stars, but because of guys who aren't necessarily household names. Jamie Collins. Shane Vereen. Rob Ninkovich. And of course, we all became acquainted with a man named Malcolm Butler on the biggest play of the Super Bowl. Where's Malcolm? How are you doing? He's so small you can't even see him. [<i>Laughter</i>] But made an unbelievable play of&mdash;and showed heart and guts on that goal-line slant pass. Of course, as we also know&mdash;and he acknowledged&mdash;he had practiced for it. So you've got a combination of somebody with toughness and heart, and you've got a great coach and a great organization that anticipates. And so I think it's fair to say that Malcolm has earned a lifetime of free drinks in every \\"bah\\" in Boston. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But that's been the story of the Patriots over this past 15 years. There's Belichick and Brady, the most successful player-coach tandem perhaps in NFL history. There's \\"the Patriot Way,\\" a group that values teamwork and hard work above all else, which is why these guys are able to shine even if the spotlight is not on them. And it works. Since 2001 season, they have four championships, more than any other franchise in that span. Six Super Bowl appearances, more than any other franchise. Twelve division titles. You get the picture. In a league that's known for its parity, they have set a standard for excellence that we may not see again for a very long time. <p>And the good news is, they're leading the way off the field as well. During the season, Patriots players spend their Tuesdays volunteering in the community, visiting schools, hospitals, getting kids active through the NFL's Play 60 initiative. Earlier today a group of Pats stopped by Walter Reed to visit with our wounded warriors. And we are very grateful to them for that. In fact, in a conversation, one of the docs on the team here served in the Navy for 20 years, and we were talking about the incredible service that our men and women in uniform are rendering every single day. And I think Coach and Bob both acknowledged that they're the kind of heroes that are at a whole other level. And so for our football teams to be able to acknowledge them&mdash;because they're all big sports fans&mdash;that means a lot. <p>On Monday, the Patriots Marathon Team ran the Boston Marathon and raised over $230,000, helping to show that 2 years after a terrible tragedy, Boston is stronger than ever. <p>So I want to congratulate the Patriots for their leadership on and off the field. I just wish the city of Boston would share some of those titles you keep winning with Chicago. I mean, I'm hoping that I get to see the Bears before I leave here. [<i>Laughter</i>] But in the meantime, I wish the Patriots organization all the best for what is well-deserved success. Congratulations, everybody.\" "
"98" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, hello, hello! Hello, OFA! Thank you. You guys sound fired up. All right, all right, settle down, settle down. [<i>Laughter</i>] Settle down. You guys are&mdash;what did they put in your coffee? [<i>Laughter</i>] That's&mdash;yes, I meant you. Sit down. [<i>Laughter</i>] Sit down, everybody. Golly. See, they're still taking pictures. <p>So first of all, I want to thank Jos&eacute; for the introduction. He is an example of what inspires me every day. You see, you get a chance to meet people all across the country who are just doing extraordinary things. And all of you are in that category. I could not be prouder of each and every one of you and everything that you're doing. You are out there every day, you're talking to your neighbors, you're talking with your coworkers. You're doing the work to change your communities. And that's how a democracy is supposed to work. That's how America is supposed to work. That's how this country has always moved forward. And that's how it's going to keep moving forward. <p><i>Senate Confirmation of Loretta E. Lynch as Attorney General </i><p>Before I start with some other issues, I want to say publicly, for the first time&mdash;I've been looking forward to saying this&mdash;that I am very pleased that Loretta Lynch has now been confirmed as America's next Attorney General. And America will be better off for it. She's spent her life fighting for the fair and equal justice that's the foundation of our democracy. She's going to do a great job helping our communities, keeping them safe, but also making sure our citizens are protected by equal justice under the law. <p>She's got credibility with law enforcement, but she's also got credibility with communities. And she knows that one of the things that I want to work with her on is making sure that all around the country we are rebuilding trust with respect to our police forces and making sure that they and the communities together are working so that everybody feels safe and everybody feels like the law is working on their behalf. And I can't think of a better person to do it. We are very, very proud of her. She's going to do a great job. <p>So I'm proud of all of you, and I hope all of you are proud of what we've done together. You think back to how we started this journey, why we started this journey in the first place. We'd gone through years in which too many Americans weren't seeing their hard work rewarded. Wages weren't rising; incomes weren't rising. Schools weren't preparing enough of our kids to get the jobs and careers in this new century. Our health care system was burdened&mdash;burdening too many families, too many businesses: too expensive, too inefficient. Other nations were racing ahead of us on clean energy. We were addicted to foreign oil. Just 2 weeks before the 2008 election, we had the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Ordinary folks got hit like never before. <p>But in the face of all that, we believed in something that was more powerful. We believed that America could change. And that's why so many people joined a grassroots campaign&mdash;Democrats, but also some Republicans and Independents&mdash;active citizens who wanted to do their part to change this country for the better. <p>We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing, we could draw new jobs to America. And over the last 5 years, our businesses have created more than 12 million new jobs. We believed that we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world. Today, our high school graduation rate is at an alltime high; more young people are finishing college than ever before. <p>We said we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet, do something about climate change. And today, America is not just number one in oil and gas, we are also number one in wind. We're also generating 20 times more electricity from the sun than&mdash;last year than we did the year I took office. We're doubling the pace at which we cut our carbon pollution, a commitment that I've made and we're going to be working with other countries to meet. That's all because of you. <p>We believed we could fix a broken health care system. Today, more than 16 million Americans have gained the security of health insurance. <p>That's change. That's what you made possible. But here's something I want you to understand: We did not take on these fights just because they were progressive priorities. We took them on because they were economic priorities for this Nation and for every family out there. The priorities we've taken on are critical to restoring the security and opportunity for working families in the 21st century, in this new global economy. <p>We live in a time when our success depends on our skills, our knowledge. That's why we've pushed for higher standards and faster Internet in our schools. That's why we reformed our student loan program and increased grants and tax credits so more people could afford to go to college. <p>We live in a time when our young people will be trying lots of jobs, different careers. And that's why we made health care more accessible and more affordable and more portable: to give them the freedom to change jobs or launch their own business and not have to worry that they were going to be losing their insurance. <p>We live in a time when more and more households have both parents in the workforce. That's why we're fighting for things like childcare and paid sick leave and paid family leave. Because hard-working families who are doing the right thing need a little bit of help on those things in order to be successful, in order to be stable. <p>So the point is, the economy has changed. And we're finally getting to the business of updating our policies to change along with it. We're looking forward; we're not looking backwards. [<i>Applause</i>] We're looking forward. <p>We've got to recognize the realities of the new economy. And we've got to fight to make sure that in America, hard work is still rewarded with the chance to take care of your family, and pass on a sense of optimism and hope in better days for our kids. That was always the vision behind my campaign. That's the vision that we have shared ever since I took office. Those are the values that inform my economic policies. <p>And so one of the things I want to talk about today&mdash;because I don't want to talk about the stuff we all agree on or we've already done. [<i>Laughter</i>] I want to talk about some stuff that creates some controversy, because it's important. And one of those policies right now that I'm focused on is new trade agreements with other countries. <p>And if you were watching MSNBC and all this stuff, and you're thinking, oh, man, well, I love Obama, but what's going on here? [<i>Laughter</i>] So I want to set the record straight here. I want everybody to be clear about what we're doing, because I believe in what I'm doing here. The&mdash;I want to talk about this because&mdash;in part because it's complicated, and also it's full of misinformation. But it's really, really important. <p>This set of trade agreements that we're looking at, it's&mdash;are vital to middle class economics: the idea that this country does best when everybody gets their fair shot, everybody does their fair share, everybody plays by the same set of rules. Simple values. American values. We want to make sure that our own economy lives up to it. <p>But we've also got to make sure that the rest of the world is a place where we can compete on a global scale. We want to make sure we're on an even playing field, not an uneven playing field. We've got to deal with a place where the rules are different in other countries, and we've got to make sure that those rules work for us. That's why I believe America needs to write the rules of the global economy. We can't leave it to somebody else. <p>We've got to do whatever we can to help our workers compete. And that's not a left or right issue. It's not a business or labor issue. It's an issue like the others that we've waged slowly, steadily. It's a question of the past and the future. <p>Now, I've talked a lot recently about why new trade agreements are important to our economy. But I want everybody to understand so when you go back to your communities and you're talking to people, you are clear about why this is important. Ninety-five percent of the world's customers are outside of the United States, they're outside our borders&mdash;95 percent. The fastest growing markets in the world are in Asia. Jobs at businesses that export are good, middle class jobs. On average they pay more than other jobs. If you work for a company that exports, they're paying you probably better on average. <p>Those are facts. So it's important to our economy, but it's also important to our values. Our values have to reflect&mdash;be reflected in these new trade agreements in the way that they haven't always been in past trade agreements. <p>The&mdash;trade has always been tough, and it's always been tough especially in the Democratic Party. A lot of people are skeptical of trade deals, and a lot of times, it's for good reason. Because for decades now, technology made good jobs obsolete, global competition meant jobs were being shipped overseas, past trade deals didn't always live up to the hype. A lot of trade deals didn't include the kinds of protections that we're fighting for today. And I saw it in Chicago and in towns across Illinois where manufacturing collapsed, plants closed down, jobs dried up. When I ran for office, I'd talk about a man I met who had to pack up his own plant before he was laid off. And that made a mockery of the value of community and the dignity of work. <p>So for a lot of Americans, they attribute those changes to what happened in the aftermath of trade agreements. And I understand that. But what&mdash;we've got to make sure we learn the right lessons from that. We can't learn the lesson that somehow the global economy is going to stop and we're going to be able to put a bunch of barriers in front of it. <p>Because change is happening. You go into any store right now, you go to any company right now, and it's global. So we've got to be able to compete. We're not going to stop a global economy at our shores. That's the wrong lesson to draw. We can't go back to the past. We shouldn't want to. We want to make sure we win the future. That's what America is about: winning the future. <p>So if America does not write rules for trade that are good for us, if we're not writing the rules of trade for the global economy while our economy is still in a position of global strength&mdash;because we're right now the fastest&mdash;we're the strongest economy compared to a lot of our competitors&mdash;now is the time for us to write rules that make sure that we aren't locked out of markets, that we're able to sell our goods in places like Asia. <p>We've got to make sure that we write rules so that our workers and our businesses can compete fairly. If we don't, then somebody else is going to write the rules. China is going to write the rules. And when they do it, they'll do it in a way that gives Chinese workers advantages and Chinese businesses the upper hand and locks American goods out. And I refuse to accept that for this country. We've the best workers in the world. We have the best businesses in the world. When the playing field is level, nobody beats the United States of America, products and services coming out of the United States of America. So we can't be afraid to compete. <p>So when I took office, while we were doing all this other stuff&mdash;while we were getting health care passed, and we were trying to raise the minimum wage, and we were changing student loans&mdash;I also started thinking about how do we revamp trade in a way that works for working families, working Americans. And that's what we've done negotiating a new trade partnership in the Asia-Pacific region. <p>It's the highest-standard trade agreement in our history. It is the most progressive trade agreement in our history. It's got strong provisions for workers, strong provisions for the environment. And unlike some past trade agreements, all these provisions are actually enforceable. If you're a country that wants to be in this agreement, you've got to meet these high standards. Once you're a part of this partnership, if you violate your responsibilities, there are consequences. There are penalties. <p>So if we have this trade agreement in place, it means that other countries, they've got to treat their workers better. They've got to treat the environment better. They've got to think about logging and fishing and whether that's destroying the planet. They've got to make sure that they've got laws against child labor. <p>And so it would strengthen our hand overseas, and it gives us the tools to open up other markets to our goods and services to make sure they're playing by the same rules we are. And because this partnership includes Mexico and Canada, it fixes a lot that was wrong with NAFTA when it was passed back in the nineties. <p>So instead of having a race to the bottom, for lower wages and worse working conditions and more abuse of our natural resources, this is a race to the top. It's not just good for our businesses, it's good for our workers. And along with it, we're making sure that American workers can retool through training programs and community colleges, use new skills to transition to new jobs. <p>So the bottom line is this: These new trade partnerships would level the playing field. And when the playing field is level, American workers always win. <p>And I just have to say, as I've been listening to some of this debate, I've got some good friends who are opposed to this trade agreement, but when I ask them specifically what is it that you oppose, they start talking about NAFTA. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I'm thinking, well, I had just come out of law school when NAFTA was passed. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's not the trade agreement I'm passing. [<i>Laughter</i>] So you need to tell me what's wrong with this trade agreement, not one that was passed 25 years ago. And the fact is, is that if you end up just being opposed to this trade deal, then that means you're satisfied with the status quo. But that doesn't make any sense, because the status quo isn't working for our workers. You go out on the street right now and you look at all the cars that are passing by, you'll see Hondas. You'll see Toyotas. You'll see Nissans. Those are all fine cars; nothing wrong with that. But when you travel to Tokyo, you don't see Fords. [<i>Laughter</i>] You don't see Chevys. You don't see Chryslers. <p>So why would we want to maintain the current status quo, where people are selling a bunch of stuff here and we can't sell there? Why wouldn't we want to rewrite those rules so there is some reciprocity and we can start opening up the Japanese market? That would be good for American workers. Same goes for the other 10 countries in the agreement. <p>Look, I remember where the auto industry was at when I came into office. I've been to auto plants all across the country that would have closed if American workers hadn't rebuilt and retooled, come back and silenced all the naysayers and proven that America can build some of the best new cars in the world. And they shouldn't be competing with one tied behind their&mdash;one hand tied behind their back. They should be able to sell cars everywhere in the world. <p>But when I hear folks saying, \\"Oh, this trade deal would destroy the auto industry\\"&mdash;listen, I spent a lot of time and a lot of political capital to save the auto industry. Why would I pass a trade deal that was bad for U.S. autoworkers? That doesn't make any sense. <p>Under my watch, under my policies, American manufacturing is creating new jobs for the first time since the 1990s. We're opening up new plants at the fastest pace in nearly 20 years. And we&mdash;so we shouldn't have all that good work just restricted to selling in the United States. We shouldn't have \\"Made in the U.S.A.\\" just apply to U.S. customers. We want \\"Made in the U.S.A.\\" sold everywhere, all around the world. That's good for American businesses and American workers. <p>So when people say that this trade deal is bad for working families, they don't know what they're talking about. I take that personally. My entire Presidency has been about helping working families. I've been working too hard at this. And I've got some of those folks who are saying this stuff after all I've done to help lift their industries up. <p>I've spent 6&frac12; years trying to wrestle this economy out of the worst recession since the Great Depression and rebuild it so that it benefits working Americans. I've had to do it against relentless opposition. But every single thing we've done&mdash;from Obamacare to Wall Street reform, to student loan reform, to credit card reform, to fighting for a fairer Tax Code, to higher minimum wages, to a smarter workplace&mdash;all of it's focused on making sure it's a good deal for middle class families and folks who are working hard to get into the middle class. <p>I've been talking about things like reversing rising inequality and strengthening social mobility since before it was cool. [<i>Laughter</i>] Go back to my first campaign for the United States Senate. I've got a bunch of people now talking about inequality, but back then, they sure weren't. Go back and look at the speech I gave in Kansas 4 years ago on economic fairness. Go back and look at the speech I gave in Southeast DC 2 years ago on income inequality. Back then, folks were saying I was preaching class warfare. Now, suddenly, it's their campaign platforms. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Some of these folks are friends of mine. I love them to death. [<i>Laughter</i>] But in the same way that when I was arguing for health care reform I asked people to look at the facts&mdash;just because somebody comes up with a slogan like \\"Death Panel,\\" doesn't mean it's true. Look at the facts. Well, the same thing is true on this. Look at the facts. Don't just throw a bunch of stuff out there and see if it sticks. And we should be mindful of the past. We can't ignore what's happened and why people have felt sometimes that trade agreements weren't working for them, that corporations were shipping out jobs. All those things happened. But we can't ignore the realities of the new economy. And we can't just oppose trade on reflex alone. You've got to fight for trade that benefits our workers on our terms. We've got to give every single American who wakes up, sends their kids to school, rolls up their sleeves, punches in each day the chance to do what we do best: innovate and build and sell the best products and ideas in the world to every corner of the world. <p>That's what I believe in. Smart, new, 21st-century trade agreements are as important to helping the middle class get ahead in this new economy as things like job training and higher education and affordable health care. They're all part of a package. <p><i>Audience member.</i> And decrease the deficit. <p><i>The President.</i> Well, I did that too. [<i>Laughter</i>] And if I didn't think this was the right thing to do for working families, I would not be doing it. <p>I mean, think about it. I've got some of these folks who are friends of mine, allies of mine saying this trade deal would destroy the American working families, despite the fact that I've done everything in my power to make sure that working families are empowered. And by the way, they've been with me on everything. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So by this logic, I would have had to do all this stuff for the last 6&frac12; years and then, suddenly, just say, well, I want to just destroy all of that. [<i>Laughter</i>] Does that make sense? <p><i>Audience members.</i> No. <p><i>The President.</i> No, it&mdash;right answer&mdash;it does not. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>If there was a trade agreement that undercut working families, I wouldn't sign it. The Chamber of Commerce didn't elect me twice; working folks did. I ran for office in the first place to expand the all-American idea of opportunity: No matter where you come from, what you look like, how you started out, who you love, you can make it if you try here in America. <p>I don't forget where I came from. I don't forget how I started. I moved to Chicago in my early twenties with barely anything except a desire to make a difference. I wanted to make sure my life attached itself to giving people a chance at opportunity: helping kids get a great education, helping parents who live in poverty get decent jobs that let them raise a family, help folks who work hard all day get health insurance so they don't have to go to the emergency room when they get sick. <p>So I became an organizer, like all of you. And I learned that change comes slow sometimes, and sometimes, there are disappointments. But I also learned the sense of purpose that comes by working together. I learned that underneath our differences, there are hopes and aspirations and grit and resilience that binds us together. That's why I do this. <p>But what I also learned was that you don't make change through slogans. You don't make change through ignoring realities. Sometimes, you do things that are tough, but the right thing to do to prepare us for the future. <p>If I was just looking at the polling, I wouldn't have done health care. But it was the right thing to do. If I&mdash;it would be a lot easier for me politically not to do this Iran deal. But it's the right thing to do. <i>Audience members.</i> Yeah! <p>Now, those things are popular with Democrats. Every once in a while, there are some things that aren't as popular with Democrats, but they still need to be done because they're the right thing to do. These trade agreements are the right thing to do. And if somebody doesn't agree with that, show me specifically what it is that you're concerned about. I'm happy to have a discussion about it. But don't just throw out a bunch of stuff, making accusations about it. <p>I'm proud of all of you. And I'm a little envious that a lot of you seem to be better at organizing than I was. [<i>Laughter</i>] You're smarter. You're more effective. You've got better tools, like Connect. <p>So I'm still asking for your help. Keep talking to your friends. Talk to your neighbors. Talk about why this fight matters. Talk about why all the things we're doing we're just continuing to push on. I want you to share OFA content: forward these emails, and retweet these tweets. Join the Economic Opportunity group on Connect to engage and get involved with people all across the country who share your hopes and dreams. That's how change starts: each one of you reaching out to somebody else. <p>You give me hope. You guys are doing extraordinary things. You've done extraordinary things these past 8 years. That's just a preview of what you're going to accomplish in the years ahead. <p>Thank you, OFA. Love you. All right. Thank you.\" "
"99" "\"Thank you, Jennifer! Well, I've got nothing to add to that. [<i>Laughter</i>] Except just to say thank you. <p>I got a chance to see all of you backstage and take pictures with you, and some of you have been able basically to record my progressive graying. [<i>Laughter</i>] You've got, like, a picture from each year showing how I get older, and Michelle, like Dorian Gray, continues to just stay exactly the same. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's a little spooky. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But I'm going to be very brief on the front end so that I can just spend some time talking with all of you. Obviously, we've had a very consequential stretch since I last saw all of you. We have had some tough stuff, like losing in the midterm, but we've had some really significant accomplishments, from a climate deal that promises to lead the world globally in making sure that this planet is working for future generations to an initiative on comprehensive immigration reform that says we want Congress to work with us, but we can't wait when we've got so many families out there who are prepared to come out of the shadows and earn a legal path so that they can do right by this country; to making sure that Iran doesn't get a nuclear weapon without having to resort to war; to the work we've done to extend the Children's Health Insurance Program and start making Medicare more efficient, something we actually got done with Congress, which was a big achievement; to just getting confirmed somebody who is going to be the outstanding next Attorney General of the United States of America. <p>So we've been busy. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I just have to tell all of you that the reason I am so energized and excited and wake up every morning ready to tackle all the problems that are in my inbox is because I know all across the country there are folks like Jennifer, who don't get a big spotlight, who aren't in the newspapers, but because of their story, because of their values, because of their love for a dad and seeing him tear up because he was able to accomplish something he didn't think was possible, because there are tons of folks like that all across the country, I always feel confident about what this country can accomplish. I feel confident there is not a problem out there we can't solve. <p>And I've now been at this long enough to know that you're going to have some ups and you're going to have some downs. And there are going to be times when the pundits have written you off. But if you remain true to that north star, which was the basis of OFA and the basis for my campaigns&mdash;that confidence that when ordinary people come together, they can change this country for the better&mdash;when we're true to that, I don't worry about the future. I feel confident about it. <p>And the reason I've been able to do it is because I've had some folks in this room who have shared those values, through thick and through thin, from the start. And some of you come from places where it's really easy to be an Obama supporter, and some of you come from places that it's really hard to be an Obama supporter. [<i>Laughter</i>] But all of you share with me a belief in people like Jennifer. <p>And what OFA has been able to accomplish so that now it's no longer about reelecting me&mdash;it never technically was, but&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;or moving our agenda forward&mdash;but I just wanted to make that point. [<i>Laughter</i>] But the degree to which now you've got chapters all across the country that are working on local issues&mdash;we can't get minimum wage moved through Congress? Let's make sure that a city council passes a minimum wage law. Congress isn't prepared to do a comprehensive childcare, early childhood education bill? Let's find a Governor who wants to do it; we'll work with him. That kind of grassroots, local, boots-on-the-ground, focused, relentless energy&mdash;that's changing this country just as much as anything we do here in Washington. <p>And probably the most important thing that we're doing is, we are seeing&mdash;and I see it every day&mdash;just this successive wave of young leadership that just keeps on coming up. And it's a little scary now that&mdash;I mean, it's bad enough that Malia is going to be going to college next fall, but now I've got all these folks who are running through this process, and now, suddenly, they're just doing incredible things. So there are concrete things we've accomplished. There are people who have health care who wouldn't have it if we hadn't done what we're doing here. There are people who are going to college who wouldn't have been going to college if we hadn't done what we did here. There are young people who would still be living in the shadows, but who are now going to school or in our military and serving this country. If it wasn't for what we had done here, they wouldn't have had those opportunities. <p>But we've got more work to do. And I just hope you guys feel as inspired as I do about that work, because despite the gray hair, I've got a lot more energy&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and a lot more work that needs to be done. And I can only do it with you. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"100" "\"Thank you so much. Please, please, have a seat. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Please. Well, thank you, Jim, for that introduction.

I'm not going to give a long speech, but I do have three basic messages that I wanted to convey. <p>The first is that I don't know how astute a consumer of information I am, but I can tell you I sure do rely on it. And those who come and brief me every single morning do an extraordinary job. I will say that the only flaw, generally, in what's called the PDB that I receive is that when Jim provides it, some of you may have heard, he leaves paperclips all over my office. [<i>Laughter</i>] They're in the couch; they're on the floor. He's shuffling paper. And so because I knew I was coming over here, one of the things I did was return them all. [<i>Laughter</i>] And so this will be available to you. I don'tDNI's budget is always a little tight; we can start recycling these. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's going to be critical. <p>But Jim is often one of the first people that I see in the morning, during the Presidential Daily Brief. Jim always gives it to me straight. He gives me his honest assessment free of politics, free of spin. I trust his integrity. And I can't tell you how invaluable that is in the job that he has. And that culture is one that permeates our IC. It's a culture that reflects the leaders at the top. And nobody, I think, exemplifies that more than Jim Clapper. So I am very grateful for him. <p>Here at ODNI, Jim has also led important reforms, both within the office and across the intelligence community. Today, the community is more collaborative and more integrated than it has ever been in the past. <p>And since no good deed ever goes unpunished, in appreciation of this integrity and outstanding work, I sent Jim to North Korea. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I know he had a wonderful time in Pyongyang. But thanks to the role that Jim played, he returned home with Kenneth Bae and Matthew Miller to be reunited with their families. <p>Today is also special to him because it happens to be his 50th wedding anniversary to his wonderful wife Sue. So we want to congratulate the two of them. And fear not, this is not all he's doing for their 50th wedding anniversary. [<i>Laughter</i>] My understanding is, they're headed off for a well-deserved anniversary vacation this weekend. So I'm going to move this along. [<i>Laughter</i>] The second reason I wanted to be here was to thank all of you at ODNI. I see Jim or Mike Dempsey, or sometimes Stephanie, every morning. And I know that everything they present reflects incredible hard work on the part of hundreds of people&mdash;thousands of people across the various agencies that are represented. And I want you to know that Jim and Mike and Stephanie and all the folks who give me these briefings, they are the first one to acknowledge that they are just the tip of the operation and that they can't do their job if it weren't for the incredible contributions that all of you are making every single day. <p>I know that sometimes it can seem like a one-way street. You push up your reports, but you don't always know how your work is received by your customers, and I guess I'm the number-one customer. You don't always maybe get feedback. So I'm here just to tell you, you do an outstanding job. The work that you provide is vital for me being able to make good decisions. And the fact that the work you prepare is giving it to me straight&mdash;that doesn't look at the world through rose-colored glasses, that doesn't exaggerate threats, but doesn't underplay the significant challenges that we face around the world&mdash;that's vitally important to me and, as a consequence, vitally important to the security of the American people. <p>So Jim knows it; Mike know it. The people who meet with me are always extolling your virtues. But I figured it would be useful for you to hear it from me directly in saying how much we appreciate the incredible hard work and effort that you make every single day. <p>Whether it's the PDB, your daily articles, your expert briefs, NIE's, I could not do my job without your insights and your analysis and your judgment. <p>More broadly, you're dedicated to your founding mission. The 9/11 Commission said we needed to unify our intelligence community. The legislation that created the DNI made you the statutory head of the community overseeing all the agencies. <p>And it's not an easy task bringing together 17 different organizations. They each have unique histories and missions and cultures and tradecraft. Many of you here represent those agencies. And yet you come here together to create a sum that's even greater and stronger than its individual parts. <p>And we see the results. We've got more sharing of intelligence across the community and also beyond it, with our other partners. Federal, State, local, and private sectors are now working together more effectively than they have in the past. New technologies and new satellites are being shared, and working across various platforms means that we're able to do a better job both accumulating information, but also disseminating it. There's more transparency than there's been in the past. There's more innovation than there's been in the past. All that is making a difference each and every day. <p>I know that integrating the efforts and contributions of all 17 organizations, people, expertise, capabilities, is never-ending work. And then, there's the challenge of being as open and transparent as possible, even as we continue to protect intelligence that saves lives. <p>But I want you to remember the United States is the most professional, most capable, most cutting-edge intelligence community in the world. And part of the reason is because all of you here at ODNI bring it together. It makes a difference. <p>Which brings me to my third and final point. A message that I hope you share with the colleagues who are not in this auditorium, I want you to share it with all the home agencies: You can take great pride in your service. Many of you&mdash;those of you with gray beards or goatees, or in Jim's case, just no hair&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;are intelligence veterans with decades of service. Some of you are young, and look even younger, a new post-9/11 generation. And over the years, I know some of you have lost good friends and colleagues: patriots, men and women who gave their lives, like those honored in the stars on the Memorial Wall at Langley. On days like today, we remember them and we honor them as well. <p>These are challenging times. And over the last few years, we've seen unprecedented intelligence disclosures. We've seen wild swings with respect to our budgets because of sequestration and furloughs; increasing demands for intelligence due to everything from Russian aggression in Ukraine to turmoil and ISIL in the Middle East. <p>And today, like all Americans, our thoughts and prayers also continue to be with the families of Dr. Warren Weinstein and Giovanni Lo Porto. I'm not going to repeat everything I said yesterday, but I do want to make one point again. We're going to review what happened. We're going to identify the lessons that can be learned and any improvements and changes that can be made. And I know those of you who are here share our determination to continue doing everything we can to prevent the loss of innocent lives. <p>I was asked by somebody, how do you absorb news like that that we received the other day? And I told the truth: It's hard. But the one thing I wanted everybody to know&mdash;because I know you, because I work with you, because I know the quality of this team&mdash;is that we all bleed when we lose an American life. We all grieve when any innocent life is taken. We don't take this work lightly. And I know that each and every one of you understand the magnitude of what we do and the stakes involved. <p>And these aren't abstractions. And we're not cavalier about what we do, and we understand the solemn responsibilities that are given to us. And our first job is to make sure that we protect the American people. But there's not a person that I talk to that's involved in the intelligence community that doesn't&mdash;that also doesn't understand that we have to do so while upholding our values and our ideals and our laws and our constitutions and our commitment to democracy. <p>And that's part of the reason why I'm so grateful to work with you, because I know you share that commitment, understanding that this is hard stuff. Everybody here is committed to doing it the right way. And for that reason, I'm absolutely committed to making sure that the American people understand all that you put in to make sure that we do it the right way. I'm very grateful for that. <p>This self-reflection, this willingness to examine ourselves, to make corrections, to do better&mdash;that's part of what makes us Americans. It's part of what sets us apart from other nations. It's part of what keeps us not only safe, but also strong and free. <p>And part of what makes our job even more challenging is, is that despite the extraordinary work that's done here and the lives that are saved on an ongoing basis, a lot of our work still requires that we maintain some things as classified. And we can't always talk about all the challenges. And the one thing I know about people in the IC is they don't seek the limelight. That means, sometimes, that the world doesn't always see your successes: the threats that you prevent or the terrorist attacks you thwart or the lives that you save. <p>But I don't want you or folks across the intelligence community to ever forget the difference that you make every day. Because of you, we've had the intelligence to take out Al Qaida leaders, including Usama bin Laden. Because of you, we've had the intelligence, quickly, that showed Syria had used chemical weapons and then had the ability to monitor its removal. Because of you, we had the intelligence, despite Russia's obfuscations, to tell the world the truth about the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine. Because of you, we had the intelligence support that helped enable our recent nuclear framework with Iran. And you're going to be critical to our efforts to forge a comprehensive deal to prevent Iran from ever getting a nuclear weapon. <p>So you help keep us safe, but you also help protect our freedoms by doing it the right way. And the American people and people around the world may never know the full extent of your success. There may be those outside who question or challenge what we do, and we welcome those questions and those challenges because that makes us better. It can be frustrating sometimes, but that's part of the function of our democracy. <p>But I know what you do. We're more secure because of your service. We're more secure because of your patriotism and your professionalism. And I'm grateful for that. And the American people are grateful as well: to you and your families who sacrifice alongside you. <p>So it's been 10 long and challenging years. But when we look back on those 10 years, the American people have been a whole lot safer. And I'm confident that over the next 10 years and 10 years after that, as long as we continue to have outstanding patriots like yourselves, we're going to be okay. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"101" "\"Hi, everybody. I've talked a lot lately about why new trade deals are important to our economy. Today I want to talk about why new trade deals are important to our values. They're vital to middle class economics: the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. <p>These are simple values. They're American values. And we strive to make sure our own economy lives up to them, especially after a financial crisis brought about by recklessness and greed. But we also live in a world where our workers have to compete on a global scale, right now on an uneven playing field, where the rules are different. And that's why America has to write the rules of the global economy: so that our workers can compete on a level playing field. <p>I understand why a lot of people are skeptical of trade deals. Past deals didn't always live up to the hype. They didn't include the kind of protections we're fighting for today. <p>We have lessons to learn from the past, and we have learned them. But trying to stop a global economy at our shores isn't one of those lessons. We can't surrender to the future, because we are meant to win the future. If America doesn't shape the rules of the global economy today, to benefit our workers, while our economy is in a position of new global strength, then China will write those rules. I've seen towns where manufacturing collapsed, plants closed down, and jobs dried up. And I refuse to accept that for our workers. Because I know when the playing field is level, nobody can beat us. <p>That's why, when I took office, we started thinking about how to revamp trade in a way that actually works for American workers. And that's what we've done with a new trade partnership we're negotiating in the Asia-Pacific, home to the world's fastest growing markets. <p>It's the highest-standard trade agreement in history. It's got strong provisions for workers and the environment, provisions that, unlike in past agreements, are actually enforceable. If you want in, you have to meet these standards. If you don't, then you're out. Once you're a part of this partnership, if you violate your responsibilities, there are actual consequences. And because it would include Canada and Mexico, it fixes a lot of what was wrong with NAFTA too. <p>So this isn't a race to the bottom, for lower wages and working conditions. The trade agreements I'm negotiating will drive a race to the top. And we're making sure American workers can retool through training programs and community colleges and use new skills to transition into new jobs. <p>If I didn't think this was the right thing to do for working families, I wouldn't be fighting for it. We've spent the past 6 years trying to rescue the economy, retool the auto industry, and revitalize American manufacturing. And if there were ever an agreement that undercut that progress or hurt those workers, I wouldn't sign it. My entire Presidency is about helping working families recover from recession and rebuild for the future. And as long as I'm President, that's what I'll keep fighting to do. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"102" "\"<i>The President.</i> Good evening, everybody. <p><i>Audience members</i>. Good evening. <p><i>The President</i>. Welcome to the White House Correspondents' Dinner, the night when Washington celebrates itself. [<i>Laughter</i>] Somebody's got to do it. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And welcome to the fourth quarter of my Presidency. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's true, I&mdash;that was Michelle cheering. [<i>Laughter</i>] The fact is, I feel more loose and relaxed than ever. Those Joe Biden shoulder massages, they're like magic. [<i>Laughter</i>] You should try one. Oh, you have. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I am determined to make the most of every moment I have left. Now, after the midterm elections, my advisers asked me, \\"Mr. President, do you have a bucket list?\\" And I said, \\"Well, I have something that rhymes with bucket list.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Take executive action on immigration? Bucket. [<i>Laughter</i>] New climate regulations? Bucket. It's the right thing to do. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And my new attitude is paying off. Look at my Cuba policy. The Castro brothers are here tonight. [<i>Laughter</i>] Welcome to America, amigos! <i>Que pasa?</i> What? It's the Castros from Texas? [<i>Laughter</i>] Oh. Hi, Joaquin. Hi, Juli&aacute;n. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Anyway, being President is never easy. I still have to fix a broken immigration system, issue veto threats, negotiate with Iran, all while finding time to pray five times a day&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;which is strenuous. [<i>Laughter</i>] And it is no wonder that people keep pointing out how the Presidency has aged me. I look so old, John Boehner has already invited Netanyahu to speak at my funeral. [<i>Laughter</i>] Meanwhile, Michelle hasn't aged a day. I ask her what her secret is, she just says, \\"Fresh fruits and vegetables.\\" It's aggravating. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>The fact is, though, at this point, my legacy is finally beginning to take shape. The economy is getting better. Nine in ten Americans now have health coverage. Today, thanks to Obamacare, you no longer have to worry about losing your insurance if you lose your job. You're welcome, Senate Democrats. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, I&mdash;look, it is true, I have not managed to make everybody happy. Six years into my Presidency, some people still say I'm arrogant and aloof, condescending. Some people are so dumb. [<i>Laughter</i>] No wonder I don't meet with them. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And that's not all people say about me. A few weeks ago, Dick Cheney says he thinks I'm the worst President of his lifetime, which is interesting, because I think Dick Cheney is the worst President of my lifetime. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's quite a coincidence. <p>I mean, everybody has got something to say these days. Mike Huckabee recently said people shouldn't join our military until a true conservative is elected President. Think about that. It was so outrageous, 47 Ayatollahs wrote us a letter trying to explain to Huckabee how our system works. [<i>Laughter</i>] It gets worse. Just this week, Michele Bachmann actually&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;predicted that I would bring about the biblical end of days. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, that's a legacy. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's big. I mean, Lincoln, Washington, they didn't do that. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But I just have to put this stuff aside, I've got to stay focused on my job, because for many Americans, this is still a time of deep uncertainty. For example, I have a&mdash;I have one friend, just a few weeks ago, she was making millions of dollars a year. And she's now living out of a van in Iowa. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Meanwhile, back here in our Nation's Capital, we're always dealing with new challenges. I'm happy to report that the Secret Service, thanks to some excellent reporting by White House correspondents, they're really focusing on some of the issues that have come up. And they have finally figured out a full-proof way to keep people off my lawn. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>At this point, an image of Sen. John S. McCain III standing on the South Lawn of the White House wearing a cardigan sweater and holding a broom was shown.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> There he is. It works. [<i>Laughter</i>] And it's not just fence jumpers. As some of you know, a few months ago, a drone crash-landed out back. That was pretty serious, but don't worry, we've installed a new, state-of-the-art security system. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>An image of Vice President Joe Biden holding a baseball bat as a small drone hovers over the South Lawn was shown.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> You know what, let me set the record straight. I tease Joe sometimes, but he has been at my side for 7 years now. I love that man. He's not just a great Vice President, he is a great friend. We've gotten so close, in some places in Indiana, they won't serve us pizza anymore. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to thank our host for the evening, a Chicago girl, the incredibly talented Cecily Strong. On \\"Saturday Night Life,\\" Cecily impersonates CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin. Which is surprising, because usually the only people impersonating journalists on CNN are journalists on CNN. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>ABC is here with some of the stars from their big new comedy, \\"Black-ish.\\" It's a great show, but I have to give ABC fair warning: Being \\"Black-ish\\" only makes you popular for so long. Trust me. [<i>Laughter</i>] There's a shelf life to that thing. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>As always, the reporters here had a lot to cover over the last year. Here on the East Coast, one big story was the brutal winter. The polar vortex caused so many record lows, they renamed it MSNBC. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But of course, let's face it, there is one issue on every reporter's minds, and that is 2016. Already, we've seen some missteps. It turns out Jeb Bush identified himself as \\"Hispanic\\" back in 2009, which, you know what, I&mdash;look, I understand. It's an innocent mistake. Reminds me of when I identified myself as \\"American\\" back in 1961. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Ted Cruz said that denying the existence of climate change&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;made him like Galileo. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, that's not really an apt comparison. Galileo believed the Earth revolves around the Sun. Ted Cruz believes the Earth revolves around Ted Cruz. [<i>Laughter</i>] I&mdash;and just as an aside, I want to point out, when a guy who has his face on a \\"Hope\\" poster calls you self-centered, you know you've got a problem. [<i>Laughter</i>] The narcissism index is creeping up a little too high. [<i>Laughter</i>] Meanwhile, Rick Santorum announced that he would not attend the same-sex wedding of a friend or a loved one. To which gays and lesbians across the country responded, that's not going to be a problem. [<i>Laughter</i>] Don't sweat that one. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And Donald Trump is here. Still. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Anyway. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's amazing how time flies. Soon, the first Presidential contest will take place. And I for one cannot wait to see who the Koch brothers pick. <p>It's exciting. Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker&mdash;who will finally get that red rose? [<i>Laughter</i>] The winner gets a billion-dollar war chest. The runner up gets to be the bachelor on the next season of \\"The Bachelor.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, seriously, a billion dollars, from just two guys. Is it just me, or does that feel a little excessive? [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, it's almost insulting to the candidates. The Koch brothers think they need to spend a billion dollars to get folks to like one of these people. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's got to hurt their feelings a little bit. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And look, I know I've raised a lot of money too. But in all fairness, my middle name is \\"Hussein.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] What's their excuse? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>The trail hasn't been easy for my fellow Democrats either. As we all know, Hillary's private e-mails got her in trouble. Frankly, I thought it was going to be her private Instagram account that was going to cause her bigger problems. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>Successive images of former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton doing a handstand on a beer keg surrounded by men and women in bathing suits, drawing a mustache on a drunken man passed out on a sofa, and holding two cats were shown.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Hillary kicked things off by going completely unrecognized at a Chipotle. Not to be outdone, Martin O'Malley kicked things off by going completely unrecognized at a Martin O'Malley campaign event. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And Bernie Sanders might run. I like Bernie. Bernie is an interesting guy. Apparently, some folks really want to see a pot-smoking Socialist in the White House. [<i>Laughter</i>] We could get a third Obama term after all. [<i>Laughter</i>] It could happen. <p>Anyway, as always, I want to close on a more serious note. I often joke about tensions between me and the press, but honestly, what they say doesn't bother me. I understand we've got an adversarial system. I'm a mellow sort of guy. <p>And that's why I invited Luther, my anger translator, to join me here tonight. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>Comedian Keegan-Michael Key entered the stage as \\"Luther,\\" the President's \\"Anger Translator,\\" a character he plays on Comedy Central's \\"Key and Peele\\" program.</i>] <p><i>Mr. Key.</i> Hold on to your lily-white butts. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> In our fast-changing world, traditions like the White House Correspondents' dinner are important. <p><i>Mr. Key.</i> I mean, really, what is this dinner? [<i>Laughter</i>] And why am I required to come to it? [<i>Laughter</i>] Jeb Bush, do you really want to do this? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Because despite our differences, we count on the press to shed light on the most important issues of the day. <i>Mr. Key.</i> And we can count on FOX News to terrify old White people with some nonsense! [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"Sharia law is coming to Cleveland. Run for the damn hills!\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Y'all is ridiculous. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> We won't always see eye to eye. <p><i>Mr. Key.</i> Oh, and CNN, thank you so much for the wall-to-wall Ebola coverage. For 2 whole weeks, we were one step away from \\"The Walking Dead.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] And then, you all got up and just moved on to the next day. That was awesome. Oh, and by the way, just if you haven't noticed, you don't have Ebola! [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> But I still deeply appreciate the work that you do. <p><i>Mr. Key.</i> Y'all remember when I had that big, old hole in the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, and then I plugged it? Remember that? Which \\"Obama's Katrina\\" was that one? Was that 19? Or was it 20? Because I can't remember. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Protecting our democracy is more important than ever. For example, the Supreme Court ruled that the donor who gave Ted Cruz $6 million was just exercising free speech. <p><i>Mr. Key.</i> Yeah, that's the kind of speech like this: \\"I just wasted $6 million.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> And it's not just Republicans. Hillary will have to raise huge sums of money too. <p><i>Mr. Key.</i> Oh, yes. She gonna get that money. She gonna get all the money. Khaleesi is coming to Westeros. [<i>Laughter</i>] So watch out! [<i>Laughter</i>] Whew! <p><i>The President.</i> The nonstop focus on billionaire donors creates real problems for our democracy. <p><i>Mr. Key.</i> And that's why we're running for a third term! [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> No, we're not. <p><i>Mr. Key.</i> We're not? <p><i>The President.</i> No. <p><i>Mr. Key.</i> Who the hell said that? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> But we do need to stay focused on some big challenges, like climate change. <p><i>Mr. Key.</i> Hey, listen, y'all, if you haven't noticed, California is bone dry. [<i>Laughter</i>] It looks like a trailer for the new \\"Mad Max\\" movie up in there. [<i>Laughter</i>] Y'all think that Bradley Cooper came here because he wants to talk to Chuck Todd? [<i>Laughter</i>] He needed a glass of water. Come on! [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> The science is clear: Nine of the 10 hottest years ever came in the last decade. <p><i>Mr. Key.</i> Now, I'm not a scientist, but I do know how to count to 10. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Rising seas, more violent storms. <p><i>Mr. Key.</i> We've got mosquitos. Sweaty people on the train, stinking it up. It's just nasty. [<i>Laughter</i>] <i>The President.</i> I mean, look at what's happening right now. Every serious scientist says we need to act. The Pentagon says it's a national security risk. Miami floods on a sunny day, and instead of doing anything about it, we've got elected officials throwing snowballs in the Senate! <p><i>Mr. Key.</i> Okay, Mr. President. Okay, I think they got it, bro. <p><i>The President.</i> It is crazy! What about our kids? What kind of stupid, shortsighted, irresponsible bull&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Mr. Key.</i> Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! [<i>Laughter</i>]. <p><i>The President.</i> What?! <p><i>Mr. Key.</i> Okay. No. Hey! [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> What?<i> </i><p><i>Mr. Key. </i>All due respect, sir. You don't need an anger translator. [<i>Laughter</i>] You need counseling. [<i>Laughter</i>] So now I'm out of here, man. I ain't trying to get into all this. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Go. <p>[<i>As Mr. Key left the stage, he spoke to the First Lady, who was seated at the dais, as </i><i>follows.</i>] <p><i>Mr. Key.</i> He crazy. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Luther, my anger translator, ladies and gentlemen. Now that I got that off my chest&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>Investigative journalism, explanatory journalism, journalism that exposes corruption and injustice and gives a voice to the different and the marginalized, the voiceless&mdash;that's power. It's a privilege. It's as important to America's trajectory&mdash;to our values, our ideals&mdash;than anything that we could do in elected office. <p>We remember journalists we lost over the past year, journalists like Steven Sotloff and James Foley, murdered for nothing more than trying to shine a light into some of the world's darkest corners. We remember the journalists unjustly imprisoned around the world, including our own Jason Rezaian. For 9 months, Jason has been imprisoned in Tehran for nothing more than writing about the hopes and the fears of the Iranian people, carrying their stories to the readers of the Washington Post in an effort to bridge our common humanity. As was already mentioned, Jason's brother Ali is here tonight, and I have told him personally we will not rest until we bring him home to his family, safe and sound. <p>These journalists and so many others view their work as more than just a profession, but as a public good, an indispensable pillar of our society. So I want to give a toast to them. I raise a glass to them and to all of you, with the words of the American foreign correspondent Dorothy Thompson: \\"It is not the fact of liberty, but the way in which liberty is exercised, that ultimately determines whether liberty itself survives.\\" <p>[<i>The President offered a toast.</i>] <p>Thank you for your devotion to exercising our liberty and to telling our American story. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Cheers!\" "
"103" "\"<i>The President.</i> Good morning. <p><i>Audience members</i>. Good morning. <p><i>President Obama</i>. <i>Ohayo gozaimasu.</i> <p><i>Prime Minister Abe</i>. <i>Ohayo gozaimasu.</i> <p><i>President Obama</i>. On behalf of the American people and Michelle and myself, it is a great honor for me to welcome Prime Minister Abe and Mrs. Abe of Japan, one of America's closest allies in the world. <p>Across Japan over the coming days, our Japanese friends are marking special holidays: honoring their history, celebrating their constitution, giving gratitude for nature's beauty, and expressing their hopes for their children. And now, with this visit, it is a truly Golden Week. <p>For Michelle and myself, this is an opportunity to return the hospitality that Shinzo, Akie, and the Japanese people have shown us in the past. In Kyoto, Michelle had the honor of playing taiko drums. In Tokyo, I played soccer with ASIMO the robot. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>This visit is a celebration of the ties of friendship and family that bind our peoples. I first felt it when I was 6 years old when my mother took me to Japan. I felt it growing up in Hawaii, like communities across our country, home to so many proud Japanese Americans. <p>Today is also a chance for Americans, especially our young people, to say thank you for all the things we love from Japan, like karate and karaoke&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;manga and anime and, of course, emojis. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And this visit also has historic significance. In 1960, President Eisenhower welcomed Prime Minister Abe's grandfather, Prime Minister Kishi, here to the White House. They signed the security treaty that endures to this day, committing America and Japan to \\"an indestructible partnership.\\" <p>Today we welcome Prime Minister Abe as we broaden our alliance for our time. The United States has renewed our leadership in the Asia-Pacific. Prime Minister Abe is leading Japan to a new role on the world stage. The foundation of both efforts is a strong U.S.-Japan alliance. <p>Ours is an alliance focused on the future: the security of our nations and the world, trade that is fair and free, and the equal opportunity and human rights of all people, around the world and in our countries as well, including women and girls, because they deserve to truly shine. <p>Prime Minister Abe, Mrs. Abe, members of the Japanese delegation, we are truly honored to have you here, as great allies and as true friends. Welcome to the United States. <i>Yokoso.</i> <p><i>Prime Minister Abe.</i> <i>Ohayo gozaimasu.</i> Good morning. <p>[<i>At this point, Prime Minister Abe spoke in Japanese, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.</i>] <i>Prime Minister Abe.</i> Mr. President, Mrs. Obama, Mr. Vice President, Dr. Biden, ladies and gentlemen, I thank President Obama's warm welcome. <p>Two years ago, when I visited Washington, DC, it was in February, during the cold season of the year. I am honored to be back in this season when we can enjoy the beautiful season&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;South Lawn of the White House. And I'd like to express my appreciation for the cordial welcome from our American friends. <p>This official visit to the United States is a special one for me. Since I took office, the top priority of my foreign policy has been to revitalize the alliance between Japan and the United States. And here at Washington, DC, I had a summit meeting with President Obama 2 years ago, and since then, together with Mr. President, we have been addressing issues such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the realignment of U.S. forces. <p>And now our bilateral relationship is more robust than ever. Our alliance is back on track, and it is even stronger. This official visit is the culmination of what we have been doing for the past 2 years, and it is a great pleasure for me to realize this visit. <p>The development of Japan-U.S. relationship is not something we could achieve without the history of longstanding bilateral cooperation over the years. There have been the relationship of trusts between the leaders, the relationship of cooperation between the two nations and the governments, and friendship through people-to-people exchange between the two people. All these have played an important role as a key pillar for the relationship. <p>The world is facing numerous challenges more than ever. Japan will be at the forefront with the United States in addressing regional and global challenges while developing our bilateral ties with the United States in a consistent manner. And I very much look forward to having a discussion with President Obama today on those challenges. <p>Mr. President, Mrs. Obama, thank you again for the warm and cordial welcome as well as your hospitality. <p>[<i>Prime Minister Abe spoke in English as follows</i>.] <p>Thank you so much.\" "
"104" "\"<i>President Obama.</i> Well, Michelle and I are honored to welcome you to the White House as we host our friends, Prime Minister and Mrs. Abe, and as we celebrate the enduring alliance and great friendship between the United States and Japan. <p>I want to begin by paying tribute to two leaders in their own right, and I know Shinzo agrees: two women who are passionate about the causes they believe in, who speak their minds, who are better dancers than us&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and an inspiration to so many women and girls, including the students they met today. And I have to say, the First Lady is more responsible for the beautiful room tonight than I am. So thank you, Michelle and Akie. <p>On my last visit to Tokyo, the Prime Minister and I went to what is reputed to be the best sushi place in Tokyo. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I have to confess that you could not have the sushi if you did not have some excellent sake to go with it. [<i>Laughter</i>] Michelle just revealed that today, on her recent visit to Tokyo, she and Mrs. Abe also indulged in sake. So tonight we're breaking with tradition a little bit and serving sake from Shinzo's home Prefecture of Yamaguchi. And please enjoy yourselves, but not too much. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>It's appropriate that we have a Japanese theme to our dinner this evening. This morning I mentioned the Japanese Americans who were such important friends and parts of my community in my youth in Hawaii. And tonight I'm thinking about one of them in particular, a man who called himself Freddy, who ran a small market near our house. And he became great friend of my grandfather's. And part of the reason he was such a great friend is because he saved us the best cuts of tuna and toro for sashimi, and then, he'd also slip in some rice candy with edible wrappers, which was fascinating to me as a child. [<i>Laughter</i>] And they were small gestures, but they always remained with me as an example of how Japanese culture was woven into my upbringing and spoke to the ties of friendship and family that bring us here together tonight. <p>In 1957, Shinzo's grandfather, Prime Minister Kishi, addressed our Senate and our House of Representatives. He said that he hoped his visit would lead to \\"a strong and enduring partnership that will open the door to a new era of Japanese-American relations.\\" Tomorrow his grandson will continue to carry our partnership forward when he makes history as the first Japanese Prime Minister to address a joint meeting<i> </i>of Congress. <p>So in honor of this historic occasion, I want to welcome all of you outstanding leaders from our two countries. You represent the friendship and the bonds that we carry forward into this new century. And in celebration of the progress that we've achieved today, I'm going to attempt a haiku. [<i>Laughter</i>] Here goes: <p>Spring, green, and friendship <p>United States and Japan <p><i>Nagoyaka ni!</i> <p>&mdash;&mdash;which means \\"harmonious feeling.\\" That's certainly how I feel. I am sure that I'm the first President ever to recite a haiku. [<i>Laughter</i>] Basho has nothing to worry about. With that, let me propose a toast, with some sake. Be careful, people. [<i>Laughter</i>] To our guests, Prime Minister Abe and Mrs. Abe, to the friendship between our two peoples, and to our magnificent alliance. It does so much not just for our two countries, but for peace and prosperity in the world. May it endure for all seasons and all time. Cheers! <i>Kanpai!</i> <p>[<i>At this point, President Obama offered a toast.</i>] <p>Let me present to you the Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe. <p><i>Prime Minister Abe.</i> Mr. President, Mrs. Obama, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by thanking you for arranging this wonderful dinner tonight. During my visit to Washington, DC, last time, I declared the revival of the alliance between Japan and the United States. Two years have passed since then, and Japan is now regaining its resilience and will continue our path together with the United States. <p>Today Barack and I had an excellent summit meeting in the morning. On the occasion, both of us reaffirmed how robust the alliance is and issued a joint vision statement taking into account the path of the alliance for the past 70 years, since the end of World War II. This was an extremely meaningful achievement. By working hand in hand with President Obama, we, the two nations, will continuously make proactive contribution to global peace and prosperity. <p>Tomorrow I will address a joint session of U.S. Congress for the first time as Japanese Prime Minister. Taking that opportunity, I would like to send out a strong message that both Japan and the United States, which once fought with each other, now achieved reconciliation; and that we will make contribution to addressing challenges that mankind faces. <p>I have to confess that the day before yesterday, and yesterday, I was seriously practicing the speech that I'm going to give at the joint session tomorrow. But my wife unfortunately told me that she is getting tired of listening to the speech. [<i>Laughter</i>] So last night we ended up in a separate room. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the current Japan-U.S. alliance shows extremely close ties, forming a foundation for our economic growth and economic prosperity. For instance, Japan's Kawasaki Rail Car built new metro rail parts in Nebraska, which run through Washington, DC. Boeing 787 is flying everywhere in the world. And guess what, more than a third of its parts were made in Japan. Barack, you are an enthusiastic fan of sushi. And last, but not least, I have to confess something about myself too. I am one of the hardcore fans of the American TV drama, \\"House of Cards.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] But I would like to draw your attention to my commitment that I am not going to show this \\"House of Cards\\" to my fellow minister, Deputy Prime Minister. [<i>Laughter</i>] In any case, you won't find another bilateral relationship like ours. <p>Mr. President, Mrs. Obama, ladies and gentlemen, when the United States stands up to fight against various challenges of the world, and when Barack stands at the forefront to tackle with the variety of global challenges, you will not be alone. Next to you, there is always Japan. Japan has been and will be always standing side by side with the United States in addressing global challenges, such as the outbreak of the Ebola disease and climate change. <p>The partnership between Japan and the United States is simply unparalleled in building the future of Asia and the world. I know everyone here knows that famous song by Diana Ross, \\"Ain't No Mountain High Enough.\\" The songs goes, \\"Ain't no mountain high enough; ain't no valley low enough to keep me from you.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] The relationship of Japan and the United States is just like this. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So with that, I'd like to propose a toast, and also I'd like to acknowledge First Lady, Mrs. Obama, for choosing the sake from Yamaguchi, where I am from. <p>Last year, when Barack visited Japan, we went to a very, very popular sushi restaurant. And because of the facts that the two leaders enjoyed&mdash;ordered sushi, now they become more and more popular in Japan. But there was slight&mdash;one problem that involved in this arrangement of sushi dinner together with Barack. I actually prepared one brand of sake from Hiroshima, not my district. This was actually arranged by the Minister of Foreign Affairs. And probably because of the fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister Kishida is from Hiroshima, he intentionally chose a brand from Hiroshima instead of Yamaguchi. And because of that selection, I got so much pressure and criticism from the local people in Yamaguchi that I actually could share this wonderful story with Mrs. Obama when she visited Japan. So probably because of that selection before last year, maybe Mrs. Obama intentionally chose the brand of Yamaguchi just for this occasion. <p>So with that, I'd like to note the kind conservation of First Lady, Mrs. Obama, and also I'd like to acknowledge the help that I always receive from my wife Akie. And I'd like to propose a toast for good health and prosperity, as well as the further development of the Japan-U.S. relationship tonight. <i>Kanpai! </i><p><i>President Obama. Kanpai!</i> <p>[<i>Prime Minister Abe offered a toast.</i>]\" "
"105" "\"Welcome to the White House, everybody. Please have a seat. This is one of my favorite days because it gives us a chance to acknowledge some folks who so often are giving so much and, let's face it, aren't always getting a lot in return. [<i>Laughter</i>] Every day, the teachers behind me, they give their students their all: their knowledge, their creativity, their focused attention, their love. They empty the tanks for their kids. Then, they get up the next morning, and they do it all over again. <p>And today is our chance to say thank you, to let these educators know that we see how hard they work, we know the difference they make in their students' lives. And they are, at the same time, making an incredible difference in the life of our country. Today is a chance to reaffirm how important teachers are to our Nation, not just these teachers, but all teachers. <p>And we are joined by somebody who is as passionate about our teachers and our students as anybody I know, and that is our outstanding Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan. I want to thank all the school leaders who are here today, because it takes leadership at every level, from principal all the way up to superintendent, to give our students the best chance to succeed. <p>Because of teachers like these, our classrooms are full of future doctors learning how muscle groups and organs work and future poets discovering Langston Hughes and Emily Dickinson, future scientists who are tinkering with microscopes and circuit boards. Future entrepreneurs are getting the hang of collaboration and problem-solving. Future leaders are learning what it means to be a citizen and how the ideals of freedom and justice made our country what we are today. <p>So America's future is written in our classrooms. We all depend on our teachers, whether we have kids in the schools or not. They deserve our support and our appreciation. And they also probably deserve higher salaries. [<i>Laughter</i>] I thought I'd editorialize a little bit. [<i>Laughter</i>] Ad lib. That's what today is all about. <p>Here with us are 55 of America's top teachers, from as far away as Alaska and American Samoa, and as close as Maryland and Washington, DC. They teach everything from math and science to art and journalism. Some have taught for decades; others are still pretty new. A few of them look like they're still in middle school. [<i>Laughter</i>] But all of them share a passion for helping their kids develop their talents. All of them know the thrill of introducing students to something new and exciting. All of them are really, really, really good at their jobs. <p>I wish I could talk about each and every one of them, because all of you are remarkable. But in the interest of time, I'll just say a few words about one teacher in particular who happens to be the 2015 National Teacher of the Year: from Amarillo, Texas, Shanna Peeples. <p>So, Shanna, I'm going to brag on you a little bit. [<i>Laughter</i>] You just stand there and relax for a second. [<i>Laughter</i>] So Shanna teaches English at Palo Duro High School in Amarillo. Many of her students face challenges that would overwhelm adults, let alone kids. About 85 percent are considered economically disadvantaged. Many are refugees from places like Iraq and Somalia. Many of them have known trauma and violence in their lives and borne burdens that no kid should have to bear. Sometimes, just showing up to school is hard. But Shanna's classroom provides them a safe haven. And in Shanna, they find somebody who protects them fiercely and believes in them deeply and sets high expectations and is confident that they're going to do amazing things. <p>Now, according to Shanna, she wasn't always a teacher. In fact, she tried everything else she could before she finally accepted her destiny. She was a DJ. [<i>Laughter</i>] I want to hear more about that. [<i>Laughter</i>] She was a medical assistant. She was a journalist; a professional pet sitter. [<i>Laughter</i>] Finally, she realized what she was always meant to do, and that's helping young people discover the joy and power of words. <p>As somebody who grew up in a violent home, writing and books meant everything to Shanna. They were an escape and a comfort, a never-ending source of inspiration, a way to provide meaning to life at difficult times. One special teacher, she says, Ms. Belton, helped Shanna develop her passion. As Shanna puts it, \\"She taught me that it was possible to read and write my way into another life.\\" That's a pretty good description of education in general. <p>Today, Ms. Peeples passes that same lesson on to her teachers&mdash;on to her students. In their writing circles, students pour their personal stories onto the page. And she tells them, \\"Everyone has a voice, everyone has a story worth sharing.\\" They discover that their experiences aren't so singular, that whether they're an Ethiopian refugee or they've never set foot out of Texas, they're not so different, and they're not so alone, as a consequence. <p>Shanna works hard to earn and keep their trust and help them find new ways to grow&mdash;academically and emotionally&mdash;to rise above their present and to reach for their future. \\"In a sense, I sell hope,\\" she says. I love that line. [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"In a sense, I sell hope.\\" And her students are hungry for hope. Most kids are hungry for hope. Since Shanna arrived at Palo Duro 5 years ago, the number of kids taking the AP English III exam has doubled. This year, 30 students are taking the AP English IV exam. Before Shanna arrived, the number was exactly zero. <p>Shanna's impact reaches beyond her classroom as well. Her English-as-a-second-language students write bilingual books for kids and record lessons that refugee families can access online. Her AP students hit the streets of Amarillo on public health campaigns, conduct social science research on the health benefits of gratitude. I love that too. [<i>Laughter</i>] As her school's instructional coach and as a literacy trainer for the district, Shanna helps other teachers learn how to better teach reading and writing. For some of her colleagues, she's a godsend. Her principal says, \\"One teacher told me he was sinking until Shanna came to his rescue.\\" <p>She often uses the tale of Hansel and Gretel to finish the school year. It's a story, she says, of how we can be our own heroes, find our way out of the forest. Shanna's students have gone on to the Ivy League. They've won prestigious scholarships. But more importantly, many have just found their way out of the forest into new and better chapters of their lives. They've figured out a way to carve a path for themselves, in large part because of her. <p>Now, obviously, Shanna is exceptional, but we could have told a similar story about every single one of the teachers standing here behind me. They are not just teaching formulas or phonetics. They're selling hope, sparking imagination, opening up minds, giving people&mdash;young people&mdash;a sense of their own power. They teach students to challenge themselves and dream beyond their circumstances and imagine different futures. And then, they work as hard as they can to help those young people make their dreams real. <p>So at the end of the school year, their children aren't just smarter, they're stronger and more confident and more resilient and more inspired. And maybe, if they've tripped, they've been able to get up and dust themselves off. And that's going to make them that much better in the future because they'll probably trip a little more. <p>Those qualities are hard to measure, but they are invaluable. America is hungry for more teachers like these, which is why we've got to acknowledge them, because every school has teachers like these, and we don't give them enough credit. And we don't talk about it enough. <p>So I want to thank all the teachers who are here today for your outstanding contributions to the life of our Nation. We couldn't be prouder of you. I like the fact that we have a strong contingent of men here today too, by the way. [<i>Laughter</i>] I like that. Way to go, guys. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And with that, I want to present Shanna with her crystal apple. <p>[<i>At this point, the President handed the National Teacher of the Year award to Shanna Peeples.</i>] <p>Here we go. Let's get a good picture of that. There you go. All right. <p>Fantastic. And with that, let me present the Teacher of the Year, Shanna Peeples.\" "
"106" "\"It is a great pleasure to welcome some outstanding legislators and advocates on behalf of an issue that should always be bipartisan, and that is, making sure that we have the most energy-efficient economy in the world. <p>We've made great strides since the beginning of my administration on everything from doubling fuel efficiency standards on cars to incentivizing smarter policies when we build buildings so that they're not wasting as much energy. And thanks to the leadership of folks like Senators Shaheen and Portman and Bennet and Representative Welch and other folks who are here, what we've seen is a coming together of Republicans and Democrats who are going to facilitate us being much smarter in terms of building buildings, how we use energy. And as a consequence, we're going to save money for consumers, we're going to save money for businesses, and we're going to deal with issues like climate change that have an enormous economic and health impact on Americans as a whole. <p>So I very much appreciate the efforts of all the organizations involved here. Senator Franken, I should have mentioned him. He stands out. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I just want to say how much I appreciate the outstanding efforts that have been made in both Chambers and by both parties. I hope that we can use this to build even more progress in the future, because we've got a lot more work to do. There's a lot of low-hanging fruit; this is the area where we can have the greatest environmental impact while making sure that we're creating good jobs and saving businesses and consumers money. So it's a win-win, and I very much appreciate the strong efforts that were made by everybody behind me here today. <p>With that, I'm going to sign this legislation.\" "
"107" "\"Hi, everybody. I'm speaking with you from the DC Public Library in Anacostia, where I just met with a group of promising middle school students. We spent some time talking about their lives and how we all care about their success and how that starts with a good education. <p>So one thing I announced here in Anacostia is a new project by libraries and major publishers to provide more than $250 million in free eBooks for low-income students. We also issued a challenge to mayors, libraries, and school leaders to help every student get a library card so they can expand their horizons in a place like this. <p>It's all part of our ConnectED initiative to connect 99 percent of America's students to high-speed Internet. Because no matter who you are, where you live, or how much money you've got, you should be able to access the world's knowledge and information just like anyone else. In a global economy, we've got to help ensure that everyone, of every age, in every ZIP Code&mdash;urban and rural&mdash;has the chance to learn the skills that lead directly to a good job. <p>It's also why I've put forward a plan to make 2 years of community college as free and universal for every American as high school is today. It's something I'll talk about in my commencement address next week at Lake Area Tech, in the small town of Watertown, South Dakota. It's a community college with a graduation rate that is nearly twice the national average. They're proving that a great education can be within everyone's reach. <p>All of us have a responsibility to not only make sure our own children have pathways to success, but that all children do. And a great education is the ticket to a better life like never before. Making sure all our kids receive one is the surest way to show them that their lives matter. And it's the smartest way to prove to them that in communities like this and in a country like ours, we believe in opportunity for all. <p>Thanks, everybody. And have a great weekend.\" "
"108" "\"Well, I just had an opportunity to have a conversation with some outstanding young men, many of them from here in New York, a few of them who have come as distant as California, Boston. We've got some folks from Jersey. <p>I want to thank Joe Echevarria, who has been heading up our \\"My Brother's Keeper\\" Alliance, the private-sector component of what we're doing. I'm going to have a lot more to say about that during my formal remarks. But if you have any doubt about the incredible promise and potential of America, then you need to get to know these young men, because they are examples of intelligence, hard work, empathy and compassion, street smarts. And all these young men are going to do incredible things with their lives. Many of them are already doing incredible things with their lives. <p>Part of what we wanted to do was to make sure we heard directly from young people who oftentimes are growing up in really tough situations: single-parent households, low-income communities, crime-infested areas. We've heard stories of some of these young men being stopped and put on the ground by police for no reason, domestic abuse inside the household, situations where the schools don't seem to be invested in their success. <p>And yet, despite all that, these young men are succeeding in some remarkable ways. And part of what I heard from them was that they're succeeding because somewhere along the line they've received a mentor, somebody who's just paying attention to them and giving them some sense of direction. Part of what we've heard is that they've had the opportunity in some way to participate in community service and to get involved and have been able to show themselves that they matter and they count and that they can make amazing things happen in their own communities. <p>And what all of them suggested is, is that if we're going to be successful in addressing some of the challenges that young men of color face around the country, that their voices have to be part of how we design programs and how we address these issues. Because they've got a lot to say, and what they say is powerful and makes a big difference. <p>So I just want to say to all of them how proud I am of you, how grateful I am to you. I want to thank John Legend to participate. John has been doing a lot of work on his own time, not just around \\"My Brother's Keeper,\\" but dealing with issues in the criminal justice system and incarcerations and how we can steer how we interact with communities of color and low-income communities in a different direction. So we appreciate his leadership. <p>I'm very excited about what we can get done, but the main reason I'm excited is because listening to all these young men, I know that the future will be in good hands as long as we're giving them the support and the love that they need. <p>All right? Thank you, everybody. We'll see you outside.\" "
"109" "\"Hello, New York! Give Darinel a big round of applause for that introduction. Thank you so much. Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat. We are so proud of Darinel. We want to thank him for being such a great role model for other students here in New York and around the country. <p>I want to give a shout-out to a friend of mine who happens to be your assemblyman, Michael Blake. Where's Michael? He is around here somewhere. There he is. Michael&mdash;you've got to stand up, Michael. [<i>Laughter</i>] We're still teaching him about politics. When the President introduces you, you've got to stand up. [<i>Laughter</i>] Get some TV time. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So Mike grew up in tough circumstances as well. He worked hard, went to a good college. He joined my campaign, worked in the White House. Now he's in public office to make sure that other young people like him have every chance in the world. So we couldn't be prouder of him. It's great to see. <p>So I'm getting practice for Malia and Sasha leaving home. I've got all these incredible young people who worked on the White House staff who are now doing all kinds of great things. <p>I want to thank all the members of Congress and elected officials who are in the house. You've got a couple of proud Lehman graduates: Eliot Engel&mdash;where's Eliot? There he is. And Jose Serrano. And we've got some more folks&mdash;we've got three other folks from the New York delegation: Gregory Meeks, the always dapper Charlie Rangel, the outstanding Yvette Clarke. And visiting from Florida, Frederica Wilson. But they all share the same passion that I do, and that is making sure every young person in this country has opportunity. <p>And that's why we're all here today. Because we believe in the idea that no matter who you are, no matter what you look like, no matter where you came from, no matter what your circumstances were, if you work hard, if you take responsibility, then America is a place where you can make something of your lives. <p>And I want to thank Lehman for hosting us here today. And our community college system, the CUNY system, our public education institutions&mdash;they are all pathways for success. And we're very proud of what they do. <p>Everything that we've done since I've been President, the past 6&frac12; years, from rescuing the economy to giving more Americans access to affordable health care to reforming our schools for all of our kids, it's been pursuit&mdash;it's been in pursuit of that one goal: creating opportunity for everybody. We can't guarantee everybody's success. But we do strive to guarantee an equal shot for everybody who's willing to work for it. <p>But what we've also understood for too long is that some communities have consistently had the odds stacked against them; that there's a tragic history in this country that has made it tougher for some. And folks living in those communities, and especially young people living in those communities, could use some help to change those odds. It's true of some rural communities where there's chronic poverty. It's true of some manufacturing communities that have suffered after factories they depended on closed their doors. It's true for young people of color, especially boys and young men. <p>You all know the numbers. By almost every measure, the life chances of the average young man of color is worse than his peers. Those opportunity gaps begin early&mdash;often at birth&mdash;and they compound over time, becoming harder and harder to bridge, making too many young men and women feel like no matter how hard they try, they may never achieve their dreams. <p>And that sense of unfairness and of powerlessness, of people not hearing their voices, that's helped fuel some of the protests that we've seen in places like Baltimore and Ferguson and right here in New York. The catalysts of those protests were the tragic deaths of young men and a feeling that law is not always applied evenly in this country. In too many places in this country, Black boys and Black men, Latino boys, Latino men, they experience being treated differently by law enforcement: in stops and in arrests and in charges and incarcerations. The statistics are clear, up and down the criminal justice system. There's no dispute. <p>That's why one of the many things we did to address these issues was to put together a Task Force on community policing. And this Task Force was made up of law enforcement and of community activists, including some who had led protests in Ferguson, some who had led protests here in New York, young people whose voices needed to be heard. And what was remarkable was, law enforcement and police chiefs and sheriffs and county officials working with these young people, they came up with concrete proposals that, if implemented, would rebuild trust and help law enforcement officers do their jobs even better and keep them and their communities even safer. <p>And what was clear from this Task Force was the recognition that the overwhelming majority of police officers are good and honest and fair and care deeply about their communities. And they put their lives on the line every day to keep us safe. And their loved ones wait and worry until they come through that door at the end of their shift. <p>As many of you know, New York's finest lost one of its own today, Officer Brian Moore, who was shot in the line of duty on Saturday night, passed away earlier today. He came from a family of police officers. And the family of fellow officers he joined in the NYPD and across the country deserve our gratitude and our prayers not just today, but every day. They've got a tough job. <p>Which is why, in addressing the issues in Baltimore or Ferguson or New York, the point I made was that if we're just looking at policing, we're looking at it too narrowly. If we ask the police to simply contain and control problems that we ourselves have been unwilling to invest and solve, that's not fair to the communities, and it's not fair to the police. What we gathered here to talk about today is something that goes deeper than policing. It speaks to who we are as a nation and what we're willing to do to make sure that equality of opportunity is not an empty word. <p>Across the country and in parts of New York, in parts of New Jersey, in parts of my hometown in Chicago, there are communities that don't have enough jobs, don't have enough investment, don't have enough opportunity. You've got communities with 30- or 40- or 50-percent unemployment. They've been struggling long before the economic crisis in 2007, 2008. Communities without enough role models. Communities where too many men who could otherwise be leaders, who could provide guidance for young people, who could be good fathers and good neighbors and good fellow citizens are languishing in prison over minor, nonviolent drug offenses. <p>Now, there's no shortage of people telling you who and what is to blame for the plight of these communities. But I'm not interested in blame. I'm interested in responsibility, and I'm interested in results. <p>And that's why we've partnered with cities to get more kids access to quality early childhood education, no matter who they are or where they're born. It's why we've partnered with cities to create Promise Zones, to give a booster shot to opportunity. That's why we've invested in ideas from support for new moms to summer jobs for young people, to helping more young people afford a college education. <p>And that's why, over a year ago, we launched something we call \\"My Brother's Keeper,\\" an initiative to address those persistent opportunity gaps and ensure that all of our young people, but particularly young men of color, have a chance to go as far as their dreams will take them. It's an idea that we pursued in the wake of Trayvon Martin's death because we wanted it&mdash;the message sent from the White House in a sustained way that his life mattered, that the lives of the young men who are here today matter, that we care about your future, not just sometimes, but all the time. <p>In every community in America, there are young people with incredible drive and talent, and they just don't have the same kinds of chances that somebody like me had. They're just as talented as me, just as smart. They don't get a chance. And because everyone has a part to play in this process, we brought everybody together. We brought business leaders and faith leaders, mayors, philanthropists, educators, entrepreneurs, athletes, musicians, actors, all united around the simple idea of giving all our young people the tools they need to achieve their full potential. <p>And we were determined not to just do a feel-good exercise, to write a report that nobody would read, to do some announcement, and then once the TV cameras had gone away and there weren't protests or riots, then somehow we went back to business as usual. We wanted something sustained. And for more than a year, we've been working with experts to identify some of the key milestones that matter most in every young person's life, from whether they enter school ready to learn to whether they graduate ready for a career. Are they getting suspended in school? Can we intervene there? Are they in danger of falling into the criminal justice system? Can we catch them before they do? Key indicators that we know will make a difference. If a child is reading by the third grade at grade level, we know they've got a chance of doing better. If they aren't involved with the criminal justice system and aren't suspended while they're in school, we know they've got a chance of doing better. So there are certain things that we knew would make a difference. <p>And we've looked at which programs and policies actually work in intervening at those key periods. Early childhood education works. Job apprenticeship programs work. Certain mentoring programs work. And we've identified which strategies make a difference in the lives of young people, like mentoring or violence prevention and intervention. <p>And because we knew this couldn't be the work of just the Federal Government, we challenged every community in the country&mdash;big cities, small towns, rural counties, tribal nations&mdash;to publicly commit to implementing strategies to help all young people succeed. And as a result, we've already got more than 200 communities across the country who are focused on this issue. They're on board, and they're doing great work. They're sharing best practices. They're sharing ideas. All of this has happened just in the last year. And the response we've gotten in such a short amount of time, the enthusiasm and the passion we've seen from folks all around the country, proves how much people care about this. Sometimes, politics may be cynical, the debate in Washington may be cynical, but when you get on the ground and you talk to folks, folks care about this. They know that how well we do as a nation depends on whether our young people are succeeding. That's our future workforce. <p>They know that if you've got African American or Latino men here in New York who instead of going to jail are going to college, those are going to be taxpayers. They're going to help build our communities. They will make our communities safer. They aren't part of the problem, they're potentially part of the solution, if we treat them as such. <p>So we've made enormous progress over the last year. But today, after months of great work on the part of a whole lot of people, we're taking another step forward, with people from the private sector coming together in a big way. We're here for the launch of the \\"My Brother's Keeper\\" Alliance, which is a new nonprofit organization of private sector organizations and companies that have committed themselves to continue the work of opening doors for young people&mdash;all our young people&mdash;long after I've left office. It's a big deal. <p>I want to thank the former CEO of Deloitte, Joe Echevarria, who's been involved for a long time. He has taken the lead on this alliance. Joe, stand up. You've done an incredible job. Just like the \\"My Brother's Keeper\\" overall effort that we launched last year, Joe and \\"My Brother's Keepers\\" Alliance&mdash;they're all about getting results. They've set clear goals to hold themselves accountable for getting those results: Doubling the percentage of boys and young men of color who read at grade level by the third grade, increasing their high school graduation rates by 20 percent, getting 50 more&mdash;50,000 more of those young men into postsecondary education or training. <p>They've already announced $80 million in commitments to make this happen, and that is just the beginning. And they've got a great team of young people who helped to work on this, a lot of them from Deloitte. We appreciate them so much. We're very proud of the great work that they did. <p>But here's what the business leaders who are here today&mdash;and Joe certainly subscribes to this&mdash;will tell you, they're not doing this out of charity. The organizations that are represented here, ranging&mdash;as varied as from Sprint to BET&mdash;they're not doing it just to assuage society's guilt. They're doing this because they know that making sure all of our young people have the opportunity to succeed is an economic imperative. <p>These young men, all our youth, are part of our workforce. If we don't make sure that our young people are safe and healthy and educated and prepared for the jobs of tomorrow, our businesses won't have the workers they need to compete in the 21st-century global economy. Our society will lose in terms of productivity and potential. America won't be operating at full capacity. And that hurts all of us. <p>So they know that there's an economic rationale for making this investment. But frankly, this is also about more than just economics, it's about values. It's about who we are as a people. <p>Joe grew up about a mile from here, in the Bronx. And as he and I were sitting there, listening to some incredible young men in a roundtable discussion, many of them from this community, their stories were our stories. So, for Joe and I, this is personal, because in these young men we see ourselves. The stakes are clear. And these stakes are high: At the end of the day, what kind of society do we want to have? What kind of country do we want to be? It's not enough to celebrate the ideals that we're built on: liberty for all and justice for all and equality for all. Those can't just be words on paper. The work of every generation is to make those ideals mean something concrete in the lives of our children&mdash;all of our children. <p>And we won't get there as long as kids in Baltimore or Ferguson or New York or Appalachia or the Mississippi Delta or the Pine Ridge Reservation believe that their lives are somehow worth less. We won't get there when we have impoverished communities that have been stripped away of opportunity and where, in the richest nation on Earth, children are born into abject poverty. <p>We won't be living up to our ideals when their parents are struggling with substance abuse or are in prison or unemployed, and when fathers are absent and schools are substandard and jobs are scarce and drugs are plentiful. We won't get there when there are communities where a young man is less likely to end up in college than jail or dead and feels like his country expects nothing else of him. <p>America's future depends on us caring about this. If we don't, then we will just keep on going through the same cycles of periodic conflict. We ask police to go into communities where there's no hope. Eventually, something happens because of the tensions between societies and these communities, and the police are just on the front lines of that. <p>And people tweet outrage. And the TV cameras come. And they focus more on somebody setting fire to something or turning over a car than the peaceful protests and the thoughtful discussions that are taking place. And then, some will argue, well, all these social programs don't make a difference. And we cast blame. And politicians talk about poverty and inequality and then gut policies that help alleviate poverty or reverse inequality. And then, we wait for the next outbreak or problem to flare up. And we go through the same pattern all over again, so that, in effect, we do nothing. <p>There are consequences to inaction. There are consequences to indifference. And they reverberate far beyond the walls of the projects or the borders of the barrio or the roads of the reservation. They sap us of our strength as a nation. It means we're not as good as we could be. And over time, it wears us out. Over time, it weakens our Nation as a whole. <p>The good news is, it doesn't have to be this way. We can have the courage to change. We can make a difference. We can remember that these kids are our kids. \\"For these are all our children,\\" James Baldwin once wrote. \\"We will all profit by, or pay for, whatever they become.\\" <p>And that's what \\"My Brother's Keeper\\" is about, that's what this alliance is about. And we are in this for the long haul. We're going to keep doing our work at the White House on these issues. Sometimes, it won't be a lot of fanfare. I notice we don't always get a lot of reporting on this issue when there's not a crisis in some neighborhood. But we're just going to keep on plugging away. And this will remain a mission for me and for Michelle not just for the rest of my Presidency, but for the rest of my life. <p>And the reason is simple. Like I said before&mdash;I know it's true for Joe; it's true for John Legend, who was part of our roundtable; it's true for Alonzo Mourning who is here, part of our board&mdash;we see ourselves in these young men. <p>I grew up without a dad. I grew up lost sometimes and adrift, not having a sense of a clear path. And the only difference between me and a lot of other young men in this neighborhood and all across the country is that I grew up in an environment that was a little more forgiving. And at some critical points, I had some people who cared enough about me to give me a second chance or a third chance or to give me a little guidance when I needed it or to open up a door that might otherwise been closed. I was lucky. <p>Alex Santos is lucky too. Where's Alex? Alex is here. Stand up, Alex. So Alex was born in Puerto Rico, grew up in Brooklyn and the Bronx, in some tough neighborhoods. When he was 11, he saw his mom's best friend, a man he respected and looked up to, shot and killed. His older brothers dropped out of school, got caught up in drugs and violence. So Alex didn't see a whole lot of options for himself, couldn't envision a path to a better future. He then dropped out of school. <p>But then, his mom went back to school and got her GED. She set an example. That inspired Alex to go back and get his GED. Actually, it's more like she stayed on him until he went back. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I know, because just like I was lucky, I also had a mom who used to get on my case about my studies. So I could relate. But this is what Alex says about his mom: \\"She made me realize that no matter what, there's a second chance in life.\\" <p>So today, Alex is getting his GED. He's developed a passion for sports. His dream is to one day work with kids as a coach and set an example for them. He says he never thought he could go to college; now he believes he can. All Alex wants to be is a good role model for his younger brothers Carlos and John, who are bright and hard-working and doing well in school. And he says, \\"They matter so much to my life, and I matter to theirs.\\" <p>So, Alex and his brothers and all the young people here, all the young ones who are out there struggling, the simple point to make is: You matter. You matter to us. <p>It was interesting during the roundtable, we asked these young men&mdash;incredible gifted young men, like Darinel&mdash;asked them, what advice would you give us? And they talked about mentor programs, and they talked about counseling programs and guidance programs in schools. But one young man, Malachi, he just talked about, we should talk about love. Because Malachi and I shared the fact that our dad wasn't around and that sometimes we wondered why he wasn't around and what had happened. <p>But really that's what this comes down to is, do we love these kids? See, if we feel like because they don't look like us or they don't talk like us or they don't live in the same neighborhood as us that they're different, that they can't learn or they don't deserve better, or it's okay if their schools are rundown, or it's okay if the police are given a mission just to contain them rather than to encourage them, then it's not surprising that we're going to lose a lot of them. <p>But that's not the kind of country I want to live in. That's not what America is about. So my message to Alex and Malachi and Darinel and to all the young men out there and young boys who aren't in this room, haven't yet gotten that helping hand, haven't yet gotten that guidance&mdash;I want you to know, you matter. You matter to us. You matter to each other. There's nothing, not a single thing, that's more important to the future of America than whether or not you and young people all across this country can achieve their dreams. <p>And we are one people, and we need each other. And we should love every single one of our kids. And then we should show that love, not just give lip-service to it, not just talk about it in church and then ignore it, not just have a seminar about it and not deliver. It's hard. We've got an accumulation of not just decades, but, in some cases, centuries of trauma that we're having to overcome. But if Alex is able to overcome what he's been through, then we as a society should be able to overcome what we've been through. If Alex can put the past behind him and look towards the future, we should be able to do the same. <p>I'm going to keep on fighting and everybody here is going to keep on fighting to make sure that all of our kids have the opportunity to make of their lives what they will. Today is just the beginning. We're going to keep at this for you, the young people of America, for your generation and for all the generations to come. <p>So, thank you. God bless you. God bless all of you. God bless America.\" "
"110" "\"<i>The President.</i> <i>Buenas tardes. Bienvenidos a la Casa Blanca</i>&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;<i>su casa tambien.</i> And Happy Cinco de Mayo. I know there are tacos and churros and margaritas. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member.</i> And tequila! <p><i>The President.</i> Tequila. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I'm going to be brief. I'll let you get back to the tequila. She sounded very excited about that. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Let me, first of all, ask everybody to give a big round of applause to our musical guests, the Esperanza Azteca Youth Orchestra of Los Angeles and Puebla, Mexico. [<i>Applause</i>] Yay! So one of the biggest Cinco de Mayo fiestas in the world happens every year in L.A., and some of these students left their hometowns to be here today. So we are very, very proud of them. I also want to welcome our guests from Mexico&mdash;Under Secretary Sergio Alcocer. Give him a big round of applause. Ambassador Alejandro Estivill is here. Give him a big round of applause. <p>We know the origins of Cinco de Mayo. On this day, more than 150 years ago, thousands of soldiers from one of the world's most powerful armies marched towards the city of Puebla. And the farmers and the peasants who lived there were as hopelessly outmatched as their uniforms were mismatched. But they held their ground. They sent the invading army running in the other direction. It's one of the great David-vs.-Goliath stories in history. <p>And the United States, of course, has made Cinco de Mayo a celebration of our own. After World War II, when States and cities across the country sought to recognize Mexico and Mexican Americans for their contributions to the war effort, recognition of Cinco de Mayo in the United States took off. And today, we celebrate it with parades and barbecues and dances and street fairs and parties just like we're having today, with tequila. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So this holiday is an opportunity to remember how deeply Mexican American culture is woven into the fabric of this country. People of Mexican heritage and their children and their children's children have influenced our commerce and our culture and our language and our literature, our faith and our food. Like so many immigrant groups in this country, Mexican Americans have kept us young and dynamic and energetic as a people. <p>So we reaffirm our commitment to those traditions, and part of the way we reaffirm it is to reaffirm our commitment to comprehensive immigration reform, because that's who we are as a country. The story of America is a dynamic story. So we're not just going to stop now suddenly and forget everything that helped to build this country. And part of what built it was the incredible power of our immigrant communities. Our prosperity, our security demands comprehensive immigration reform. <p>That's the reason I took the actions I did last fall&mdash;within my legal authority&mdash;to make our immigration system fairer and smarter and more just. That's why Congress still needs to step up and ultimately pass comprehensive immigration reform. <p><i>Audience members</i>. Yes! <i>The President</i>. I know that it's so challenging when you know the right thing to do, and there are folks blocking your way and obstacles in your path. But I just want to remind everybody that progress is not always a straight line. Sometimes, you have to take this turn and that turn and go over this mountain and that valley. But the good news is, the American people are with us, because they understand that the story of America is a story of progress. And it's often written by people who come here with a vision for what's possible and are willing to take risks and aspire to something bigger than what they've already known. <p>As one of my predecessors, Franklin Roosevelt, once said, \\"Remember, always, that all of us, and you and I especially, are descended from immigrants and revolutionists.\\" Immigrants and revolutionists. Now, that's not the story of looking backwards, that's the story of looking forward. That's what we're doing today. And that's why I'm so glad that all of you are joining us. <p>So with that, <i>viva los Estados Unidos. Viva Mexico. Feliz Cinco de Mayo.</i> And go easy on the tequila. [<i>Laughter</i>] <i>Muchas gracias,</i> everybody.\" "
"111" "\"Hello, everybody. Welcome to the White House. Please have a seat. And congratulations to this year's winners of the Commander in Chief's Trophy, the Air Force Fighting Falcons. [<i>Applause</i>] Hey! <p>So this is the Falcons' third trip to the White House in the last 5 years. All told, it is a record 19 times that they have earned this unreasonably large trophy. [<i>Laughter</i>] But if anybody can figure out how to get this thing to where it needs to go, it is the Air Force. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to start by recognizing the Air Force Chief of Staff, General Mark Welsh, as well as the Superintendent of the Air Force Academy, Lieutenant General Michelle Johnson. [<i>Applause</i>] Yay! And of course, we've got Coach Troy Calhoun, a graduate of the Air Force Academy himself. <p>Now, last year at this time, most folks did not think that Coach Calhoun and the Falcons would be here today. They had just come off a less-than-ideal season. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But this year, they came back determined to set a new tone. The Falcons won four of their first five games. In a big win over Navy, quarterback Kale Pearson threw three touchdown passes, and wide receiver Jalen Robinette threw another on a trick play. Three games later, they went to West Point with this trophy on the line. And there, the Falcons defense held Army to just six points to complete the sweep against the academies and take this trophy back to Colorado Springs. <p>And that was just one of a number of highlights this season. They posted big wins over Boise State and Nevada, Colorado State. When the dust settled, they finished with a 10-and-3 record, a bowl victory, an eight-win improvement from the previous season, which tied for the best turnaround in all of college football. That was quite a season right there. <p>So this was a total team effort, led by Kale, the team MVP, and guys like offensive lineman Michael Husar and linebacker Jordan Pierce, kicker Will Conant. And we can't forget manager Chris Woychak. [<i>Laughter</i>] Where's Chris? Where is he? There he is. [<i>Laughter</i>] Who became a cult hero with his all-out sprints to get that water bottle&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;into the huddle. Coach, this guy has speed. [<i>Laughter</i>] Fans started calling him Blue Bolt. We should find some sort of position, slot the guy at wideout or something&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;because he can move. <p>So this was quite a season for the Falcons. But my favorite thing about Air Force&mdash;and all the academies who come through here&mdash;is not just that they win, it's how they win. Last year, they had the highest graduation rate in the conference. Coach recruits guys with at least a 3.5 high school GPA. As cadets, they give back to their community, and obviously, ultimately, they give back to their country. <p>Alongside preseason training, players complete summer service, leadership training. They volunteered for more than 500 hours at local community organizations. They've taken action to combat and prevent sexual assaults on their campus by joining with a campus organization called Cadet Athletes Against Sexual Violence, and they recorded a video similar to our \\"It's On Us\\" campaign. As defensive back Christian Spears said, he would&mdash;and I quote&mdash;\\"lay my life on the line for any guy up here. To say that and mean that, it's a real blessing.\\" <p>And we know that for these players, it's not just words. This week, we honor the tradition of service and sacrifice that has always defined those who wear our country's uniform as we mark the 70th anniversary of V-E Day. Seventy years ago tomorrow, the world celebrated a generation of young Americans who thundered across a continent to liberate a people, young Americans who were willing to lay down their lives for people they'd never met and ideals that we can't live without. From the sands of Africa to the beachheads of Italy and Normandy to the skies over the Pacific islands, young Americans like these guys changed the course of human history and shaped the future of the entire world. <p>So we honor all our World War II veterans for their courage and their example. We see their character alive and well in a new generation of Americans who have stepped up to serve: the cadets behind me, the midshipmen from the Naval Academy who we've got here today and who teamed up to win this year's Cyber Defense Exercise, the soldiers and marines and coastguardsmen with whom these men will serve once they graduate, every man and every woman who stands post across the country and around the world with pride and with honor and talent and skill. <p>You are the ones who make the United States Armed Forces the finest fighting force in the history of the world. And as President, I have no greater honor or greater responsibility than serving as your Commander in Chief. <p>In the months and in the years ahead, these cadets will go on to become officers in our military. They will lead their peers, and that will call on each of you to live up to the example of those who came before you. And wherever you are stationed, I want you to know that this country stands behind you and will strive to serve you as well as you will be serving us. But in the meantime, congratulations on a great football season. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Thank you for your leadership. Thank you for your service years to come. Give it up once again to the Fighting Falcons of the Air Force Academy. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"112" "\"Hello, everybody. Today marks a historic anniversary: 70 years since the Allied victory in Europe during World War II. On V-E Day after the Nazi surrender, people swarmed the streets of London and Paris and Moscow, and the cloud of fear that had hung for so many years finally lifted. Here at home, from small towns to Times Square, crowds gathered in celebration, singing and dancing with joy. It would still be 3 more months of deadly fighting in the Pacific. But for a few hours, the world rejoiced in the hope of peace. <p>General Eisenhower announced the news with little fanfare. \\"The mission of this Allied Force,\\" he said, \\"was fulfilled.\\" But his simple message belied the extraordinary nature of the Allied victory and the staggering human loss. For over 5 years, brutal fighting laid waste to an entire continent. Mothers, fathers, children were murdered in concentration camps. By the time the guns fell silent in Europe, some 40 million people on the continent had lost their lives. <p>Today we pay tribute to all who served. They were patriots, like my grandfather who served in Patton's army: soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, coast guard, merchant marines, and the women of the WACs and the WAVES and every branch. They risked their lives and gave their lives so that we, and people the world over, could live free. They were women who stepped up in unprecedented numbers, manning the home front and, like my grandmother, building bombers on assembly lines. <p>This was the generation that literally saved the world: that ended the war and laid a foundation for peace. This was the generation that traded in their uniforms for a college education so they could marry their sweethearts, buy homes, raise children, and build the strongest middle class the world has ever known. This was the generation that includes heroes like the Tuskegee Airmen, the Navajo Code Talkers, and the Japanese Americans of the forty&mdash;hundred forty-second [442d; White House correction.] Regiment, and who continued the fight for freedom here at home, expanding equality and opportunity and justice for minorities and women. <p>We will be forever grateful for what these remarkable men and women did, for the selfless grace they showed in one of our darkest hours. But as we mark this 70th anniversary, let's not simply commemorate history, let's rededicate ourselves to the freedoms for which they fought. <p>Let's make sure that we keep striving to fulfill our founding ideals: that we're a country where no matter who we are or where we're from or what we look like or who we love, if we work hard and take responsibility, every American will have the opportunity to make of our lives what we will. <p>Let's stand united with our allies, in Europe and beyond, on behalf of our common values&mdash;freedom, security, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law around the world&mdash;and against bigotry and hatred in all their forms so that we give meaning to that pledge: \\"Never forget. Never again.\\" <p>Most of all, let's salute once more that generation of Americans whose courage and sacrifice are the reason we're here today, in peace and freedom. Their spirit lives on in our brave men and women in uniform and their families who continue to defend the very freedoms our parents and grandparents fought for. As Americans grateful for their service, let's truly honor them, on this day and every day, with the gratitude they have earned and the respect that they deserve. <p>May God bless them, and may he continue to bless the United States of America.\" "
"113" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Oregon! Well, who arranged this day? Every time I come to Oregon this is what it looks like. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member</i>. Come more often! <p><i>The President</i>. Yes! Then, I'll&mdash;it never rains in Oregon, does it? <p><i>Audience members.</i> No! <p><i>The President.</i> Never. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Don't come to California. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> All right. Well, listen, it is wonderful to see all of you. First of all, please give Mark another round of applause for his hospitality. And thanks to everyone at Nike for hosting us today, here in \\"Federer Platz.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] You know, the White House is cool. [<i>Laughter</i>] We've got a basketball court. Actually, it's a tennis court that we repainted some lines&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;when I came into office. So it's a combination basketball-tennis court. There is a putting green that President Eisenhower put in. Can you imagine, by the way, if I had put in a putting green? [<i>Laughter</i>] Things have changed. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But you've got all that and the 18th tee box from Pebble Beach. Come on. I'm sure some of my staff is running around right now in the Michael Jordan and Mia Hamm buildings. [<i>Laughter</i>] They want to be lab rats for your new gear. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But it is wonderful to be here. Please give it up for two people who fight every single day for Oregon workers, your Representatives in Congress&mdash;they do a great job&mdash;Earl Blumenauer and Suzanne Bonamici. They are both here. Give them a big round of applause. Yay! And there are two people who couldn't make it here today, but they're doing a great job, and you should give them a round of applause as well, and that's Senator Ron Wyden and Representative Kurt Schrader. <p>So it is great to be at the world headquarters of such an iconic company, a company that helps athletes succeed from the individual to the world stage. And as you've heard, I've come to Oregon to talk a little bit about trade&mdash;which initially may have had some people thinking, what, is Mariota going someplace that we didn't know about? Or&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>] He's going to be great. He's an outstanding young man. He's going to be terrific&mdash;and from Hawaii, by the way. [<i>Laughter</i>] Right on. Local boy. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But this is important, and I want to tell you why I think trade deals and our willingness to go out there and compete on the global stage is so important. <p>Before I came out here, I had a chance to meet with some small-business owners from across Oregon, whose workers make everything from bikes to tea to stationery to wine. And they know how important this is to them. Sometimes, when we talk about trade, we think of Nike, or we think of Boeing, or we think of GE. We think about these big multinational companies. But those small-business leaders came here today because they understood that these markets outside the United States will help them grow and will help them hire more folks, just as all the suppliers to Nike or Boeing or GE or any of these other companies understand this is going to be critical to their growth and their ability to create new jobs. In fact, that's why Ron Wyden is not here, because he's in Washington, DC, as we speak quarterbacking this effort on behalf of Oregon's small-business owners and workers. <p>Now, small businesses are the backbone of our economy. Eventually, like Nike, they grow sometimes into really, really big companies. They employ millions of people. Ninety-eight percent of exporters are small businesses. They're the ones who made&mdash;make \\"Made in Oregon\\" and \\"Made in the U.S.A.\\" mean something. And they represent something essential about this country, the notion that if you've got a good idea and you're willing to work at it, you can turn that idea into a business, you can grow that business; eventually, who knows what might happen. You can give other people a chance to earn a living even as you do well. That's America's promise. And it's up to us to keep that promise alive. <p>Now, that promise was threatened for almost everybody just about 7 years ago, when the economy nearly collapsed and millions of Americans lost their jobs and their homes and their life savings. But thanks to the hard work of the American people and entrepreneurs like the ones who are here today&mdash;and some pretty good policies from my administration&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;we're in a different place today. [<i>Applause</i>] We're in a different place today. <p>This morning we learned that our economy created 223,000 new jobs last month. The unemployment rate ticked down again to 5.4 percent, which is the lowest it's been in almost 7 years. That's 3 million new jobs over the past 12 months, nearly the fastest pace in over a decade. And all told, over the past 62 months in a row, America's businesses have created 12.3 million new jobs. <p>I should add, by the way, 62 months ago is when I signed the Affordable Care Act. So, obviously, it hasn't done too bad in terms of employment in this country. I just thought I'd mention that. Since there were a lot of predictions of doom and gloom, I would just suggest, those who were making those predictions go back and check the statistics. [<i>Laughter</i>] Just saying. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So small businesses deserve a lot of credit for that. In fact, over the past several years, small businesses have created nearly two out of every three new American jobs. And the question is, how do we build on that success? We've got to be relentless in our efforts to support small businesses who are creating jobs and helping to grow the economy. <p>And that's been the purpose behind many of the policies I've fought for as President. I've cut taxes for small businesses more than a dozen times. I've pushed for investments in infrastructure and faster Internet. It's why we've made health care more accessible, affordable, portable, to give people the freedom to change jobs or launch that startup without worrying about losing their health insurance. <p>And passing trade agreements is part of that agenda if those trade agreements are the right kinds of trade agreements; if they make sure that they're growing our businesses and helping American workers by selling goods made in America across the rest of the world. And I've been talking a lot about this lately, because I view smart trade agreements as a vital piece of middle class economics. Not a contradiction to middle class economics, it's a part and parcel of it. <p>I believe that our country does best when everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, everybody plays by the same set of rules. And that means making sure everybody has got a good education. It means making sure that women are getting paid the same as men for doing the same work. It means making sure that folks have to have sick leave and family leave and that they can balance work and family in a fair way. It means, working to increase the minimum wage all across this country, because folks who have some of the toughest jobs oftentimes get the lowest pay. <p>That's all part of middle economics&mdash;middle class economics, but you know what, so is trade. We strive to make sure our own economy lives up to high standards, but in a lot of parts of the world, the rules are unfair. The playing field is uneven. That puts American businesses and American workers at a disadvantage. So the question is, what should we do about it? <p>Some folks think we should just withdraw and not even try to engage in trade with these countries. I disagree. We have to make sure America writes the rules of the global economy. And we should do it today, while our economy is in the position of global strength. Because if we don't write the rules for trade around the world, guess what? China will. And they'll write those rules in a way that gives Chinese workers and Chinese businesses the upper hand and locks American-made goods out. <p>That's the choice we face. We're not going to be able to isolate ourselves from world markets. We've got to be in there and compete. And the question is, are we going to make sure that the rules are fair so that our businesses and our workers are on a level playing field? Because when they are, we win every time. When the rules are fair, we win every time. <p>So this is why I'm such a strong supporter of new trade agreements. They're going to help our workers compete and our businesses compete. This is not a left issue or a right issue or a business or a labor issue. It is about fairness and equity and access. And like other issues that we've waged slow, steady fights on over the last 7 years, this is also a question of the past versus the future. <p>So the Trans-Pacific Partnership that we're working on&mdash;it's the biggest trade deal that we're working on right now&mdash;has to do with the Asia-Pacific region. And it reflects our values in ways that, frankly, some previous trade agreements did not. It's the highest standard, most progressive trade deal in history. It's got strong, enforceable provisions for workers, preventing things like child labor. It's got strong, enforceable provisions on the environment, helping us to do things that haven't been done before: to prevent wildlife trafficking or deforestation or dealing with our oceans. And these are enforceable in the agreement. <p>And Nike operates in the Pacific region, so they understand the competitive pressures they're under. Nike has factories all around the world. And let's face it&mdash;Mark I think doesn't mind me saying it&mdash;that some of these countries, they don't have the standards for wages and labor conditions that we have here. <p>So when you look at a country like Vietnam, under this agreement, Vietnam would actually, for the first time, have to raise its labor standards. It would have to set a minimum wage. It would have to pass safe workplace laws to protect its workers. It would even have to protect workers' freedom to form unions for the very first time. That would make a difference. That helps to level the playing field. And it would be good for the workers in Vietnam, even as it helps make sure that they're not undercutting competition here in the United States. <p>So that's progress. It doesn't mean that suddenly, working conditions in Vietnam will be like they are here at Nike&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;or here in Portland right away. But it moves us in the right direction. And if Vietnam or any of the other countries in this trade agreement don't meet these requirements, they'll face meaningful consequences. If you're a country that wants in to this agreement, you have to meet higher standards. If you don't, you're out. If you break the rules, there are actual repercussions. And that's good for American businesses and American workers, because we already meet higher standards than most of the rest of the world, and that helps level the playing field. <p>And this deal would strengthen our hand overseas by giving us the tools to open other markets to our goods and services and make sure they play by the fair rules we help write. The truth is, we have one of the most open markets in the world. Folks are already selling stuff here. We've got to be able to sell there. That requires us to enter into trade agreements to open up their markets. <p>I hear Oregon wine is actually pretty good. [<i>Laughter</i>] Somebody told me that the pinot noir in Oregon is top notch, right? I've got some winemakers right here. Well, I want to make sure Japanese wine consumers have the opportunity to partake&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;in a excellent Oregon wine. We got some Oregon beef producers and ranchers around here. I&mdash;beef is really expensive in Japan. Let's make sure they try some Oregon steaks. It's good stuff. <p>And that's one of the best things that can happen for our businesses and our workers: opening up markets that have previously been closed, particularly markets where they're already selling stuff here. There's a lack of reciprocity. It's not a fair deal right now. We want to make it fairer. <p>Now, I want to acknowledge&mdash;because this looks like a very well read and informed crowd&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that there have been a bunch of critics about trade deals generally and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And what's interesting is, typically, they're my friends, coming from my party, and they're my fellow travelers on minimum wage and on job training and on clean energy. And on every progressive issue, they're right there with me. And then, on this one, they're, like, whooping on me. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But I tell you what: I've run my last election, and the only reason I do something is because I think it's good for American workers and the American people and the American economy. I don't have any other rationale for doing what I do than that I think it's the best thing for the American people. And on this issue, on trade, I actually think some of my dearest friends are wrong. They're just wrong. And here's why. <p>First of all, they say that this trade agreement will cost American jobs. And they're really basing this on some past experience, looking at what happened in the nineties, over the last 20 years, as there was a lot of outsourcing going on. And you know what, past trade agreements, it's true, didn't always reflect our values or didn't always do enough to protect American workers. But that's why we're designing a different kind of trade deal <p>And the truth is that companies that only care about low wages, they've already moved. They don't need new trade deals to move. They've already outsourced. They've already located in search of low wages. <p>What this trade agreement would do is open the doors to the higher skill, higher wage jobs of the future, jobs that we excel at. It would make sure our manufacturers who are operating at the higher end of the value chain are able to access these growing markets. And the fact is, over the past few years, our manufacturers have been steadily creating jobs for the first time since the 1990s, under my administration. After more than a decade away from the top spot, business leaders around the world have declared the United States is the world's number-one place to invest for a third year in a row. [<i>Applause</i>] Third year in a row. So the point is, outsourcing is already giving way to insourcing. Companies are starting to move back here to do more advanced manufacturing, and this is a trend we expect to continue. This trade deal would help that. <p>Just this morning, as Mark may have mentioned, Nike announced that, with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, it will make new investments in advanced manufacturing, not overseas, but right here in the United States. And far more Nike products would be made in the U.S.A. And that means thousands of new jobs in manufacturing and engineering and design at Nike facilities across the country and potentially tens of thousands of new jobs along Nike's supply chain here at home. That's what trade can do. <p>Look, I've spent 6&frac12; years trying to rescue this economy, 6&frac12; years of trying to revitalize American manufacturing, including rescuing an American auto industry that was on its back and is now fully recovered. So I would not risk any of that if I thought the trade deals were going to undermine it. The reason I'm for this is because I think it will enhance it and advance it. So that's point number one. <p>Point number two: When you ask folks specifically, \\"What do you oppose about this trade deal?\\" they just say \\"NAFTA.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] NAFTA was passed 20 years ago. That was a different agreement. And in fact, this agreement fixes some of what was wrong with NAFTA by making labor and environmental provisions actually enforceable. I was just getting out of law school when NAFTA got passed. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Number three, you've got some critics saying that any deal would be rushed through; it's a secret deal, people don't know what's in it. This is not true. [<i>Laughter</i>] Any agreement that we finalize with the other 11 countries will have to be posted online for at least 60 days before I even sign it. Then, it would go to Congress, and you know they're not going to do anything fast. [<i>Laughter</i>] So there will be months of review. Every\\" t\\" crossed, every \\"i\\" dotted. Everybody is going to be able to see exactly what's in it. <p>There's nothing fast-track about this. This is a very deliberate track&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;which will be fully subject to scrutiny. And I'm confident when people read the agreement for themselves, they'll see that this is the most progressive trade deal in history. <p>Number four, critics warn that parts of this deal would undermine American regulation: food safety, worker safety, even financial regulations. This is&mdash;they're making this stuff up. This is just not true. No trade agreement is going to force us to change our laws. This agreement would make sure our companies aren't discriminated against in other countries. <p>We already treat companies from other countries fairly here. But our companies don't always get treated fairly there. So sometimes, they need to have some way to settle disputes where it's not subject to the whims of some government bureaucrat in that country. That's important. We want our businesses to succeed in selling over there because that's how our workers will get more jobs here in the United States. <p>And then, finally, some critics talk about currency manipulation. Now, this has been a problem in the past. Some countries, they try to lower their currency so that it makes their goods cheaper, makes our more expensive. There was a time when China was pretty egregious about this. When I came into office, I started pounding on them. Every time I'd meet with them, I'd be talking about currency. And we pushed back hard, and China moved. In real terms, their currency has appreciated about 30 percent since I came into office. And we're going to keep on going after it. But that's not an argument against this trade agreement. If we give up the chance to help our businesses sell their stuff in the world's fastest growing markets, that doesn't do anything to stop currency manipulation. <p>So the fact is, some folks are just opposed to trade deals out of principle, a reflexive principle. And what I tell them is, you know what, if you're opposed to these smart, progressive trade deals, then that means you must be satisfied with the status quo. And the status quo hasn't been working for our workers. It hasn't been working for our businesses. And there are people here who will tell you why. <p>I'm going to just give you a couple of examples of small businesses who I had a chance to meet with today. Egg Press, it's a Portland-based greeting card company, really nice. They sell their cards in Australia, which is a member of this Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. Their CEO, Tess Darrow&mdash;where's Tess? Raise your hand. I saw her. There she is. So Tess says that if they could more easily reach customers in Japan as well, they'd sell half the volume that they do here in America. That's a lot. <p>Right now the logistics of exporting to Japan are too complicated. Products end up being held up for months at the border. This agreement would help solve some of those problems so Tess can sell more greeting cards in Japan, presumably in Japanese. [<i>Laughter</i>] Right? Is there going to be&mdash;there will be a translation process, I assume. Yes, absolutely. I'm teasing. [<i>Laughter</i>] Okay. <p>So the trade deal would help eliminate barriers and simplify customs and hold countries accountable for getting products delivered swiftly. The more Tess sells, the more she can grow, the more she can hire here in Oregon, here in the United States. <p>Oregon Fruit Products&mdash;makes canned fruits, berries, other products&mdash;depends on exports for 20 percent of its annual sales. Right now it exports to four members of this partnership that we're putting together: Japan, Australia, Singapore, and Canada. Unfortunately, selling in these countries right now can mean dealing with unfair rules designed to prevent our products from being offered in their markets. Under this agreement, that would change. Exporting becomes simpler, more consistent. That means more people around the world eating Oregon berries all year long. Berry tasty. <p>Sokol Blosser Winery&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;oh, we got a lot of drinkers here. [<i>Laughter</i>] This is a winery, family run in Dayton, Oregon. One of its top export markets is Japan. Right now there are high tariffs on American wine in that country. Under this trade partnership, those tariffs would be eliminated, and wineries across America could see their sales grow overseas. The brother-and-sister team that runs this vineyard&mdash;wave, guys&mdash;they say, \\"If we can make it easier to do business with countries that are already our trading partners, countries that are allies, that's a good thing.\\" <p>They're right. This deal would be a good thing. So let's \\"just do it.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] It took a while for you to catch that, didn't you? [<i>Laughter</i>] I thought that was pretty obvious. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So listen, I know a lot of folks who are skeptical about trade. Past trade deals didn't always live up to the hype. Labor and environmental protections weren't always strong enough. I saw for years, in Chicago and towns across Illinois, manufacturing collapsing, jobs drying up. Outsourcing is real. Folks didn't just make that up. Some of our manufacturing base shifted over the last 25 years, and it wasn't good for manufacturing, and it wasn't good for those communities, and it wasn't good for workers. That's the truth. It had benefits. Other jobs were created; we got cheaper goods. But there was real displacement and real pain. And so for many Americans, this is not an abstraction, this is real. <p>But we've got to learn the right lessons from that. The lesson is not that we pull up the drawbridge and build a moat around ourselves. The lesson is, is that we've got to make sure that the trade deals that we do shape are ones that allow us to compete fairly. <p>So when I took office, I decided we could rethink the way we do trade in a way that actually works for working Americans. I didn't think this was the right thing to do just for companies. If I didn't think this was the right thing to do for working families, I would not be fighting for it. If any agreement undercuts working families, I won't sign it. I ran for office to expand opportunity for everybody, the all-American idea that no matter who you are or where you come from or how you started out or who you love, in America, you can make it if you try. <p>So yes, we should be mindful of the past, but we can't ignore the realities of the new economy. We can't stand on the beaches and stop the global economy at our shores. We've got to harness it on our terms. This century is built for us. It's about innovation. It's about dynamism and flexibility and entrepreneurship and information and knowledge and science and research. That's us. So we can't be afraid of it; we've got to seize it. We've got to give every single American who wakes up, sends their kids to school, rolls up their sleeves, punches in every day the chance to do what they do best: dream up, innovate, build, sell the best products and ideas in the world to every corner of the world. <p>Because, Nike, we do not just have the best athletes in the world. We also have the best workers in the world. We also have the best businesses in the world. And when the playing field is level, nobody beats the United States of America. Nobody beats the United States of America. <p>Just do it, everybody. Thank you. God bless you. Thank you, Oregon. Thank you. God bless America.\" "
"114" "\"Thank you so much. Thank you. Congratulations. Thank you so much. Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat. Well, hello, Watertown! It's good to be in South Dakota. I want to thank Governor Daugaard and the first lady. Apparently, Michelle and her, they're on the same wave length when it comes to keeping us straight. [<i>Laughter</i>] To Senator Thune, Senator Rounds, Congresswoman Noem, Mayor Thorson, Superintendent Dr. Lesli Jutting&mdash;all of you for your extraordinary hospitality. <p>I am thrilled to be here. I have now been to all 50 States as President, and I was saving the best for last. To the other 49, I hope you take no offense. [<i>Laughter</i>] I will say that your tourism secretary sent me a very impressive letter listing all the South Dakota sites that I still need to see. [<i>Laughter</i>] And they looked great, but I decided that the first one I needed to see was Lake Area Tech. <p>So, President Cartney, thank you and the people of Watertown for welcoming me. To the students, the faculty, the staff, I'm honored to be with you here today. And most of all, congratulations to the class of 2015! <p>I know some folks were a little surprised by me coming here. But there is no place I'd rather be on this Friday afternoon than celebrating with all of you. Although, I was told I should head home before any of my staff end up at the \\"gravel pit\\" tonight. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's what I was told. <p>I want to begin with a public service announcement. As long as you keep your school ID, you can still get your Sunday night student discount at B-Dubs. [<i>Laughter</i>] I had my staff check on that. And I think it may go down in history as one of my more popular executive actions. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So after a whole lot of work, you have a whole lot to celebrate this weekend. This is a proud moment, and not just for you wearing the funny hats, but for your friends and your family and your mentors, your instructors who helped you to reach this day. So let's give the family members and all the people who helped get you here, let's give them a big round of applause. <p>And I actually spend a lot of time with a community college professor whose name is Dr. Jill Biden. She happens to be Joe Biden's wife. She teaches English full time at a community college in Virginia. So I know how great your instructors can be. And I want to thank one of them in particular. So Dolores Stemwedel was scheduled to speak today. Where is she? I saw her earlier. There she is. She graciously agreed to wait until next year so that I could cut in. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I had a chance to meet her. She was completely charming. And I have to say, you guys missed out. She's really good. <p>Of course, Dolores was not the only one who was surprised to learn that I had asked to speak at your commencement. When President Cartney told his staff the news, apparently no one believed him. [<i>Laughter</i>] And Shane Ortmeier, your bookstore manager, said he blacked out for a minute. [<i>Laughter</i>] Alexis Stinton, an instructor in your Ag program, said her first thought was: \\"That's the funniest joke in the world. We're just a tiny little school in this little tiny town.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And look, she's right. This is a small school in a small town, in a State that is wonderful, but not a huge population. There are schools out there with more students than this one. There are schools with more resources and more history and more name recognition. And frankly, there are schools with stadiums that could fit all of this county nearly four times over. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So the question is, why am I here? Well, you started to hear the answer earlier from the previous speakers. Why would I come to a 2-year college in the fifth-biggest city in South Dakota? Well, the reason is because I believe that in a fast-paced, hyperconnected, constantly changing world, there are few institutions that are more important to America's economic future than community colleges. And there are few community colleges that are as important as Lake Area Tech. This school is leading the way. <p>Compared with other community colleges, the graduation rate at Lake Area is more than three times the national average. Three times. Within 6 months, 98 percent of those graduates&mdash;you&mdash;are either employed or continuing your education. The average Lake Area graduate who enters the workforce earns nearly 50 percent more than other new hires in this region. And as has already been noted, since 2011, there's been an award for excellence called the \\"Aspen Prize.\\" It's basically the Oscars for great community colleges. Only two community colleges in the country made the top 10 every year the prize has been awarded, and one of them is Lake Area Tech. <p>So this is not an accident. It's the result of a relentless focus on teaching real-world skills that lead directly to a job. In your time here, you've done hands-on work with companies across the upper Midwest. Employers even help design the curriculum. You work direct with the tools and the technology that you'll encounter in the workforce, from car engines to welding equipment to your new MakerSpace, with 3-D printers that were actually built by Lake Area students. And your instructors haven't just taught you new skills, they've helped place you in new careers. <p>You might think all this attention on job training comes at the expense of great teaching, but if anything, the opposite is true. This is the kind of place where students are on a first-name basis with their instructors. If you call at 10 p.m., they'll answer your call, although I hope you don't do that, because folks need their sleep. If you don't make it to morning classes, they'll check up on you and make sure you're okay. I heard one student who skipped school to go hunting found that out the hard way that somebody was going to check up on you. [<i>Laughter</i>] One of today's graduates, Colin Blume&mdash;where's Colin? Raise your hand. Stand up, Colin, just so you&mdash;hey, that's Colin. Colin is a big guy, by the way. So Colin&mdash;I'm going to quote Colin on this. He said, \\"You're family, and they'll do anything to help you along the way.\\" <p>And that sense of mission has been part of Lake Area since this school was founded 50 years ago. And today, it matters even more, that sense that we're a family and that we'll do anything to help each other along the way. <p>Class of 2015, you're about to graduate into an economy that is fundamentally different than the one that faced the first class of Lake Area graduates over a half-century ago. You've seen a lot of the perils of this economy firsthand: how good jobs and entire industries can vanish or be shipped overseas; how a crisis, because of some of irresponsible folks on Wall Street, can punish families on Main Street with one of the most vicious recessions in our country's history. <p>So it would be easy to just throw up your hands and say: \\"What hope does a place like Watertown have in a global economy? What place does somebody like me have in today's job market?\\" But instead of looking backwards, you looked forward. You saw doors of opportunity waiting to be opened. And you decided that community college would be your key to unlocking those doors. <p>Some of you came to Lake Area because you knew exactly what you wanted to do with your lives and you saw that education could earn your way to get started as quickly as possible. And Colin, the young man who said this school was like a family, turned a high school welding project into a business when he was 16 years old. At 18, he was awarded a patent for creating a new type of grain-handling cage. And today, at the ripe old age of 20&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;he's graduating with a degree in Ag production, a new contract to manufacture continuous fencing in the shop on his family farm, and who knows how many jobs he's going to end up creating. That's the kind of future-oriented focus that we're seeing in today's graduates. And the instructors here helped him make it happen. So we're really proud of you. <p>But Colin is not the only. From the time she was an infant, Maysa Hackens has been blind in her right eye, and she has only 75 percent vision in her left. Where&mdash;is she here? Maysa? Come on, stand up. There you go. There you go. So Maysa is not as tall as Colin. [<i>Laughter</i>] But in high school, she discovered a passion that most people might not expect somebody with her vision issues to be able to pursue photography. And she was really good at it. And she found that Lake Area would give her the chance to complete both a business degree and a photography degree in just 2 years. So now she's going back home, to New Underwood, to run her own business. It's called \\"How 'Eye' See It Photography.\\" And she's got a website, and she's got a business plan. That's the kind of initiative that built this country. And a little free advertising from the President doesn't help&mdash;it doesn't hurt. [<i>Laughter</i>] Hopefully, folks were paying attention. <p>So community colleges like this one can be a great place for young people to launch a career. But they're also a great place for people who have already been in the workforce for a while and decide they need to change their careers and reach for something better. <p>So Leanna Waldner&mdash;where's Leanna? Come on, don't be shy. She's here somewhere. There she is. Wow. Leanna, you stood up and sat down before I could even see you. [<i>Laughter</i>] Where are you? Come on, stand up. There you are. There you go. So Leanna grew right&mdash;grew up right here in Watertown. She dropped out of high school. By age 20, she was working as a waitress, supporting two beautiful baby girls, Lizzie and Farrah, on her own. And that touches me, because I was raised by a single mom with the help of my grandparents. <p>So after years of low-paying jobs, Leanna decided she needed to go back to school. And it wasn't easy. Some nights, Lizzie would be doing her homework at one end of the kitchen table, and Mom would be doing her homework at the other end. And Leanna says, \\"I didn't think I'd ever be in that position to walk across that stage and get a diploma.\\" But here she is, about to walk across this stage and earn her financial services degree. And I know there are two little girls here today that are really, really proud of their mom. Setting a great example. <p>And then, some of you came to Lake Area Tech because you'd already begun a great career, in the bravest way possible. And you figured with a few new skills, you could take the next step. Tech Sergeant Joe Wiskur joined the Navy right before 9/11. Where's Joe? In 2005, he enlisted in the South Dakota Air National Guard. He helped organize air operations over four deployments overseas, earned two commendation medals for his service. But Joe's mentors told him that if he wanted to keep climbing the chain of command, he needed more than a high school degree. So he came to Lake Area to study aviation maintenance technology. Joe's next deployment is shortly after graduation. But this time, he's hoping to be training the airmen who used to do his old job. <p>And Sergeant Wiskur is one of 35 servicemembers and veterans graduating from Lake Area Tech today. And as your Commander in Chief, I could not be prouder of you. And I ask everyone to stand and recognize these men and women for their service. Thank you. <p>So stories like Joe's and Leanna's and Maysa's and Colin's, they are our proof that community colleges like this one are vital paths to the middle class for millions of Americans. In just 2 years, schools like this can change lives, change careers, grow our economy. They can change our country. <p>All of us are better off when our businesses have access to the best trained workers in the world. All of us are better off when entrepreneurs like Colin and Maysa can boost their hometown economies and make it more attractive for young people to stay. All of us are better off when a parent like Leanna can make ends meet and provide for her kids. All of us are better off when a patriot like Joe can keep serving his country. <p>So that's why I came here today, to this little tiny school in this little tiny town. I didn't come here to inspire you. I came here because you, the graduates, inspire me. That's why I came here. You have lived through some of the toughest economic times in your country's history, and you still chose to came here&mdash;come here and invest in yourself, because you still believe that America is a place where you can make it if you try. That's what hope is, the belief that even if today is hard, with a little hard work, there's something better around the bend. <p>And it is that promise that has always set this country apart. It's the idea that through hard work and through sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams, but we still come together as one American family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well; that we take responsibility for looking after our own kids, but we're also thinking about somebody else's kids; that if we got a good break and did well, you know what, we're going to turn around and make sure that somebody else gets a break too. It's the idea, as Colin said, that we're a family and we'll do anything to help each other along. And we know that if we're helping somebody else, at some point we may need help too. <p>Now, I doubt all this was on your mind when you celebrated \\"Thirsty Thursday\\" last night. [<i>Laughter</i>] But as President, it's my job to think about this stuff. And I think the time you spent here was not only an investment in yourself, but a true act of faith in your country as well. <p>And that's why I think the country should return the favor. We should have faith in people like you. We should invest in people like you. Our budgets should reflect that we care about you. <p>That means giving everybody in America the same chance you have here, the chance to earn new skills that lead directly to a good job. And this is an idea that has united philanthropists and companies and educators around a common mission. And at a moment when our politics sometimes can seem really divided, this is an idea that actually has some bipartisan support. From the Republican Governor of Tennessee to the Democratic mayor of Chicago, leaders across our country are laying out plans to put a college education within reach for everybody. And I'm proud of what we've done to expand Pell grants and the fact that so many young people here are recipients of Pell grants. Because when I came into office, not as many folks were getting them. And I'm proud of what we've done to try to keep interest rates low on student loans. But we can do more than what we're doing. <p>That's why this year, in my State of the Union Address, inspired by a letter I received from a hard-working mom like Leanna, I put forward a proposal of my own. I want to lower the cost of community college in America to zero. I want to make it as easy to go to community college as it is to graduate from high school, if you're willing to work hard. <p>Now, I know some of you graduates are wishing we could go back in time and make the last 2 years free. [<i>Laughter</i>] I get it. I do too. But if folks in Congress decide to make this a priority, we could do the next best thing and make community college free for an entire generation of young Americans, as long as they're willing to work: keep their grades up, be responsible, graduate on time. And we could pay for it by closing just one loophole for millionaires and billionaires. Just one. Just one tax loophole enjoyed almost entirely by very few at the top, we could offer a quality education to millions of middle class Americans. It's in everybody's interest. <p>We live in a 21st-century economy that rewards knowledge and innovation like never before. So as a country, we can't afford to let any striving American be priced out of the education they need to get ahead. For everybody willing to work for it, we need to make 2 years of community college as free and universal as high school is today. It's the right thing to do. [<i>Applause</i>] It's the right thing to do. <p>And you know, if that seems pie in the sky, just remember, 4 years of free high school was once hard to imagine, until we as a country decided to give every child that chance. Helping veterans go to college on the GI bill was hard to imagine, until we decided our returning heroes deserved nothing less. Pell grants for lower income students were hard to imagine, until we decided that by investing in their future, we were investing in our own. <p>That's part of what makes America exceptional. We are family, and we'll do anything to help each other along the way. That's what Colin said. <p>That brings me back to Alexis Stinton, your instructor who wondered why I would ask to come to this tiny little school, this little tiny town. Where's Alexis, by the way? There she is, over there. You see, back in 2007, Alexis owned a small dog-grooming business. And her husband Nathaniel worked construction. And one day, misfortune hit, and Nathaniel got injured, and he had to leave his job. And then the recession hit, and her small business struggled. \\"It was so overwhelming and such a low point for us,\\" Alexis said, \\"I knew I was at a point where life needed to change.\\" And this is the place where it did. <p>First, Nathaniel enrolled here. He earned a degree from the lab technician program. Today, he works in quality control at the Baby Bel Cheese factory over in Brookings. The next semester, Alexis enrolled here. And she was such a good student that even before she finished her Ag degree, she was asked to help teach classes. And \\"Lake Area Tech has turned both of our lives around,\\" Alexis says. And today, her life work is to help other students make the same journey. \\"It's gratifying,\\" she says, \\"when someone finds their path.\\" <p>Graduates, I hope that's something you keep in mind as you walk across the stage today, that gratification that comes from helping someone find their path; for making yourself useful not just to yourself, but to others. For you haven't just earned new opportunities with this degree; you've also earned responsibilities along with it. And, Colin and Maysa, as you open your small business, don't forget to be those entrepreneurs who give back to the communities that gave you so much. Leanna, as you build a better future for your kids, teach them that every child deserves the chance they had, even if they aren't lucky enough to have a mom like you. Joe and all the other graduates here today: Never settle. Keep climbing that ladder of success as you're doing it. Reach back to help other strive to be the best they can be. <p>That's who we are as Americans. We are rugged individuals. We haven't lost that pioneering spirit that brought many of our grandparents and great-grandparents to these plains. We ask for nothing more than the chance to blaze our own trail. And yet each of us is only here because somebody, somewhere, helped us find our path. <p>Which brings me to one last story. It's a story about a boy who was born more than a hundred years ago in Wallace, South Dakota, about 25 miles from here. His family didn't have much. But they were able to give him an education because he was part of that first generation of Americans to grow up in a country that believed high school should be available for everybody. And after high school, that boy went on to graduate college, and then he became a teacher, and then he became a mayor, and then he became a Senator. At the time Lake Area was founded, Hubert Humphrey was Vice President of the United States. But he never once forgot what made his American story possible. \\"The road to freedom,\\" he said, \\"here and everywhere on Earth, begins in the classroom.\\" The road to freedom begins in the classroom. <p>So, class of 2015, you have earned the chance to walk the road to freedom and to make of your lives what you will, to write that next great chapter in our American story. And your path will not always be easy, and your way forward will not always be clear. But you have worked hard for this moment. And if you hold fast to that faith in yourself and in your country and in our God, then the greatest moments of your journey are the ones that still lie ahead. <p>It's your world. Thank you, graduates. God bless you. Congratulations to the class of 2015. And good job, Lake Area Tech! We're proud of you.\" "
"115" "\"<i>The President</i>. Thank you so much. Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. Please have a seat. Welcome to the White House. <p>We have more than 20 countries represented here today. So to those of you visiting for the first time, welcome to the United States. We have a lot of brainpower here. We've got innovators and investors, business leaders, entrepreneurs. We've even got a few Sharks. [<i>Laughter</i>] Mark and Daymond and Barbara, they were having a chance to talk to some of these young entrepreneurs, and they&mdash;the young entrepreneurs, I think, decided they were pretty nice sharks, as sharks go. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to welcome Senator Coons, who's here and a great champion of our engagement with Africa. And I want to thank Secretary Penny Pritzker, as well as our Small Business Administrator, Maria Contreras-Sweet, and all the leaders from across the administration for their work to empower entrepreneurs like you. <p>We're here today because we believe in the power of entrepreneurship: the basic notion that if you've got an idea and if you really work hard and you're able to pick yourself up if you stumble a couple of times, you can eventually turn that idea into a reality. And this matters to us because encouraging the spirit of entrepreneurship can help us to tackle some of the greatest challenges that we face around the world. <p>At a time when we're still working to sustain the global economic recovery and put people back to work, helping folks to start new business can spur broad-based growth, here at home and around the world. At a time when the world is more interconnected than ever, we've got unprecedented opportunities to help more people access capital and resources and networks that they need to succeed. At a time that we're facing challenges that no country can meet by itself&mdash;lifting people out of poverty, combating climate change, preventing the spread of disease&mdash;helping social entrepreneurs mobilize and organize brings more people together to find solutions. <p>And entrepreneurship breaks down barriers between cultures and between faiths at a time when we need more than ever the capacity to understand and work across borders. <p>And no one understands this better than our young people, like those of you who are here today. I do have to say, as a quick aside, I feel kind of old hanging out with you. [<i>Laughter</i>] I used to think of entrepreneurs as kind of old, grizzled people, and now I'm the old grizzled person&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and the entrepreneurs are all young, and so I have a extraordinarily good-looking group of entrepreneurs. <p>But more than half the world's population is under the age of 30. In some countries, it's an overwhelming majority. And yet there are also countries where youth unemployment can exceed 35 percent. And when so many young people don't see a future for themselves, if they don't see a path to success, it holds the entire nation back. It's a recipe for instability and conflict and violence. <p>And around the world, we've seen how violent extremists are exploiting and tapping into these frustrations of young people who feel that they've got no opportunity to improve their lives. And what they offer are dead ends. And yet if these young people don't feel that there is a positive path for themselves, then they're vulnerable. <p>Poverty alone does not cause terrorism or sectarian violence, but investments in youth entrepreneurship and education are some of our best antidotes that we have to that kind of disorder. So all of this matters to us: to our shared prosperity and to our shared security. <p>And that's why, from the very beginning of my administration, I've elevated our support for entrepreneurship to make it easier for young people&mdash;and people generally&mdash;to start a new business or a new social venture. I hosted the first Global Entrepreneurship Summit back in 2010, and over the past 5 years, we've helped to train and empower thousands of aspiring entrepreneurs. We've helped small businesses expand into new markets, mobilized new investments, connected emerging innovators with mentors and networks and expanded access to capital. <p>As part of our Young African Leaders Initiative, we're offering training and grants and online resources and courses and leadership centers to help young entrepreneurs build businesses that can drive growth in Africa. As part of our initiative in Southeast Asia, we've connected young people across the ASEAN countries, and this is a region that will only grow in importance for the global economy. <p>Last month, I was in Jamaica&mdash;not only to visit Bob Marley's house, which was very cool. [<i>Laughter</i>] The&mdash;Mark, I'm telling you, if you can go, it's&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;it's cool. But also to launch our initiative for young entrepreneurs in the Caribbean and Latin America. And everywhere you go, I've&mdash;you meet these incredibly inspiring young people. Young Palestinians I met in Ramallah, working to improve the lives of people across the West Bank through business and creating opportunity. A young man in rural Malawi, his town currently in darkness, but he's building generators to deliver electricity. Young Malaysians, harnessing technology and connecting their communities to the global economy. And just like you, they're daring to dream and dedicating themselves to building something lasting for themselves, but also for their countries. <p>So all told, we've set a goal of generating $1 billion in new investment for emerging entrepreneurs worldwide by 2017. And half of that money is going to support young entrepreneurs and women entrepreneurs. And we're calling it the Spark Global Entrepreneurship Initiative&mdash;brings together some of the most successful entrepreneurship programs across our Government and makes sure that they're working with the private sector in ways that allow for long-term, sustained success. <p>So today we're taking some next steps. First, we're going to step up our efforts to support young entrepreneurs and women, which is just smart business. We want to spur entrepreneurship in places where it can do the most good and have the greatest impact. And we're going to work even harder to reach entrepreneurs who face the highest hurdles when it comes to accessing the essential tools of entrepreneurship: finance, support networks, mentors. <p>Second, I'm proud to announce that more of America's business leaders and innovators are joining us in this effort. We call them our ambassadors for global entrepreneurship. They do not have to be confirmed by the Senate&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;which is worth&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;cheering. Our first class of ambassadors has been doing extraordinary work. Steve Case, who, from the day I came into office, has been working with me on promoting entrepreneurship here in the United States and now overseas, he just ended his Rise of the Rest bus tour, investing in young entrepreneurs in 14 cities across the United States. Today we're welcoming nine new ambassadors from companies working on shared challenges: how to build a business in underserved communities, how to improve the affordability and accessibility of medical care, how to inspire young girls to pursue science and engineering. And each of our ambassadors has committed to a signature project focused on the communities we're looking to help. <p>I'm just going to give you two examples, although each one of these entrepreneurs have amazing stories and are doing some extraordinary partnering with us. So Brian Chesky of Airbnb&mdash;where's Brian? There he is. In addition to stealing a few of my employees&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;is going to help the Cuban people navigate new business opportunities as their economy opens up to greater Internet connectivity and modern payment systems, which provides enormous opportunities for individuals inside of Cuba at a time when things are transitioning and changing. <p>Julie Hanna. Where is Julie? There she is. Julie will use her expertise leading Kiva to increase access to capital around the world. Her project commits to delivering a hundred million dollars in crowdfunded loans to 200,000 women and young entrepreneurs across 86 different countries. <p>So I want to thank all our global entrepreneurship ambassadors for stepping forward and being part of this important work. Why&mdash;can you guys all stand up? And our global ambassadors, I want to just give them a big round of applause because they're doing really important work. <p>And finally, I'm challenging our partners across the private sector around the world to join this effort. We've already got the backing of some of the world's leading entrepreneurial foundations and organizations. They've joined together to form the Spark Global Entrepreneurship Coalition, which will coordinate this work and help us mobilize even more funding to support entrepreneurs. <p>But today I'm also urging governments and companies and organizations and individuals to make their own commitments. Whether it's through training and mentorship programs or helping entrepreneurs access capital and connect to markets or improving educational opportunities and exchanges, everybody has a part to play. Everybody can do something. <p>And this summer, I'll travel to Kenya. While I'm there, I'll participate in the&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member. </i>[<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President</i>. All right, yo! [<i>Laughter</i>] <i>Habari!</i> The&mdash;and so we're going to participate in the sixth Global Entrepreneurship Summit. And I'll have the opportunity to meet some of the brilliant young entrepreneurs from across Africa and around the world. If enough folks respond to the challenge that I'm issuing today, I believe that at the summit in Nairobi we'll be able to announce new investments and commitments that will pay off for years to come. <p>We want to empower people in ways that empower societies and ultimately empower the world. Women like Jimena Florez of Colombia&mdash;where's Jimena? There she is. So I just had a chance to meet with her. She started her own company making healthy foods&mdash;which Michelle would be very pleased with&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and she started her company entirely with fellow women entrepreneurs, which Michelle would also be happy with. And through our support for women entrepreneurs, we've helped Jimena connect to mentors and training so that she can access new trade opportunities and grow her business. And through her work, she's also helping Colombian farmers adopt organic farming and benefit from access to new markets as well. So we want to thank you, Jimena, for helping to lift up your community. We're very, very proud of you. <p>We want to empower pioneers like Ziad Sankari. Where's Ziad? There he is, right next to her. When he was 17, he lost his father to a heart attack. And Ziad first came to the United States to study on a Fulbright. Then, through one of our science and technology competitions, he earned seed funding to develop his innovation, which is a heart-monitoring technology that clips to your waistband. So today, he's improving the way we respond to cardiac incidents, which will have enormous ramifications not just in places like Lebanon, but potentially, all around the world. So thank you, Ziad, for helping to save lives. <p>And we want to empower leaders of social change like Lina Khalifeh of Jordan. Where's Lina? There she is. After seeing one of her close friends abused, Lina said, that's enough. And so she had a background in martial arts. [<i>Laughter</i>] And so she opened SheFighter, a self-defense studio for women. So far, she has helped about 10,000 women learn how to protect themselves. And now she's competing for funding to expand her mission across the Middle East. So thank you, Lina. We want to be your partner to help women live&mdash;in helping women to live with dignity and safety. <p>So Jimena, Ziad, Lina&mdash;to all the young entrepreneurs out here&mdash;you are the face of change. You have the power to drive creative solutions to our pressing challenges. You know how to bring people together to work toward a common goal. And I believe in all of you. And as I travel around the country&mdash;I was telling some of the entrepreneurs earlier&mdash;when you go to some of the toughest places in the world, where violence and deprivation are, sadly, daily facts of life, what people are most eager to hear about is opportunities to start a business. What they're most interested in hearing about is the power of entrepreneurship to allow them to shape their own destinies, not just to be subject to the whims of aid agencies or geopolitics, but to be part of something that allows them to pursue their dreams and, by doing so, empowers all of us. <p>I believe that entrepreneurs like you can make the world a better place, one idea at a time. And you're going to be how change happens: one person, one step, one business, one city, one country at a time. <p>There are brilliant young people and hard-working women and innovative thinkers from communities all around the world&mdash;people just like you&mdash;ready to make a difference. But they haven't been given the chance yet. And we can change that. And together, we can help make sure that anyone who's got the creativity and drive to work hard, no matter where they're from, what they look like, what their background is, they get a fair shot at pursuing their dreams. And we'll all be better for it. <p>That's what this is about. And that's why America is going to keep supporting entrepreneurs like you. And as long as I'm President, this is going to be a critical part of our engagement and our diplomacy with countries and peoples around the world, and I suspect I'll still be working on it well after I'm President as well. <p>So thank you very much, everybody. Proud of you. Keep it up. Thank you.\" "
"116" "\"Thank you so much. Please be seated. Thank you, Chuck, for that kind introduction, for your years of proud service, not only as a police officer, but for all the advocacy that you do on behalf of law enforcement and their families. I want to thank the entire Fraternal Order of Police and its leadership, including Jim Pasco and Linda Hennie, for everything that you do to support those who protect and serve. <p><i>U.S. Marine Corps Helicopter Crash in Nepal </i><p>Let me also say that as we gather here today, our prayers remain with the families of our marines and two Nepalese soldiers, now that the wreckage of their helicopter has been found in a remote part of Nepal. They went to that remote land to help people who suffered devastating losses in a terrible earthquake. They represent a truth that guides our work around the world: When our friends are in need, America helps. <p>Sometimes, those in uniform get attention only when there's a battle. But they do so much more than that, looking out for folks who are vulnerable or having a tough time, if&mdash;experienced a disaster. And it can involve great risk and great sacrifice. And we give thanks to all our fellow Americans, military and civilian, who reflect the very best of American leadership around the world. The world is better for them. <p>We are here to honor heroes who have lost their lives in the line of duty, men and women who put themselves in the way of danger so that the rest of us could live in safety. They were beat cops, deputies, detectives, correctional and forest service officers, Federal agents, and tribal police. But to many here today, they went by different titles: caring husband, loving wife, my son, my daughter, Mom, Dad. <p>And so to all the families who are here today, whose loved one did not come home at the end of a shift, please know how deeply sorry we are for the loss that you've endured. Know how deeply grateful we are for your loved one's sacrifice. <p>We hold them up as heroes because that's what they are. It takes a special kind of courage to be a peace officer: to be the one people turn to in their most desperate moments, to be willing to run into a dangerous situation, when everyone else is running the other way. Scripture tells us to love our neighbors as we love ourselves, but only a special few take that commandment so deeply to heart that they are willing to risk their lives so that others&mdash;often total strangers&mdash;can know peace and security. And that's what peace officers do. And today we honor 131 who made that ultimate sacrifice. <p>Officer Kevin Gordon [Jordan]* was a member of the police department of Griffin, Georgia. Husband to Tammy. Father to seven children. Army veteran. His daughter Deborah says, \\"We were his platoon.\\" And Kevin deployed his own training to raise his young platoon, leading them in cadences: How motivated are you? <p>[<i>At this point, Griffin, GA, Police Officer Kevin D. Jordan's children, who were seated in the audience, chanted a response.</i>] They were motivated. [<i>Applause</i>] Highly motivated. <p>He drilled them with the basics: to study hard and to push yourself and to take care of each other. And everywhere he went, he made friends. In Tammy's words, \\"He never met a stranger.\\" To help make ends meet, Kevin took a night shift as a security guard at a Waffle House. And one night, some customers got rowdy, and as Kevin was placing one of the troublemakers under arrest, he was shot and killed. He was just 43 years old. One week later, Kevin's son Hezekiah graduated from Griffin High. And there to cheer him on were over a hundred of Kevin's fellow officers. And today, Hezekiah is in the Army, training to be an MP, and wants to be in law enforcement, just like his dad. <p>Senior Deputy Jessica Hollis started out as an EMT in San Antonio, Texas. She and her husband Ricky applied to the Austin Police Academy together, were accepted together, graduated together, just the second married couple in Austin to do that. Jessica eventually joined the Travis County Sheriff's Office, where she became a senior deputy and member of the prestigious dive team. She was a fierce animal lover. If she drove by a turtle trying to cross a road, she'd slam on the brakes and carry it gently on to the other side. She took her son Mason on special vacations&mdash;to the family lake house, New Orleans, on diving trips&mdash;just the two of them. <p>And last September, after heavy rains, Jessica went out to check for civilians trapped in rising water. It was around 2 o'clock in the morning when she radioed for help. Her car was being swept away by the floodwater. Minutes later, she was missing. Dozens of officers came out to join the search, but by the time they found her, it was too late. <p>More than 1,000 people attended Senior Deputy Hollis's funeral. And there, Travis County Sheriff Greg Hamilton made sure to tell all his officers that he never had the chance to say something to Jessica: \\"I love each and every one of you. And I'll do anything for you.\\" <p>Officer Roberto Sanchez's parents brought him to California from Mexico when he was just 4 years old. It was his first trip on an airplane, and that airplane is what brought him to America. So he began to collect model airplanes. He took his high school sweetheart, Sonia, on \\"plane spotting\\" dates, even worked as a freight carrier at Orange County's John Wayne Airport. <p>But he always had one big dream: to be a police officer. When he joined the LAPD, friends say it was one of the happiest days of his life. He lived within walking distance of his parents. He volunteered at the school where his niece teaches kindergarten. He married Sonia, his high school sweetheart. And his partner on the force was his best friend. So life was good. <p>One night, Officer Sanchez was in pursuit of a speeding vehicle when someone intentionally crashed into his patrol car. He was the third Los Angeles police officer killed in a crash in just 2 months. <p>Your jobs are inherently dangerous. The reminders are too common. Just a few days ago, two police officers were killed in the line of duty in Mississippi. A week before that, an officer was killed in the line of duty in Queens. A few months before that, two of his fellow officers in the NYPD were killed as well. <p>We cannot erase every darkness or danger from the duty that you've chosen. We can offer you the support you need to be safer. We can make the communities you care about and protect safer as well. You&mdash;we can make sure that you have the resources you need to do your job. We can do everything we have to do to combat the poverty that plagues too many communities in which you have to serve. <p>We can work harder, as a nation, to heal the rifts that still exist in some places between law enforcement and the people you risk your lives to protect. We owe it to all of you who wear the badge with honor. And we owe it to your fellow officers who gave their last full measure of devotion. <p>Most of all, we can say thank you. We can say we appreciate you and we're grateful for the work that you do each and every day. And we can thank the families who bear the burden alongside you. <p>On behalf of the American people, I offer the families, friends, and fellow officers of those we've lost my prayers and my deepest thanks. We could not be prouder of them, more grateful for their service. We could not be prouder of you and all who work so hard to keep us safe. <p>May God bless and keep the fallen. May He comfort the mourning. May He protect the peacemakers. And may He bless the United States of America.\" "
"117" "\"Hi, everybody. Everything we've done over the past 6 years has been in pursuit of one overarching goal: creating opportunity for all. What we've long understood, though, is that some communities have consistently had the odds stacked against them. That's true of rural communities with chronic poverty. It's true of some manufacturing communities that suffered after the plants they depended on closed their doors. It's true of some suburbs and inner cities, where jobs can be hard to find and harder to get to. <p>And that sense of unfairness and powerlessness has helped to fuel the kind of unrest that we've seen in places like Baltimore and Ferguson and New York. It has many causes, from a basic lack of opportunity to groups feeling unfairly targeted by police, which means there's no single solution. But there are many that could make a difference and could help. And we have to do everything in our power to make this country's promise real for everyone willing to work for it. <p>That's why last Tuesday, at a summit organized by Catholics and evangelicals, I sat down with a conservative scholar and a poverty expert for a discussion on what it takes to open more doors of opportunity. We know our efforts matter: Since 1967, we've brought poverty down by about 40 percent, thanks in part to programs like Social Security and the earned-income tax credit for working families. And we know that there are folks from all faiths and across the ideological spectrum who care deeply about \\"the least of these.\\" So I hope this conversation continues, not as a question of whether, but of how, we can work together to grow opportunity. Because it's not words, but deeds that make a difference. And from expanding tax cuts for working parents to raising high school graduation rates, to helping millions of Americans secure health insurance when they didn't have it just a few years ago, our actions are making a difference. <p>Of course, lack of opportunity is not the only barrier between too many of our young people and the kind of future they deserve. On Monday, I'll travel to Camden, New Jersey, a city that has faced one of the highest violent crime rates in America. I'll highlight some of the innovative things they've done to help police do their jobs more safely and reduce crime in the process. And I'll highlight steps all cities can take to maintain trust between the brave law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line and the communities they have sworn to serve and protect. <p>Whether we are Democrats, Republicans, or Independents, whether we live in one of our poorest communities, one of our wealthiest, or anywhere in between, we all want our country to be one where hard work pays off and responsibility is rewarded. We want a place where you can make it if you try. That's the promise we make to our young people. That's the promise that makes us exceptional. And it's the promise I'll never stop fighting to keep, for my children and for yours. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"118" "\"Thank you, everybody. Everybody, please have a seat. Have a seat. Well, thank you so much. It is good to be in Camden. <p>I want to thank your Lieutenant Governor, Kim Guadagno, your Congressman, Donald Norcross, and your mayor, Dana Redd, for being here. Give them all a big round of applause. I want to thank the outstanding facility, our hosts. The Salvation Army is doing great work, and the Ray Kroc Center here seems like just a wonderful, wonderful facility. So we're very proud of them. I want to thank Camden County Police Chief Scott Thomson for his outstanding work. Where's the Chief? There he is. <p>So I've come here to Camden to do something that might have been unthinkable just a few years ago, and that's to hold you up as a symbol of promise for the Nation. Now, I don't want to overstate it. Obviously, Camden has gone through tough times, and there are still tough times for a lot of folks here in Camden. But just a few years ago, this city was written off as dangerous beyond redemption, a city trapped in a downward spiral. Parents were afraid to let their children play outside. Drug dealers operated in broad daylight. There weren't enough cops to patrol the streets. <p>So 2 years ago, the police department was overhauled to implement a new model of community policing. They doubled the size of the force, while keeping it unionized. They cut desk jobs in favor of getting more officers out into the streets, not just to walk the beat, but to actually get to know the residents: to set up basketball games, to volunteer in schools, to participate in reading programs, to get to know small businesses in the area. <p>Now, to be a police officer takes a special kind of courage. And I talked about this on Friday at a memorial for 131 officers who gave their lives to protect communities like this one. It takes a special kind of courage to run towards danger, to be a person that residents turn to when they're most desperate. And when you match courage with compassion, with care and understanding of the community&mdash;like we've seen here in Camden&mdash;some really outstanding things can begin to happen. <p>Violent crime in Camden is down 24 percent. Murder is down 47 percent. Open-air drug markets have been cut by 65 percent. The response time for 911 calls is down from 1 hour to just 5 minutes. And when I was in the center, it was 1.3 minutes, right when I was there. And perhaps most significant is that the police and residents are building trust. Building trust. <p>Now, nobody is suggesting that the job is done. This is still a work in progress. The police chief would be the first one to say it. So would the mayor. Camden and its people still face some very big challenges. But this city is on to something. You've made real progress in just 2 years. And that's why I'm here today, because I want to focus on the fact that other cities across America can make similar progress. <p>Everything we've done over the past 6 years, whether it's rescuing the economy or reforming our schools or retooling our job training programs, has been in pursuit of one goal, and that's creating opportunity for all of us, all our kids. But we know that some communities have the odds stacked against them and have had the odds stacked against them for a very long time, in some cases for decades. You've got rural communities that have chronic poverty. You have manufacturing communities that got hit hard when plants closed and people lost jobs. There are not only cities, but also suburbs, where jobs can be tough to find and tougher to get to because of development patterns and lack of transportation options. And folks who do work, they're working harder than ever, but sometimes, don't feel like they can get ahead. <p>And in some communities, that sense of unfairness and powerlessness has contributed to dysfunction in those communities. Communities are like bodies, and if the immunity system is down, they can get sick. And when communities aren't vibrant, where people don't feel a sense of hope and opportunity, then a lot of times that can fuel crime, and that can fuel unrest. <p>We've seen it in places like Baltimore and Ferguson and New York. And it has many causes, from a basic lack of opportunity to some groups feeling unfairly targeted by their police forces. And that means there's no single solution. There have to be a lot of different solutions and different approaches that we try. <p>So one of the things that we did to address these issues was to create a Task Force on the future of community policing. And this Task Force was outstanding because it was made up of all the different stakeholders. We had law enforcement. We had community activists. We had young people. They held public meetings across the country. They developed concrete proposals that every community in America can implement to rebuild trust and help law enforcement. <p>The recommendations were released in March; they were finalized today. They include everything from enhanced officer training to improving the use of body cameras and other technologies to make sure that police departments are being smart about crime and that there's enough data for them to be accountable as well. <p>And we're trying to support the great work that's happening at the local level where cities are already responding to these recommendations. And before I go further, I just want the members of our Task Force to stand, because they've done some outstanding work, and they deserve to be acknowledged. Thank you. <p>Now, we've launched a Police Data Initiative that's helping Camden and other innovative cities use data to strengthen their work and hold themselves accountable by sharing it with the public. Departments might track things like incidents of force so that they can identify and handle problems that could otherwise escalate. <p>Here in Camden, officers deal with some 41 different data systems, which means they have to enter the same information multiple times. So today we've brought a volunteer, elite tech team to help: a group of data scientists and software engineers and tech leaders. They're going to work with the police department here to troubleshoot some of the technical challenges so it's even easier for police departments to do the things they already want to do in helping to track what's going on in communities, and then also helping to make sure that that data is used effectively to identify where there are trouble spots, where there are problems, are there particular officers that may need additional help, additional training. All that can be obtained in a really effective, efficient way. <p>Today we're also releasing new policies on the military-style equipment that the Federal Government has in the past provided to State and local law enforcement agencies. We've seen how militarized gear can sometimes give people a feeling like there's an occupying force, as opposed to a force that's part of the community that's protecting them and serving them. It can alienate and intimidate local residents and send the wrong message. So we're going to prohibit some equipment made for the battlefield that is not appropriate for local police departments. There is other equipment that may be needed in certain cases, but only with proper training. So we're going to ensure that departments have what they need, but also that they have the training to use it. <p>And we're doing these things because we're listening to what law enforcement is telling us. The overwhelming majority of police officers are good and honest and fair. They care deeply about their communities. They put their lives on the line every day to keep them safe. Their loved ones wait and worry until they come through the door at the end of their shift. So we should do everything in our power to make sure that they are safe and help them do the job the best they can. <p>And what's interesting about what Chief Thomson has done and what's happening here in Camden is these new officers&mdash;who I have to confess made me feel old&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;because they all look like they could still be in school. [<i>Laughter</i>] The approach that the Chief has taken&mdash;in getting them out of their squad cars, into the communities, getting them familiar with the people that they're serving&mdash;they're enjoying their jobs more because they feel as if, over time, they can have more of an impact, and they're getting more help from the community because the community has seen them and knows them before there's a crisis, before there's an incident. <p>So it's not just crisis response. It's not after the fact: There's a crime, there's a dead body, there's a shooting, and now we're going to show up. It's, we're here all the time, and hopefully, we can prevent those shootings from happening in the first place. <p>But one of the things I also want to focus on is the fact that a lot of the issues that have been raised here, and in places like Baltimore and Ferguson and New York, goes beyond policing. We can't ask the police to contain and control problems that the rest of us aren't willing to face or do anything about. <p>If we as a society don't do more to expand opportunity to everybody who's willing to work for it, then we'll end up seeing conflicts between law enforcement and residents. If we as a society aren't willing to deal honestly with issue of race, then we can't just expect police departments to solve these problems. If communities are being isolated and segregated, without opportunity and without investment and without jobs, if we politicians are simply ramping up long sentences for nonviolent drug crimes that end up devastating communities, we can't then ask the police to be the ones to solve the problem when there are no able-bodied men in a community or kids are growing up without intact households. <p>We can't just focus on the problems when there's a disturbance and then cable TV runs it for 2 or 3 or 4 days and then suddenly we forget it&mdash;about it again, until the next time. Communities like some poor communities in Camden or my hometown in Chicago, they're part of America too. The kids who grow up here, they're America's children. Just like children everyplace else, they've got hopes, and they've got dreams, and they've got potential. And if we're not investing in them, no matter how good Chief Thomson and the police are doing, these kids are still going to be challenged. So we've all got to step up. We've all got to care about what happens. <p>Chief Thomson will tell you that his officers read to young children in the communities not just to build positive relationships, but because it's in the interests of the community to make sure these kids can read so they can stay in school and graduate ready for college and careers and become productive members of society. That's in his interest not just as a police chief, but also as a citizen of this country and somebody who grew up in this area and, knows this area. <p>And that's why we've partnered with cities and States to get tens of thousands more kids access to quality early childhood education. No matter who they are or where they're born, they should get a good start in life. <p>That's why we've partnered with cities, including Camden, to create what we call Promise Zones, where all-hands-on-deck efforts to change the odds for communities start happening because we're providing job training and helping to reduce violence and expanding affordable housing. <p>It's why we're ready to work with folks from both sides of the aisle to reform our criminal justice system. We all want safety, and we all know how pernicious the drug culture can be in undermining communities. But this massive trend toward incarceration even of nonviolent drug offenders and the costs of that trend are crowding out other critical investments that we can make in public safety. If we're spending a whole lot of money on prisons and we don't have computers or books or enough teachers or sports or music programs in our schools, we are being counterproductive. It's not a good strategy. <p>And so in addition to the work we're doing directly on the criminal justice front, we're also launching something that we call \\"My Brother's Keeper,\\" an initiative to ensure that all young people, but with a particular focus on young men of color, have a chance to go as far as their dreams will take them. Over the coming weeks, members of my Cabinet will be traveling around the country to highlight communities that are doing great work to improve the lives of their residents. <p>We know these problems are solvable. We know that we're not lacking for answers, we're just lacking political will. We have to see these problems for what they are: not something that's happening to&mdash;in some other city to some other people, but something that's happening in our community, the community of America. <p>And we know that change is possible because we've seen it in places like this. We've seen it, thanks to people like Officer Virginia Matias. Where is Virginia? There she is right there. So earlier this year, Vice President Biden and I got to sit with Officer Matias and rank-and-file law enforcement officers from around the country. And Virginia was talking about how when she was growing up in East Camden, crime was so bad she wasn't allowed to go to the store alone. Her mom was once robbed at gunpoint. When she was 17, her uncle was shot and killed in his own store. Instead of turning away from Camden, she decided she wanted to become a cop where she grew up to help the community that she loved. And today, she is a proud member of the Camden County Police Department. <p>And she's a constant presence in the community, getting to know everybody she passes on her beat, even volunteering in a kindergarten. Officer Matias isn't just helping to keep her community safe, she's also a role model for young people of Camden. And anybody who thinks that things aren't getting better, she says, \\"I see kids playing outside, riding bikes in the neighborhood, on their porches having a conversation. That's how I measure change.\\" <p>And that's how we should all measure change. I had a chance to meet with some of the young people here who participated in a little roundtable with the officers, and they're extraordinary young people. And they've got hopes and dreams just like Malia and Sasha, and they're overcoming some bigger barriers than my children ever had to go through or I had to go through. And they're strong, and they're focused. But in talking to them, some of them&mdash;the reason they've been able to make it and do well is because their parents don't let them out outside. Well, you know what, children shouldn't have to be locked indoors in order to be safe. That's not right. Some of them still have concerns about friends of theirs that have taken a wrong path and got involved in the streets and drugs. That's not the environment we need our kids to be growing up in. <p>I challenge everybody to get to know some of these young people. They're outstanding, and they're going to do great things in their lives. But the point is, is that they shouldn't have to go through superhuman efforts just to be able to stay in school and go to college and achieve their promise. That should be the norm. That should be standard. And if it isn't, we're not doing something right. We as a society are not doing something right if it isn't. <p>So, ultimately, that's how we're going to measure change: rising prospects for our kids, rising prospects for the neighborhood. Do our children feel safe on the streets? Do they feel cared for by their community? Do they feel like the police departments care about them? Do they feel as if they&mdash;when they work hard they can succeed? Do they feel like the country is making an investment in them? Do they see role models for success? Are there pathways to jobs that they can identify? Do they know that if they put in effort, they can make it? Are they going to be treated fairly regardless of the color of their skin or what their last name is? <p>It's pretty basic. I travel around the country. The one thing that makes me always so optimistic is our children. And what you realize is everywhere, kids are kids. [<i>Laughter</i>] Sometimes, they'll drive you crazy. [<i>Laughter</i>] They'll make mistakes. But there's an inherent goodness in them. They want to do the right thing. They just need to be given a chance. <p>And some of them aren't going to be lucky enough to have the structures at home that they need, in which case, then, we all have to pick up the slack. And if we do, they'll respond. They will. But we've got to feel like that they're our kids. We've got to see our children in them, in their eyes. And we haven't done enough of that. But we can. <p>This is a moment of great promise; this is a moment of great hope. And if we're seeing such extraordinary improvement in Camden because of the good efforts of a lot of elected officials and an outstanding police chief and some wonderful police officers and a community that's supportive and nonprofit organizations like Salvation Army and others that are doing some great work&mdash;if it's working here, it can work anywhere. [<i>Applause</i>] It can work anywhere. <p>On the City Hall of Camden, you got an inscription by Walt Whitman: \\"In a dream, I saw a city invincible.\\" In a dream, I see a country invincible, if we care enough to make the effort on behalf of every child in this country. Camden is showing that it can be done. I want America to show everybody around the world that it can be done. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you.\" "
"119" "\"Well, as some of you aware, several weeks ago, we lost two of New York's finest, Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu. They were serving their community with great honor and dedication and courage. And all of New York grieved, and all of the Nation grieved. It was a reminder of the incredibly difficult and dangerous work that so many of our law enforcement officers are engaged in every single day. <p>I had a chance to meet the families of Officers Ramos and Liu at the memorial that we did just a few days ago. But it's important for us not only to honor their memory, it's also important for us to make sure that we do everything we can to help ensure the safety of our police officers when they're in the line of duty. <p>And this legislation, which has been sponsored on a bipartisan basis by people like Senators Cardin and Representatives Reichert and Pascrell, represent, I think, the best of a bipartisan support for law enforcement. What this legislation is going to do is to initiate a Blue Alert System so that when we know there is an active threat against law enforcement, that the alerts are going out at a comprehensive, expeditious way. That prevents the possibility that other officers may be caught by surprise, and it ensures that appropriate steps can be taken as quickly as possible. <p>So I want to again thank the Members of Congress who have come together to put this legislation in place. Most of all, I want to thank the families who obviously are still grieving from a terrible tragedy, but have worked hard to make sure that it is translated into something concrete. <p>And we're very proud of them. I'm particularly proud of the children here, these young men who, I think, are obviously grief stricken, but we know they're going to do a great job looking after their mom moving forward. <p>So with that, what I'd like to do is sign the legislation. <p>[<i>At this point, the President signed the bill.</i>] <p>Done. Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"120" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you very much. Everybody, please have a seat. Class of 2015: Ahoy! <p><i>Audience members.</i> Ahoy! [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> There are now fewer days to go until the class of 2015 graduates than&mdash;never mind. [<i>Laughter</i>] There are now zero days until the class of 2015 graduates. <p>Thank you, Admiral Zukunft, for your kind introduction and for your leadership of our coastguardsmen on all seven continents; Governor Malloy, Secretary Johnson, Ambassador, distinguished guests, faculty and staff, families and friends. <p>And Admiral Stosz, as you prepare to conclude your time as Superintendent, thank you for your outstanding stewardship of this Academy. You made history as the first woman ever to lead one of our Nation's service academies. And I know you'll keep making history, because I was proud to nominate you for your third star and as the Coast Guard's next Deputy Commandant for Mission Support. <p>It is wonderful to be with all of you here today on this beautiful day. Michelle sends her greetings as well. She is the proud sponsor of the Coast Guard cutter <i>Stratton,</i> which is tough to beat. But as Admiral Zukunft pointed out, both the Coast Guard and I were born on the same day. So I want you all to know, every birthday from now on, I will be thinking about the Coast Guard. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, the Coast Guard may be the smallest of our services, but I have to say, you may also be the loudest. [<i>Laughter</i>] Whenever I visit our military bases, there are always lots of soldiers and sailors and airmen and marines. They make a lot of noise. But wherever I am, across the country or around the world, including Afghanistan&mdash;nowhere near an ocean&mdash;the most determined cheer from the crowd comes from our proud coastguardsmen, because usually, there might only be one or two of them. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And as Paul mentioned, in my State of the Union Address this year, I mentioned how I've seen America at its best when commissioning our new officers, including here in New London. And it's true, some folks across the country didn't quite get the reference. One person tweeted that they were pretty sure I just made this up. And then there was one person in town who asked, \\"Did Obama name drop New London?\\" So let me do it again. It is a great honor to be back in New London, at the United States Coast Guard Academy, to salute the newest ensigns of America's oldest continuous maritime service. <p>Cadets, this is a day to celebrate all that you've achieved over these past 4 years. You have excelled at one of the most selective and rigorous academic institutions in America. You've held yourselves to a high code of conduct, proven yourself worthy to be called commissioned officers of the United States Coast Guard. <p>You pushed yourselves physically, from Swab Summer to beating your officers at basketball and softball and football. [<i>Laughter</i>] You braced up, squared your meals, spent Friday nights waxing the floors, maybe a little \\"Rodeo Buffing.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] I saw the video. That looks dangerous, by the way. [<i>Laughter</i>] You made your mark, and you will be remembered: in Chase Hall, in this stadium, and at Hanafin's and Bulkeley House. Which reminds me, in keeping with longstanding tradition, I hereby absolve all cadets serving restrictions for minor offenses. [<i>Laughter</i>] Minor offenses. <p>You came together as one team. We are joined today by Commander Merle Smith, the first African American graduate of this Academy, class of 1966, a decorated Vietnam veteran. His legacy endures in all of you, because the graduating class of 2015 is the most diverse in Academy history. And you took care of each other, like family. Today we honor the memory of your classmate from the Republic of Georgia, Soso, along with Beso. Their spirits will live on in the partnerships you forge with coast guards all over the world. <p>Today you take your rightful place in the Long Blue Line. For Marina Stevens and her family, it is a very long line. Where is Marina? Just wave at me real quick. There she is right there. Marina's dad is Coast Guard civilian. Her mom Janet, an Academy graduate, was a Coast Guard captain and will pin on Marina's shoulder boards today. Marina's grandfather was a coastguardsman. Her great-grandfather joined the U.S. Lighthouse Service in 1918. That's four generations, spanning nearly the entire life of the modern Coast Guard. No wonder she's named Marina. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's in her blood. <p>And, cadets, I know that none of you reached this day alone. So join me in giving a huge round of applause to your mentors and your incredible parents and your family members, so many of them, themselves, veterans as well. Please give them a big round of applause. <p>Class of 2015, I'm here as your Commander in Chief, on behalf of the American people, to say thanks to each of you. Thanks for choosing to serve, for stepping up, for giving up the comforts of civilian life, for putting on that uniform. Thank you for the service you are about to render, the life of purpose that you've embraced, the risks that you've accepted, and the sacrifices that you will make. <p>But I'm not here to just sing your praises. I want to speak to you about what comes next. Soon, you'll fan out across the Coast Guard, and some of you will go to sectors and shore command. Some of you will start your duty aboard cutters. Some of you will start flight training. America needs you. And we need the Coast Guard more than ever. <p>We need you to safeguard our ports against all threats, including terrorism. We need you to respond in times of disaster or distress and lead your rescue teams as they jump out of perfectly good helicopters. We need you in the Caribbean and Central America, interdicting drugs before they reach our streets and damage our kids. We need you in the Middle East, in the Gulf, alongside our Navy; in places like West Africa, where you helped to keep the ports open so that the world could fight a deadly disease. We need you in the Asia-Pacific, to help our partners train their own coast guards to uphold maritime security and freedom of navigation in waters vital to our global economy. <p>These are all demanding missions. The pace of operations is intense. And these are tight fiscal times for all our services, including the Coast Guard. But we are going to keep working to give you the boats and the cutters and the aircraft that you need to complete the missions we ask of you. <p>We're moving ahead with new Fast Response Cutters, new Offshore Patrol Cutters. We're on track to have a full fleet of new National Security Cutters, the most advanced in history. And I've made it clear that I will not accept a budget that continues these draconian budget cuts called sequestration, because our Nation and our military and our Coast Guard deserve better. And this brings me to the challenge I want to focus on today, one where our coastguardsmen are already on the front lines and that, perhaps more than any other, will shape your entire careers, and that's the urgent need to combat and adapt to climate change. <p>As a nation, we face many challenges, including the grave threat of terrorism. And as Americans, we will always do everything in our power to protect our country. Yet even as we meet threats like terrorism, we cannot&mdash;and we must not&mdash;ignore a peril that can affect generations. <p>Now, I know there are still some folks back in Washington who refuse to admit that climate change is real. And on a day like today, it's hard to get too worried about it. There are folks who will equivocate. They'll say, \\"You know, I'm not a scientist.\\" Well, I'm not either. [<i>Laughter</i>] But the best scientists in the world know that climate change is happening. Our analysts in the intelligence community know climate change is happening. Our military leaders&mdash;generals and admirals, Active Duty and retired&mdash;know it's happening. Our homeland security professionals know it is happening. And our Coast Guard knows it's happening. <p>The science is indisputable. The fossil fuels we burn release carbon dioxide, which traps heat. And the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are now higher than they have been in 800,000 years. The planet is getting warmer. Fourteen of the 15 hottest years on record have been in the past 15 years. Last year was the planet's warmest year ever recorded. <p>Our scientists at NASA just reported that some of the sea ice around Antarctica is breaking up even faster than expected. The world's glaciers are melting, pouring new water into the ocean. Over the past century, the world sea level rose by about 8 inches. Now, that was in the last century; by the end of this century, it's projected to rise another 1 to 4 feet. <p>Cadets, the threat of a changing climate cuts to the very core of your service. You've been drawn to water, like the poet who wrote, \\"the heart of the great ocean sends a thrilling pulse through me.\\" You know the beauty of the sea, but you also know its unforgiving power. <p>Here at the Academy, climate change&mdash;understanding the science and the consequences&mdash;is part of the curriculum, and rightly so, because it will affect everything that you do in your careers. Some of you have already served in Alaska and aboard icebreakers, and you know the effects. As America's Maritime Guardian, you've pledged to remain always ready&mdash;Semper Paratus&mdash;ready for all threats. And climate change is one of those most severe threats. <p>And this is not just a problem for countries on the coasts or for certain regions of the world. Climate change will impact every country on the planet. No nation is immune. So I'm here today to say that climate change constitutes a serious threat to global security, an immediate risk to our national security. And make no mistake, it will impact how our military defends our country. And so we need to act, and we need to act now. <p>After all, isn't that the true hallmark of leadership? When you're on deck, standing your watch, you stay vigilant. You plan for every contingency. And if you see storm clouds gathering, or dangerous shoals ahead, you don't sit back and do nothing. You take action, to protect your ship, to keep your crew safe. Anything less is negligence. It is a dereliction of duty. And so too with climate change. Denying it or refusing to deal with it endangers our national security. It undermines the readiness of our forces. <p>It's been said of life on the sea, \\"The pessimist complains about the wind, the optimist expects it to change; the realist adjusts the sails.\\" Cadets, like you, I reject pessimism. We know what we as Americans can achieve when we set ourselves to great endeavors. We are, by nature, optimists, but we're not blind optimists. We know that wishful thinking in the face of all evidence to the contrary would set us on a course for disaster. If we are to meet this threat of climate change, we must be realists. We have to readjust the sails. <p>And that's why confronting climate change is now a key pillar of American global leadership. When I meet with leaders around the world, it's often at the top of our agenda, a core element of our diplomacy. And you are part of the first generation of officers to begin your service in a world where the effects of climate change are so clearly upon us. It will shape how every one of our services plan, operate, train, equip, and protect their infrastructure, their capabilities, today and for the long term. So let me be specific on how your generation will have to lead the way: to both prepare ourselves and how to prevent the worst effects in the future. <p>Around the world, climate change increases the risk of instability and conflict. Rising seas are already swallowing low-lying lands, from Bangladesh to Pacific islands, forcing people from their homes. Caribbean islands and Central American coasts are vulnerable as well. Globally, we could see a rise in climate change refugees. And I guarantee you, the Coast Guard will have to respond. Elsewhere, more intense droughts will exacerbate shortages of water and food, increase competition for resources, and create the potential for mass migrations and new tensions. All of which is why the Pentagon calls climate change a \\"threat multiplier.\\" <p>Understand, climate change did not cause the conflicts we see around the world. Yet what we also know is that severe drought helped to create the instability in Nigeria that was exploited by the terrorist group Boko Haram. It's now believed that drought and crop failures and high food prices helped fuel the early unrest in Syria, which descended into civil war in the heart of the Middle East. So, increasingly, our military and our combatant commands, our services&mdash;including the Coast Guard&mdash;will need to factor climate change into plans and operations, because you need to be ready. <p>Around the world, climate change will mean more extreme storms. No single weather event can be blamed solely on climate change. But Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines gave us a possible glimpse of things to come: one of the worst cyclones ever recorded, thousands killed, many more displaced, billions of dollars in damage, and a massive international relief effort that included the United States military and its Coast Guard. So more extreme storms will mean more humanitarian missions to deliver lifesaving help. Our forces will have to be ready. <p>As Admiral Zukunft already mentioned, climate change means Arctic sea ice is vanishing faster than ever. By the middle of this century, Arctic summers could be essentially ice free. We're witnessing the birth of a new ocean: new sea lanes, more shipping, more exploration, more competition for the vast natural resources below. <p>In Alaska, we have more than 1,000 miles of Arctic coastline. The United States is an Arctic nation, and we have a great interest in making sure that the region is peaceful, that its indigenous people and environment are protected, and that its resources are managed responsibly in partnership with other nations. And that means all of you are going to have to step up, because few know the Arctic better than the U.S. Coast Guard. You've operated there across nearly 150 years. And as the Arctic opens, the role that the Coast Guard plays will only grow. I believe that our interests in the Arctic demand that we continue to invest in an enduring Coast Guard icebreaking capacity. I was proud to nominate your last Commandant, Admiral Papp, as our Special Representatives for the Arctic. And as the U.S. chairs the Arctic Council this year, I'm committed to advancing our interests in this critical region because we have to be ready in the Arctic as well. <p>Climate change, and especially rising seas, is a threat to our homeland security, our economic structure&mdash;infrastructure, the safety and health of the American people. Already, today, in Miami and Charleston, streets now flood at high tide. Along our coasts, thousands of miles of highways and roads, railways, energy facilities are all vulnerable. It's estimated that a further increase in sea level of just one foot by the end of this century could cost our Nation $200 billion. <p>In New York Harbor, the sea level is already a foot higher than a century ago, which was one of the reasons Superstorm Sandy put so much of lower Manhattan underwater. During Sandy, the Coast Guard mounted a heroic response, along with our National Guard and Reserve. But rising seas and stronger storms will mean more disaster response missions. And we need the Coast Guard to be ready, because you are America's maritime first responder. <p>Climate change poses a threat to the readiness of our forces. Many of our military installations are on the coast, including, of course, our Coast Guard stations. Around Norfolk, high tides and storms increasingly flood parts of our Navy base and an airbase. In Alaska, thawing permafrost is damaging military facilities. Out West, deeper droughts and longer wildfires could threaten training areas our troops depend on. <p>So politicians who say they care about military readiness ought to care about this as well. Just as we're helping American communities prepare to deal with the impacts of climate change, we have to help our bases and ports as well. Not just with stronger seawalls and natural barriers, but with smarter, more resilient infrastructure, because when the seas rise and storms come, we all have to be ready. <p>Now, everything I've discussed with you so far is about preparing for the impacts of climate change. But we need to be honest: Such preparation and adaptation alone will not be enough. As men and women in uniform, you know that it can be just as important, if not more important, to prevent threats before they can cause catastrophic harm. And the only way&mdash;the only way&mdash;the world is going to prevent the worst effects of climate change is to slow down the warming of the planet. <p>Some warming is now inevitable. But there comes a point when the worst effects will be irreversible. And time is running out. And we all know what needs to happen. It's no secret. The world has to finally start reducing its carbon emissions now. And that's why I've committed the United States to leading the world on this challenge. <p>Over the past 6 years, we've done more than ever to reduce harmful emissions: unprecedented investments to cut energy waste in our homes and buildings, standards to double the fuel efficiency of our vehicles. We're using more clean energy than ever before: more solar, more wind. It's all helped us reduce our carbon emissions more than any other advanced nation. And today, we can be proud that our carbon pollution is near its lowest levels in almost two decades. But we've got to do more. <p>So going forward, I've committed to doubling the pace at which we cut carbon pollution. And that means we all have to step up. And it will not be easy. It will require sacrifice, and the politics will be tough. But there is no other way. We have to make our homes and buildings more efficient. We have to invest in more energy research and renewable technologies. We have to move ahead with standards to cut the amount of carbon pollution in our power plants. And working with other nations, we have to achieve a strong global agreement this year to start reducing the total global emission, because every nation must do its part. Every nation. <p>So this will be tough. But as so often is the case, our men and women in uniform show us the way. They're used to sacrifice and they are used to doing hard stuff. Class of 2015, you've built new equipment that uses less energy. You've designed new vessels with fewer harmful emissions. Stephen Horvath, selected as a Fulbright Scholar, will research new technologies for renewable energies. The Coast Guard is building more fuel-efficient cutters. So you're already leading. And, cadets, as you go forward, I challenge you to keep imagining and building the new future we need and make your class motto your life's work: \\"To go where few dare.\\" This is a place where we need you. <p>Across our military, our bases and ports are using more solar and wind, which helps save money that we can use to improve readiness. The Army is pursuing new, lighter, more fuel-efficient vehicles. The Air Force F-22 broke the sound barrier using biofuels. And the Navy runs an entire carrier strike group, the Green Fleet, with biofuels. Our Marines have deployed to Afghanistan with portable solar panels, lightening their load and reducing dangerous resupply missions. So fighting climate change and using energy wisely also makes our forces more nimble and more ready. And that's something that should unite us as Americans. This cannot be subject to the usual politics and the usual rhetoric. When storms gather, we get ready. <p>And I want to leave you with a story that captures the persistence and the patriotism that this work requires, because this is a nation made up of folks who know how to do hard things. Down in the front row is Dr. Olivia Hooker. In 1921, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, when she was just 6 years old, her African American community was attacked by White mobs. It was a horrific racial incident. And hundreds of innocent African Americans were killed. The mobs destroyed her father's clothing store. They looted her house. They even burned the little clothes for her doll. <p>And Olivia could have given in to bitterness. She could have been pessimistic about her country. Instead, she made it better. So, in World War II, she enlisted as a SPAR, becoming the first African American woman in the Coast Guard. As a yeoman in Boston, she served with distinction. By the time the war was won, she was discharged, she was a petty officer second class. <p>With the GI bill, Olivia earned her master's, then her doctorate. She has been a professor and mentor to her students, a passionate advocate for Americans with disabilities, a psychologist counseling young children, a caregiver at the height of the AIDS epidemic, a tireless voice for justice and equality. And a few months ago, Olivia turned a hundred years old. <p>So, Olivia, you're going to have to tell us you're secret. She's still as sharp as they come, and as fearless. In Yonkers, New York, she even still volunteers as a member of the Coast Guard Auxiliary and was determined to be here with us today. So, Dr. Hooker, thank you. You're an inspiration. Hundred years old. So Dr. Hooker has led a remarkable life. But this is what she says: \\"It's not about you or me. It's about what we can give to this world.\\" <p>Cadets, you're at the start of your careers. And we cannot know, each of us, how many days we will walk this Earth. We can't guarantee we're all going to live to a hundred. But what we can do is live each day to its fullest. What we can do is look squarely at what will make the biggest difference for future generations and be willing to tackle those challenges. And as you embark on your life of service, as you man your stations and head to the seas and take to the skies, should the sea begin to surge and the waves swell and the wind blows hard against your face, I want you to think back to this moment, to feel what you feel in your hearts today. And if you remember all that you've learned here at the Thames, how you came here and came together, out of many one, to achieve as a team what you could never do alone; if you resolve to stay worthy of traditions that endure&mdash;honor, respect, devotion to duty; if you heed the wisdom and humility of a petty officer second class from Oklahoma, to think not of yourself, but what you can give to this world, then I'm confident that you will truly go where few dare. And you will rise to meet the challenges that not only face our country, but face our planet. And your legacy will be a nation that is stronger and safer for generations to come. <p>So, class of 2015, thank you for your service. Congratulations. God bless you. God bless all our coastguardsmen. God bless our United States of America. Thank you.\" "
"121" "\"Well, today I have the opportunity to welcome two of the newest members of our Cabinet who haven't had a chance to be at a Cabinet meeting before: our new Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter, and our new Attorney General, Loretta Lynch. And we want to give them a big round of applause. <p>Each of the men and women around this table have a very simple mission, although it's hard to execute, and that is, how do we make sure that we are continually expanding opportunity, prosperity, and security for the American people? The good news is, about halfway through 2015, we've already seen some significant progress. The unemployment rate is now at its lowest in almost 7 years. Our businesses created 3 million jobs over the past 12 months, nearly the fastest pace in over a decade. On the health care front, the uninsured rate has now fallen by the largest amount in four decades, even as health care inflation continues to be lower than it has been in a very long time. <p>So our work is paying off. But we've got to build on that progress. And our overarching goal remains the same, which is, how do we make sure everybody in this country gets opportunity? That means that we're going to keep fighting to make sure that community colleges are as free and as universal as high school. It means we're going to go after issues of poverty and inequality, both urban and rural. It means that we're going to continue to expand on our job training agenda and our apprenticeship agenda so that people of all ages have the skills that they need to succeed in this economy. <p>It means we're going to continue to go after ISIL, get a strong deal that prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. And as part of our agenda for middle class economics, it means that we're going to continue to pursue strong trade agreements that benefit American workers and American businesses. <p>And I want to thank the bipartisan group of Senators who took a big step forward this morning on the trade agenda that is consistent with strong labor standards, strong environmental standards, and is going to open up access to markets that too often are closed even as these other countries are selling goods here in the United States. It's an agenda that's good for U.S. businesses, but most importantly, good for American workers. <p>So we've got a lot to do over the next year and a half. We're going to run through the tape. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I'm going to be hearing from everybody around this table in terms of how we are going to make sure that all of our agencies are working on all cylinders to accomplish these goals. All right? <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"122" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you so much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Well, good morning, everybody! <p><i>Audience members.</i> Good morning! <p><i>The President.</i> A slightly early shabbat shalom. [<i>Laughter</i>] I want to thank Rabbi Steinlauf for the very kind introduction. And to all the members of the congregation, thank you so much for such an extraordinary and warm welcome. <p>I want to thank a couple of outstanding Members of Congress who are here. Senators Michael Bennet&mdash;where did Michael Bennet go? There he is. And Representative Sandy Levin, who is here. I want to thank our Special Envoy To Combat Anti-Semitism, Ira Forman, for his important work. There he is. But as I said, most of all I want to thank the entire congregation of Adas Israel for having me here today. <p>Earlier this week, I was actually interviewed by one of your members, Jeff Goldberg. And Jeff reminded me that he once called me \\"the first Jewish President.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, since some people still seem to be wondering about my faith&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I should make clear, this was an honorary title. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I was flattered. <p>And as an honorary member of the tribe&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;not to mention somebody who's hosted seven White House seders and been advised by two Jewish chiefs of staff, I can also proudly say that I'm getting a little bit of the hang of the lingo. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I will not use any of the Yiddish-isms that Rahm Emanuel taught me because&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I want to be invited back. [<i>Laughter</i>] Let's just say he had some creative new synonyms for \\"<i>shalom</i>.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, I wanted to come here to celebrate Jewish American Heritage Month because this congregation, like so many around the country, helps us to tell the American story. And back in 1876, when President Grant helped dedicate Adas Israel, he became the first sitting President in history to attend a synagogue service. And at the time, it was an extraordinarily symbolic gesture, not just for America, but for the world. <p>And think about the landscape of Jewish history. Tomorrow night the holiday of Shavuot marks the moment that Moses received the Torah at Mount Sinai, the first link in a chain of tradition that stretches back thousands of years and a foundation stone for our civilization. Yet, for most of those years, Jews were persecuted, not embraced, by those in power. Many of your ancestors came here fleeing that persecution. <p>The United States could have been merely another destination in that ongoing diaspora. But those who came here found that America was more than just a country, America was an idea. America stood for something. As George Washington wrote to the Jews of Newport, Rhode Island: The United States \\"gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance.\\" <p>It's important for us to acknowledge that too often in our history, we fell short of those lofty ideals: in the legal subjugation of African Americans through slavery and Jim Crow, the treatment of Native Americans. And far too often, American Jews faced the scourge of anti-Semitism here at home. But our founding documents gave us a north star, our Bill of Rights; our system of government gave us a capacity for change. And where other nations actively and legally might persecute or discriminate against those of different faiths, this Nation was called upon to see all of us as equal before the eyes of the law. When other countries treated their own citizens as \\"wretched refuse,\\" we lifted up our lamp beside the golden door and welcomed them in. Our country is immeasurably stronger because we did. <p>From Einstein to Brandeis, from Jonas Salk to Betty Friedan, American Jews have made contributions to this country that have shaped it in every aspect. And as a community, American Jews have helped make our Union more perfect. The story of Exodus inspired oppressed peoples around the world in their own struggles for civil rights. From the founding members of the NAACP to a freedom summer in Mississippi, from women's rights to gay rights to workers' rights, Jews took the heart of Biblical edict that we must not oppress a stranger, having been strangers once ourselves. <p>Earlier this year, when we marked the 50th anniversary of the march in Selma, we remembered the iconic images of Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel marching with Dr. King, praying with his feet. And to some, it must have seemed strange that a rabbi from Warsaw would take such great risks to stand with a Baptist preacher from Atlanta. But Heschel explained that their cause was one and the same. In his essay, \\"No Religion Is an Island,\\" he wrote, \\"We must choose between interfaith and internihilism.\\" Between a shared hope that says together we can shape a brighter future or a shared cynicism that says our world is simply beyond repair. <p>So the heritage we celebrate this month is a testament to the power of hope. Me standing here before you, all of you in this incredible congregation, is a testament to the power of hope. It's a rebuke to cynicism. It's a rebuke to nihilism. And it inspires us to have faith that our future, like our past, will be shaped by the values that we share. At home, those values compel us to work to keep alive the American Dream of opportunity for all. It means that we care about issues that affect all children, not just our own; that we're prepared to invest in early childhood education; that we are concerned about making college affordable; that we want to create communities where if you're willing to work hard, you can get ahead the way so many who fled and arrived on these shores were able to get ahead. Around the world, those values compel us to redouble our efforts to protect our planet and to protect the human rights of all who share this planet. <p>It's particularly important to remember now, given the tumult that is taking place in so many corners of the globe, in one of the world's most dangerous neighborhoods, those shared values compel us to reaffirm that our enduring friendship with the people of Israel and our unbreakable bonds with the State of Israel&mdash;that those bonds, that friendship cannot be broken. Those values compel us to say that our commitment to Israel's security&mdash;and my commitment to Israel's security&mdash;is and always will be unshakeable. <p>And I've said this before: It would be a moral failing on the part of the U.S. Government and the American people, it would be a moral failing on my part, if we did not stand up firmly, steadfastly not just on behalf of Israel's right to exist, but its right to thrive and prosper. Because it would ignore the history that brought the State of Israel about. It would ignore the struggle that's taken place through millennia to try to affirm the kinds of values that say everybody has a place, everybody has rights, everybody is a child of God. <p>As many of you know, I've visited the houses hit by rocket fire in Sderot. I've been to Yad Vashem and made that solemn vow: \\"Never forget. Never again.\\" When someone threatens Israel's citizens or its very right to exist, Israelis necessarily take that seriously, and so do I. Today, the military and intelligence cooperation between our two countries is stronger than ever. Our support of the Iron Dome's rocket system has saved Israeli lives. And I can say that no U.S. President, no administration has done more to ensure that Israel can protect itself than this one. <p>As part of that commitment, there's something else that the United States and Israel agrees on: Iran must not, under any circumstances, be allowed to get a nuclear weapon. Now, there's a debate about how to achieve that, and that's a healthy debate. And I'm not going to use my remaining time to go too deep into policy&mdash;although, for those of you who are interested&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;we have a lot of material out there. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I do want everybody to just remember a few key things. <p>The deal that we already reached with Iran has already halted or rolled back parts of Iran's nuclear program. Now we're seeking a comprehensive solution. I will not accept a bad deal. As I pointed out in my most recent article with Jeff Goldberg, this deal will have my name on it, so nobody has a bigger personal stake in making sure that it delivers on its promise. I want a good deal. <p>I'm interested in a deal that blocks every single one of Iran's pathways to a nuclear weapon&mdash;every single path. A deal that imposes unprecedented inspections on all elements of Iran's nuclear program so that they can't cheat and if they try to cheat, we will immediately know about it and sanctions snap back on. A deal that endures beyond a decade; that addresses this challenge for the long term. In other words, a deal that makes the world and the region&mdash;including Israel&mdash;more secure. That's how I define a good deal. <p>Now, I can't stand here today and guarantee an agreement will be reached. We're hopeful. We're working hard. But nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. And I've made clear that when it comes to preventing Iran from get getting a nuclear weapon, all options are and will remain on the table. <p>Moreover, even if we do get a good deal, there remains the broader issue of Iran's support for terrorism and regional destabilization and ugly threats against Israel. And that's why our strategic partnership with Israel will remain, no matter what happens in the days and years ahead. And that's why the people of Israel must always know: America has its back, and America will always have its back. <p>Now, that does not mean that there will not be, or should not be, periodic disagreements between our two governments. There will be disagreements on tactics when it comes to how to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and that is entirely appropriate and should be fully aired. Because the stakes are sufficiently high that anything that's proposed has to be subjected to scrutiny, and I welcome that scrutiny. <p>But there are also going to be some disagreements rooted in shared history that go beyond tactics, that are rooted in how we might remain true to our shared values. I came to know Israel as a young man through these incredible images of kibbutzim and Moshe Dayan and Golda Meir and Israel overcoming incredible odds in the '67 war. The notion of pioneers who set out not only to safeguard a nation, but to remake the world; not only to make the desert bloom, but to allow their values to flourish, to ensure that the best of Judaism would thrive. And those values in many ways came to be my own values. They believed the story of their people gave them a unique perspective among the nations of the world, a unique moral authority and responsibility that comes from having once been a stranger yourself. And to a young man like me, grappling with his own identity, recognizing the scars of race here in this Nation, inspired by the civil rights struggle, the idea that you could be grounded in your history, as Israel was, but not be trapped by it, to be able to repair the world, that idea was liberating. The example of Israel and its values was inspiring. <p>So when I hear some people say that disagreements over policy belie a general lack of support of Israel, I must object, and I object forcefully. For us to paper over difficult questions, particularly about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or about settlement policy, that's not a true measure of friendship. <p>Before I came out here, the Rabbi showed me the room that's been built to promote scholarship and dialogue and to be able to find how we make our shared values live. And the reason you have that room is because applying those values to our lives is often hard and involves difficult choices. That's why we study. That's why it's not just a formula. And that's what we have to do as nations as well as individuals. We have to grapple and struggle with how do we apply the values that we care about to this very challenging and dangerous world. <p>And it is precisely because I care so deeply about the State of Israel&mdash;it's precisely because, yes, I have high expectations for Israel the same way I have high expectations for the United States of America&mdash;that I feel a responsibility to speak out honestly about what I think will lead to long-term security and to the preservation of a true democracy in the Jewish homeland. And I believe that's two states for two peoples, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security. Just as Israelis built a state in their homeland, Palestinians have a right to be a free people on their land as well. <p>Now, I want to emphasize, that's not easy. [<i>Laughter</i>] The Palestinians are not the easiest of partners. [<i>Laughter</i>] The neighborhood is dangerous. And we cannot expect Israel to take existential risks with their security, so that any deal that takes place has to take into account the genuine dangers of terrorism and hostility. <p>But it is worthwhile for us to keep up the prospect, the possibility of bridging divides and being just and looking squarely at what's possible, but also necessary in order for Israel to be the type of nation that it was intended to be in its earliest founding. <p>And that same sense of shared values also compel me to speak out&mdash;compel all of us to speak out&mdash;against the scourge of anti-Semitism wherever it exists. I want to be clear that, to me, all these things are connected. The rights I insist upon and now fight for, for all people here in the United States compels me then to stand up for Israel and look out for the rights of the Jewish people. And the rights of the Jewish people then compel me to think about a Palestinian child in Ramallah that feels trapped without opportunity. That's what Jewish values teach me. That's what the Judeo-Christian tradition teaches me. These things are connected. <p>And in recent years, we've seen a deeply disturbing rise in anti-Semitism in parts of the world where it would have seemed unthinkable just a few years or decades ago. This is not some passing fad; these aren't just isolated phenomena. And we know from our history they cannot be ignored. Anti-Semitism is, and always will be, a threat to broader human values to which we all must aspire. And when we allow anti-Semitism to take root, then our souls are destroyed, and it will spread. <p>And that's why, tonight, for the first time ever, congregations around the world are celebrating a Solidarity Shabbat. It's a chance for leaders to publicly stand against anti-Semitism and bigotry in all of its forms. And I'm proud to be a part of this movement, and I'm proud that six Ambassadors from Europe are joining us today. And their presence here&mdash;our presence together&mdash;is a reminder that we are not doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. Our traditions, our history, can help us chart a better course as long as we are mindful of that history and those traditions, and we are vigilant in speaking out and standing up against what is wrong. It's not always easy, I think, to speak out against what is wrong, even for good people. <p>So I want to close with the story of one more of the many rabbis who came to Selma 50 years ago. A few days after David Teitelbaum arrived to join the protests, he and a colleague were thrown in jail. And they spent a Friday night in custody, singing <i>Adon Olam</i> to the tune of \\"We Shall Overcome.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] And that in and of itself is a profound statement of faith and hope. But what's wonderful is, is that out of respect many of their fellow protestors began wearing what they called \\"freedom caps\\"&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;yarmulkes&mdash;as they marched. <p>And the day after they were released from prison, Rabbi Teitelbaum watched Dr. King lead a prayer meeting before crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge. And Dr. King said, \\"We are like the children of Israel, marching from slavery to freedom.\\" <p>That's what happens when we're true to our values. It's not just good for us, but it brings the community together&mdash;<i>tikkun olam</i>&mdash;it brings the community together, and it helps repair the world. It bridges differences that once looked unbridgeable. It creates a future for our children that once seemed unattainable. This congregation, Jewish American life is a testimony to the capacity to make our values live. But it requires courage. It requires strength. It requires that we speak the truth not just when it's easy, but when it's hard. <p>So may we always remember that our shared heritage makes us stronger, that our roots are intertwined. May we always choose faith over nihilism, and courage over despair, and hope over cynicism and fear. As we walk our own leg of a timeless, sacred march, may we always stand together, here at home and around the world. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you.\" "
"123" "\"Hi, everybody. This weekend is Memorial Day, a time to pay tribute to all our men and women in uniform who've ever given their lives so that we can live in freedom and security. This year, the holiday is especially meaningful. It's the first Memorial Day since our war ended in Afghanistan. <p>On Monday, at Arlington Cemetery, I'll join our Gold Star families, veterans, and their loved ones to remember all our fallen heroes, including the more than 2,200 American patriots who gave their lives in Afghanistan. And I plan to share a few of their stories. <p>Growing up in Arizona, Wyatt Martin loved the outdoors. To him, a great day was a day spent fishing. After high school, he enlisted in the Army because he believed that the blessings he enjoyed as an American came with an obligation to give back to his country. <p>Ramon Morris was born in Jamaica and as a teenager came to Queens. Like so many proud immigrants, he felt a calling to serve his new country and joined the Army. He fell in love, got engaged, and the thing he wanted most was to make the world safer for his 3-year-old daughter. <p>In their lives, Specialist Wyatt Martin and Sergeant First Class Ramon Morris traveled different paths. But in December, their paths intersected as the final two Americans to give their lives during our combat mission in Afghanistan. <p>This weekend also reminds us that, around the world, our men and women in uniform continue to serve and risk their lives. In Afghanistan, our troops now have a new mission: training and advising Afghan forces. John Dawson was one of them. From Massachusetts, he loved the Bruins and the Pats. In April, he gave his life as an Army combat medic, the first American to give his life in this new mission. This Memorial Day, we'll honor Corporal Dawson as well. <p>Like generations of heroes before them, these Americans gave everything they had, not for glory, not even for gratitude, but for something greater than themselves. We cannot bring them back. Nor can we ease the pain of their families and friends who live with their loss. <p>But we are the Americans they died to defend. So what we can do&mdash;what we must do&mdash;is fulfill our sacred obligations to them, just like they fulfilled theirs to us. We have to honor their memory. We have to care for their families and our veterans who served with them. And as a nation, we have to remain worthy of their sacrifice, forever committed to the country they loved and the freedom they fought for and died for. <p>Thank you, and have a wonderful weekend. And may God bless our fallen heroes and their families.\" "
"124" "\"<i>The President</i>. Good morning, everybody. <p><i>Audience members</i>. Good morning. <p><i>The President</i>. Thank you, Secretary Carter, for your leadership of our men and women in uniform; General Dempsey; Major General Buchanan; Mr. Patrick Hallinan, Executive Director of Army National Military Cemeteries; Chaplain Studniewski; members of our Armed Services, veterans, and most of all, families and friends of our fallen: It is my deep honor to share this day with you again. <p>For 147 years, our Nation has set aside this day to pay solemn tribute to patriots who gave their last full measure of devotion for this country that we love. And while the nature of war has changed over that time, the values that drive our brave men and women in uniform remain constant: honor, courage, selflessness. Those values lived in the hearts of everyday heroes who risked everything for us in every American war, men and women who now rest forever in these quiet fields and across our land. <p>They lived in the patriots who sparked a revolution and who saved our Union. They lived in the young GIs who defeated tyranny in Europe and the Pacific. And this year, we mark a historic anniversary: 70 years since our victory in World War II. More than 16 million Americans left everything they knew to fight for our freedom. More than 400,000 gave their lives. And today I ask all the family and friends of our fallen World War II heroes&mdash;spouses, children, brothers and sisters, and fellow veterans of World War II&mdash;to please stand if you can, or raise your hand so that our country can thank you once more. <p>These same values lived in those who braved the mountains of Korea, the jungles of Vietnam, the deserts of the Middle East. And in the past decade, we've seen these values on display again in the men and women of our 9/11 generation. <p>For many of us, this Memorial Day is especially meaningful; it is the first since our war in Afghanistan came to an end. Today is the first Memorial Day in 14 years that the United States is not engaged in a major ground war. So on this day, we honor the sacrifice of the thousands of American servicemembers&mdash;men and women&mdash;who gave their lives since 9/11, including more than 2,200 American patriots who made the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan. <p>As an Arizona kid, Wyatt Martin loved the outdoors. He started fishing when he was 2 years old. His dad says he was pretty good for a toddler. Wyatt grew to 6-foot-4, became a hunter, and wore flannel shirts every day, so his friends nicknamed him Paul Bunyan. He planned to go to college and work in the Arizona Game and Fish Department so that he could protect the land and waters he loved so much. <p>Wyatt's life was animated by the belief that the blessings that he and his family enjoyed as Americans came with an obligation to give back, an obligation to serve. So before he pursued his dream of being a good steward of the great outdoors, he enlisted in the Army. And when he deployed to Afghanistan as a combat engineer, there was no doubt in his mind that he was doing the right thing. Last summer, Wyatt told his sister, \\"If something happens to me, know that I went happy.\\" Ramon Morris was born in Jamaica, moved to Queens as a teenager. And like so many proud immigrants, he was called&mdash;compelled&mdash;to serve his new country. He too enlisted in the Army, and he even recruited his older brother Marlon to join as well. He served five tours, including several in Iraq. Along the way, he fell in love with an Army Reservist named Christina. And they had a little girl and named her Ariana. Ramon was the kind of leader who would do anything for his men, on and off the battlefield. But nothing was more important to him than being a great father to his little girl. <p>Now, Specialist Wyatt Martin and Sergeant First Class Ramon Morris were 15 years apart in age. They traveled greatly different paths in life. But those paths took them to the same unit. Those paths made them brothers-in-arms, serving together in Afghanistan. In December, an IED struck their vehicle. They were the last two Americans to give their lives during our combat mission in Afghanistan. Today, here in Arlington, in Section 60, Ramon lies in eternal rest. And we are honored to be joined by his brother, Sergeant First Class Marlon Laidley, who is deploying for Germany tonight. Thank you, Marlon. Thank you to your family. <p>These two men, these two heroes, if you saw them passing on the street, you wouldn't have known they were brothers. But under this flag, in common cause, they were bonded together to secure our liberty, to keep us safe. <p>My fellow Americans, this hallowed ground is more than the final resting place of heroes, it is a reflection of America itself. It's a reflection of our history, the wars we've waged for democracy, the peace we've laid to preserve it. It's a reflection of our diversity: men and women of all backgrounds, all races and creeds and circumstances and faiths, willing to defend and die for the ideals that bind us as one Nation. It's a reflection of our character, seen not only in those who are buried here, but also in the caretakers who watch over them and preserve this sacred place, and in the Sentinels of the Third Infantry Regiment who dutifully, unfailingly watch over those patriots known only to God, but never forgotten. Today a grateful nation thanks them as well. <p>Most Americans don't fully see, don't fully understand the sacrifice made by the 1 percent who serve in this All-Volunteer Armed Forces, a sacrifice that preserves the freedoms we too often take for granted. Few know what it's like to take a bullet for a buddy or to live with the fact that he or she took one for you. But our Gold Star families, our military families, our veterans, they know this, intimately. <p>Whenever I meet with our Gold Star families, like I did this morning, I hear their pride through their tears, as they flip through old photos, run their fingers over shiny medals. I see that their hearts are still broken and yet still full of love. They do not ask for awards or honors. They do not ask for special treatment. They are unfailingly humble. In the face of unspeakable loss, they represent the best of who we are. <p>They're people like Ramon's mother, who could carry hate for the people who killed her son. But she says: \\"I have no anger, no bitterness, even for the person who did this. I feel sorry for them, and I ask God to change their hearts.\\" That's one Gold Star mother's amazing grace. <p>Folks like Wyatt's parents, Brian and Julie Martin, who said of their son: \\"He's not just our kid, he's everybody's. He's an American soldier. And as an American soldier, he belongs to everybody.\\" <p>They are siblings, like the Gold Star sister who wrote to me of her brother, Private First Class Stephen Benish, who gave his life in Iraq in 2004. She said, \\"Remember him not as the 1,253d war casualty, but the 6-foot-7 burst of light and positive influence he was on the world.\\" These sons and daughters, these brothers and sisters who lay down their lives for us, they belong to us all. They're our children too. We benefit from their light, their positive influence on the world. And it's our duty, our eternal obligation, to be there for them too: to make sure our troops always have what they need to carry out the mission, to make sure we care for all those who have served, to make sure we honor all those whom we have lost, to make sure we keep faith with our military families, to make sure we never stop searching for those who are missing or trying to bring home our prisoners of war. And we are grateful for the families of our POW/MIAs. <p>This may be the first Memorial Day since the end of our war in Afghanistan. But we are acutely aware, as we speak, our men and women in uniform still stand watch and still serve and still sacrifice around the world. <p>Several years ago, we had more than a hundred thousand troops in Afghanistan. Today, fewer than 10,000 troops remain on a mission to train and assist Afghan forces. We'll continue to bring them home and reduce our forces further, down to an Embassy presence by the end of next year. But Afghanistan remains a very dangerous place. And as so many families know, our troops continue to risk their lives for us. <p>Growing up in Massachusetts, John Dawson was an honor student who played varsity soccer, loved the Bruins, loved the Pats, was always up for fun, running into a room while spraying silly string, or photobombing long before it was in style. <p>John was passionate about service. He shared the same convictions of so many we honor today, who wanted nothing more than to join a common cause and be part of something bigger than himself. He channeled his love of cycling into charity bike rides with his church. He joined the Army. And as a combat medic, he fulfilled his dream of helping people. He loved his job. <p>In April, an attacker wearing an Afghan uniform fired at a group of American soldiers. And Army Corporal John Dawson became the first American servicemember to give his life to this new mission to train Afghan forces. The words on John's dog tag were those of Scripture: \\"Greater love has no other than this, than to lay down your life for your friends.\\" <p>The Americans who rest beneath these beautiful hills and in sacred ground across our country and around the world, they are why our Nation endures. Each simple stone marker, arranged in perfect military precision, signifies the cost of our blessings. It is a debt we can never fully repay, but it is a debt we will never stop trying to fully repay. By remaining a nation worthy of their sacrifice. By living our own lives the way the fallen lived theirs, a testament that \\"Greater love has no other than this, than to lay down your life for your friends.\\" <p>We are so grateful for them. We are so grateful for the families of our fallen. May God bless our fallen heroes and their families and all who serve. And may He continue to bless the United States of America.\" "
"125" "\"Well, I am here at the National Hurricane Center for our annual update on preparations for hurricane season, which begin on Monday. And I want to thank our NOAA Administrator Kathy Sullivan, FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate, and their teams for helping to lead this briefing. <p><i>Flooding in Texas and Oklahoma </i><p>Before we talk a little bit about the hurricane season, obviously, our thoughts and prayers are still with the families and the communities that have been devastated by the flooding in Texas and Oklahoma. Lives have been lost, and our condolences go out to the families that have been affected. But there's going to be a lot of work that has to be done for rebuilding. <p>Craig just informed me, gave me an update on the coordination that we're doing between Federal and State and local respondents. The coordination is good. They appear to have the assets they need at this stage to respond, but there's going to be a lot of rebuilding. And we as a nation are going to have to help the same way we do anytime that folks are affected by these natural disasters. <p>And so we will stay in close coordination with them to make sure that our response is quick, that we're cutting through bureaucracy, and that we're helping them recover. And there's still going to be some weather events over the next several days that will potentially make things a little tougher for folks, but I'm confident, obviously, that these communities will ultimately get back on their feet. <p><i>Hurricane Preparedness </i><p>It does remind us that it is never too early for disaster preparation. Today FEMA released our national preparedness report, summarizing new progress at a national level, along with submissions from across the country. We are in constant coordination with our State and local partners to make sure that their action plans are up to date. <p>We're joined today by our State partners who are critical in all this work, because they are the first responders, the people on the ground who are actually making a difference and taking a lot of the information that we get here and funneling that to local communities. So we've got partners from Florida, North Carolina, Virginia; they've done great work to prepare for hurricane season. <p>The truth is, we are better prepared than ever for the storms of today. The technology has improved, the forecasting has improved, the tools we have to model what may happen with something like storm surge has all gotten a lot better. And so not only do we have better information, but we have new mechanisms to disseminate it. <p>We're also focusing on making ourselves more resilient to the impacts of a changing climate that are having significant effects on both the pace and intensity of some of these storms. The best climate scientists in the world are telling us that extreme weather events like hurricanes are likely to become more powerful. When you combine stronger storms with rising seas, that's a recipe for more devastating floods. Climate change didn't cause Hurricane Sandy, but it might have made it stronger. The fact that the sea level in New York Harbor is about a foot higher than a century ago certainly made the storm surge worse. And that's why we are seeking to work with Congress to make sure that we are focused on resilience and the steps we can take to fortify our infrastructure in these communities. We're fortunate to have a couple of outstanding Members of Congress here on a bipartisan basis. Congressman Carlos Curbelo and Congressman Ted Deutch both represent Florida and obviously have a shared interest in making sure that we are building the kind of resilience that we may need. <p>Miami, for example, already has to spend hundreds of millions of dollars just to adapt its water system to the more frequent flooding that it's already experiencing from rising seas. That's why I put forward America's first climate action plan 2 years ago. I called for a climate resilience toolkit to help families and business owners in communities plan for the impacts of a changing climate, and that toolkit is now online at toolkit.climate.gov. <p>Responding to a hurricane is a team effort. From the Federal to the local levels, we all have a role to play. So I encourage every American, no matter where you live, to check out ready.gov&mdash;ready.gov&mdash;where you will find information on making plans for your family, building an emergency supply kit, knowing what to do when disaster strikes. This is something that Administrator Fugate has been like a broken record about every single year, but he's absolutely right that the best preparedness is the preparedness that's being taken by individual families, homeowners, business owners. If they have a plan, if they have ideas about how they will respond to warnings, and they're paying attention, then the collective effort obviously goes a lot more smoothly. <p>Finally, I just want to thank all the hard-working public servants who help America prepare for and respond to and recover from emergencies. Sometimes, we take for granted what our public servants do. Sometimes, we spend a lot of time griping about government, and we spend a lot of time complaining about folks that we're not seeing and bureaucrats and don't really appreciate that basic information, like what the weather is like, when storms come, how we're going to respond. That all involves our public servants at the Federal, State, and local levels. And they may be in the background until a disaster strikes, and suddenly, we realize how much we depend on them. <p>And so I think now is a good time for us to remind ourselves and make sure we're properly resourcing folks who, in dire straits, we really depend on to make sure we're safe, our families are safe, and that we can recover from really devastating attacks by Mother Nature. <p>And I also want to thank our military, our National Guard, for the work that they do. But our first responders and our folks at the local level, they've been doing some outstanding work. <p>I really want to lift up in particular some of the men and women who deploy on search and rescue, not just here domestically, but internationally. We've just had a couple of teams made up of expert, finely trained, local first responders who essentially volunteer. They just came back from Nepal, where they saved a couple of lives. In the past, they have saved lives in places like Haiti, after the devastating earthquake there. They've been working around the clock in Texas. They are always ready to do the selfless work that we should all be very, very proud of. So thank you so much for the outstanding work that you do. <p>All right, everybody, thank you.\" "
"126" "\"Hi, everybody. As President and Commander in Chief, my greatest responsibility is the safety of the American people. And in our fight against terrorists, we need to use every effective tool at our disposal, both to defend our security and to protect the freedoms and civil liberties enshrined in our Constitution. <p>But tomorrow&mdash;Sunday at midnight&mdash;some important tools we use against terrorists will expire. That's because Congress has not renewed them and because legislation that would, the USA FREEDOM Act, is stuck in the Senate. I want to be very clear about what this means. <p>Today, when investigating terrorist networks, our national security professionals can seek a court order to obtain certain business records. Our law enforcement professionals can seek a roving wiretap to keep up with terrorists when they switch cell phones. We can seek a wiretap on so-called lone wolves, suspected terrorists who may not be directly tied to a terrorist group. These tools are not controversial. Since 9/11, they've been renewed numerous times. FBI Director James Comey says they are \\"essential\\" and that losing them would \\"severely\\" impact terrorism investigations. But if Congress doesn't act by midnight tomorrow, these tools go away. <p>The USA FREEDOM Act also accomplishes something I called for a year and a half ago: It ends the bulk metadata program&mdash;the bulk collection of phone records&mdash;as it currently exists and puts in place new reforms. The Government will no longer hold these records, telephone providers will. The Act also includes other changes to our surveillance laws, including more transparency, to help build confidence among the American people that your privacy and civil liberties are being protected. But if Congress doesn't act tomorrow, at midnight, these reforms will be in jeopardy as well. <p>It doesn't have to be this way. The USA FREEDOM Act reflects ideas from privacy advocates, our private sector partners, and our national security experts. It already passed the House of Representatives with overwhelming bipartisan support: Republicans and Democrats. That doesn't happen very often. A majority of the Senate&mdash;Republicans and Democrats&mdash;have voted to move it forward. <p>So what's the problem? A small group of Senators is standing in the way. And, unfortunately, some folks are trying to use this debate to score political points. But this shouldn't and can't be about politics. This is a matter of national security. Terrorists like Al Qaida and ISIL aren't suddenly going to stop plotting against us at midnight tomorrow. And we shouldn't surrender the tools that help keep us safe. It would be irresponsible. It would be reckless. We shouldn't allow it to happen. <p>So today I'm calling on Americans to join me in speaking with one voice to the Senate: Put the politics aside. Put our national security first. Pass the USA FREEDOM Act now. And let's protect the security and civil liberties of every American. Thanks very much.\" "
"127" "\"<i>The President.</i> Good morning, everybody. Please be seated. <p><i>Audience members</i>. Good morning. <p><i>The President</i>. Welcome to the White House. Nearly a hundred years ago, a 16-year-old kid from the Midwest named Frank Buckles headed to Europe's western front. An ambulance driver, he carried the wounded to safety. He lived to see our troops ship off to another war in Europe and one in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan. And Frank Buckles became a quietly powerful advocate for our veterans and remained that way until he passed away 4 years ago, America's last surviving veteran of World War I. <p>On the day Frank was laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery, Vice President Biden and I went to pay our respects. And we weren't alone. Americans from across the country came out to express their gratitude as well. They were of different ages and different races, some military, some not. Most had never met Frank. But all of them braved a cold winter's day to offer a final tribute to a man with whom they shared a powerful conviction: that no one who serves our country should ever be forgotten. <p>We are a nation, a people, who remember our heroes. We take seriously our responsibilities to only send them when war is necessary. We strive to care for them and their families when they come home. We never forget their sacrifice. And we believe that it's never too late to say thank you. That's why we're here this morning. <p>Today America honors two of her sons who served in World War I, nearly a century ago. These two soldiers were roughly the same age, dropped into the battlefields of France at roughly the same time. They both risked their own lives to save the lives of others. They both left us decades ago, before we could give them the full recognition that they deserved. But it's never too late to say thank you. Today we present America's highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor, to Private Henry Johnson and Sergeant William Shemin. <p>I want to begin by welcoming and thanking everyone who made this day possible: family, friends, admirers. Some of you have worked for years to honor these heroes, to give them the honor they should have received a long time ago. We are grateful that you never gave up. We are appreciative of your efforts. <p>As a young man, Henry Johnson joined millions of other African Americans on the Great Migration from the rural South to the industrial North, a people in search of a better life. He landed in Albany, where he mixed sodas at a pharmacy, worked in a coal yard and as a porter at a train station. And when the United States entered World War I, Henry enlisted. He joined one of only a few units that he could: the all-Black 369th Infantry Regiment. The Harlem Hellfighters. And soon, he was headed overseas. <p>At the time, our military was segregated. Most Black soldiers served in labor battalions, not combat units. But General Pershing sent the 369th to fight with the French Army, which accepted them as their own. Quickly, the Hellfighters lived up to their name. And in the early hours of May 15, 1918, Henry Johnson became a legend. His battalion was in Northern France, tucked into a trench. Some slept, but he couldn't. Henry and another soldier, Needham Roberts, stood sentry along no man's land. In the predawn, it was pitch black and silent. And then, a click, the sound of wire cutters. <p>A German raiding party&mdash;at least a dozen soldiers, maybe more&mdash;fired a hail of bullets. Henry fired back until his rifle was empty. Then he and Needham threw grenades. Both of them were hit. Needham lost consciousness. Two enemy soldiers began to carry him away while another provided cover, firing at Henry. But Henry refused to let them take his brother-in-arms. He shoved another magazine into his rifle. It jammed. He turned the gun around and swung it at one of the enemy, knocking him down. Then, he grabbed the only weapon he had left, his Bolo knife, and went to rescue Needham. Henry took down one enemy soldier, then the other. The soldier he'd knocked down with his rifle recovered, and Henry was wounded again. But armed with just his knife, Henry took him down too. <p>And finally, reinforcements arrived, and the last enemy soldier fled. As the Sun rose, the scale of what happened became clear. In just a few minutes of fighting, two Americans had defeated an entire raiding party. And Henry Johnson saved his fellow soldier from being taken prisoner. <p>Henry became one of our most famous soldiers of the war. His picture was printed on recruitment posters and ads for Victory War Stamps. Former President Teddy Roosevelt wrote that he was one of the bravest men in the war. In 1919, Henry rode triumphantly in a victory parade. Crowds lined Fifth Avenue for miles, cheering this American soldier. <p>Henry was one of the first Americans to receive France's highest award for valor. But his own Nation didn't award him anything&mdash;not even the Purple Heart, though he had been wounded 21 times. Nothing for his bravery, though he had saved a fellow soldier at great risk to himself. His injuries left him crippled. He couldn't find work. His marriage fell apart. And in his early thirties, he passed away. <p>Now, America can't change what happened to Henry Johnson. We can't change what happened to too many soldiers like him, who went uncelebrated because our Nation judged them by the color of their skin and not the content of their character. But we can do our best to make it right. In 1996, President Clinton awarded Henry Johnson a Purple Heart. And today, 97 years after his extraordinary acts of courage and selflessness, I'm proud to award him the Medal of Honor. <p>We are honored to be joined today by some very special guests: veterans of Henry's regiment, the 369th. Thank you, to each of you, for your service. And I would ask Command Sergeant Major Louis Wilson of the New York National Guard to come forward and accept this medal on Private Johnson's behalf. <p>[<i>At this point, Lt. Cmdr. Jillian C. Malzone, USCG, Coast Guard Aide to the President, read the citation, and the President presented the medal, assisted by Maj. Wesley N. Spurlock III, USAF, Air Force Aide to the President.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Growing up in Bayonne, New Jersey, William Shemin loved sports: football, wrestling, boxing, swimming. If it required physical and mental toughness, if it made your heart pump, your muscles ache, he was all in. [<i>Laughter</i>] As a teenager, he even played semi-pro baseball. So when America entered the war and posters asked if he was tough enough, there was no question about it, he was going to serve. Too young to enlist? No problem. He puffed his chest and lied about his age. [<i>Laughter</i>] And that's how William Shemin joined the 47th Infantry Regiment, 4th Division, and shipped out for France. On August 7, 1918, on the western front, the Allies were hunkered down in one trench, the Germans in another, separated by about 150 yards of open space, just a football field and a half. But that open space was a bloodbath. Soldier after soldier ventured out, and soldier after soldier was mowed down. So those still in the trenches were left with a terrible choice: die trying to rescue your fellow soldier or watch him die, knowing that part of you will die along with him. <p>William Shemin couldn't stand to watch. He ran out into the hell of no man's land and dragged a wounded comrade to safety. And then, he did it again and again. Three times, he raced through heavy machine gunfire. Three times, he carried his fellow soldiers to safety. <p>The battle stretched on for days. Eventually, the platoon's leadership broke down. Too many officers had become casualties. So William stepped up and took command. He reorganized the depleted squads. Every time there was a lull in combat, he led rescues of the wounded. As a lieutenant later described it, William was \\"cool, calm, intelligent, and personally utterly fearless.\\" That young kid who lied about his age grew up fast in war. And he received accolades for his valor, including the Distinguished Service Cross. <p>When he came home, William went to school for forestry and began a nursery business in the Bronx. It was hard work, lots of physical labor, just like he liked it. He married a red-head, blue-eyed woman named Bertha Schiffer, and they had 3 children who gave them 14 grandchildren. He bought a house upstate, where the grandkids spent their summers swimming and riding horses. He taught them how to salute. [<i>Laughter</i>] He taught them the correct way to raise the flag every morning and lower and fold it every night. He taught them how to be Americans. <p>William stayed in touch with his fellow veterans too. And when World War II came, William went and talked to the Army about signing up again. [<i>Laughter</i>] By then, his war injuries had given him a terrible limp. But he treated that limp just like he treated his age all those years ago. Pay no attention to that, he said. He knew how to build roads, he knew camouflage; maybe there was a place for him in this war too. To Bertha's great relief, the Army said that the best thing William could do for his country was to keep running his business and take care of his family. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>His daughter Elsie&mdash;who's here today with what seems like a platoon of Shermans&mdash;Shemins&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;was a&mdash;has a theory about what drove her father to serve. He was the son of Russian immigrants, and he was devoted to his Jewish faith. \\"His family lived through the pogroms,\\" she says. \\"They saw towns destroyed and children killed. And then, they came to America. And here they found a haven, a home, success. And my father and his sister both went to college. All that in one generation. That's what America meant to him. And that's why he'd do anything for this country.\\" <p>Well, Elsie, as much as America meant to your father, he means even more to America. It takes our Nation too long sometimes to say so, because Sergeant Shemin served at a time when the contributions and heroism of Jewish Americans in uniform were too often overlooked. But William Shemin saved American lives. He represented our Nation with honor. And so it is my privilege, on behalf of the American people, to make this right and finally award the Medal of Honor to Sergeant William Shemin. I want to invite his daughters Elsie and Ina&mdash;86 and 83, and gorgeous&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;to accept this medal on their father's behalf. <p>[<i>Lt. Cmdr. Malzone read the citation, and the President presented the medal, assisted by Maj. Spurlock.</i>] <i>The President.</i> Well, it has taken a long time for Henry Johnson and William Shemin to receive the recognition they deserve. And there are surely others whose heroism is still unacknowledged and uncelebrated. So we have work to do, as a nation, to make sure that all of our heroes' stories are told. And we'll keep at it, no matter how long it takes. America is the country we are today because of people like Henry and William, Americans who signed up to serve and rose to meet their responsibilities and then went beyond. The least we can do is to say: We know who you are. We know what you did for us. We are forever grateful. <p>May God bless the fallen of all of our wars. May He watch over our veterans and their families and all those who serve today. May God bless the United States of America. <p>With that, I'd ask Chaplain to return to the podium for a benediction. <p>[<i>Maj. Gen. Paul K. Hurley, USA, Army Chief of Chaplains said a prayer.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Amen. With that, we conclude the formal ceremony. But I welcome everybody to join in a wonderful reception. And let's give our Medal of Honor winners one big round of applause. <p>Thank you, everybody.\" "
"128" "\"Hello, everybody! Have a seat, have a seat. Welcome to the White House. For these folks, I guess, it's welcome back. [<i>Laughter</i>] This is the third time in the last 5 years: the world champion San Francisco Giants! <p>We have a lot of Giants fans in the house. We've got some Members of Congress, including Leader Nancy Pelosi. Mayor Lee is here. The outstanding CEO of the Giants, Larry Baer. I am particularly honored to have a couple of trailblazing Hall of Famers here: Monte Irvin and the \\"Say Hey Kid,\\" Willie Mays. And of course, we've got a manager who seems to be making his own case for Cooperstown, Bruce Bochy. <p>So this is quite a crew that we've got up here. They have won three titles in 5 years, probably only matched soon by the white&mdash;by the Blackhawks, who are&mdash;but that's hockey, so I'll&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. This is the first National League team in almost 70 years to do that. They have not lost a playoff series since 2003. And they're doing it all at a time when we've got more playoff teams than ever, more parity than we've seen in a long time. I mean, even the Cubs have a shot this year. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I continue to hold out hope that my White Sox can turn it around. <p>But all that parity seems to wipe away whenever the Giants make the playoffs. I mean, the truth is, it seems like if they get in, they'll probably win it. [<i>Laughter</i>] They've got that \\"even year\\" magic. They've got that championship experience. I seem to be good luck for them. [<i>Laughter</i>] Apparently. And I guess they do have one other thing: Madison Bumgarner. [<i>Applause</i>] They've got Madison. <p>So last October, Madison put together a string of performances that I think is pretty hard to believe, and I'm not talking about his locker room celebrations. [<i>Laughter</i>] Twenty-five years old and is already one of the best pitchers in postseason history. For his career, he's 4 and 0 with a 0.25 ERA in the World Series. Last year, he set a new record for postseason innings pitched. <p>And of course, there's Game 7, which is what kids in their backyards dream about. Madison comes in from the bullpen on just 2 days' rest after throwing a complete game shutout in Game 5. Throws five more scoreless innings to wrap up the title with one of the greatest performances in World Series history. As a courtesy to my Press Secretary, Josh Earnest, I won't mention the team he beat. [<i>Laughter</i>] He's from Kansas City, but&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>But you can't win a World Series&mdash;or you certainly can't win three of them&mdash;just with one guy. The Giants have those pillars that all great teams have. Buster Posey. Matt Cain. Tim Lincecum couldn't be here today, but obviously has made an enormous contribution. The Core Four out of the bullpen. <p>And then there are guys like Yusmeiro Petit, who set a world League record by retiring 46 consecutive batters during the season. Veteran All-Star Tim Hudson. Joe Panik, a rookie last year. And of course, we've got Hunter Pence. I told Hunter I was going to talk about him a little bit. He was not only named to the All-Star team, he inspired a craze of signs from opposing fans like \\"Hunter Pence eats pizza with a fork,\\" \\"Hunter Pence likes Godfather 3.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Not everybody would have laughed at those signs, but not everybody is Hunter Pence. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So it was another great season for the Giants. But what's best about this organization is the example they set off the field. Their Junior Giants program works to get our young people active, teaches them skills like self-esteem and teamwork and leadership. They've given out nearly $500,000 in scholarships to students. <p>Today I'm proud to announce that the Giants Community Fund is teaming up with San Francisco State University and Major League Baseball to build a multimillion-dollar Junior Giants Urban Youth Academy, complete with training facilities, classrooms, batting cages, two baseball fields. <p>The academy will target boys and girls from underserved areas of San Francisco and will include mentoring and tutoring and college prep programming. It's the kind of initiative that fits right in with the goals of our \\"My Brother's Keeper\\" initiative to keep all of our young people out of trouble and give them the opportunity to stretch as far as their dreams will take them. And it builds on the work that Major League Baseball is already doing to lift up young people in communities like Compton and New Orleans and right here in Washington, DC. <p>So it's a tremendous commitment from a tremendous team. Congratulations, everybody. Good luck this year. We're proud of you. Everybody, give a big round of applause. San Francisco Giants. Hey!\" "
"129" "\"\\"A man,\\" wrote an Irish poet, \\"is original when he speaks the truth that has always been known to all good men.\\" Beau Biden was an original. He was a good man, a man of character, a man who loved deeply and was loved in return. <p>Your Eminences, your Excellencies, General Odierno, distinguished guests; to Hallie, Natalie, and Hunter; to Hunter, Kathleen, Ashley, Howard; the rest of Beau's beautiful family, friends, colleagues; to Jill and to Joe: We are here to grieve with you, but more importantly, we are here because we love you. <p>Without love, life can be cold and it can be cruel. Sometimes, cruelty is deliberate: the action of bullies or bigots or the inaction of those indifferent to another's pain. But often, cruelty is simply born of life, a matter of fate or God's will, beyond our mortal powers to comprehend. To suffer such faceless, seemingly random cruelty can harden the softest hearts or shrink the sturdiest. It can make one mean or bitter or full of self-pity. Or, to paraphrase an old proverb, it can make you beg for a lighter burden. <p>But if you're strong enough, it can also make you ask God for broader shoulders, shoulders broad enough to bear not only your own burdens, but the burdens of others; shoulders broad enough to shield those who need shelter the most. <p>To know Beau Biden is to know which choice he made in his life. To know Joe and the rest of the Biden family is to understand why Beau lived the life he did. For Beau, a cruel twist of fate came early: the car accident that took his mom and his sister and confined Beau and Hunter, then still toddlers, to hospital beds at Christmastime. <p>But Beau was a Biden. And he learned early the Biden family rule: If you have to ask for help, it's too late. It meant you were never alone; you don't even have to ask, because someone is always there for you when you need them. <p>And so, after the accident, Aunt Valerie rushed in to care for the boys and remained to help raise them. Joe continued public service, but shunned the parlor games of Washington, choosing instead the daily commute home, maintained for decades, that would let him meet his most cherished duty: to see his kids off to school, to kiss them at night, to let them know that the world was stable and that there was firm ground under their feet. <p>As Joe himself confessed to me, he did not just do this because the kids needed him, he did it because he needed those kids. And somehow, Beau sensed that: how understandably and deeply hurt his family and his father was. And so rather than use his childhood trauma as justification for a life of self-pity or self-centeredness, that very young boy made a very grownup decision: He would live a life of meaning. He would live a life for others. He would ask God for broader shoulders. <p>Beau would guide and look out for his younger brother. He would embrace his new mom&mdash;apparently, the two boys sheepishly asking their father when they could all marry Jill&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and throughout his life, no one would make Jill laugh harder. He would look after their baby sister Ashley. He would forever be the one to do the right thing, careful not to give his family or his friends cause for concern. <p>Now, it's no secret that a lot of what made Beau the way he was, was just how much he loved and admired his dad. He studied law, like his dad, even choosing the same law school. He chased public service, like his dad, believing it to be a noble and important pursuit. From his dad, he learned how to get back up when life knocked him down. He learned that he was no higher than anybody else and no lower than anybody else, something Joe got from his mom, by the way. And he learned how to make everybody else feel like we matter, because his dad taught him that everybody matters. <p>He even looked and sounded like Joe, although, I think Joe would be first to acknowledge that Beau was an upgrade&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;Joe 2.0. [<i>Laughter</i>] But as much as Beau reminded folks of Joe, he was very much his own man. He was an original. <p>Here was a scion of an incredible family who brushed away the possibility of privilege for the harder, better reward of earning his own way. Here was a soldier who dodged glory and exuded true humility, a prosecutor who defended the defenseless, the rare politician who collected more fans than foes, and the rarer public figure who prioritized his private life above all else. <p>Beau didn't cut corners. He turned down an appointment to be Delaware's attorney general so he could win it fair and square. When the field was clear for him to run for the Senate, he chose to finish his job as AG instead. He didn't do these things to gain favor with a cynical public. It's just who he was. You know, in his twenties, he and a friend were stopped for speeding outside Scranton. And the officer recognized the name on the license, and because he was a fan of Joe's work with law enforcement, he wanted to let Beau off with a warning. But Beau made him write that ticket. Beau didn't trade on his name. <p>After 9/11, he joined the National Guard. He felt it was his obligation, part of what those broader shoulders are for. He did his duty to his country and deployed to Iraq, and General Odierno eloquently spoke to Major Biden's service. What I can tell you is, when he was loading up to ship out at Dover, there was a lot of press that wanted to interview him. Beau refused. He was just another soldier. <p>I saw him when I visited Iraq; he conducted himself the same way. His deployment was hard on Hallie and the kids, like it was for so many families over the last 14 years. It was hard on Joe, hard on Jill. It's partly why Jill threw herself into her work with military families with so much intensity. That's how you know when Joe thunders, \\"May God protect our troops,\\" in every speech he does, he means it so deeply. <p>Like his father, Beau did not have a mean bone in his body. The cruelty he'd endured in his life didn't make him hard, it made him compassionate, empathetic. But it did make him abhor bullies. <p>Beau's grandfather, Joe's father, believed that the most egregious sin was to abuse your power to inflict pain on another. So Beau squared his broad shoulders to protect people from that kind of abuse. He fought for homeowners who were cheated, seniors who were scammed. He even went after bullying itself. He set up a Child Protector&mdash;Predator Task Force, convicted more than 200 of those who targeted vulnerable children. And in all this, he did it in a way that was alive to the suffering of others, bringing in experts to help spare both the children and their parents further trauma. That's who Beau was: someone who cared, someone who charmed you and disarmed you and put you at ease. When he'd have to attend a fancy fundraiser with people who took themselves way too seriously, he'd walk over to you and whisper something wildly inappropriate in your ear. [<i>Laughter</i>] The son of a Senator, a major in the Army, the most popular elected official in Delaware&mdash;I'm sorry, Joe&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but he was not above dancing in nothing but a sombrero and shorts at Thanksgiving; it would shake loose a laugh from the people he loved. And through it all, he was the consummate public servant, a notebook in his back pocket at all times so he could write down the problems of everyone he met and go back to the office to get them fixed. <p>Because he was a Biden, the titles that come with family&mdash;husband, father, son, brother, uncle&mdash;those were the ones Beau valued above any other. This was a man who, at the Democratic National Convention, didn't spend all his time in backrooms with donors or glad-handing. Instead, he rode the escalators in the arena with his son, up and down, up and down, again and again&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;knowing, just like Joe had learned, what ultimately mattered in life. <p>You know, anyone can make a name for themselves in this reality TV age, especially in today's politics. If you're loud enough or controversial enough, you can get some attention. But to make that name mean something, to have it associated with dignity and integrity, that is rare. There's no shortcut to get it. It's not something you can buy. But if you do right by your children, maybe you can pass it on. And what greater inheritance is there? What greater inheritance than to be part of a family that passes on the values of what it means to be a great parent; that passes on the values of what it means to be a true citizen; that passes on the values of what it means to give back, fully and freely, without expecting anything in return? <p>That's what our country was built on, men like Beau. That's who built it, families like this. We don't have kings or queens or lords. We don't have to be born into money to have an impact. We don't have to step on one another to be successful. We have this remarkable privilege of being able to earn what we get out of life, with the knowledge that we are no higher than anybody else or lower than anybody else. We know this not just because it is in our founding documents, but because families like the Bidens have made it so, because people like Beau have made it so. <p>He did in 46 years what most of us couldn't do in 146. He left nothing in the tank. He was a man who led a life where the means were as important as the ends. And the example he set made you want to be a better dad or a better son or a better brother or sister, better at your job, the better soldier. He made you want to be a better person. Isn't that finally the measure of a man, the way he lives, how he treats others, no matter what life may throw at him? <p>We do not know how long we've got here. We don't know when fate will intervene. We cannot discern God's plan. What we do know is that with every minute that we've got, we can live our lives in a way that takes nothing for granted. We can love deeply. We can help people who need help. We can teach our children what matters and pass on empathy and compassion and selflessness. We can teach them to have broad shoulders. <p>To the Biden family, this sprawling, intimate clan, I know that Beau's passing has left a gaping void in the world. Hallie, I can only imagine the burdens that you've been carrying on your shoulders these past couple of years. And it's because you gave him everything that he could give everything to us. And just as you were there for him, we'll be there for you. To Natalie and Hunter, there aren't words big enough to describe how much your dad loved you, how much he loved your mom. But I will tell you what, Michelle and I and Sasha and Malia, we've become part of the Biden clan. We're honorary members now. [<i>Laughter</i>] And the Biden family rule applies: We're always here for you; we always will be&mdash;my word as a Biden. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>To Joe and Jill, just like everybody else here, Michelle and I thank God you are in our lives. Taking this ride with you is one of the great pleasures of our lives. Joe, you are my brother. And I am grateful every day that you've got such a big heart and a big soul and those broad shoulders. I couldn't admire you more. <p>I got to know Joe's mom, Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden, before she passed away. She was on stage with us when we were first elected. And I know she told Joe once that out of everything bad that happens to you, something good will come if you look hard enough. And I suppose she was channeling that same Irish poet with whom I began today, Patrick Kavanagh, when he wrote, \\"And I said, let grief be a fallen leaf at the dawning of the day.\\" <p>As hard as it is right now, through all the heartache and through all the tears, it is our obligation to Beau to think not about what was and what might have been, but instead to think about what is, because of him. Think about the day that dawns for children who are safer because of Beau, whose lives are fuller, because of him. Think about the day that dawns for parents who rest easier and families who are freer because of him. Some folks may never know that their lives are better because of Beau Biden. But that's okay. Certainly for Beau, acclaim was never the point of public service. <p>But the lines of well-wishers who've been here all week, they know. The White House mailroom that's been overflowing with letters from people, those folks know. The soldiers who served with Beau, who joined the National Guard because of him. The workers at Verdi's who still have their home because of him and who thanked him for helping them bus tables one busy night. The students in Newark who remember the time he talked with them for hours, inexhaustible, even after giving a speech, even after taking his National Guard fitness test. The Rehoboth woman who's saved a kind voicemail from him for 5 years and wrote to say, \\"I loved the way he loved his family.\\" And the stranger who wrote from halfway across this great country just to say: \\"The only thing we can hope for is that our children make us proud by making a difference in the world. Beau has done that and then some. The world noticed.\\" <p>Jill, Joe, Hallie, Hunter, and Natalie: The world noticed. They noticed. They felt it, his presence. And Beau lives on in the lives of others. And isn't that the whole point of our time here? To make this country we love fairer and more just, not just for Natalie and Hunter or Naomi or Finnegan or Maisy or Malia or Sasha, but for every child? Isn't that what this amazing journey we've been on is all about, to make life better for the next generation? Beau figured that out so early in life. What an inheritance Beau left us. What an example he set. <p>\\"Through our great good fortune, in our youth our hearts were touched with fire,\\" said Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. \\"But, above all, we have learned that whether a man accepts from Fortune her spade, and will look downward and dig, or from Aspiration her axe and cord, and will scale the ice, the one and only success which it is his to command is to bring to his work a mighty heart.\\" <p>Beau Biden brought to his work a mighty heart. He brought to his family a mighty heart. What a good man. What an original. <p>May God bless his memory and the lives of all he touched.\" "
"130" "\"Hi, everybody. One of the remarkable things about America is that nearly all of our families originally came from someplace else. We're a nation of immigrants. It's a source of our strength and something we all can take pride in. And this month, Immigrant Heritage Month, is a chance to share our American stories. <p>I think about my grandparents in Kansas, where they met and where my mom was born. Their family tree reaches back to England and Ireland and elsewhere. They lived and raised me by basic values: working hard, giving back, and treating others the way you want to be treated. <p>I think of growing up in Hawaii, a place enriched by people of different backgrounds: native Hawaiian, Filipino, Japanese, Chinese, Portuguese, and just about everything else. Growing up in that vibrant mix helped shape who I am today. And while my father was not an immigrant himself, my own life journey as an African American and the heritage shared by Michelle and our daughters, some of whose ancestors came here in chains, has made our family who we are. <p>This month, I'm inviting you to share your story too. Just visit whitehouse.gov/new-americans. We want to hear how you or your family made it to America, whether you're an immigrant yourself or your great-great-grandparents were. <p>Of course, we can't just celebrate this heritage, we have to defend it by fixing our broken immigration system. Nearly 2 years ago, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate came together to do that. They passed a commonsense bill to secure our border, get rid of backlogs, and give undocumented immigrants who are already living here a pathway to citizenship if they paid a fine, paid their taxes, and went to the back of the line. But for nearly 2 years, Republican leaders in the House have refused to even allow a vote on it. <p>That's why, in the meantime, I'm going to keep doing everything I can to make our immigration system more just and more fair. Last fall, I took action to provide more resources for border security; focus enforcement on the real threats to our security; modernize the legal immigration system for workers, employers, and students; and bring more undocumented immigrants out of the shadows so they can get right with the law. Some folks are still fighting against these actions. I'm going to keep fighting for them. Because the law is on our side, it's the right thing to do, and it will make America stronger. <p>I want us to remember people like Ann Dermody from Alexandria, Virginia. She's originally from Ireland and has lived in America legally for years. She worked hard, played by the rules, and dreamed of becoming a citizen. In March, her dream came true. And before taking the oath, she wrote me a letter. \\"The papers we receive . . . will not change our different accents [or] skin tones,\\" Ann said. \\"But for that day, at least, we'll feel like we have arrived.\\" <p>Well, to Ann and immigrants like her who have come to our shores seeking a better life: Yes, you have arrived. And by sharing our stories and staying true to our heritage as a nation of immigrants, we can keep that dream alive for generations to come. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"131" "\"<i>Gr&uuml;ss Gott!</i> It is wonderful to be back in Germany for my fourth visit as President. And to my great friend and partner, Chancellor Merkel; to Mayor Schwarzenberger and the people of Kr&uuml;n and&mdash;[<i>inaudible</i>]; to the people of Germany: Thank you for welcoming me here today and for the incredible hospitality and the incredible beauty of this place. <p>I want to thank everybody for this wonderful visit to this beautiful village. I know it's a lot of hard work when I come to town. [<i>Laughter</i>] That was, without question, the best alphorn performance that I've ever heard. I have to admit that I forgot to bring my lederhosen. But I'm going to see if I can buy some while I'm here. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, I must admit that when I first learned that Angela was going to host the G-7 in Bavaria, I was hoping that it would fall during <i>Oktoberfest.</i> But, then again, there's never a bad day for a beer and a weisswurst. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I can't think of a better place to come to celebrate the enduring friendship between the German and American people. <p>I come here grateful for the history that we share. And so much of America, including my hometown of Chicago, would not be the same without the contributions of so many German immigrants, including from Bavaria. Over the years, Bavaria and Germany have returned the favor by welcoming countless Americans, including generations of our servicemembers and students from the George Marshall Center. And on behalf of the American people, I want to thank you for your gracious hospitality. <p>So over the next 2 days in Schloss Elmau, we're going to discuss our shared future: a global economy that creates jobs and opportunity, maintaining a strong and prosperous European Union, forging new trade partnerships across the Atlantic, standing up to Russian aggression in Ukraine, combating threats from violent extremism to climate change. And on all these issues, we are very grateful for the partnership and leadership of your Chancellor, Angela Merkel. <p>These are all difficult challenges. But part of what gives me hope is the example of Germany. This year marks 70 years since the end of World War II and decades of a great NATO alliance. It marks 25 years since the unification of Germany that inspired the world. The fact that all of us are here together today is proof that conflicts can end and great progress is possible. <p>So this morning, as we celebrate one of the strongest alliances the world has ever known, my message to the German people is simple: We are grateful for your friendship, for your leadership. We stand together as inseparable allies, in Europe and around the world. <p>My only final request to Angela is that, on such a beautiful day, instead of being inside, we should have all our summit meetings in this incredible village center and drink beer. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I think we'll have to negotiate with the security people. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Vielen Dank.</i>\" "
"132" "\"Thank you. Thank you so much. Everybody, please have a seat. Thank you so much. <p>Well, I don't know whether this is appropriate, but I just told Sister Carol I love her. [<i>Laughter</i>] On a big stage. It is true, though. I do. She is just wonderful. Her dedication to doing God's work here on Earth, her commitment to serving \\"the least of these,\\" her steadiness, her strength, her steadfast voice have been an inspiration to me. We would not have gotten the Affordable Care Act done had it not been for her. I want to thank the entire Catholic Health Association for the incredible work you do. <p>And it's true, I just love nuns, generally. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm just saying. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>It is an honor to join you on your 100th anniversary of bringing hope and healing to so many. I want to acknowledge Dignity Health and its CEO, Lloyd Dean, honored by the Catholic Health Association last night for his outstanding support of our efforts to improve health care in America. He has been a great friend. <p>I want to thank Ascension Health, a great provider of care that also recently raised its minimum wage. I want to thank Secretary Burwell and the Members of Congress who are here today, because they have been obviously doing extraordinary work. <p>My first job in Chicago when I moved after college to work as a community organizer&mdash;my first job was funded by the Campaign for Human Development, an antipoverty initiative of the Catholic Church. And my first office was at Holy Rosary Church on the South Side of Chicago, across from Palmer Park. You're clapping there&mdash;she knows Holy Rosary. [<i>Laughter</i>] And the task was to work with parishes and neighbors and faith and community leaders to bring low-income people together, to stitch neighborhoods together, clergy and laypeople. And the work was hard, and there were times where it was dispiriting. We had plenty of setbacks. There were times where I felt like quitting, where I wondered if the path I'd chosen was too hard. <p>But despite these challenges, I saw how kindness and compassion and faith can change the arc of people's lives. And I saw the power of faith: a shared belief that every human being, made in the image of God, deserves to live in dignity, and that all children, no matter who they are or where they come from or how much money they were born into, ought to have the opportunity to achieve their God-given potential; that we were&mdash;that we are all called, in the words of His Holiness Pope Francis, \\"to satisfy the demands of justice, fairness, and respect for every human being.\\" <p>And at the time, when I had just moved to Chicago, the Cardinal there was Cardinal Bernardin, an extraordinary man. And he understood that part of that commitment, part of that commitment to the dignity of every human being also meant that we had to care about the health of every human being. And he articulated that, and the Church articulated that, as we moved at the State level in the Illinois legislature, once I was elected there later on in life, to advance the proposition that health care is not a privilege, it is a right. <p>And that belief is at the heart of the Catholic Health Association's mission. For decades, your member hospitals have been on the front lines, often serving the marginalized and the vulnerable and the sick and the uninsured. And that belief is at the heart of why we came together more than 5 years ago to reform our health care system, to guarantee that every American has access to quality, affordable care. <p>So I'm here today to say thank you for your tireless efforts to make health reform a reality. Without your commitment to compassionate care, without your moral force, we would not have succeeded. We would not have succeeded had it not been for you and the foundation you had laid. <p>And pursuing health care reform wasn't about making good on a campaign promise for me. It was, remember, in the wake of an economic crisis with a very human toll. And it was integral to restoring the basic promise of America, the notion that in this country, if you work hard and you take responsibility, you can get ahead. You can make it if you try. Everything we've done these past 6&frac12; years to rebuild our economy on a new foundation, from rescuing and retooling our industries to reforming our schools to rethinking the way we produce and use energy to reducing our deficits, all of that has been in pursuit of that one goal: creating opportunity for all people. And health care reform was a critical part of that effort. <p>For decades, a major barrier to economic opportunity was our broken health care system. It exposed working families to the insecurities of a changing economy. It saddled our businesses with skyrocketing costs that made it hard to hire or pay a good wage. It threatened our entire Nation's long-term prosperity, was the primary driver of our deficits. <p>And for hospitals like yours, the fact that so many people didn't have basic care meant you were scrambling and scratching every single day to try to figure out how do we keep our doors open. <p>Leaders from Teddy Roosevelt to Teddy Kennedy wanted to reform it. For as long as there were Americans who couldn't afford decent health care, as long as there were people who had to choose between paying for medicine or paying the rent, as long as there were parents who had to figure out whether they could sell or borrow to pay for a child's treatment just a few months more and beg for God's mercy to make it work in time, as long as those things were happening, America was not living up to our highest ideals. <p>And that's why providers and faith leaders like you called for expanding access to affordable care. Every day, you saw the very personal suffering of those who go without it. And it seemed like an insurmountable challenge. Every time there was enough political will to alleviate that suffering and to reform the health care system, whether it was under Democratic Presidents or Republican Presidents, you had special interests arraying and keeping the status quo in place. And each year that passed without reform the stakes kept getting higher. <p>By the time I took office, thousands of Americans were losing their health insurance every single day. Many people died each year because they didn't have health insurance. Many families who thought they had coverage were driven into bankruptcy by out-of-pocket costs. Tens of millions of our fellow citizens had no coverage at all in this, the wealthiest, most powerful nation on Earth. And despite being the only advanced economy in the world without universal health care, our health care costs grew to be the most expensive in the world with no slowing in sight. And that trend strained the budgets of families and businesses and our Government. <p>And so we determined that we could not keep kicking that can down the road any longer. We could not leave that problem for another generation to solve or another generation after that. And remember, this was not easy. [<i>Laughter</i>] There were those who thought health care reform was too messy and too complicated and too politically risky. I had pollsters showing me stuff, and 85 percent of folks at any given time had health care, and so they weren't necessarily incentivized to support it. And you could scare the heck out of them about even if they weren't entirely satisfied with the existing system, that somehow it would be terrible to change it. All kinds of warning signs about how tough this was&mdash;bad politics. <p>But for every politician and pundit who said we should wait&mdash;\\"Why rush?\\"&mdash;barely a day went by where I didn't hear from hard-working Americans who didn't have a moment left to lose. These were men and women from all backgrounds, all walks of life, all races, all faiths, in big cities, small towns, red States, blue States. Middle class families with coverage that turned out not to be there for them when they needed it. Moms and dads desperately seeking care for a child with a chronic illness only to be told no again and again, or fearful as their child got older, what was their future going to be because they weren't going to be able to get insurance once they left the house. Small-business owners forced to choose between insuring their employees and keeping the \\"open\\" sign hanging in the window. <p>And every one of these stories tugged at me in a personal way, because I spoke about seeing my mom worry about how she was going to deal with her finances when she got very sick. And I was reminded of the fear that Michelle and I felt when Sasha was a few months old and we had to race to the hospital, in the emergency room learning that she had meningitis&mdash;that we caught only because we had a wonderful pediatrician and regular care. Never felt so scared or helpless in my life. <p>We were fortunate enough to have good health insurance. And I remember looking around in that emergency room and thinking, what about the parents who aren't that lucky? What about the parents who get hit with a bill of $20,000 or $30,000, and they've got no idea how to pay for it? What about those parents with kids who have a chronic illness like asthma and have to keep going back to the emergency room because they don't have a regular doctor, and the bills never stop coming? Who's going to stand up for them? <p>And behind every single story was a simple question: What kind of country do we want to be? Are we a country that's defined by values that say access to health care is a commodity awarded to only the highest bidders, or by the values that say health care is a fundamental right? Do we believe that where you start should determine how far you go, or do we believe that in the greatest nation on Earth, everybody deserves the opportunity to make it, to make of their lives what they will? <p>The rugged individualism that defines America has always been bound by a shared set of values, an enduring sense that we're in this together, that America is not a place where we simply turn away from the sick or turn our backs on the tired, the poor, the huddled masses. It is a place sustained by the idea, \\"I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper,\\" that we have an obligation to put ourselves in our neighbor's shoes and see each other's common humanity. <p>And so after a century of talk, after decades of trying, after a year of sustained debate, we finally made health care reform a reality here in America. <p>And despite the constant doom-and-gloom predictions, the unending Chicken Little warnings that somehow making health insurance fairer and easier to buy would lead to the end of freedom&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;the end of the American way of life, lo and behold, it did not happen. None of this came to pass. In fact, in a lot of ways, the Affordable Care Act worked out better than some of us anticipated. <p>Nearly one in three uninsured Americans have already been covered, more than 16 million people, driving our uninsured rate to its lowest level ever. Ever. On top of that, tens of millions more enjoy new protections with the coverage that they've already got. Those&mdash;that 85 percent who had health insurance, they may not know that they've got a better deal now than they did, but they do. Americans can no longer be denied coverage because of preexisting conditions, from you having had cancer to you having had a baby. Women can't be charged more just for being a woman. And they get free preventive services like mammograms. And there are no more annual or lifetime caps on the care patients receive. <p>Medicare has been strengthened and protected. We've added 13 years to its actuarial life. The financial difference for business owners trying to invest and grow and the families trying to save and spend, that's real too. Health care prices have risen at the lowest rate in 50 years. Employer premiums are rising at a rate tied for the lowest on record. The average family premium is $1,800 lower today than it would have been had trends over the decade before the ACA passed continued. <p>In the years to come, countless Americans who can now buy plans that are portable and affordable on a competitive marketplace will be free to chase their own ideas, unleash new enterprises across the country, knowing they'll be able to buy health insurance. <p>And here's the thing: That security won't just be there for us, it will be there for our kids as they go through life. When they graduate from college, they're looking for that first job, they can stay on our plans until they're 26. When they start a family, pregnancy will no longer count against them as a preexisting condition. When they change jobs or lose a job or strike out on their own to start a business, they'll still be able to get good coverage. They'll have that peace of mind all the way until they retire into a Medicare that now has cheaper prescription drugs and wellness visits to make sure that they stay healthy. <p>And while we were told again and again that Obamacare would be a job-killer&mdash;amazingly enough, some critics still peddle this notion&mdash;it turns out, in reality, America has experienced 63 straight months of private sector job growth, a streak that started the month we passed the Affordable Care Act. The longest streak of private sector job growth on record that adds up to 12.6 million new jobs. <p>So the critics stubbornly ignore reality. In reality, there is a self-employed single mom of three who couldn't afford health insurance until health reform passed and she qualified for Medicaid in her State. And she was finally able to get a mammogram, which detected early-stage breast cancer and may have saved her life. That's the reality, not the mythology. <p>In reality, there are parents in Texas whose autistic son couldn't speak. Even with health insurance, they struggled to pay for his treatment. But health reform meant they could buy an affordable secondary plan that covered therapy for their son, and today, that little boy can tell his parents that he loves them. That's the reality. <p>In reality, there's a self-employed barber from Tennessee&mdash;who happens to be a Republican&mdash;who couldn't afford health insurance until our new marketplace opened up. And once he bought a plan, he finally went to the doctor and was diagnosed with esophageal cancer. In the old days, without coverage, he wouldn't have even known that he was sick. And today, he's now cancer-free. So 5 years in, what we are talking about it is no longer just a law. It's no longer just a theory. This isn't even just about the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare. This isn't about myths or rumors that folks try to sustain. There is a reality that people on the ground day to day are experiencing. Their lives are better. <p>This is now part of the fabric of how we care for one another. This is health care in America, which is why, once you get outside of Washington and leave behind the Beltway chatter and the politics, Americans support this new reality. When you talk to people who actually are enrolled in a new marketplace plan, the vast majority of them like their coverage. The vast majority are satisfied with their choice of doctors and hospitals and satisfied with their monthly premiums. They like their reality. <p>Now, that doesn't mean that we don't have more work to do. Sister Carol and I were talking backstage; we know we got more work to do. Like any serious attempt at change, there were disruptions in the rollout, there are policies we can put in place to make health care work even better. Secretary Burwell is talking about all the things we have to do together around delivery system reform. We have to protect the coverage that people have now and sign even more people up. We need more Governors and State legislatures to expand Medicaid, which was a central part of the architecture of the overall plan. We have to continue to improve the quality of care. And we know we can still bring down costs. <p>And none of this is going to be easy. Nobody suggests that somehow our health care system is perfect as a consequence of the law being passed, but it is serving so many more people so much better. And we're not going to go backwards. There's something, I have to say, just deeply cynical about the ceaseless, endless partisan attempts to roll back progress. I mean, I understood folks being skeptical or worried before the law passed and there wasn't a reality there to examine. But once you see millions of people of having health care, once you see that all the bad things that were predicted didn't happen, you'd think that it would be time to move on. <p>Let's figure out how to make it better. It seems so cynical to want to take coverage away from millions of people, to take care away from the people who need it the most, to punish millions with higher costs of care and unravel what's now been woven into the fabric of America. <p>And that kind of cynicism flies in the face of our history. Our history is one of each generation striving to do better and to be better than the last. Just as we'll never go back to a time when seniors were left to languish in poverty or not have any health insurance in their golden years&mdash;there was a generation that didn't have that guarantee of health care&mdash;we're not going to go back to a time when our citizens can be denied coverage because of a preexisting condition. When tens of millions of people couldn't afford decent, affordable care, that wasn't a better America. That's not freedom. The freedom to languish in illness or to be bankrupt because somebody in your family gets stick&mdash;that's not who we are. That's not what we're about. <p>Debra Lea Oren of Pennsylvania knows that. Debra suffers from osteoarthritis that was so severe that it put her in a wheelchair. And for years she couldn't stand or walk at all and was in constant pain, through no fault of her own, just the twists and turns of life. And without health insurance to get treatment, it seemed as though she might never again live a life that was full. Today, Debra is enrolled in affordable health coverage, was able to have surgery to replace her knees. She's back on her feet. She walks her dogs, shops at the grocery store, gets to her doctor's appointments. She's cooking, she's exercising, regaining her health. Debra couldn't be here today, but she recently wrote to me, and she said: \\"I walk with my husband Michael and hold hands. It's like a whole new world for me.\\" Just walking and holding hands, something that one of our fellow Americans for years could not do. <p>Every day, miracles happen in your hospitals. But remaking Debra's world didn't require a miracle. It just required that Debra have access to something that she and every other American has a right to expect, which is health care coverage. <p>And while there are outcomes that we can calculate and enumerate&mdash;the number of newly insured families, the number of lives saved&mdash;and those numbers all add up to success in this reform effort. But there are also outcomes that are harder to calculate: in the tally of pain and tragedy and bankruptcies that have been averted, but also in the security of a parent who can afford to take her kid to the doctor, or the dignity of a grandfather who can get the preventive care that he needs, or the freedom of an entrepreneur who can start a new venture, or the joy of a wife who thought she'd never again take her husband's hand and go for a walk. <p>In the end, that's why you do what you do. Isn't that what this is all about? Is there any greater measure of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness than those simple pleasures that are afforded because you have good health and you have some security? <p>More than 5 years ago, I said that while I was not the first President to take up this cause, I was determined to be the last. And now it's up to all of us, the citizens in this room and across the country, to continue to help make the right to health care a reality for all Americans. And if we keep faith with one another and keep working for each other to create opportunity for everybody who strives for it, then, in the words of Senator Ted Kennedy, \\"the dream will be fulfilled for this generation, and preserved and enlarged for generations to come.\\" <p>It couldn't have happened without you. <p>Thank you. God bless you all. Thank you so much.\" "
"133" "\"Hi, everybody. My top priority as President is to grow the economy and help more hard-working Americans get ahead. And after the worst economic crisis in our lifetimes, our businesses have now created 12.6 million new jobs over the past 63 months. <p>That's a record streak of job creation. And it's come as we've been working to reform our schools, revitalize manufacturing and the auto industry, revamp our job training programs, and rework our health care system, covering more than 16 million uninsured Americans so far. <p>We've done all of this to rebuild our economy on a new foundation, a foundation for growth that benefits not only us, but our kids and their kids. Because we do live in a new economy. And we've got to adapt to make sure America leads the way in this new century, just like we did in the last. <p>Part of that means sparking new sources of growth and job creation that keep us on the cutting edge. And one big way to do that is through smart new trade agreements that level the playing field for our workers, open new markets for our businesses, and hold other countries to the kinds of high standards that Americans are proud to hold ourselves to here at home. <p>Simply put, America has to write the rules of the 21st-century economy in a way that benefits American workers. If we don't, countries like China will write those rules in a way that benefits their workers. <p>Now, on Friday, Republicans and Democrats in the House of Representatives voted to help the United States negotiate new trade deals that are both free and fair, deals that expand opportunity for our workers and our businesses alike. And that's good. These kinds of trade deals say no to a race for the bottom, for lower wages and working conditions. They're about starting a race to the top, for higher wages and better working conditions, stronger environmental protections, and a smarter way to crack down on countries that break the rules of the global economy. <p>But that's not all we should be doing for our workers. Right now something called trade adjustment assistance provides vital support, like job training and community college education, to tens of thousands of American workers each year who were hurt by past trade deals, the kind that we're not going to repeat again. Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have voted to renew this initiative, but so far, the House of Representatives has chosen to let it expire in just a few months, leaving as many as a hundred thousand American workers on their own. For the sake of those workers, their families, and their communities, I urge those Members of Congress who voted against trade adjustment assistance to reconsider and stand up for American workers. <p>Because these smart new trade deals aren't just about growing our economy and supporting good new American jobs, it's about the kind of country we want to build for our kids and our grandkids. And if I did not think that smart new trade deals were the right thing to do for working families, I wouldn't be fighting for it. <p>This is the right thing to do. Trade that's fair and free and smart will grow opportunity for our middle class. It will help us restore the dream we share and make sure that every American who works hard has a chance to get ahead. That's a cause worth fighting for, today and every day I have the honor of serving as your President. <p>Thanks, everybody, and have a great weekend.\" "
"134" "\"Hello, everybody. Everybody, please, please, have a seat, have a seat. Well, I couldn't tell&mdash;I couldn't let these young men leave without having a chance to say goodbye. <p>Over the past year, I've had a chance to spend some time with these outstanding young men. I crashed their r&eacute;sum&eacute; workshop in the Roosevelt Room. We had lunch in the Diplomatic Room, and most of us didn't spill too much stuff on our ties. [<i>Laughter</i>] I showed them which fork to use. [<i>Laughter</i>] They showed me a thing or two on the basketball court. So this has been a great, mutual learning relationship between me and these outstanding young people. <p>And I've gotten so much out of the conversation, because it's been a privilege to hear about their lives and their families and their hopes and their dreams and a few fears too. The good news is, they're all dreaming big and they're dreaming smart. They know that it's going to take a lot of hard work and perseverance and integrity to get to where they want to be. They know they're going to face some obstacles along the way, sometimes some discouragement, because all too often the world underestimates young men like these. They know that their stories and their success can also help change the narrative. And that's a responsibility that each of them have, but it's one that they're willing to shoulder and, I'm confident, one that they're going to do a great job pulling off. <p>One of these young men, Gerard, told me that his goal was to become the Attorney General of the United States. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I told him, well, that's a big goal. I wasn't sure whether he understood how big it was. I did tell him he was probably going to have to get a new hairdo if he wanted to be Attorney General. [<i>Laughter</i>] And then, I walked him through all the other steps: He had to go to college, he had to graduate from college, you had to take the L-S-A-T&mdash;the LSAT&mdash;you had to get into a law school. You had to then pass the bar and do the work as an attorney and then potentially join the U.S. Attorney's Office and work your way up. I took 10 minutes just going through the whole path that it might take for you to become the Attorney General. And I thought maybe that would make Gerard back off a little bit. Instead, he said, \\"Okay.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] He didn't seem too fazed by it. And then, a couple weeks later, he spent the day shadowing Eric Holder, who has been an outstanding Attorney General, and apparently, he still wasn't fazed. <p>So it gives you a sense of the kind of young men we're talking about. We've got people here who are interested in being engineers. We've got young men who are already participating through the ROTC and are interested in serving their country in the military. We've got young people who are interested in the sciences and had some pretty fancy experiments that they were trying to explain to me that I wasn't exactly clear about, but sounded very impressive. [<i>Laughter</i>] We've got a few folks who are student-athletes and are looking to get scholarships, but understand that, as we discussed, the odds of you becoming a doctor or a lawyer or a school principal are a lot higher than you being in the NBA, so you want to make sure that you're not putting all your eggs in that basket. <p>And throughout this process, what I've been most encouraged by is just how resilient these young people are. And that's not just a credit to them, it's a credit to everybody who encouraged them and loved them and supported them. So I want to give it up to all the moms and dads, grandparents, teachers, coaches, mentors who have poured their love into these young people, made sure they know that they matter and they can do anything. Give them a big round of applause. [<i>Applause</i>] Good job. <p>I want to say a special congratulations to our graduating seniors. Every&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. Yay! Every single one of them is going to college in the fall. And I'm going to give each of them a special shout-out. <p>So we've got Mike Belay is headed to George Mason University. Mike. Chuck Edmunds will be in the honors engineering program at Morgan State University. Yay! Jonathan Larrain will study business at Northern Virginia Community College. Jerron Hawkins is sticking around here and going to Howard University. Noah McQueen is going to Morehouse College, going to be a Morehouse man. Bernard Mkumbuzi is studying engineering at East Carolina University. Marcus Russell will attend Virginia State University, VSU. Malik Brooks is going to West Virginia Wesleyan College. And Joseph West is heading to Morgan State University. <p>So the seniors are launched. They're well on their way. And then, we've got our outstanding juniors here, all who took college-prep classes and took the SATs, and so they're in the process of applying, just like Malia. And I know it's going to be nerve wracking&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but they're handling their business. And so we're proud of them too. And those juniors, you've got a big year ahead of you, but we know you've got what it takes: intelligence, character, and a good sense of humor. So I'm confident that you guys are going to do great. <p>I told these young men as we were taking pictures before we came out that I could not be prouder of how they conducted themselves. This&mdash;we're just in the process now of starting to expand our mentee program not just here at the White House, but through \\"My Brother's Keeper.\\" We're trying to expand this all across the country, because what we know is, when we give outstanding young people like this a chance, they can succeed. They just need a little bit of help. They just need a little bit of encouragement. Maybe a contact here or two. A mentor who is willing to show them the ropes. Somebody who is helping them to set their sights high. <p>And so what I told them is that although they will not be White House mentees after this class, they will always be part of my family and those mentors in our administration who are with them. And so they will continue to be able to count on us to help smooth out some of those rough patches and to get the kind of support that they need to continue to succeed. So I'm not going anywhere for at least 18 months&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but after that, Michelle and I and Broderick and others who have been involved in this program, we intend to continue to help support young people. <p>Now, as we've always said, there's mutual responsibilities involved. So just as we're going to continue to be there for you, we expect you to continue to not only work hard and apply yourself, but also to help reach back and provide the kind of leadership and guidance. We want you to be role models for the young people that are coming behind you, starting obviously with your brothers and sisters, but then continuing to expand to others who may not have always had the same opportunities that you've had. And you've got to make sure that you're helping to not only conduct yourself in a way that gives them an idea of what it takes to succeed, but that you're also being hands on in helping them wherever you can. <p>One of the things that I think we all have to understand as a country is that we all do better when everybody has a shot. This idea that somehow we succeed just on our own is just not true. Nobody does, not even the President of the United States, maybe especially not the President of the United States. There are thousands, tens of thousands of people&mdash;starting with my parents, and now my family&mdash;but tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people who helped me succeed and continue to help me succeed every single day. And that's the nature of how any society works is, we support each other. And so you've got to, as beneficiaries of a lot of support from some wonderful family members, you've got to make sure that you are showing that same leadership going forward. All right? <p>Couldn't be prouder of you. I can't wait to see all the great things that you're going to achieve. Congratulations. And, parents, way to go. Good job. All right. Thank you, everybody.\" "
"135" "\"Thank you, everybody. Thank you so much. Everybody, please have a seat. I was telling Loretta backstage, a little pomp and circumstance never hurts. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor is here. I want to congratulate Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates on her confirmation. She is here somewhere. There she is. And I want to thank the elected officials who are here today, the family and the friends, colleagues. <p>At long last, I'm so proud to be here for the installation of our 83d Attorney General of the United States, Loretta Lynch. <p>We want to welcome Loretta's family&mdash;her husband, Stephen Hargrove; her father, Reverend Lorenzo Lynch. We want to say to Mrs. Lynch as well, thank you so much for your appearance. <p>As I said when I nominated Loretta, in a country built on the rule of law, there are few, perhaps no, offices more important than that of Attorney General. The person in this position is the American people's lawyer, tasked with enforcing our Federal laws and making sure they're applied evenly and equally. <p>And that's the legacy of Eric Holder. We are grateful for his outstanding service as one of the longest serving Attorney Generals in our history. And I want to thank his wonderful wife, Dr. Sharon Malone, who's here today. Where's Sharon at? There she is. <p>As of Attorney General, Eric was driven by his fundamental belief that justice is not an abstraction, it's a very real and tangible way that our laws interact with people in their daily lives. And the good news is, Loretta shares that belief. <p>She brings her own unique style of leadership. She brings a wealth of experience to the Justice Department at a time when there is so much work to be done, from keeping us safe from terrorist attacks to protecting our financial system to safeguarding our environment to upholding civil rights. And all of you at the Justice Department, public servants who do incredible work day in and day out, could not ask for a better leader. <p>Many of you know Loretta's story. Born in segregated Greensboro, North Carolina, Loretta was raised by a fourth-generation Baptist minister and a school librarian, both of whom don't seem to mind speaking their minds. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's just my quick impression. [<i>Laughter</i>] And more importantly, taught Loretta the value of speaking up for what's right. <p>As a young girl, she'd go to the Durham courthouse with her father and watch court proceedings, and he'd tell her stories about her grandfather, who risked everything to protect Black people who found themselves caught up with the law, but had almost no recourse under Jim Crow. And he did this with only a third grade education, proving to Loretta that, no matter what our circumstances, we all have the power to make a difference in the lives of others. <p>So it's clear that both her parents had a huge influence on Loretta. They are her biggest cheerleaders. Apparently, when she applied to work at the U.S. Attorney's Office and a FBI agent went to their house to conduct a routine background check, her parents pulled out a bunch of scrapbooks of Loretta's accomplishments&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;made the agents look through them. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm sure Loretta was mortified. [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"And here in third grade, she got the prize.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"And here's one of her old poems.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] I can just picture the FBI agent sitting there, \\"Yes, ma'am.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So the agent later told Loretta that she probably wasn't a threat to America because if she were, \\"her parents would have documented it in some way.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] That's something I can appreciate as a father. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So Loretta seized the opportunities that her family gave her to build a distinguished life in public service. After Harvard College and Harvard Law School, she rose to become a strong, independent prosecutor. Loretta spent years in the trenches battling terrorism and financial fraud and cybercrime. She went from the Assistant U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of New York to Chief of the Long Island Office&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;Chief Assistant U.S. Attorney&mdash;Long Island in the House! And then U.S. Attorney. <p>She chased public corruption. She helped secure billions in settlements from some of the world's biggest banks accused of fraud. She jailed some of New York's most notorious and violent mobsters and gang members. She pursued some of the world's most dangerous terrorists and cyber criminals. <p>The law is her map; justice, her compass. She is tough, but she is fair. She is firm, but kind. Her intelligence and her judgment, her grace under fire have earned the trust and admiration of those she works with and those she serves and even those she goes up against. <p>In fact, it's funny that we are \\"installing\\" Loretta today&mdash;it's not like she's been waiting around for the embossed invitation. She hit the ground running from day one. She's already made her mark here at home and abroad because of her laser focus on the core mission of the Justice Department: the protection of the American people. <p>And she understands the importance of policing and improving relationships between law enforcement and communities. She went on a six-city tour to spotlight the challenges in community policing and the progress that's being made. She understands the importance of criminal justice reform: that we have to be smart on crime, not just tough. That's why she's committed to working as a partner to leaders with both parties who want to pursue reform that continues the trend of a falling crime rate and a falling incarceration rate. <p>She understands the importance of protecting our national security while also securing our civil liberties. That's why she will safeguard the programs that are critical to protecting American lives and Americans' privacy. I see our FBI Director, Jim Comey, who's here, and I know he's committed to doing the same thing. <p>She lives out the words of one of our greatest Attorney Generals, Robert F. Kennedy: \\"The glory of justice and the majesty of the law are created not just by the Constitution, nor by the courts, nor by the officers of the law, nor by the lawyers, but by the men and women who constitute our society&mdash;who are protectors of the law as they are themselves protected by the law.\\" <p>That's always been the story of our Nation. Our strength does not come from the words we've written on the page or the laws we've put down on the books. It comes from ordinary citizens, generation after generation, who do their part to uphold our founding ideals. It comes from an unshakable faith in our ability to stand up for what is right and to admit where we've fallen short and then choose a better way forward. That was the cause to which Loretta dedicated her life long before she became America's top law enforcement officer. Today, the American people can have no greater advocate for their right to equality under the law, no greater partner in securing justice for all than our Attorney General, Loretta Lynch. <p>[<i>At this point, Supreme Court Associate Justice Sonia M. Sotomayor administered the oath of office. Attorney General Lynch then made brief remarks.</i>]\" "
"136" "\"[<i>At this point, the President approached the podium with the Presidential seal affixed</i>.] <p><i>The President.</i> That's right. It's the one with the sign on it there. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member</i>. Yeah! <p><i>The President</i>. How is everybody doing today? Well, I want to welcome everybody to the South Lawn. And usually, it's broiling hot when we have our congressional picnic, so this is one of those days where we actually welcome a little cloud cover. <p>I'm going to be very brief because I want to shake as many hands as I can, although I want to warn in advance, I can't do a selfie with everybody. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member.</i> How about a kiss? <p><i>The President.</i> A kiss I can give you. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>The&mdash;my main message is, as is always true at this wonderful event, is just to say thank you. America faces enormous challenges. We face the challenge of making sure that the economy works for everybody and everybody has opportunity. We have international challenges from terrorism to climate change. But the thing that always gives me confidence that we're going to meet these challenges is because the American people are good and they are decent, and we've got a democracy that, as frustrating and messy as it can be sometimes, still represents the best hope for freedom and prosperity for any society. <p>And we are the longest continuous democracy on Earth. We have set the model and the tone for people around the world who aspire to the values that we cherish so dearly. There's a reason why, from every corner of the globe, striving, hopeful, talented people still want to come to the United States of America. And our job, together&mdash;mine as President and those of you who are serving in Congress&mdash;is to make sure that we are true to that commitment and true to those values. <p>And obviously, democracy can be contentious. There are times where people have deep, principled disagreements. But I hope that events like today remind us that ultimately, we're all on the same team, and that's the American team. <p>I also want to say thank you to the families, because there is enormous burdens that are placed on the spouses and the children of those who serve in Congress. I know&mdash;and Michelle knows really well&mdash;the nature of those burdens. And for you to sacrifice in your own ways is the only way that we are able to serve. And so we are very, very grateful for your support and your sacrifice. <p>And for the members of the staffs who are here, we want to say thank you as well, because you make us look good. And you have all the sacrifices, but you don't always get the attention. And we know that you work really, really hard to make this possible as well. So we are grateful to you. <p>So I want everybody to have fun. Eat up. And I do want to also say how wildly impressed I was at the quality of baseball when I went out to Nat Stadium the other day. You guys actually looked like you knew what you were doing! [<i>Laughter</i>] Flake, I saw you, man, at bat. You were all right. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So enjoy. Thank you. God bless you guys. Thank you. Oh, and can everybody please give it up for our outstanding Marine Band? They're the best. They can play anything!\" "
"137" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. This morning I spoke with, and Vice President Biden spoke with, Mayor Joe Riley and other leaders of Charleston to express our deep sorrow over the senseless murders that took place last night. <p>Michelle and I know several members of Emanuel AME Church. We knew their pastor, Reverend Clementa Pinckney, who, along with eight others, gathered in prayer and fellowship and was murdered last night. And to say our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families and their community doesn't say enough to convey the heartache and the sadness and the anger that we feel. <p>Any death of this sort is a tragedy. Any shooting involving multiple victims is a tragedy. There is something particularly heartbreaking about the death happening in a place in which we seek solace and we seek peace, in a place of worship. <p>And Mother Emanuel is, in fact, more than a church. This is a place of worship that was founded by African Americans seeking liberty. This is a church that was burned to the ground because its worships&mdash;worshipers worked to end slavery. When there were laws banning all-Black church gatherings, they conducted services in secret. When there was a nonviolent movement to bring our country closer in line with our highest ideals, some of our brightest leaders spoke and led marches from this church's steps. This is a sacred place in the history of Charleston and in the history of America. <p>The FBI is now on the scene with local police, and more of the Bureau's best are on the way to join them. The Attorney General has announced plans for the FBI to open a hate crime investigation. We understand that the suspect is in custody. And I'll let the best of law enforcement do its work to make sure that justice is served. <p>Until the investigation is complete, I'm necessarily constrained in terms of talking about the details of the case. But I don't need to be constrained about the emotions that tragedies like this raise. I've had to make statements like this too many times. Communities like this have had to endure tragedies like this too many times. We don't have all the facts, but we do know that, once again, innocent people were killed in part because someone who wanted to inflict harm had no trouble getting their hands on a gun. <p>Now is the time for mourning and for healing. But let's be clear: At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn't happen in other places with this kind of frequency. And it is in our power to do something about it. I say that recognizing the politics in this town foreclose a lot of those avenues right now. But it would be wrong for us not to acknowledge it. And at some point, it's going to be important for the American people to come to grips with it and for us to be able to shift how we think about the issue of gun violence collectively. <p>The fact that this took place in a Black church obviously also raises questions about a dark part of our history. This is not the first time that Black churches have been attacked. And we know that hatred across races and faiths pose a particular threat to our democracy and our ideals. The good news is, I am confident that the outpouring of unity and strength and fellowship and love across Charleston today from all races, from all faiths, from all places of worship indicates the degree to which those old vestiges of hatred can be overcome. That certainly was Dr. King's hope just over 50 years ago, after four little girls were killed in a bombing in a Black church in Birmingham, Alabama. <p>He said, \\"They lived meaningful lives,\\" and \\"they died nobly.\\" \\"They say to each of us,\\" Dr. King said, \\"Black and White alike, that we must substitute courage for caution. They say to us that we must be concerned not merely with [about; White House correction.] who murdered them, but about the system, the way of life, the philosophy which produced the murderers. Their death says to us that we must work passionately and unrelentingly for the realization of the American Dream. <p>\\"And if one will hold on, he will discover that God walks with him, and that God is able to lift you from the fatigue of despair to the buoyancy of hope, and transform dark and desolate valleys into sunlit paths of inner peace.\\" <p>Reverend Pinckney and his congregation understood that spirit. Their Christian faith compelled them to reach out not just to members of their congregation or to members of their own communities, but to all in need. They opened their doors to strangers who might enter a church in search of healing or redemption. <p>Mother Emanuel church and its congregation have risen before&mdash;from flames, from an earthquake, from other dark times&mdash;to give hope to generations of Charlestonians. And with our prayers and our love, and the buoyancy of hope, it will rise again now as a place of peace. <p>Thank you.\" "
"138" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you, Mayors! Thank you so much. I love being with mayors. [<i>Laughter</i>] It is great to be here, although I did worry a little bit that Dennis Johnson would introduce me again. At the White House, he had the old Bulls theme song, and it set a very high bar, as if I was Michael Jordan coming out. [<i>Laughter</i>] And he is a great friend, and I very much appreciate him, as I do so many of the mayors here. I saw a lot of you in Washington in January. I thought, I had such a good time, let's meet this summer as well. And this time, I thought I'd come to you. <p>I want to thank our host, San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee. He was just in the White House for the San Francisco Giants' championship visit. I know how excited the Bay Area is over the Golden State Warriors' championship. <p>I want to thank two outstanding public servants, Governor Jerry Brown and Leader Nancy Pelosi, who are here with us today. And I want to thank this year's leaders of the Conference of Mayors: Kevin Johnson, Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, and Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett. <p>I also want to mention a few outstanding mayors who are getting ready to step down: Michael Nutter of Philadelphia has done outstanding work; Greg Ballard of Indianapolis, an outstanding mayor, doing great work with \\"My Brother's Keeper\\"&mdash;thank you; Annise Parker of Houston, I love Annise; and my dear, old friend, Michael Coleman of Columbus, Ohio. <p>And finally, a great mayor, one of my favorite people, and I know one of the people all of you admire so much, a great mayor, Joe Riley of Charleston. Joe is back home doing one of a mayor's sadder, more important duties today. <p>Obviously, the entire country has been shocked and heartbroken by what happened in Charleston. The nature of this attack&mdash;in a place of worship, where congregants invite in a stranger to worship with them, only to be gunned down&mdash;adds to the pain. The apparent motivations of the shooter remind us that racism remains a blight that we have to combat together. We have made great progress, but we have to be vigilant because it still lingers. And when it's poisoning the minds of young people, it betrays our ideals and tears our democracy apart. <p>But as much as we grieve this particular tragedy, I think it's important, as I mentioned at the White House, to step back and recognize, these tragedies have become far too commonplace. <p>Few people understand the terrible toll of gun violence like mayors do. And whether it's a mass shooting like the one in Charleston or individual attacks of violence that add up over time, it tears at the fabric of a community. It costs you money, and it costs resources. It costs this country dearly. <p>More than 11,000 Americans were killed by gun violence in 2013 alone&mdash;11,000. If Congress had passed some commonsense gun safety reforms after Newtown, after a group of children had been gunned down in their own classroom, reforms that 90 percent of the American people supported, we wouldn't have prevented every act of violence, or even most. We don't know if it would have prevented what happened in Charleston. No reform can guarantee the elimination of violence. But we might still have some more Americans with us. We might have stopped one shooter. Some families might still be whole. You all might have to attend fewer funerals. <p>And we should be strong enough to acknowledge this. At the very least, we should be able to talk about this issue as citizens, without demonizing all gun owners who are overwhelmingly law abiding, but also without suggesting that any debate about this involves a wild-eyed plot to take everybody's guns away. <p>I know today's politics makes it less likely that we see any sort of serious gun safety legislation. I remarked that it was very unlikely that this Congress would act. And some reporters, I think, took this as resignation. I want to be clear: I am not resigned. I have faith we will eventually do the right thing. I was simply making the point that we have to move public opinion. We have to feel a sense of urgency. <p>Ultimately, Congress will follow the people. And we have to stop being confused about this. At some point, as a country, we have to reckon with what happens. It is not good enough simply to show sympathy. <p>You don't see murder on this kind of scale, with this kind of frequency, in any other advanced nation on Earth. Every country has violent, hateful, or mentally unstable people. What's different is, not every country is awash with easily accessible guns. And so I refuse to act as if this is the new normal or to pretend that it's simply sufficient to grieve and that any mention of us doing something to stop it is somehow politicizing the problem. <p>We need a change in attitudes among everybody: lawful gun owners, those who are unfamiliar with guns. We have to have a conversation about it and fix this. <p>And ultimately, Congress acts when the public insists on action. And we've seen how public opinion can change. We've seen it change on gay marriage. We've seen it beginning to change on climate change. We've got to shift how we think about this issue. And we have the capacity to change, but we have to feel a sense of urgency about it. We, as a people, have got to change. That's how we honor those families. That's how we honor the families in Newtown. That's how we honor the families in Aurora. <p>Now, the first time I spoke at this conference, in 2008, I said that American cities shouldn't be succeeding despite Washington, they should be succeeding with some help from Washington. And as President, I've made it a priority to partner with mayors like you. That's why I've named three former mayors to my Cabinet. That's why I asked a former president of this conference, Jerry Abramson, to be one of my top advisers. That's why my staff and I work with mayors across the country just about every day, on just about every issue under the sun, from school reform to community policing, from business development to veterans homelessness. <p>Because mayors have to get the job done. If you're a mayor, it's not sufficient to just blather on. [<i>Laughter</i>] You actually have to do something. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's not enough to figure out how do I position myself on a particular issue to minimize the possibility that I might get in trouble or criticized, because people expect you to trim the trees and pave the roads and pick up the garbage and educate our kids and police our streets. Whatever the problem, large or small, you got to do everything you can to solve it. You don't let partisanship stop you. You don't let cynicism stop you. You're always in the hunt for good ideas, no matter where they come from. <p>And I'm going to embarrass Jerry for a second. He took his wife to Paris a few years after they got married. And she took in all the splendor of the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es. And he took photos of garbage cans. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's a mayor for you. [<i>Laughter</i>] So she teased him about it. She said, there's the Eiffel Tower. There's the Seine. And he said, \\"Those are some beautiful garbage cans!\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] And soon enough, downtown Louisville had garbage cans that looked a lot like the Parisian garbage cans. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>That's a mayor, right there! [<i>Laughter</i>] Somebody who's always thinking about how to make his or her city better&mdash;even on vacation in Paris&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and stops at nothing to get it done. <p>Now, as President, I'm constantly thinking about how we, together, can keep growing the economy and growing new pathways of opportunity for the American people to get ahead. And across the country, the good news is, we're making progress. And you're seeing it in your cities. More than 12 million new private sector jobs in the past 5 years; more than 16 million Americans who have gained health insurance; more jobs creating more clean energy. Here in California, solar is growing crazy. We're producing 10 times as much solar power today as we did when I came into office&mdash;10 times; 3 times as much wind power, double the amount of clean energy. More kids graduating from high school and college than ever before. <p>I'm proud of that record. And by the way, we've done it while reducing the deficit by two-thirds. You don't hear that that much, but let me just point that out. And I'm proud of it particularly when it's so hard to get anything through Congress, even when we're talking about issues that most Americans outside of Washington agree on. <p>But that's also why we've partnered with many of you over the past couple of years: to make real progress on the economic priorities that matter to middle class Americans. We're working with many of you to help working families make ends meet and feel more secure in a changing economy. So far, 19 cities have enacted paid sick leave&mdash;sick days; 5 States enacted paid sick days or paid family leave. Oregon is set to join them soon. Seventeen States have raised their minimum wage; 27 cities and counties have taken action to raise the wage as well. <p>We're working with many of you to help working families earn higher wages down the road with skills and education they need. Seattle, a city with a Democratic mayor, Ed Murray, just passed universal pre-K. Indianapolis, a city with a Republican mayor, Greg Ballard, is starting citywide preschool scholarships. Thirty-four States have increased funding for preschool as well, which means even more young people getting the early enrichment that can pay off over a lifetime. <p>Three months ago, I launched an initiative called TechHire to help train workers for the high-skill, high-wage jobs of tomorrow. Twenty-one communities have signed up for TechHire so far, and we're looking to double that number. So if your town has tech jobs that need filling, the people who want to fill them, come join us. <p>We're working with many of you to generate more high-wage jobs for our workers to fill. Eleven cities have joined a new initiative called Startup in a Day to help entrepreneurs apply for all the licenses and permits they need to start a business in just one day. Cut the redtape. We're working with cities to create a network of high-tech manufacturing hubs to keep America at the forefront of innovation. The first hub in Youngstown, Ohio, is doing cutting-edge research in 3-D printing and has already attracted tens of millions of dollars in investment to the region. <p>So we're creating jobs, we're training folks for jobs. We're also working with many of you to make our streets safer and our communities stronger. More than 230 local and tribal leaders have joined the \\"My Brother's Keeper\\" initiative and are taking meaningful steps to change the odds for young people in tough circumstances. Together, you're working to curb juvenile arrests, reduce absenteeism, and you're helping these kids imagine a bigger future for themselves. <p>Today, at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab just down the road, more than a hundred students from Oakland and San Francisco are participating in the first \\"MBK Day at the Lab,\\" where they can learn about STEM careers. <p>And meanwhile, from police holding impromptu town hall meetings in barbershops in Charlotte to Boston Police Academy improving how it trains cops to deal with young people on the job, cities like yours are striving to rebuild trust between law enforcement and communities, making sure police have the resources they need to do their job and making sure that every police officer who has an incredibly tough job is trained in making the kinds of connections with communities that engender trust and ensure that everybody is treated equally under the law, which makes for smart law enforcement and vindicates our values. <p>So these are just a few of the examples of the work that's being done. And I'd name every single way that we're working together to open new doors of opportunity for the American people, but we'd be here all day. So here is the bottom line. On America's most important economic priorities&mdash;from supporting working families to improving education, to creating good new jobs, to getting people to those new jobs, to improving affordable housing, to dealing with homelessness&mdash;cities are not standing still. You are moving forward. <p>So I want to say two things to you. Number one, thank you. Thank you for your leadership and your vision. And I particularly want to thank you because more than just about any other office in the land, those who occupy the office of mayor are approaching it in a practical way. Democrats aren't clinging to dogmas and are partnering with businesses anywhere they can. And Republicans aren't clinging to their dogmas; they're recognizing that government has a role to play in helping make for a vibrant city and expanding opportunity. <p>And that commonsense, problem-solving, can-do attitude, that's what the American people are looking for. That's what they need. So I want to say thank you to all of you. You're setting a good example. <p>Now, second, I also want to say, don't stop now, because we've still got a lot more work to do. We've got to keep pushing to grow our economy so that more Americans who work hard feel like their hard work is paying off, which is why I'm working with Congress to pass new 21st-century trade agreements with higher standards and tougher protections than past agreements. And I appreciate the help of many of the mayors here to get that done, because you know it's important to your cities. I believe it's the right thing to do for American workers and families, or I would not be doing it. I want to thank all of you who helped me make that case: that this matters to your cities. <p>We've got to keep pushing to put people to work rebuilding our infrastructure. There's not a mayor here who can't reel off 10 infrastructure projects right now that you'd love to get funding for and that would put people to work right away and improve your competitiveness and help businesses move their products and help people get to their jobs. We can keep paying the costs of patching over our existing infrastructure: more expensive, less efficient, leading to higher commute times, more waste. That's an option. Or we can create tens of thousands of jobs right now building a 21st-century infrastructure that makes us competitive well into the 21st century. That's what we need to do. We've just got to convince Congress to make it happen. And I need mayors to help, from all across the country. Put some pressure on Congress to get this done. <p>We've got to keep pushing to prepare for the impacts of climate change, because it's science. It's a fact. It's like gravity. [<i>Laughter</i>] I&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member. </i>Yes, it is. <p><i>The President.</i> It is! <p>A lot of cities have gone far ahead on this issue, along with States. You're making a difference right now. You're not waiting for Congress. Mayor Roy Buol is here from Dubuque, Iowa. They've set a target to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions 50 percent from 2003 levels by the end of the next decade. Just met with Governor Jerry Brown. He's talking about how California, which so often has been a leader on environmental issues, is looking to partner and make a difference internationally. <p>Today my administration proposed new fuel standards for buses and tractor trailers and other heavy-duty vehicles, another important step towards reducing harmful carbon pollution and protecting our planet. <p>But a lot of this does come down to Congress. I know many of you are worried about Congress cutting programs that are important to your city's economic growth. But the battle we should be having with Congress isn't just about individual programs. It's about the foolish, self-destructive cuts that in Washington are known as the sequester, because with the sequester, the whole pie is smaller, so protecting one program means cutting another one. <p>That's why you're facing cuts that don't make any sense to things like TIGER grants, which are&mdash;you all know are so important to putting our people to work rebuilding our infrastructure. That's the reason why it's so hard for us to get the funding we need to get homeless assistance grants, which help some of our most vulnerable neighbors and get them off the streets. That's why it's been so difficult to fund the preschool development grants, which help educate our children, which we know if we make that investment will pay off for your cities, your States, and for our country. <p>I've been clear: I will not sign bills at sequestration levels. I will not sign bills that seek to increase defense spending before addressing any of our needs here at home. <p>And I need your help. I need your help, Mayors, to talk to your Members of Congress to get rid of the sequester once and for all, because it is harming our cities and harming our country. There is no business&mdash;no successful business&mdash;that if it needed to reduce spending, would simply lop off 10 percent of everything or 15 percent of everything. That's not how any of us would run our household budget. You'd cut out things you don't need, but you'd still keep the college fund going. You'd still pay your health insurance bill and your mortgage note. There are things we have to do as a country to stay ahead. Once again, mayors understand that if there's a conflict between ideology and reality, you should opt for reality. Don't&mdash;[<i>Laughter</i>]&mdash;reality is a stubborn thing: facts, evidence, reason. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So thanks for your partnership. I want you to know that as long as I'm in the White House, I've got your back. I love the country, I love the suburbs, but I'm a city guy. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I know that when cities thrive, suburbs thrive. And when cities thrive, farmlands thrive. And when cities thrive, States thrive. And when cities thrive, America thrives. <p>You guys are making it happen. I enjoy working with each and every one of you. And I know that each of you takes pride in what makes your hometown unique. You may be proud of your pizza or your hoagies or your barbecue&mdash;even though everybody knows Chicago has the best pizza. [<i>Laughter</i>] You may be proud of your city's victory parades, even though we've got a Blackhawk parade that's pretty good. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm sure you're all very proud of your parks. We've got nice parks. Or the number of sunny days you've got, which we enjoy half the year. [<i>Laughter</i>] Chances are you've got a few superlatives ready when&mdash;in case somebody asks, \\"What makes your city so special?\\" That's what mayors do. You're boosters. <p>Yet as unique as your cities are, as proud &mdash;of&mdash;as you should be of your cities, we always remind ourselves we're also Americans. And we all want an America to be a place where our ZIP Code does not determine our destiny, where every kid, in whatever city, whatever hamlet, whatever town, has an equal shot at life when they grow up. No matter who you are or where you come from, you can make it if you try. <p>That's what's America is about. That's what you're fighting for every day. And I'm going to fight right there alongside with you. Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"139" "\"Hi, everybody. As President, I spend most of my time focused on what we can do to grow the economy and grow new pathways of opportunity for Americans like you to get ahead. <p>And we've made progress: more than 12 million new private sector jobs in the past 5 years, more than 16 million Americans who have gained health insurance, more jobs creating more clean energy, more kids graduating from high school and college than ever before. <p>But in a relentlessly changing economy, we've still got more work to do. And one of the things we should be doing, for example, is rewriting the rules of global trade to benefit American workers and American businesses. I think we should write those rules before China does. That's why I've been working with Congress to pass new, 21st-century trade agreements with standards that are higher and protections that are tougher than any past trade agreement. <p>I believe it's the right thing to do for American workers and families, or I wouldn't be doing it. I believe it's what will give us the competitive edge in a new economy, or I would not be doing it. Now, several Members of Congress disagree. That's why it's still tied up there, along with a lot of other good ideas that would create jobs. And eventually, I'm optimistic we'll get this done. <p>But America doesn't stand still. And that's why, on issue after issue where Congress has failed to act, my administration has partnered with mayors and Governors across the country to advance economic priorities that most working families in America are in favor of doing right now. <p>And we've had success. Over the past couple years, 17 States and 6 major cities have raised the minimum wage for their workers, 19 cities have enacted paid sick days, and 5 States have enacted paid sick days or paid family leave. Thirty-four States increased funding for quality pre-K, and 19 cities and States have signed up for our new TechHire initiative to train workers for the high-wage, high-skill jobs of tomorrow, the kind of jobs that new trade deals would help create. <p>Some of these victories have been small. Some have been quiet. But they've added up to a big difference for working families across America. And that's what matters to me the most, because it matters to you. On Friday, I talked about these initiatives and more in a speech to the U.S. Conference of Mayors. Check it out at whitehouse.gov. Some of it might matter to your city. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"140" "\"You don't have to all be this serious. [<i>Laughter</i>] Welcome to the White House. Now, I know that these are the longest days of the year, which is why I'm so glad that they put the first course down right away. [<i>Laughter</i>] I know you're hungry, and I promise to be brief. <p>I want to thank the members of our diplomatic corps who are here today, as well as our Members of Congress and all those serving across Government who are joining us. And I especially want to recognize all the inspiring young people who are here today, many of whom I've put at my table. [<i>Laughter</i>] To all of you and to Muslim Americans across the country, <i>Ramadan Kareem.</i> <p>Our annual White House iftar recognizes the sacredness of Ramadan to more than 1.5 billion Muslims around the world. It's a time when Muslims recommit themselves to their faith, following days of discipline with nights of gratitude for the gifts that God bestows. It's a time of spiritual renewal and a reminder of one's duty to our fellow man: to serve one another and lift up the less fortunate. The Koran teaches that God's children should tread gently upon the Earth and, when confronted by ignorance, reply, \\"Peace.\\" In honoring these familiar values together&mdash;of peace and charity and forgiveness&mdash;we affirm that, whatever our faith, we're all one family. <p>Our iftar is also a reminder of the freedoms that bind us together as Americans, including the freedom of religion: that inviolable right to practice our faiths freely. That's what Samantha Elauf represents. She was determined to defend the right to wear a hijab, to have the same opportunities as everybody else. She went all the way to the Supreme Court, which I didn't do at her age. [<i>Laughter</i>] And she won. So, Samantha, we're very proud of you. <p>When our values are threatened, we come together as one Nation. When three young Muslim Americans were brutally murdered in Chapel Hill earlier this year, Americans of all faiths rallied around that community. And obviously, tonight our prayers remain with Charleston and Mother Emanuel church. As Americans, we insist that nobody should be targeted because of who they are or what they look like, who they love, how they worship. We stand united against these hateful acts. <p>These are the freedoms and the ideals and the values that we uphold. And it's more important than ever, because around the world and here at home, there are those who seek to divide us by religion or race or sect. Here in America, many people personally don't know someone who is Muslim. They mostly hear about Muslims in the news, and that can obviously lead to a very distorted impression. <p>We saw this play out recently at a mosque in Arizona. A group of protestors gathered outside with offensive signs against Islam and Muslims. And then, the mosque's leaders invited them inside to share in the evening prayer. One demonstrator, who accepted the invitation later, described how the experience changed him, how he finally saw the Muslim American community for what it is: peaceful and welcoming. That's what can happen when we stop yelling and start listening. That's why it's so important always to lift up the stories and voices of proud Americans who are contributing to our country every day. And we have a lot of inspiring Americans here today. They're Muslim Americans like Ziad Ahmed. As a Bangladeshi American growing up in New Jersey, he saw early on that there was not enough understanding in the world. So 2 years ago, he founded Redefy, a website to push back against harmful stereotypes by encouraging teens like him&mdash;he's only 16, I think our youngest guest tonight&mdash;to share their stories. Because, in Ziad's words, \\"ignorance can be defeated through education.\\" He wants to do his part to make sure that \\"Muslims can be equal members of society and still hold onto their faith and identity.\\" So we're very proud of you, Ziad. <p>They're Muslim Americans like Munira Khalif. And Munira is the daughter of Somali immigrants; she started an organization to support girls' education in East Africa. She just graduated from high school in Minnesota. She's already lobbied Congress to pass the Girls Count Act so that girls in the developing world are documented at birth, a bill I was proud to sign into law last week. She's even spoken at the United Nations. I was also not doing this at her age. [<i>Laughter</i>] This fall, Munira is heading to Harvard to continue her education in public service, which was a tough choice, because of course she was accepted to all the Ivy League schools she applied to. [<i>Laughter</i>] But we are very, very proud of you, and I know your community is as well. <p>They're Muslim Americans like Batoul Abuharb, who was born in a refugee camp in Gaza, and when she was an infant her family moved to Houston. After graduating from Rice University, she spent a summer in Gaza working with the U.N. health clinic. After seeing people line up whenever new stocks of vaccines arrived, she started Dunia Health to improve the distribution of vaccines and tell families when to come in, all over text message. They've started with Palestinian refugees in Jordan, but the program has been so successful that the U.N. is looking to expand Dunia's work to more countries across the Middle East. Batoul, we're very proud of you. Congratulations. <p>So, Ziad, Munira, Batoul&mdash;they all talk about how much they value the opportunities they've had to succeed here in the United States. And they also remind us that our obligations to care for one another extend beyond our immediate communities, beyond our borders. So tonight we keep in our prayers those who are suffering around the world, including those marking Ramadan in areas of conflict and deprivation and hunger: the people of Iraq and Syria as they push back on thebarbarity of ISIL; the people of Yemen and Libya, who are seeking an end to ongoing violence and instability; those fleeing war and hardship in boats across the Mediterranean; the people of Gaza, still recovering from last year's conflict; the Rohingya in Myanmar, including migrants at sea, whose human rights must be upheld. <p>We're proud, by the way, to have Wai Wai Nu with us tonight, a former political prisoner who's working on human rights issues for the Rohingya and equal rights for women. So we're glad to have you here with us tonight. <p>So these challenges around the world and here at home demand the very qualities you summon every day during Ramadan: sacrifice, discipline, patience. A resilience that says we don't simply endure, but we overcome. That together, we can overcome ignorance and prejudice. Together, we will overcome conflict and injustice, not just with words, but with deeds. With what a hero of mine, the civil rights icon John Lewis, calls using our feet: getting out in the real world to organize and to create the change that we seek. That's what so many of you do every single day. And that's what we have to continue to do together, here in America and around the world. As the Koran teaches, let us answer with \\"Peace.\\" <p>May God bless you all. Have a wonderful Ramadan. And get back to dinner. [<i>Laughter</i>] All right? Thank you very much.\" "
"141" "\"Good afternoon. Since 9/11, more than 80 Americans have been taken hostage by murderous groups engaged in terrorism or privacy. For these innocent men and women&mdash;tourists, journalists, humanitarians&mdash;it's a horror and cruelty beyond description. For their families and for their friends, it's an unrelenting nightmare that the rest of us cannot even begin to imagine. <p>As a Government, we should always do everything in our power to bring these Americans home safe and to support their families. Dedicated public servants across our Government work tirelessly to do so. Our military personnel risk their lives in dangerous missions, such as the operation I authorized last year that attempted to rescue Americans held in Syria and Yemen. And there have been successes, such as the rescue of Captain Richard Phillips, held by Somali pirates, and Jessica Buchanan, rescued from Somalia. <p>Of these more than 80 Americans taken hostage since 9/11, more than half have ultimately come home, some after many years. Tragically, too many others have not. And at this very moment, Americans continue to be held by terrorist groups or detained unjustly by foreign governments. For them, the nightmare goes on, and so does our work, day and night, to reunite them with their loved ones. <p>As I've said before, the terrorist threat is evolving. The world has been appalled by ISIL's barbaric murder of innocent hostages, including Americans. Moreover, the families of hostages have told us&mdash;and they've told me directly&mdash;about their frequent frustrations in dealing with their own Government: how different departments and agencies aren't always coordinated, how there's been confusion and conflicting information about what the Government is prepared to do to help, how they've often felt lost in the bureaucracy, and how, in some cases, families feel that they've been threatened for exploring certain options to bring their loved ones home. <p>That's totally unacceptable. Now, as I've gotten to know some of these families and heard some of these stories, it has been my solemn commitment to make sure that they feel fully supported in their efforts to get their families home and that there is a syncing up of what I know to be sincere, relentless efforts within Government and the families who obviously have one priority and one priority only, and that's getting their loved ones back. <p>These families have already suffered enough, and they should never feel ignored or victimized by their own Government. Diane Foley, whose son Jim was killed by ISIL last year, said, \\"As Americans, we can do better.\\" I totally agree. We must do better. And that's why I ordered a comprehensive review of our hostage policy. <p>I want to thank everybody who contributed to this review, inside and outside of Government, some of whom are here today. I especially want to thank the former hostages and families who contributed. I've come to know some of these families, often under the most heartbreaking of circumstances. When her son Peter, also known as Abdul-Rahman, was being held in Syria, his mother Paula Kassig wrote me a letter. And in it, she described how on clear nights she and her husband would look up at the stars and the Moon and wonder if, perhaps, their son might be able to see them too, a reminder of the bond they might still share. I've called these families to offer our condolences after they've received gut-wrenching news no parents ever want to hear. I've visited with them. I've hugged them. I've grieved with them. I just spent time with some of the families, as well as some former hostages here at the White House. And needless to say, it was a very emotional meeting. Some are still grieving. <p>I thanked them for sharing their experiences and their ideas with our review team. In fact, many of the changes we're announcing today are a direct result of their recommendations. I acknowledged to them in private what I want to say publicly: that it is true that there have been times where our Government, regardless of good intentions, has let them down. I promised them that we can do better. Here's how. <p>Today I'm formally issuing a new Presidential policy directive to improve how we work to bring home American hostages and how we support their families. I've signed a new Executive order to ensure our Government is organized to do so. And we're releasing the final report of our review, which describes the two dozen specific steps that we're taking. Broadly speaking, they fall into three areas. <p>First, I'm updating our hostage policy. I'm making it clear that our top priority is the safe and rapid recovery of American hostages. And to do so, we will use all elements of our national power. I am reaffirming that the United States Government will not make concessions, such as paying ransom, to terrorist groups holding American hostages. And I know this can be a subject of significant public debate. It's a difficult and emotional issue, especially for the families. As I said to the families who are gathered here today, and as I've said to families in the past, I look at this not just as a President, but also as a husband and a father. And if my family were at risk, obviously, I would move heaven and earth to get those loved ones back. <p>As President, I also have to consider our larger national security. I firmly believe that the United States Government paying ransom to terrorists risks endangering more Americans and funding the very terrorism that we're trying to stop. And so I firmly believe that our policy ultimately puts fewer Americans at risk. <p>At the same time, we are clarifying that our policy does not prevent communication with hostage takers: by our Government, the families of hostages, or third parties who help these families. And when appropriate, our Government may assist these families and private efforts in those communications, in part, to ensure the safety of family members and to make sure that they're not defrauded. So my message to these families was simple: We're not going to abandon you. We will stand by you. <p>Second, we're making changes to ensure that our Government is better organized around this mission. Every department that is involved in our national security apparatus cares deeply about these hostages, prioritizes them, and works really hard. But they're not always as well coordinated as they need to be. Under the National Security Council here at the White House, we're setting up a new Hostage Response Group, comprised of senior officials from across our Government who will be responsible for ensuring that our hostage policies are consistent and coordinated and implemented rapidly and effectively. And they will be accountable at the highest levels; they'll be accountable to me. <p>Soon, I'll be designating as well a senior diplomat as my Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, who will be focused solely on leading our diplomatic efforts with other countries to bring our people home. <p>At the operational level, we're creating for the first time one central hub where experts from across Government will work together, side-by-side, as one coordinated team to find American hostages and bring them home safely. In fact, this fusion cell, located at the FBI, is already up and running. And we're designating a new official in the intelligence community to be responsible for coordinating the collection, analysis, and rapid dissemination of intelligence related to American hostages so we can act on that intelligence quickly. <p>Third, and running through all these efforts, we are fundamentally changing how our Government works with families of hostages. Many of the families told us that they at times felt like an afterthought or a distraction, that too often the law enforcement or military and intelligence officials they were interacting with were begrudging in giving them information. And that ends today. I'm making it clear that these families are to be treated like what they are: our trusted partners and active partners in the recovery of their loved ones. We are all on the same team, and nobody cares more about bringing home these Americans than their own families, and we have to treat them as partners. <p>So, specifically, our new fusion cell will include a person dedicated to coordinating the support families get from the Government. This coordinator will ensure that we communicate with families better, with one clear voice, and that families get information that is timely and accurate. Working with the intelligence community, we will be sharing more intelligence with families. <p>And this coordinator will be the families' voice within Government, making sure that when decisions are made about their loved ones, their concerns are front and center. Everyone who deals with these families on a regular basis will be given additional training to ensure families are treated with the dignity and compassion that they deserve. In particular, I want to point out that no family of an American hostage has ever been prosecuted for paying a ransom for the return of their loved ones. And the last thing that we should ever do is to add to a family's pain with threats like that. <p>So the bottom line is this: When it comes to how our Government works to recover Americans held hostage and how we work with their families, we are changing how we do business. After everything they've endured, these families are right to be skeptical, and that's why it's so important, as I told them today, that we will be setting up mechanisms to ensure accountability and implementation. I've directed my national security team to report back to me, including getting feedback from the families to make sure that these reforms are being put in place and that they are working. <p>In the course of our review, several families told us they wanted to spare other families the frustrations they endured. Some have even created new organizations to support families like theirs or to honor their loved ones, such as the memorial foundation for Steven Sotloff, who wrote: \\"Everyone has two lives. The second one begins when you realize you only have one.\\" As a Government, and as a nation, we can learn from the example and the strength of their lives, the kind of strength we've seen in all these held hostages, including Kayla Mueller. <p>Kayla devoted her life to serving those in need around the world. To refugees in Syria who had lost everything, she was a source of comfort and hope. Before her tragic death, she was held by ISIL in Syria for a year and a half. And during her captivity, Kayla managed to smuggle a letter to her family. She said: \\"None of us could have known it would be this long, but I know I am also fighting from my side in the ways that I am able, and I have a lot of fight left in me. I am not breaking down, and I will not give in no matter how long it takes.\\" <p>Today my message to anyone who harms Americans is that we do not forget. Our reach is long. Justice will be done. My message to every American being held unjustly around the world who is fighting from the inside to survive another day, my message to their families who long to hold them once more, is that the United States of America will never stop working to reunite you with your family. We will not give up, no matter how long it takes. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "

And drinking the booze. I know that's right. Anyway, where was I? <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. There we go. I know that. <p>So the civil rights of LGBT Americans, this is an issue whose time has come. And we've got a lot to celebrate because of your hard work. And there are people here who have been working these issues for decades. And so this is something where it's bearing fruit today, but it has to do with courage that was happening in obscurity and incredible difficulty. And I am so honored to be a part of seeing all that hard work pay off. <p>A lot of what we've accomplished over these last 6&frac12; years has been because of you. Because of the groundwork that you and so many of you laid before, from sophisticated national campaigns to small, quiet acts of defiance, together, we've been able to do more to protect the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans than at any time in our history. <p>Together, we ended \\"don't ask, don't tell.\\" We passed a historic hate crimes bill named in part after Matthew Shepard. We lifted the HIV entry ban, and this summer, we're going to be updating our national HIV/AIDS strategy which will focus on eliminating disparities that gay and bisexual men and transgender women face. We strengthened the Violence Against Women Act to protect LGBT victims. Hospitals that accept Medicare and Medicaid are now required to treat LGBT patients the same as everybody else. The pillar of the so-called Defense of Marriage Act was struck down by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional. Just yesterday we announced that insurance companies that cover Federal workers will no longer be able to prohibit gender transition services. <p>And of course, we're now awaiting the Supreme Court's ruling on whether same-sex couples nationwide have the equal right to marry. There are a few decisions coming down these next few days&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that I'm paying close attention to. But however the decision comes down on the marriage issue, one thing is undeniable: There has been this incredible shift in attitudes across the country. <p>When I became President, same-sex marriage was legal in only two States. Today, it's legal in 37 States and the District of Columbia. A decade ago, politicians ran against LGBT rights. Today, they're running towards them. [<i>Laughter</i>] Right? Because they've learned what the rest of the country knows: that marriage equality is about our civil rights and our firm belief that every citizen should be treated equally under the law. <p>Now, we all know there's a lot more that we can and must do. In 2015, at a time when we have laws that say Americans can't be fired for the color of their skin or their religion or if they have a disability, it is wrong that hard-working Americans still live in fear of being fired simply because of who they are or who they love. <p>That's why I've repeatedly called on Congress to pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would explicitly prohibit discrimination against LGBT workers. And that's why we've got to keep the pressure on until they do it. <p>In the meantime, we're doing what we can to protect workers. Last year, my administration prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity by Federal contractors, for Federal employees. And that's protecting an estimated 1.5 million Americans. <p>I support efforts to ban conversion therapy for minors. It has no basis in science. Every young person, no matter who they are or what they look like or what gender they identify as, deserves to be valued and loved for who they are. <p>In just the past year, America has come far in its acceptance of transgender Americans. And we've got brave folks coming out at the highest levels of business and government and in sports and in Hollywood. We're seeing television shows portray transgender characters and families. And the power of example is slowly but surely changing people's hearts. <p>But we know that transgender persons still face terrible violence and abuse and poverty here at home and around the world. <p><i>Audience member.</i> President Obama, we love you! You must know that transsexuals love you. <p><i>The President.</i> Well, see&mdash;that's the kind of heckling I can always accept. <p>But too&mdash;seriously, too many folks are still targeted, and transgender women of color are particularly vulnerable. So that kind of ugliness simply doesn't belong in America. That's not who we are. <p>And the truth is that courage comes in a lot of forms. There's courage in the moment of danger, the kind our troops show in battle. There's the courage of resilience and perseverance, what we see in our brave wounded warriors. There's moral courage of the sort we saw in Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Harvey Milk, who fight for their ideals. And then, there's the kind of courage it takes to be true to yourself even if society doesn't always accept or understand you. <p>And nobody has got a monopoly on that kind of courage. It can come from all walks of life. And to a young boy or girl out there struggling with their own identity, the folks in this room are heroes, have shown extraordinary courage. Not only are you helping others find the strength to be true to who they are, you're helping America be true to who we are as a nation. <p>And that's ultimately what this Pride Month is all about. It's about commemorating the bravery at Stonewall, when in the face of hatred and violence, a group of Americans decided to stand up for their rights to be who they are. It's about celebrating the extraordinary progress we've made in making sure that LGBT Americans can enjoy their rights to pursue life, liberty, and happiness. But it's also about pride in who we are as a nation. We are big and vast and diverse. We've got different backgrounds and different beliefs. We've got different experiences and stories. But we are bound by our shared ideal that no matter who you are or what you look like, where you come from, who you love, this is a place where you should be able to write your own ticket and be who you are and revel in your true self. We're a people who believe enough in America's promise to make it real for everybody. <p>And those of us who know freedom and opportunity, thanks to the toil and blood of those who came before us, we have an extra responsibility to extend freedom and opportunity to other people who are still marginalized and still facing injustice: working families who aren't getting paid a living wage; women who aren't getting paid equally for their efforts; immigrants who deserve to have a pathway to be able to get right with the law; anybody who is treated differently because of the color of their skin or the nature of their faith; anybody whose right to vote is threatened. <p>So there are still battles to wage, more hearts and minds to change. As long as there's a single child in America that's afraid they won't be accepted for who they are, we've got more work to do. But if the people in this room and our friends and allies across the country have proven anything, it's that even in the toughest of circumstances, against the greatest possible odds, in America, change is possible. It's in our hands. Together, I know we'll get there. Look how far we've already come. <p>Thank you. God bless you. Thank you, guys.\" "
"143" "\"Good morning, everybody. Have a seat. Five years ago, after nearly a century of talk, decades of trying, a year of bipartisan debate, we finally declared that in America, health care is not a privilege for a few, but a right for all. <p>Over those 5 years, as we've worked to implement the Affordable Care Act, there have been successes and setbacks. The setbacks I remember clearly. [<i>Laughter</i>] But as the dust has settled, there can be no doubt that this law is working. It has changed, and in some cases saved, American lives. It set this country on a smarter, stronger course. <p>And today, after more than 50 votes in Congress to repeal or weaken this law, after a Presidential election based in part on preserving or repealing this law, after multiple challenges to this law before the Supreme Court, the Affordable Care Act is here to stay. <p>This morning the Court upheld a critical part of this law: the part that's made it easier for Americans to afford health insurance regardless of where you live. If the partisan challenge to this law had succeeded, millions of Americans would have had thousands of dollars' worth of tax credits taken from them. For many, insurance would have become unaffordable again. Many would have become uninsured again. Ultimately, everyone's premiums could have gone up. America would have gone backwards. And that's not what we do. That's not what America does. We move forward. <p>So today is a victory for hard-working Americans all across this country whose lives will continue to become more secure in a changing economy because of this law. <p>If you're a parent, you can keep your kids on your plan until they turn 26, something that has covered millions of young people so far. That's because of this law. <p>If you're a senior or an American with a disability, this law gives you discounts on your prescriptions, something that has saved 9 million Americans an average of $1,600 so far. <p>If you're a woman, you can't be charged more than anybody else, even if you've had cancer or your husband had heart disease or just because you're a woman. Your insurer has to offer free preventive services like mammograms. They can't place annual or lifetime caps on your care because of this law. <p>Because of this law and because of today's decision, millions of Americans who I hear from every single day will continue to receive the tax credits that have given about 8 in 10 people who buy insurance on the new marketplaces the choice of a health care plan that costs less than a hundred dollars a month. <p>And when it comes to preexisting conditions, someday our grandkids will ask us if there was really a time when America discriminated against people who get sick. Because that is something this law has ended for good. That affects everybody with health insurance, not just folks who got insurance through the Affordable Care Act. All of America has protections it didn't have before. As the law's provisions have gradually taken effect, more than 16 million uninsured Americans have gained coverage so far. Nearly one in three Americans who was uninsured a few years ago is insured today. The uninsured rate in America is the lowest since we began to keep records. And that is something we can all be proud of. <p>Meanwhile, the law has helped hold the price of health care to its slowest growth in 50 years. If your family gets insurance through your job&mdash;so you're not using the Affordable Care Act&mdash;you're still paying about $1,800 less per year on average than you would be if we hadn't done anything. By one leading measure, what business owners pay out in wages and salaries is now finally growing faster than what they spend on health insurance. That hasn't happened in 17 years, and that's good for workers, and it's good for the economy. <p>The point is, this is not an abstract thing anymore. This is not a set of political talking points. This is reality. We can see how it is working. This law's law is working as&mdash;exactly as it's supposed to. In many ways, this law is working better than we expected it to. For all the misinformation campaigns, all the doomsday predictions, all the talk of death panels and job destruction, for all the repeal attempts, this law is now helping tens of millions of Americans. <p>And they've told me that it has changed their lives for the better. I've had moms come up and say, \\"My son was able to see a doctor and get diagnosed and catch a tumor early, and he's alive today because of this law.\\" This law is working. And it's going to keep doing just that. <p>Five years in, this is no longer about a law. This is not about the Affordable Care Act as legislation or Obamacare as a political football. This is health care in America. <p>And unlike Social Security or Medicare, a lot of Americans still don't know what Obamacare is beyond all the political noise in Washington. Across the country, there remain people who are directly benefiting from the law, but don't even know it. And that's okay. There's no card that says \\"Obamacare\\" when you enroll. But that's by design, for this has never been a Government takeover of health care, despite cries to the contrary. This reform remains what it's always been: a set of fairer rules and tougher protections that have made health care in America more affordable, more attainable, and more about you, the consumer, the American people. It's working. <p>And with this case behind us, let's be clear: We've still got work to do to make health care in America even better. We'll keep working to provide consumers with all the tools you need to make informed choices about your care. We'll keep working to increase the use of preventive care that avoids bigger problems down the road. We'll keep working to boost the steadily improving quality of care in hospitals and bring down costs even lower, make the system work even better. Already, we've seen reductions, for example, in the number of readmissions at hospitals. That saves our society money, it saves families money, makes people healthier. <p>We're making progress. We're going to keep working to get more people covered. I'm going to work as hard as I can to convince more Governors and State legislatures to take advantage of the law, put politics aside, and expand Medicaid and cover their citizens. We've still got States out there that, for political reasons, are not covering millions of people that they could be covering, despite the fact that the Federal Government is picking up the tab. <p>So we've got more work to do. But what we're not going to do is unravel what has now been woven into the fabric of America. And my greatest hope is that rather than keep refighting battles that have been settled again and again and again, I can work with Republicans and Democrats to move forward. Let's join together, make health care in America even better. Three generations ago, we chose to end an era when seniors were left to languish in poverty. We passed Social Security, and slowly, it was woven into the fabric of America and made a difference in the lives of millions of people. Two generations ago, we chose to end an age when Americans in their golden years didn't have the guarantee of health care. Medicare was passed, and it helped millions of people. <p>This generation of Americans chose to finish the job: to turn the page on a past when our citizens could be denied coverage just for being sick, to close the books on a history where tens of millions of Americans had no hope of finding decent, affordable health care, had to hang their chances on fate. We chose to write a new chapter, where, in a new economy, Americans are free to change their jobs or start a business, chase a new idea, raise a family, free from fear, secure in the knowledge that portable, affordable health care is there for us and always will be, and that if we get sick, we're not going to lose our home; that if we get sick, that we're going to be able to still look after our families. <p>That's when America soars: when we look out for one another, when we take care of each other, when we root for one another's success, when we strive to do better and to be better than the generation that came before us and try to build something better for generations to come. That's why we do what we do. That's the whole point of public service. <p>So this was a good day for America. Let's get back to work. [<i>Laughter</i>]\" "
"144" "\"Good morning. Our Nation was founded on a bedrock principle that we are all created equal. The project of each generation is to bridge the meaning of those founding words with the realities of changing times, a never-ending quest to ensure those words ring true for every single American. <p>Progress on this journey often comes in small increments, sometimes two steps forward, one step back, propelled by the persistent effort of dedicated citizens. And then sometimes, there are days like this, when that slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt. <p>This morning the Supreme Court recognized that the Constitution guarantees marriage equality. In doing so, they've reaffirmed that all Americans are entitled to the equal protection of the law; that all people should be treated equally, regardless of who they are or who they love. <p>This decision will end the patchwork system we currently have. It will end the uncertainty hundreds of thousands of same-sex couples face from not knowing whether their marriage, legitimate in the eyes of one State, will remain if they decide to move [to; White House correction.] or even visit another. This ruling will strengthen all of our communities by offering to all loving same-sex couples the dignity of marriage across this great land. <p>In my second Inaugural Address, I said that if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well. It is gratifying to see that principle enshrined into law by this decision. <p>This ruling is a victory for Jim Obergefell and the other plaintiffs in the case. It's a victory for gay and lesbian couples who have fought so long for their basic civil rights. It's a victory for their children, whose families will now be recognized as equal to any other. It's a victory for the allies and friends and supporters who spent years, even decades, working and praying for change to come. <p>And this ruling is a victory for America. This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts: When all Americans are treated as equal, we are all more free. <p>My administration has been guided by that idea. It's why we stopped defending the so-called Defense of Marriage Act and why we were pleased when the Court finally struck down a central provision of that discriminatory law. It's why we ended \\"don't ask, don't tell.\\" From extending full marital benefits to Federal employees and their spouses, to expanding hospital visitation rights for LGBT patients and their loved ones, we've made real progress in advancing equality for LGBT Americans in ways that were unimaginable not too long ago. <p>I know change for many of our LGBT brothers and sisters must have seemed so slow for so long. But compared to so many other issues, America's shift has been so quick. I know that Americans of good will continue to hold a wide range of views on this issue. Opposition in some cases has been based on sincere and deeply held beliefs. All of us who welcome today's news should be mindful of that fact, recognize different viewpoints, revere our deep commitment to religious freedom. <p>But today should also give us hope that on the many issues with which we grapple, often painfully, real change is possible. Shifts in hearts and minds is possible. And those who have come so far on their journey to equality have a responsibility to reach back and help others join them. Because for all our differences, we are one people, stronger together than we could ever be alone. That's always been our story. <p>We are big and vast and diverse, a nation of people with different backgrounds and beliefs, different experiences and stories, but bound by our shared ideal that no matter who you are or what you look like, how you started off, or how and who you love, America is a place where you can write your own destiny. <p>We are a people who believe that every single child is entitled to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. There's so much more work to be done to extend the full promise of America to every American. But today we can say in no uncertain terms that we've made our Union a little more perfect. <p>That's the consequence of a decision from the Supreme Court, but more importantly, it is a consequence of the countless small acts of courage of millions of people across decades who stood up, who came out, who talked to parents, parents who loved their children no matter what; folks who were willing to endure bullying and taunts and stayed strong and came to believe in themselves and who they were and slowly made an entire country realize that love is love. <p>What an extraordinary achievement. What a vindication of the belief that ordinary people can do extraordinary things. What a reminder of what Bobby Kennedy once said about how small actions can be like pebbles being thrown into a still lake and ripples of hope cascade outwards and change the world. Those countless, often anonymous heroes, they deserve our thanks. They should be very proud. America should be very proud. <p>Thank you.\" "
"145" "\"<i>The President.</i> Giving all praise and honor to God. <p>The Bible calls us to hope. To persevere and have faith in things not seen. \\"They were still living by faith when they died,\\" Scripture tells us. \\"They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on Earth.\\" <p>We are here today to remember a man of God who lived by faith. A man who believed in things not seen. A man who believed there were better days ahead, off in the distance. A man of service who persevered, knowing full well he would not receive all those things he was promised, because he believed his efforts would deliver a better life for those who followed. <p>To Jennifer, his beloved wife; to Eliana and Malana, his beautiful, wonderful daughters; to the Mother Emanuel family, the people of Charleston, the people of South Carolina: I cannot claim to have had the good fortune to know Reverend Pinckney well. But I did have the pleasure of knowing him and meeting him here in South Carolina, back when we were both a little bit younger. [<i>Laughter</i>] Back when I didn't have visible gray hair. [<i>Laughter</i>] And the first thing I noticed was his graciousness, his smile, his reassuring baritone, his deceptive sense of humor, all qualities that helped him wear so effortlessly a heavy burden of expectation. <p>Friends of his remarked this week that when Clementa Pinckney entered a room, it was like the future arrived; that even from a young age, folks knew he was special, anointed. He was the progeny of a long line of the faithful, a family of preachers who spread God's word, a family of protesters who sowed change to expand voting rights and desegregate the South. Clem heard their instruction, and he did not forsake their teaching. <p>He was in the pulpit by 13, pastor by 18, public servant by 23. He did not exhibit any of the cockiness of youth, nor youth's insecurities. Instead, he set an example worthy of his position, wise beyond his years, in his speech, in his conduct, in his love, faith, and purity. <p>As a senator, he represented a sprawling swath of the Lowcountry, a place that has long been one of the most neglected in America, a place still wracked by poverty and inadequate schools, a place where children can still go hungry and the sick can go without treatment&mdash;a place that needed somebody like Clem. <p>His position in the minority party meant the odds of winning more resources for his constituents were often long. His calls for greater equity were too often unheeded, the votes he casts were sometimes lonely. But he never gave up. He stayed true to his convictions. He would not grow discouraged. After a full day at the capitol, he'd climb into his car and head to the church to draw sustenance from his family, from his ministry, from the community that loved and needed him. There he would fortify his faith and imagine what might be. <p>Reverend Pinckney embodied a politics that was neither mean, nor small. He conducted himself quietly and kindly and diligently. He encouraged progress not by pushing his ideas alone, but by seeking out your ideas, partnering with you to make things happen. He was full of empathy and fellow feeling, able to walk in somebody else's shoes and see through their eyes. No wonder one of his senate colleagues remembered Senator Pinckney as \\"the most gentle of the 46 of us, the best of the 46 of us.\\" <p>Clem was often asked why he chose to be a pastor and a public servant. But the person who asked probably didn't know the history of the AME church. As our brothers and sisters in the AME church know, we don't make those distinctions. \\"Our calling,\\" Clem once said, \\"is not just within the walls of the congregation, but . . . the life and community in which our congregation resides.\\" <p>He embodied the idea that our Christian faith demands deeds and not just words; that the \\"sweet hour of prayer\\" actually lasts the whole week long; that to put our faith in action is more than individual salvation, it's about our collective salvation; that to feed the hungry and clothe the naked and house the homeless is not just a call for isolated charity, but the imperative of a just society. <p>What a good man. Sometimes, I think that's the best thing to hope for when you're eulogized: after all the words and recitations and r&eacute;sum&eacute;s are read, to just say someone was a good man. <p>You don't have to be of high station to be a good man. Preacher by 13. Pastor by 18. Public servant by 23. What a life Clementa Pinckney lived. What an example he set. What a model for his faith. And then, to lose him at 41, slain in his sanctuary with eight wonderful members of his flock, each at different stages in life, but bound together by a common commitment to God. <p>Cynthia Hurd. Susie Jackson. Ethel Lance. DePayne Middleton-Doctor. Tywanza Sanders. Daniel L. Simmons. Sharonda Coleman-Singleton. Myra Thompson. Good people, decent people, God-fearing people. People so full of life and so full of kindness. People who ran the race, who persevered. People of great faith. <p>To the families of the fallen, the Nation shares in your grief. Our pain cuts that much deeper because it happened in a church. The church is and always has been the center of African American life, a place to call our own in a too often hostile world, a sanctuary from so many hardships. <p>Over the course of centuries, Black churches served as \\"hush harbors\\" where slaves could worship in safety; praise houses where their free descendants could gather and shout, \\"Hallelujah\\"; rest stops for the weary along the Underground Railroad; bunkers for the foot soldiers of the civil rights movement. They have been and continue to be community centers where we organize for jobs and justice, places of scholarship and network, places where children are loved and fed and kept out of harm's way and told that they are beautiful and smart and taught that they matter. That's what happens in church. <p>That's what the Black church means. Our beating heart. The place where our dignity as a people is inviolate. And there's no better example of this tradition than Mother Emanuel, a church built by Blacks seeking liberty, burned to the ground because its founder sought to end slavery, only to rise up again, a Phoenix from these ashes. <p>When there were laws banning all-Black church gatherings, services happened here anyway, in defiance of unjust laws. When there was a righteous movement to dismantle Jim Crow, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., preached from its pulpit and marches began from its steps. A sacred place, this church. Not just for Blacks, not just for Christians, but for every American who cares about the steady expansion of human rights and human dignity in this country, a foundation stone for liberty and justice for all. That's what the church meant. <p>We do not know whether the killer of Reverend Pinckney and eight others knew all of this history. But he surely sensed the meaning of his violent act. It was an act that drew on a long history of bombs and arson and shots fired at churches, not random, but as a means of control, a way to terrorize and oppress; an act that he imagined would incite fear and recrimination, violence and suspicion; an act that he presumed would deepen divisions that trace back to our Nation's original sin. <p>Oh, but God works in mysterious ways. God has different ideas. <p>He didn't know he was being used by God. Blinded by hatred, the alleged killer could not see the grace surrounding Reverend Pinckney and that Bible study group, the light of love that shone as they opened the church doors and invited a stranger to join in their prayer circle. The alleged killer could have never anticipated the way the families of the fallen would respond when they saw him in court, in the midst of unspeakable grief, with words of forgiveness. He couldn't imagine that. <p>The alleged killer could not imagine how the city of Charleston, under the good and wise leadership of Mayor Riley, how the State of South Carolina, how the United States of America would respond: not merely with revulsion at his evil act, but with big-hearted generosity and, more importantly, with a thoughtful introspection and self-examination that we so rarely see in public life. <p>Blinded by hatred, he failed to comprehend what Reverend Pinckney so well understood: the power of God's grace. This whole week, I've been reflecting on this idea of grace: the grace of the families who lost loved ones; the grace that Reverend Pinckney would preach about in his sermons; the grace described in one of my favorite hymnals, the one we all know: <p>Amazing grace! How sweet the sound, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that saved a wretch like me! <br>I once was lost, but now I'm found; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was blind but now I see. <p>According to the Christian tradition, grace is not earned. Grace is not merited. It's not something we deserve. Rather, grace is the free and benevolent favor of God, as manifested in the salvation of sinners and the bestowal of blessings. Grace. <p>As a nation, out of this terrible tragedy, God has visited grace upon us, for he has allowed us to see where we've been blind. He has given us the chance, where we've been lost, to find our best selves. We may not have earned it, this grace, with our rancor and complacency and short-sightedness and fear of each other, but we got it all the same. He gave it to us anyway. He's once more given us grace. But it is up to us now to make the most of it, to receive it with gratitude and to prove ourselves worthy of this gift. <p>For too long, we were blind to the pain that the Confederate flag stirred in too many of our citizens. It's true, a flag did not cause these murders. But as people from all walks of life, Republicans and Democrats, now acknowledge&mdash;including Governor Haley, whose recent eloquence on the subject is worthy of praise&mdash;as we all have to acknowledge, the flag has always represented more than just ancestral pride. For many, Black and White, that flag was a reminder of systemic oppression and racial subjugation. We see that now. Removing the flag from this State's capitol would not be an act of political correctness; it would not be an insult to the valor of Confederate soldiers. It would simply be an acknowledgment that the cause for which they fought&mdash;the cause of slavery&mdash;was wrong. The imposition of Jim Crow after the Civil War, the resistance to civil rights for all people, was wrong. It would be one step in an honest accounting of America's history; a modest, but meaningful, balm for so many unhealed wounds. It would be an expression of the amazing changes that have transformed this State and this country for the better, because of the work of so many people of good will, people of all races striving to form a more perfect Union. By taking down that flag, we express God's grace. <p>But I don't think God wants us to stop there. For too long, we've been blind to the way past injustices continue to shape the present. Perhaps we see that now. Perhaps this tragedy causes us to ask some tough questions about how we can permit so many of our children to languish in poverty or attend dilapidated schools or grow up without prospects for a job or for a career. <p>Perhaps it causes us to examine what we're doing to cause some of our children to hate. Perhaps it softens hearts towards those lost young men, tens and tens of thousands caught up in the criminal justice system, and lead us to make sure that that system is not infected with bias; that we embrace changes in how we train and equip our police so that the bonds of trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve make us all safer and more secure. <p>Maybe we now realize the way racial bias can infect us even when we don't realize it, so that we're guarding against not just racial slurs, but we're also guarding against the subtle impulse to call Johnny back for a job interview, but not Jamal; so that we search our hearts when we consider laws to make it harder for some of our fellow citizens to vote. By recognizing our common humanity by treating every child as important, regardless of the color of their skin or the station into which they were born, and to do what's necessary to make opportunity real for every American&mdash;by doing that, we express God's grace. <p>For too long&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience members.</i> For too long! <p><i>The President.</i> For too long, we've been blind to the unique mayhem that gun violence inflicts upon this Nation. Sporadically, our eyes are open: when 8 of our brothers and sisters are cut down in a church basement, 12 in a movie theater, and 26 in an elementary school. But I hope we also see the 30 precious lives cut short by gun violence in this country every single day, the countless more whose lives are forever changed: the survivors crippled, the children traumatized and fearful every day as they walk to school, the husband who will never feel his wife's warm touch, the entire communities whose grief overflows every time they have to watch what happened to them happen to some other place. <p>The vast majority of Americans&mdash;the majority of gun owners&mdash;want to do something about this. We see that now. And I'm convinced that by acknowledging the pain and loss of others, even as we respect the traditions and ways of life that make up this beloved country, by making the moral choice to change, we express God's grace. <p>We don't earn grace. We're all sinners. We don't deserve it. But God gives it to us anyway. And we choose how to receive it. It's our decision how to honor it. <p>None of us can or should expect a transformation in race relations overnight. Every time something like this happens, somebody says we have to have a conversation about race. We talk a lot about race. There's no shortcut. And we don't need more talk. None of us should believe that a handful of gun safety measures will prevent every tragedy. It will not. People of good will will continue to debate the merits of various policies, as our democracy requires. This is a big, raucous place, America is. And there are good people on both sides of these debates. Whatever solutions we find will necessarily be incomplete. <p>But it would be a betrayal of everything Reverend Pinckney stood for, I believe, if we allowed ourselves to slip into a comfortable silence again. Once the eulogies have been delivered, once the TV cameras move on, to go back to business as usual&mdash;that's what we so often do to avoid uncomfortable truths about the prejudice that still infects our society; to settle for symbolic gestures without following up with the hard work of more lasting change&mdash;that's how we lose our way again. <p>It would be a refutation of the forgiveness expressed by those families if we merely slipped into old habits, whereby those who disagree with us are not merely wrong, but bad, where we shout instead of listen, where we barricade ourselves behind preconceived notions or well-practiced cynicism. <p>Reverend Pinckney once said: \\"Across the South, we have a deep appreciation of history. We haven't always had a deep appreciation of each other's history.\\" What is true in the South is true for America. Clem understood that justice grows out of recognition of ourselves in each other, that my liberty depends on you being free too, that history can't be a sword to justify injustice or a shield against progress, but must be a manual for how to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, how to break the cycle. A roadway toward a better world. He knew that the path of grace involves an open mind, but more importantly, an open heart. <p>That's what I've felt this week, an open heart. That, more than any particular policy or analysis, is what's called upon right now, I think; what a friend of mine, the writer Marilynne Robinson, calls \\"that reservoir of goodness, beyond, and of another kind, that we are able to do each other in the ordinary cause of things.\\" <p>That reservoir of goodness. If we can find that grace, anything is possible. If we can tap that grace, everything can change. <p>Amazing grace. Amazing grace. <p>[<i>At this point, the President sang the first verse of the hymn \\"Amazing Grace,\\" joined after the first line by audience members, as follows.</i>] <p>Amazing grace! How sweet the sound, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that saved a wretch like me! <br>I once was lost, but now I'm found; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was blind but now I see. <p>[<i>The President continued his remarks as follows.</i>] <p><i>The President. </i>Clementa Pinckney found that grace. Cynthia Hurd found that grace. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes! <p><i>The President.</i> Susie Jackson found that grace. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes! <p><i>The President. </i>Ethel Lance found that grace. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes! <i>The President. </i>DePayne Middleton-Doctor found that grace. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes! <p><i>The President.</i> Tywanza Sanders found that grace. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes! <p><i>The President. </i>Daniel L. Simmons, Sr., found that grace. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes! <p><i>The President.</i> Sharonda Coleman-Singleton found that grace. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes! <p><i>The President. </i>Myra Thompson found that grace. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes! <p><i>The President.</i> Through the example of their lives, they've now passed it on to us. May we find ourselves worthy of that precious and extraordinary gift as long as our lives endure. May grace now lead them home. May God continue to shed His grace on the United States of America.\" "
"146" "\"Hi, everybody. Five years ago, we finally declared that in America, health care is not a privilege for a few, but a right for all. And this week, after more than 50 votes in Congress to repeal or weaken this law, after a Presidential election based in part on preserving or repealing this law, after multiple challenges to this law before the Supreme Court, we can now say this for certain: The Affordable Care Act still stands, it is working, and it is here to stay. <p>On Thursday, when the Court upheld a critical part of the Affordable Care Act, it was a victory for hard-working Americans all across this country whose lives are more secure because of this law. This law means that if you're a parent, you can keep your kids on your plan until they turn 26. If you're a senior or an American with a disability, this law gives you discounts on your prescriptions. You can't be charged more just because you're a woman. And you can't be discriminated against just for having a preexisting condition. <p>This law is working exactly as it's supposed to and, in some ways, better than we expected it to. So far, more than 16 million uninsured Americans have gained coverage. Nearly one in three Americans who was uninsured a few years ago is insured today. The uninsured rate in America is the lowest it's been since we began to keep such records. <p>The law has helped hold the price of health care to its slowest growth in 50 years. If your family gets insurance through the workplace, not through the Affordable Care Act, you're paying about $1,800 less per year on average than you would be if trends before this law had continued, and that's good for workers, and it's good for the economy. <p>The point is, this is not some abstract political debate. For all the misinformation campaigns and doomsday predictions, for all the talk of death panels and job destruction, for all the repeal attempts, this law is helping tens of millions of Americans. This isn't just about Obamacare, this is health care in America. <p>With this case behind us, we're going to keep working to make health care in America even better and more affordable and to get more people covered. But it's time to stop refighting battles that have been settled again and again. It's time to move on. <p>Because as Americans, we don't go backwards, we move forwards. We take care of each other. We root for one another's success. We strive to do better, to be better, than the generation before us, and we try to build something better for the generation coming behind us. With this behind us, let's come together and keep building something better right now. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"147" "\"Thank you. Well, welcome to the White House. I thought we'd start off the week with something we should do more often: a truly bipartisan bill signing. <p>For 6&frac12; years, we've worked to rescue the economy from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, to get it growing again and to rebuild it on a new foundation for prosperity. Today, our businesses have created more than 12 million new jobs in the past 5 years; that's the longest streak of job growth on record, 401(k)s have been replenished, the housing market is stronger, and more than 16 million Americans have gained the financial security of health insurance. <p>But a constantly changing economy demands our constant effort to protect hard-working Americans and protect their success. And one of the things we ought to be doing is rewriting the rules of global trade to make sure that they benefit American workers and American businesses and that they reflect American values, especially now, while our economy is in a position of global strength. The two bills that I'll sign today will help America do just that. <p>The first will help us pass new, 21st-century trade agreements with higher standards and tougher protections than those that we've signed before. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, for example, includes strong protections for workers and the environment. Unlike previous agreements, those provisions will actually be enforceable. And that's good for American businesses and America workers because we already meet high standards than&mdash;higher standards than most of the rest of the world. So we want to make sure that everybody else catches up. This agreement will help us level the playing field. <p>The second bill offers even more support for American workers. It renews and expands the trade adjustment assistance program, which provides job training and other assistance to tens of thousands of American workers every year. It gives us new tools to help American steelworkers and folks in other critical industries fight against unfair practices by other countries. It also reauthorizes AGOA, the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which has had strong bipartisan support for many years now, and which helps open up markets in Africa to American businesses while making it easier for African businesses to sell their products in America. And we're extending a similar program to Haiti and renewing support for other development&mdash;developing economies through what's known as the Generalized System of Preferences. <p>Now, I think it's fair to say that getting these bills through Congress has not been easy. [<i>Laughter</i>] They've been declared dead more than once. They have inspired long and passionate debates, and that's entirely appropriate for our democracy. That's how this country is supposed to work. We're supposed to make sure that we air our differences, and then, ultimately, Congress works its will, especially on issues that inspire strongly held feelings on all sides. <p>But I would not be doing this, I would not be signing these bills if I was not absolutely convinced that these two pieces of legislation are ultimately good for American workers. I would not be signing them if I wasn't convinced they'd be good for American businesses. I would not be signing them if I did not know that they will give us a competitive edge in this new economy and that that new economy cannot be reversed. We have to embrace it. <p>This legislation will help turn global trade, which can often be a race to the bottom, into a race to the top. It will reinforce America's leadership role in the world: in Asia and in Europe and beyond. If I didn't believe it, I wouldn't have fought so hard to get these things done. <p>So this is a good day. And I want to thank everybody who has helped us get it&mdash;get to this day. We've got small-business owners here, environmental and global development groups, other advocates who were a big part of this campaign. We've got some outstanding Members of Congress, both Republican and Democrat, who came together to make this happen. I want to name just a few. Although Congress is on recess, I think it's important to acknowledge Speaker John Boehner and Leader Mitch McConnell; Senators Orrin Hatch, Ron Wyden, and Patty Murray; Congressmen Paul Ryan, Ron Kind, and Pat Tiberi. And thanks to all the Senators and Representatives who took tough votes and encouraged their colleagues to do the same. <p>This was a true bipartisan effort. And it's a reminder of what we can get done&mdash;even on the toughest issues&mdash;when we work together in a spirit of compromise. I hope we're going to be able to summon that same spirit on future challenges, like starting to rebuild some of our roads and bridges and infrastructure&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;around the country, because the American people deserve nothing less from us. <p>Let me just make one more comment. The trade authorization that's provided here is not the actual trade agreements. So we still have some tough negotiations that are going to be taking place. There has always been concern that people want transparency in those agreements. Under this authorization, these agreements will be posted on a website for a long period of time for people to scrutinize and take a look at and pick apart. <p>And so the debate on the particular provisions of trade will not end with this bill signing. But I'm very confident that we're going to be able to say at the end of the day that the trade agreements that come under this authorization are going to improve the system of trade that we have right now. And that's a good thing. <p>I think it's also important to note that trade is just one part of a broader agenda of middle class economics. And so we've still got more work to do on infrastructure. We've still got more work to do on job training. We've still got more work to do on research and development. And we've still got more work to do to make sure that folks are getting good wages for hard work. We've still got too many communities that are left behind around the country. We've still got more work to do to help support our small businesses, who are extraordinary job creators. <p>So this is not the end of the road; this is just one step in a long path to making sure that the next generation enjoys the extraordinary prosperity that our parents and grandparents passed down to us. And although there are going to be disagreements between the parties on particular elements, I think what we can agree on is that in this country, if you work hard, you should be able to get ahead no matter where you come from, what you look like, or who you love. <p>With that, let me sign this piece of legislation. <p>[<i>At this point, the President signed the bills.</i>] <p>All right. For those of you who work for me, get back to work. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "

"149" "\"Good morning, everybody. Please have a seat. <p>More than 54 years ago, at the height of the cold war, the United States closed its Embassy in Havana. Today I can announce that the United States has agreed to formally reestablish diplomatic relations with the Republic of Cuba and reopen Embassies in our respective countries. This is a historic step forward in our efforts to normalize relations with the Cuban Government and people and begin a new chapter with our neighbors in the Americas. <p>When the United States shuttered our Embassy in 1961, I don't think anyone expected that it would be more than half a century before it reopened. After all, our nations are separated by only 90 miles, and there are deep bonds of family and friendship between our people. But there have been very real, profound differences between our Governments, and sometimes, we allow ourselves to be trapped by a certain way of doing things. <p>For the United States, that meant clinging to a policy that was not working. Instead of supporting democracy and opportunity for the Cuban people, our efforts to isolate Cuba, despite good intentions, increasingly had the opposite effect: cementing the status quo and isolating the United States from our neighbors in this hemisphere. The progress that we mark today is yet another demonstration that we don't have to be imprisoned by the past. When something isn't working, we can and will change. <p>Last December, I announced that the United States and Cuba had decided to take steps to normalize our relationship. As part of that effort, President Ra&uacute;l Castro and I directed our teams to negotiate the reestablishment of Embassies. Since then, our State Department has worked hard with their Cuban counterparts to achieve that goal. And later this summer, Secretary Kerry will travel to Havana formally to proudly raise the American flag over our Embassy once more. <p>This is not merely symbolic. With this change, we will be able to substantially increase our contacts with the Cuban people. We'll have more personnel at our Embassy, and our diplomats will have the ability to engage more broadly across the island. That will include the Cuban Government, civil society, and ordinary Cubans who are reaching for a better life. <p>On issues of common interest, like counterterrorism, disaster response, and development, we will find new ways to cooperate with Cuba. And I've been clear that we will also continue to have some very serious differences. That will include America's enduring support for universal values like freedom of speech and assembly and the ability to access information. And we will not hesitate to speak out when we see actions that contradict those values. <p>However, I strongly believe that the best way for America to support our values is through engagement. That's why we've already taken steps to allow for greater travel, people-to-people, and commercial ties between the United States and Cuba. And we will continue to do so going forward. Since December, we've already seen enormous enthusiasm for this new approach. Leaders across the Americas have expressed support for our change in policy; you heard that expressed by President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil yesterday. Public opinion surveys in both our countries show broad support for this engagement. One Cuban said, \\"I have prepared for this all my life.\\" Another said that \\"this is like a shot of oxygen.\\" One Cuban teacher put it simply: \\"We are neighbors. Now we can be friends.\\" <p>Here in the United States, we've seen that same enthusiasm. There are Americans who want to travel to Cuba and American businesses who want to invest in Cuba, American colleges and universities that want to partner with Cuba. Above all, Americans want to get to know their neighbors to the south. And through that engagement, we can also help the Cuban people improve their own lives. One Cuban American looked forward to \\"reuniting families and opening lines of communications.\\" Another put it bluntly: \\"You can't hold the future of Cuba hostage to what happened in the past.\\" <p>And that's what this is about: a choice between the future and the past. <p>Americans and Cubans alike are ready to move forward. I believe it's time for Congress to do the same. And I've called on Congress to take steps to lift the embargo that prevents Americans from traveling or doing business in Cuba. We've already seen Members from both parties begin that work. After all, why should Washington stand in the way of our own people? <p>Yes, there are those who want to turn back the clock and double down on a policy of isolation. But it's long past time for us to realize that this approach doesn't work. It hasn't worked for 50 years. It shuts America out of Cuba's future, and it only makes life worse for the Cuban people. <p>So I'd ask Congress to listen to the Cuban people. Listen to the American people. Listen to the words of a proud Cuban American, Carlos Gutierrez, who recently came out against the policy of the past, saying, \\"I wonder if the Cubans who have to stand in line for the most basic necessities for hours in the hot Havana sun feel that this approach is helpful to them.\\" <p>Of course, nobody expects Cuba to be transformed overnight. But I believe that American engagement&mdash;through our Embassy, our businesses, and most of all, through our people&mdash;is the best way to advance our interests and support for democracy and human rights. Time and again, America has demonstrated that part of our leadership in the world is our capacity to change. It's what inspires the world to reach for something better. <p>A year ago, it might have seemed impossible that the United States would once again be raising our flag, the stars and stripes, over an Embassy in Havana. This is what change looks like. <p>In January of 1961, the year I was born, when President Eisenhower announced the termination of our relations with Cuba, he said: It is my hope and my conviction that it is \\"in the not-too-distant future it will be possible for the historic friendship between us once again to find its reflection in normal relations of every sort.\\" Well, it took a while, but I believe that time has come. And a better future lies ahead. <p>Thank you very much. And I want to thank some of my team who worked diligently to make this happen. They're here. They don't always get acknowledged. We're really proud of them. Good work.\" "

[<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member.</i> I love you! <p><i>The President.</i> Love you! <p>But in addition to the fireworks, in addition to the food, this is a chance to celebrate a bedrock principle so deep that generations of Americans have been willing to risk everything to declare it: the idea that all of us are created equal; that all of us are endowed with certain inalienable rights&mdash;life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness; and then, it's each generation's obligation to help secure those rights not just for a few, but for everybody. <p>And that's something that I've spent a lot of time thinking about. It's been a remarkable few weeks in America. Health care is now affirmed as something that everybody can get, not just some. And by the way, it's not just a matter of making sure everybody has access to high-quality care, it's also organizations like Gundersen here in Wisconsin that are doing great work to help to increase quality and to control costs. And so that was a great affirmation. <p>And then, the freedom to marry who you love, that's now open to all of us. Everybody. That's a good thing. That's a good thing. [<i>Applause</i>] That is a good thing. <p>And then, out of the worst of tragedies, this country is responding with a generosity, but also the kind of self-examination that can lead us to someplace better. <p>And some folks think all this progress comes really quickly. But the truth is, progress only comes with the persistent, dedicated effort of citizens, people who are, in their own small ways all across the country, are working hard, committed to the promise that's always set this country apart. It doesn't happen because of the Supreme Court; it doesn't happen because of a President or a Member of Congress. It happens because ordinary people work hard and do extraordinary things together; the promise that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can chase our own individual dreams, but we still come together as one American family to make sure the next generation has opportunity as well. <p>And that's especially true when it comes to our economy. And that's what I've come to La Crosse to talk about on this Fourth of July weekend. <p>America has always done better economically when we're all in it together, when everybody gets a fair shot; when everybody gets a fair shot, everybody is doing their fair share, everybody is playing by the same set of rules; when we all feel like we've got a common stake in our success, from the CEO in the corner suite to the workers on the factory floor. That's how we built the great American middle class. When you drive through La Crosse and throughout Wisconsin, when you see communities where kids are thriving and communities are thriving, it's because everybody has a shot. Everybody is working hard. Everybody is pitching in. That's when we're at our best. <p>Now, this morning we learned that our businesses created another 223,000 jobs last month. And the unemployment rate is now down to 5.3 percent. Keep in mind, when I came into office, it was hovering around 10 percent. All told, we've now seen 64 straight months of private sector job growth, which is a new record&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;new record&mdash;12.8 million new jobs all told. <p>And that's good. But we've got more work to do because we've got to get folks' wages and incomes to keep going up. We've got to make sure folks feel like their hard work is getting them somewhere. And let's face it, there are a lot of folks who still feel like the playing field is tilted in ways that make it hard for them to get ahead. <p>The challenges facing working men and women didn't all start with this recession. It's been going on for a while now. For a long time, health care was closed off from too many people and cost too much. Our schools too often were underfunded, weren't preparing our kids and our workers for the competition that's coming from the rest of the world. <p>And by the way, our teachers are underpaid. The&mdash;I'm just saying. That's true. Hardest job there is, most important job there is, and we should honor it as such. <p>The&mdash;other nations had been racing ahead on clean energy; we were still addicted to foreign oil when I came into office. So even as we've worked to put people back to work in the short run, we've also been trying to work to change some of these long-term trends to make sure that we're laying the foundation for future success. <p>We worked to rebuild our economy on a stronger foundation for growth. And in slow and steady ways, that work is paying off. We believed that we could ship fewer jobs overseas, start bringing new jobs to our shores instead. So we retooled the American auto industry. Today, we're on track to sell more cars and trucks this year than we have in over a decade. We invested in American manufacturing, and after a decade of decline, thanks to some of the steps we took, thanks to the support of folks like Tammy Baldwin and Ron Kind, we've added nearly 900,000 new manufacturing jobs. Manufacturing is actually growing faster than the rest of the economy. <p>We believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world. And today, our high school graduation rate has hit an alltime high; more Americans finish college than ever before. We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and do a better job of protecting the planet. Today, America is number one in the traditional fuels, oil and gas, but we're also number one in wind. We generate more than 20 times as much solar electricity as we did in 2008. And thanks to lower gas prices and us setting standards to double fuel efficiency on cars, the typical family is on pace to save about 700 bucks at the pump this year. <p>We extended tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans and 97 percent of small businesses, and, yes, we asked the wealthiest Americans&mdash;who had been doing better than everybody else not just relatively, but absolutely&mdash;we asked them to pay a little bit more to help bring down the deficit. We put in place the toughest Wall Street reform in history that's protecting Main Street from another crisis if folks start acting reckless on Wall Street. <p>As I already mentioned, health reform means the uninsured rate in America is now the lowest on record. I have these vague recollections of when Republicans were saying Obamacare would kill jobs and crush freedom and bring about death panels. [<i>Laughter</i>] And it turns out we're still celebrating the Fourth of July. The only difference is, another 16 million Americans can celebrate it with health care. That's worth celebrating. [<i>Applause</i>] Yes. The Republic survived. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>By one leading measure, what business owners pay out in wages and salaries is now growing faster than what they spend on health care. And that's the first time that's happened since the 1990s. So not only are more people getting health care, but because we've slowed the growth of health care costs, businesses have more money left over to start giving raises to their workers. That's good for everybody. <p>Now, I just want to play back the tape. [<i>Laughter</i>] I want to play back the tape, because we were told all these measures were going to destroy jobs and explode the deficit. Remember that? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes! <p><i>The President.</i> Remember when Republicans promised to bring unemployment down to 6 percent by 2017? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So we've got a record streak of private sector job growth. We've cut the deficit by two-thirds. Our stock market has more than doubled, restoring 401(k)s of&mdash;for millions of families. <p>This is progress. Step by step, America is moving forward. Middle class economics works. It works. [<i>Applause</i>] Yes! <p>But we've still got more work to do. As Will Rogers once said, \\"Even if you're on the right track, you'll still get run over if you just sit there.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] So you got to keep running. And so the question we've got to keep asking ourselves is, where do we go from here? Because we still have choices. Will we drift toward an economy where only a few of us do very well and everybody else is still scrabbling, struggling to get by? That's not the right way to do it. Or will we keep working towards an economy where everybody who works hard has a chance to succeed? <p>And over the next year and a half, you're going to hear a lot of pitches from a lot of people. They're going to deny that any progress has been made. You'll hear a lot of folks trying to sell you on their vision of where our country should go. They're going to be making a whole bunch of stuff up. [<i>Laughter</i>] And when I say a lot of stuff, I mean a lot of stuff. But I&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. We've got some healthy competition in the Democratic Party, but I've lost count of how many Republicans are running for this job. [<i>Laughter</i>] They'll have enough for an actual \\"Hunger Games.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, that's a&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. That is an interesting bunch. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So&mdash;but, Wisconsin, I've come here today, I figure why should I let them have all the fun? [<i>Laughter</i>] It is a good thing that this time around, you're hearing Republicans joining Democrats, talking about the middle class and working families. And that's good. I welcome them acknowledging that that's an important issue. But just keep in mind, Tammy, Ron, me&mdash;we were talking about the middle class before it was cool. [<i>Laughter</i>] Before it was trendy. We were talking about it before the polls told you, you should be talking about it. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And they talk the talk, but they don't walk the walk. Their menu doesn't have a whole lot of options for the middle class. The one thing that the bus full of people who are fighting to lead the Republican ticket all share is, they keep on coming up with the same old trickle-down, \\"you're on your own\\" economics that helped bring about the crisis back in 2007-2008 in the first place. <p>And I want to emphasize&mdash;I know some of them well. They're good people. It's just their ideas are bad. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I want to emphasize that. We're one country, we're all on one team, and so we're all one American family. But we all go&mdash;we're at Thanksgiving, and Uncle Harry starts saying something, and&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;you say, \\"Uncle Harry, that makes no sense at all.\\" You still love him. [<i>Laughter</i>] He's still a member of your family. Right? But you've got to correct him. You don't want to put him in charge of stuff. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's all I'm saying. <p>And by the way, if there's an Uncle Harry out here&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I wasn't talking about you. [<i>Laughter</i>] I was just using \\"Harry\\" as an example. <p>Here are a few of their bad ideas. Eliminating taxes that the wealthiest Americans pay on their investments while making you pay taxes on every dime of your paycheck, that's a bad idea. That's a bad idea. <p>Keeping the minimum wage worth less than it was when Ronald Reagan took office before most of you were born, that's a bad idea. Although, to be accurate, at least one of them actually thinks we just shouldn't have a nationwide minimum wage at all; we should just get rid of it. <p>Every single one of these candidates serving in Congress has supported cutting taxes for folks at the top while slashing investments in education. I know that sounds familiar. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> Some of those Members of Congress voted to do it. Every single one of them is still obsessed with repealing the Affordable Care Act despite the fact that, by every measure, it's working. You know, look, you could make an argument against Obamacare before it passed&mdash;it's something new, it's untried, you don't know. But now, where it's doing exactly what it was supposed to and actually costing less than we expected, and people are satisfied with the coverage we're getting, it just seems a little mean&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;to say that you just&mdash;you don't want to provide coverage to 16 million people. And you've got nothing to replace it with. That's a bad idea. <p>Now, I just to be clear, these are all really their ideas. I'm not making it up. You can go fact-check it. I'm not asking you to select from this list to see which one is actually true. They're all true. And the thing is, there's nothing new about this philosophy. Right? It's a philosophy that believes if we give special breaks to folks at the top, prosperity trickles down for the rest of us. But we've seen what happens when top-down economics meets the real world. We've got proof right here in Wisconsin. You had a Statewide fair pay law that was repealed. Your right to organize and bargain collectively was attacked. <p><i>Audience members.</i> No! <p><i>The President.</i> Per-student education funding was cut. Your minimum wage has been stuck in place. Meanwhile, corporations and the most fortunate few have been on the receiving end of hundreds of millions of dollars in new tax cuts over the past 4 years. <p>All right, so that's what's been going on here. What happens when we try middle class economics? Just across the river&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;I mean, this is a&mdash;it's a pretty interesting experiment. Across the river, in Minnesota, they asked the top 2 percent to pay a little bit more. They invested in things that help everybody succeed, like all-day kindergarten and financial aid for college students. They took action to raise their minimum wage. They passed an equal pay law. They protected workers' rights. They expanded Medicaid to cover more people. <p>Now, according to the Republican theory, all those steps would have been bad for the economy. But Minnesota's unemployment rate is lower than Wisconsin's. Minnesota's median income is around $9,000 higher. The La Crosse Tribune wrote, \\"Minnesota is winning this border battle.\\" Now, it is true that, as the Tribune pointed out, Wisconsin does have the Packers. So even a Bears fan can respect the Packers. <p>And&mdash;but understand, I'm saying this&mdash;Wisconsin is this extraordinary State filled with extraordinary people. But if you end up having policies that cut education, help folks at the top, aren't expanding opportunity, then it's not going to work. We need better policies, because the bottom line is, top-down economics doesn't work. Middle class economics works. It works. It works. [<i>Applause</i>] It works. <p>And this is also a matter of values. Being an American is not about taking as much as you can from your neighbor before they take as much as they can from you. We're not just a bunch of individuals out here on our own. We're a community. We're a family. We're all in this together. <p>We all have to work hard. I was taking some photos beforehand with Ron and met a couple folks who've got dairy farms. Nobody works harder than farmers. They know about hard work. Farmers know about hard work. They wake up early, go to bed late. They're worrying all the time about making sure things run. But they also understand about being neighbors and helping each other out. That's America. <p>We've got to make sure that this economy works for everybody who's willing to work, everybody who's willing to do their fair share. So I want to spend a little&mdash;just the rest of my time talking about what that might mean for the 21st century. <p>Number one, we've got to help working families feel more secure in this world of constant change. That's why health care mattered. If you ever have been locked out of the health care market just because you have a preexisting condition, those days are over. So you can now change jobs, chase that new idea, start a business, because you've got portable, affordable insurance if you need it. And that's going to protect a lot of people in the new economy. <p>The same applies when it comes to wages and benefits. Instead of treating childcare as a side issue or a women's issue, we got to treat it like a national economic priority. We've got to make sure that when we've got families where the mom and dad work, that we're putting together ways for them to still make sure their kids are secure and safe. <p>See, we got a lot of young people here who don't&mdash;aren't really thinking about that yet. And that's good. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We've got to make sure we've got sick leave that's in place so that families&mdash;if somebody at home gets sick, you're not thinking, do I give up my paycheck or do I take care of my loved one? Everybody should have that basic benefit. <p>We need to boost the minimum wage. Give America a raise. That's very straightforward. We have to protect, and not attack, a worker's right to organize for fairer wages and better benefits and safer workplaces. <p>Folks forget sometimes, unions are what helped bring about the 40-hour workweek, helped bring about the idea of the weekend. And I know that's a popular concept. [<i>Laughter</i>] Helped establish worker protections, worker safety, a stronger middle class. As I said at Laborfest in Milwaukee last fall, if I were looking for a good job that lets me build some security for my family, I'd join a union, because I'd want a union looking out for me. And we're stronger together than we are by ourselves. I'd want Congress looking out for me too, but you can't always get what you want. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So when Congress doesn't act on behalf of working people, what I've tried to do is partner with cities and States and mayors and Governors and acted on my own. Over the past couple of years, 17 States, almost 30 cities and counties have taken action to raise wages. Other cities and States have started guaranteeing workers paid sick days and family leave. And just this week, we took action to protect a worker's right to overtime. <p>Now, this is an issue of basic fairness. If you work longer, you work harder, you should get paid for it. Today, some companies take advantage of an exception in the rule to make their lower wage employees who really should be paid hourly, they're making them work 50, 60, sometimes 70 hours a week without paying them an extra dime. In extreme cases, it's possible for workers to actually earn less than the minimum wage. So they essentially label somebody as management instead of a worker, even if they're making, like, $25,000, work them a whole bunch of hours. That's a way of getting around the minimum wage. It's not fair. <p>So we're updating the rules. We're ending that exception. We're making more workers eligible for the overtime that you've earned. And it's one of the single most important steps we can take to help grow middle class wages. It's going to give as many as 5 million Americans, including 80,000 folks right here in Wisconsin, the overtime protections they deserve. It's the right thing to do. [<i>Applause</i>] It's the right thing to do. Because in America, a hard day's work deserves a fair day's pay. <p>Now, in an economy that's constantly changing, we've also got to give every American the chance to earn the skills they need to stay competitive. That's why we've got to be investing in job training and apprenticeships that help folks earn the skills for that new job or better paying job. That's why we should make community college free for responsible students, like Tammy Baldwin is introducing in the United States Senate. No middle class family should be priced out of the education that they need. <p>And we need to keep churning out high-wage jobs for a better trained workforce to fill, which means investing in basic research and development that leads to new businesses and industries. We should put more Americans to work rebuilding our roads, our railways, our bridges, our ports, our airports. <p>At a moment where our economy is in a position of global strength, because we're growing faster than most other countries right now&mdash;advanced countries&mdash;we have to rewrite the rules for the global economy before countries like China do. The other day, I signed a couple of bipartisan bills that will help our businesses sell more goods made in the United States than the rest of the world. And I'm going to keep pushing for trade that is fair and that creates a race not to the bottom, but to the top; that creates better wages and better working conditions. Because when the playing field is level, American workers always win. They always win. We know how to work. Americans know how to work. <p>So that's what we need for this new economy: Helping hard-working families make ends meet. Give them the tools they need to earn higher wages and better jobs. Keep our businesses the most competitive. Stay on the cutting edge of technology. Invest in research. Rebuild our roads. Rebuild our bridges. That's how we're going to help more middle class families succeed in a new and changing economy. We can't stop the economy globally from changing, but we can make sure we're at the forefront of adapting to it. <p>And look, I don't want to lie to you. This is hard. If it sounds hard, it's because it's hard. [<i>Laughter</i>] I remember when we were working on health care, I had an adviser who&mdash;we're in a meeting, and we were going around and around about how we were going to get this thing done. He raised his hand, and he says, Mr. President, the thing is, this is hard, and hard things are hard. [<i>Laughter</i>] I said, well, thank you for that astute observation. [<i>Laughter</i>] So when he left, he left me a plaque that I put on my desk. It says \\"Hard things are hard.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Just in case I forget. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Battling back from recession has been hard. Fixing a broken health care system has been hard. Making our economy more competitive for the future, it's hard. But the last 7 years&mdash;shoot, the last 7 days&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;should remind us there's nothing America cannot do. There's no challenge we can't solve. There are inspiring Americans who prove this every single day. Nothing we can't do. Nothing we can't do. [<i>Applause</i>] There's nothing we can't do. <p>I've got to admit&mdash;let me just, as a quick aside&mdash;I've been President for 6&frac12; years now. I do not watch the news. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, I didn't&mdash;no offense folks. [<i>Laughter</i>] But you'd think, like, every day, the only thing going on are shark attacks and&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;just horrible things. But every day, I do get letters from Americans from all walks of life, and they're doing such amazing, inspiring things. Sometimes, just simple things: working hard, running a farm, looking after their families, teaching a child. And then, every once in a while, they do something that has an even broader impact. <p>So Steve Cottrell lives right here in La Crosse. I'm going to use him as an example. Steve? Steve is right there. He's going to start blushing, but I'm going to talk about him anyway. <p>In 2002, he started a small business out of his house to help manage data for car companies and dealerships. By 2007, he employed a handful of people. Then, he was hit with a double whammy: The recession came, and the auto industry almost went belly up. But we refused to walk away from people like Steve. That shot in the arm, Steve says, was enough to keep his company's confidence going. During the worst years of the recession, Steve invested in new people, new technology, decided to double down, was absolutely confident his business model was right. <p>As the auto industry came roaring back, things began booming. And since 2007, Steve's revenue is up a thousand percent. His company, Authenticom, has gone from 18 employers&mdash;18 employees to more than 120. So this business that began in Steve's son's old bedroom is now one of America's fastest growing private companies, based in a restored historic building right in downtown La Crosse. <p>Now, I guarantee you, Steve worked hard. He put everything he had into it. He took enormous risks. But he's also somebody who recognizes that he didn't do it by himself. He's proud of what he's accomplished, but he also talks about how fortunate he's been to part of&mdash;to be part of a community like La Crosse, to be part of an industry that got back to basics, determined to do things better and smarter. He pays his employees fair wages. He guarantees paid sick days. He helps pay for the tuition of those folks when they decide to go back to school. He created a stock appreciation program so when the business does better, his workers do better also. And then, most importantly, there's \\"Free lunch Friday.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Who doesn't like \\"Free Lunch Friday,\\" right? <p>So look, I want to read something Steve said. He said: \\"You can't always do everything that everyone would like. But if you treat everybody like family, that's good for us.\\" If you treat everybody like family, that's good for us. <p>What's true for Steve's business is true for America. If you treat everybody like family, that's good for us. Not just me, not just you, not just Democrats, not just Republicans, not just old folks or young folks, not just Black folks or White folks&mdash;it's good for us. <p>We're not going to solve every problem in one fell swoop. But if we make things a little better for our fellow Americans, we're going to leave something better for us and for our kids. And if we're walking down that road together, we're going to get there faster. <p>That's what we're fighting for, everybody. That's what we're fighting for, Wisconsin. That's what's Tammy is fighting for and Ron is fighting for. That's what we all have to fight for. <p>Happy Fourth of July, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"151" "\"Happy Fourth of July, everybody. Like many of you, Michelle, Sasha, Malia, and I are going to spend the day outdoors, grilling burgers, hot dogs, watching the fireworks with our family and friends. It's also Malia's birthday, which always makes the Fourth extra fun for us. <p>As always, we've invited some very special guests to our backyard barbecue: several hundred members of our military and their families. On this most American of holidays, we remember that all who serve here at home and overseas represent what today is all about. And we remember that their families serve too. We are so grateful for their service and for their sacrifice. <p>We remember as well that this is the day when, 239 years ago, our founding patriots declared our independence, proclaiming that all of us are created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights, including the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. <p>A couple of centuries later, we've made ourselves into a big, bold, dynamic, and diverse country. We're of all races, we come from all places, we practice all faiths and believe in all sorts of different ideas. But our allegiance to this declaration&mdash;this idea&mdash;is the creed that binds us together. It's what, out of many, makes us one. <p>And it's been the work of each successive generation to keep this founding creed safe by making sure its words apply to every single American. Folks have fought, marched, protested, even died for that endeavor, proving that as Americans, our destiny is not written for us, but by us. <p>We honor those heroes today. We honor everyone who continually strives to make this country a better, stronger, more inclusive, more hopeful place. And we the people pledge to make their task our own, to secure the promise of our founding words for our own children and our children's children. <p>And finally, what better weekend than this to cheer on Team U.S.A. Good luck to the U.S. Women's National Team in the World Cup Final! <p>Thanks, everybody. From my family to yours, have a safe and happy Fourth of July.\" "
"152" "\"Everybody having a good time? Everybody, give it up for Bruno Mars! And the band! <p>Michelle and I just want to say to everybody here, we love you. On this day, we thank everyone who does so much each and every day to defend our country, to defend our freedom. We are grateful to our Armed Services. We are grateful to our military families. We are grateful to our veterans. <p>Without you, we could not enjoy the incredible blessings that we do in this greatest country on Earth. And we are so appreciative to all of you. We hope you are having a good time. The weather is cooperating. And Michelle and I, Malia, Sasha, we could not be more privileged to have gotten to know so many of you and to know all the sacrifices that you make on our behalf each and every day. <p>So we just want to wish you the happiest Fourth of July and remind ourselves that freedom is not free. It's paid by all the folks who are here today and all the folks who are around the world. We want to thank those who aren't with their families on this holiday season because they're posted overseas. We want to especially remember them. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"153" "\"<i>The President.</i> Good to see you! Hello, everybody! How are you? So, all right, everybody can have a seat. Have a seat. <p>I'm sorry to crash your little party here. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I just wanted to say hi to everybody. And I wanted to let you know that, first of all, I'm very proud of everything that my outstanding wife has done when it comes to healthy eating and \\"Let's Move!\\" And we're celebrating the fifth anniversary of \\"Let's Move!\\" So do you guys move? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes! <p><i>The President.</i> You guys are movers? Okay. You guys look pretty healthy, I've got to admit. This is a good-looking group. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The First Lady.</i> A good-looking group. <p><i>The President.</i> And so I also just wanted to let you know that although I can't stay and eat right now, that I've looked over the menu, and the food looks outstanding. I particularly am impressed with the Barackamole. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I'm expecting people to save me a little sampling of the Barackamole. <p>I also noticed that there are a lot of good vegetables on the menu, including my favorite vegetable, broccoli. [<i>Laughter</i>] Do I&mdash;who&mdash;did somebody raise their hand there? <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Well, I told these two that was your favorite vegetable. <p><i>The President.</i> You didn't believe me? [<i>Laughter</i>] It's true, I love broccoli. I eat it all the time. Anybody else love broccoli? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes. <p><i>The President.</i> That's what I'm talking about. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So I know that all your parents are so proud of you for having come up with these outstanding recipes. And the reason it's so important for you guys to be here and to be doing what you're doing is because the truth is, is that parents, it turns out, don't always have the most influence&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Yes, I know. It's sad. <p><i>The President.</i> &mdash;&mdash;in terms of encouraging young people to eat healthy. <p>What really helps is when their friends at school are all, like, oh, you're having chips? I'm sorry, I'm having the Barackamole. [<i>Laughter</i>] And then, because you're a cool kid, suddenly, the other kids are all, like, well, if that cool kid's eating broccoli, maybe I should try that broccoli out. So you guys are setting a great example for all your friends in school and in the neighborhoods, and I&mdash;we're really proud of you for that. <p>All right? So I'm proud of you. And I hope you guys have a wonderful dinner. And I'm going to come around and shake hands with people, but I can't take selfies with everybody because I've actually got just a few other things to do. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Yes. <i>The President.</i> So that would end up taking too long. All right? But you can take pictures while I'm shaking hands. I just can't, like, pose and&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;all that stuff. <p>Oops, that's okay, I get nervous, too. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The First Lady.</i> We do that all the time. <p><i>The President.</i> Whenever I'm at state dinners, I'm always spilling stuff.

"154" "\"As many of you know, one of the great legacies of this incredible country of ours is our national parks and national monuments. It is something that we pass on from generation to generation, not only preserving the incredible beauty of this Nation, but also reminding us of the richness of its history. And I am especially pleased to be able to announce three new designations that are going to be taking place in varied landscapes, but all of them speak to some incredible history. <p>The first, we are going to be designating the Waco Mammoth National Monument. This is one of the most incredible collections of mammoth fossils anywhere in the country. And for us to be able to preserve this space is going to be important not only to scientists, but also to many people who are able to take a look at this incredible landscape down in Texas. <p>We're also designating the Basin and Range area of southeastern Nevada&mdash;the Basin and Range National Monument. This is one of the most undisturbed corners of the Great Basin region, and its topography is unique. It is a place that attracts already a large number of visitors because of some of its unique geological aspects. And we're going to be able to make sure that even more visitors are aware and take advantage of this incredible landscape. <p>And finally, we're going to be designating the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument in California's wild Inner Coast Range. Once covered by ocean waters, it's a landscape that is shaped by geological forces that are unique, and it has been a refuge for Native American inhabitants for 11,000 years, so it gives you a sense of, sort of, the timescales that we're working off of with some of these national monuments. <p>Teddy Roosevelt, it's been said, had America's best idea when he talked about preserving our incredible national heritage. And for me to be able to add to that heritage is greatly appreciated. <p>I want to thank our outstanding Secretary of the Interior, Sally Jewell, and everybody in the Park Service who does such a great job. <p>One of the wonderful things about our use of the Antiquities Act is, we've had the opportunity to engage local communities consistently throughout this process: businesses, residents, people who are profoundly attached to the land. And as a consequence, the local communities have huge buy-in into these things and are absolutely confident that not only is it going to be a real economic spur in these areas, but it's also going to be able to preserve everything that they love about the places where they live. <p>So you guys have done a great job. I'm very proud. <p>And with that, I'm going to start signing some of these things. <p>[<i>At this point, the President signed the first proclamation.</i>] <p>All right, there we go. That's for the Basin and Range. <p>[<i>The President signed the second proclamation.</i>] <p>That's for Berryessa Snow Mountain. <p>[<i>The President signed the third proclamation.</i>] <p>There you go. That's for Waco. <p>Thank you so much, everybody.\" "
"155" "\"Hi, everybody. It's our job as citizens to make sure we keep pushing this country we love towards our most cherished ideals: that all of us are created equal, all of us deserve an equal shot. This week, my administration took new steps to bring us closer to that goal. <p>Almost 50 years ago, Republicans and Democrats in Congress came together to pass the Fair Housing Act. It's a law that says landlords can't turn away tenants solely because of their race, religion, sex, national origin, or disability. And it made a difference in this country. <p>Still, the work of the Fair Housing Act remains unfinished. Just a few weeks ago, the Supreme Court ruled that policies segregating minorities in poor neighborhoods, even unintentionally, are against the law. The Court recognized what many people know to be true from their own lives: that too often, where people live determines what opportunities they have in life. <p>In some cities, kids living just blocks apart lead incredibly different lives. They go to different schools, play in different parks, shop in different stores, walk down different streets. And often, the quality of those schools and the safety of those parks and streets are far from equal, which means those kids aren't getting an equal shot in life. <p>That runs against the values we hold dear as Americans. In this country, of all countries, a person's Zip Code shouldn't decide their destiny. We don't guarantee equal outcomes, but we do strive to guarantee an equal shot at opportunity, in every neighborhood, for every American. <p>Now, the Fair Housing Act also says that this isn't the responsibility of a landlord alone; local governments have a role to play too. That's why, this week, my administration announced that we'll make it easier for communities to implement this law. We're using data on housing and neighborhood conditions to help cities identify the areas that need the most help. We're doing more to help communities meet their own goals. Plus, by opening up this data to everybody, everyone in a community&mdash;not just elected officials&mdash;can weigh in. If you want a bus stop added near your home or more affordable housing nearby, now you'll have the data you need to make your case. <p>These actions won't make every community perfect. That's something we all have to strive for in our own lives. But they will help make our communities stronger and more vibrant. They'll help keep this a country where kids from every background can grow up knowing that no matter who you are, what you look like, or where you live, you can write your own story. <p>That's the America I love, and it's the America I'll keep fighting for. Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"156" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody. Thank you so much. Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat. Welcome to the White House Conference on Aging, everybody. And I&mdash;please give Vicki a big round of applause for the outstanding work she's doing to help women and families prepare for retirement. <p>I want to thank the Members of Congress who are here, those in my administration who've been working on this issue. I want to especially point out one of my favorite former Members of Congress, a legend who's here today, John Dingell. John, thank you. <p>John was elected to Congress when he was just 29, an overachiever. [<i>Laughter</i>] Ten years later, he presided over the House Chamber for the vote to pass Medicare into law, an achievement for which he and his father can take some credit. Last week, John turned 89, so we want to wish John a happy birthday. He's been a retiree for 6 months, but he's keeping busy; just check out his Twitter feed if you don't believe me. [<i>Laughter</i>] So he's still got some pretty strong opinions. <p>It is wonderful to be here with all of you. Many of you have devoted your careers to advocating for older Americans. You understand the whole terrain: not just the challenges, but also the opportunities; not only the questions we're asking today, but the questions that we have to start thinking about for tomorrow. And because this conference takes place just once a decade, we've got to make it count. <p>So one of the best measures of a country is how it treats its older citizens. And by that measure, the United States has a lot to be proud of. Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security are some of our greatest triumphs as a nation. When Social Security was signed into law, far too many seniors were living in poverty. When Medicare was created, only a little more than half of all seniors had some form of insurance. Before Medicaid came along, families often had no help paying for nursing home costs. Today, the number of seniors in poverty has fallen dramatically. Every American over 65 has access to affordable health care. And by the way, since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, the uninsured rate for all Americans has fallen by about one-third. Just thought I'd mention that. <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> That was pretty good. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Together, we declared that every citizen of this country deserves a basic measure of security and dignity. And that choice saved millions upon millions of our people from poverty, allowed them to live longer and better lives. So we've got to be proud of that. These American endeavors didn't just make our country better, it reaffirmed our greatness as a country. And it's hard to find a single American whose live&mdash;life hasn't been enriched by these covenants in some fashion. <p>My grandmother was a fiercely independent woman. She helped to raise me. She didn't have a college degree. She worked her way up, working on bomber assembly lines&mdash;Rosie the Riveter&mdash;during the war, and then went on, got a job as a secretary, and then kept on working her way up until she was vice president of a local bank. And after my grandfather died, she chose to live independently. And Medicare and Social Security allowed her to make that choice. <p>She had the confidence that, having worked hard, played by the rules, she was rewarded with a safe foundation for retirement and she could not fall through those cracks. And that was a promise this country made to her and all its citizens. And as a grateful grandson&mdash;who happens to be President&mdash;this is a promise I'm going to make sure we're going to keep for future generations. We've got to make sure that it's there for people who are working today. <p>But we're going to have work for it. We have to work to do more to ensure that every older American has the resources and the support that they need to thrive. That challenge&mdash;protecting our seniors, dealing with the rising costs of an aging generation, ensuring we have enough homecare workers looking out for our family members, maximizing the contributions that older Americans can make to our country&mdash;these challenges are just becoming more urgent. <p>And here's why. When we won World War II, everyone came home and had babies. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, not literally everyone, but a lot of people had babies. [<i>Laughter</i>] And now, each and every day, almost 10,000 of those babies turn 65 years old. So more than 250,000 Americans turn 65 every month. They're living longer, and they're living healthier. We're seeing people break athletic records in their sixties. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Diana Nyad is here today, by the way. You do not want to race her in anything. So the&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;arguably the toughest justice on the Supreme Court is the oldest: Ruth Bader Ginsburg, also known as the Notorious R.B.G. [<i>Laughter</i>] She's tough. <p>In just about every field, Americans who once might have been dismissed as out of touch or past their primes are making vital contributions in every field. And all of us, as a consequence, are able to raise our own ambitions about what we hope to achieve in our golden years. And since I'm living out dog years here in the Presidency&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;it's&mdash;this is something I'm paying a lot of attention to. [<i>Laughter</i>] Look at this hair. [<i>Laughter</i>] Although, I do have hair. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Rep. Joseph Crowley.</i> Thanks a lot! <p><i>The President.</i> Crowley was laughing a little bit too much over here. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So since these golden years are coming pretty fast, I want to make sure that we briefly focus on what we've done to strengthen already Medicare and take a longer look at what we have to do to strengthen retirement even more. <p>And now, we're often told that Medicare and Social Security are in crisis. We hear that all the time. And usually, that's used as an excuse to try to cut spending on those bedrock programs. But here's the truth. Medicare and Social Security are not in crisis, nor have they kept us from cutting our deficits by two-thirds since I took office. [<i>Laughter</i>] Both programs are facing challenges because of the demographic trends I just talked about. And for Medicare, that means we've got to keep slowing the growth of health care costs and keep building on the progress we've already made in the past few years. <p>Since I signed the Affordable Care Act&mdash;also known as Obamacare&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. The&mdash;since we signed the ACA into law, we've extended the life of the Medicare Trust Fund by 13 years. We're moving Medicare towards payment models that require quality of care instead of quantity of care as the measure of what you get paid, creating a different set of incentives. And that's something that will keep older Americans healthy and Medicare healthy as well. What's more, this law has saved over 9 million people on Medicare, currently, more than $15 billion on their prescriptions. <p>Now, that doesn't get a lot of notice, but I want everybody to understand: Built into the Affordable Care Act, 9 million seniors have gotten significant discounts on their prescription drugs. They don't always know that it's because of Obamacare, but that's why they've been paying cheaper drug prices. It's also given nearly 40 million people on Medicare free preventive health services. And we've expanded the options for home- and community-based services offered by Medicaid, which means that more older Americans are able to make the same choice that my grandmother did and live independently. <p>So those are some areas we've made progress. And Sylvia Burwell, who's here, our Secretary of Health and Human Services, I'm sure at some point during this conference will be talking about additional steps that we need to be taking to further improve a delivery system. <p>And understand, the goal here is not to cut back on services. The goal is to make sure that you're getting more of the services that you need, less of the services you don't, so you've got more money left over to do even more stuff that you need to keep you healthy and active and thriving. Because we have too much waste in the system that's not benefiting patients, but oftentimes, just has to do with a really inefficient system or, in some cases, works really well for providers, but doesn't work well for the consumer. <p>Now, even as we're dealing with the health care side, we also know that too many older Americans leave the workforce without having saved enough for a dignified retirement. And it's not as if they haven't tried. I mean, Vicki touched on this issue. There are a lot of folks out here who work really, really hard, but at the end of the day just still don't have enough of a nest egg. In today's economy, preparing for retirement has gotten tougher. <p>First of all, most workers don't have a traditional pension, what we used to understand as a defined benefit pension where you were guaranteed a certain amount every year once you retired. A Social Security check on its own oftentimes is not enough. And even though, as a consequence of some of the steps that we took, we pulled ourselves out of a terrible financial crisis and the stock market has now doubled since I took office, which means that it's replenished the 401(k)s for millions of families&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;so that's been important for millions of families across the country, but a lot of people don't have any kind of retirement account at all. <p>So we're going to have to work hard to deal with these issues. Number one, we have to keep Social Security strong, protecting its future solvency. And I think there are ways, creative ways that people are talking about to protect its future solvency, but also strengthen retirement security for our most vulnerable neighbors. So that's step number one. <p>Step number two: For Americans who are doing the hard work of saving for retirement, let's make sure that they get a fair deal. Earlier this year, I announced new steps we're taking to protect Americans by cracking down on conflicts of interest in retirement advice. The goal here is to put an end to Wall Street brokers who benefit from backdoor payments or hidden fees at the expense of their clients. If they are advising you on how to save your money, they should be looking out for you, not for somebody who's selling a product that may not be best for you. And for the many brokers out there who are doing the right thing, this rule levels the playing field for them and their customers. The notion here is, is we want to make sure responsibility is rewarded and not exploited. So there's a consumer protection element to this whole thing. Number three, we've got to make it easier for people to save for retirement. And today I'm pleased to announce an important step that we're taking to do just that. Right now about one-third of American workers do not have access to a retirement plan at work&mdash;one-third. That's why every budget request I've submitted since taking office has included a commonsense proposal to automatically enroll workers without access to a workplace retirement plan in an IRA, which would provide an additional 30 million Americans with access to a retirement plan at work. <p>Now, unfortunately, Congress has repeatedly failed to act on this idea. The good news is, States are stepping up, just like they're stepping up in other areas where Congress is not doing its work, like raising the minimum wage or making paid sick leave available for working families. So, so far, a handful of States have passed laws to create new ways for people without a workplace plan to save for retirement. And more than 20 States are thinking about doing the same. <p>We want to do everything we can to encourage more States to take this step. So I've called on the Department of Labor and Tom Perez to propose a set of rules by the end of the year to provide a clear path forward for States to create retirement savings programs. And if every State did this, tens of millions more Americans could save for retirement at work. <p>But I just&mdash;I want to emphasize this point. It is perverse that in this country, it is just easier to save if you've already got money. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I'm talking about not just the fact that you've got money to save, I'm talking about just the mechanics, the mechanisms of being able to save and then take advantage of the tax benefits of savings. So if we can just make sure that everybody, even if your employer doesn't provide those mechanisms, you still have a way of accessing it, every dollar you put in, that's going to be a dollar that also then benefits from the same kinds of tax advantages that somebody with a million dollars is able to take advantage of all the time. <p>And that's just fair. That's only fair. And that's all we're trying to do here, is make sure that if you're working hard out there, even if you're making&mdash;not making goo-gobs of money and don't have fancy financial advisers and all that, that you can still put away a little nest egg so that you're protected when you get older. <p>So this is just one of a number of steps that we're going to be taking to improve the lives of older Americans. As many of you know, over the past year, we've held regional forums with AARP across the country, heard lots of ideas from people, including folks in this room, about how we can make things better, especially for families and caregivers. So we're going to be moving ahead with several of the ideas that you've given us. <p>For example, we're going to make it easier for folks who are homebound to get nutritional assistance. We're going to update quality and safety requirements for thousands of nursing homes, the first major overhaul in nearly 25 years. We're going to train more prosecutors in how to combat elder abuse. We're going to work with Congress to reauthorize the Older Americans Act, because we know it will provide critical support to families and communities. <p>We're going to help Federal workers and their supervisors better understand how our policies on workplace flexibility can support employees who are also caregivers to aging parents. That's important. And I'm going to keep fighting to make family leave and workplace flexibility available to every American, no matter where they work. It's the right thing to do. <p>Every study shows that the kind of workplace flexibility we're talking about isn't just good for the employees; ultimately, it ends up being good for the employers, because you get more loyal, more productive employees with less turnover. And it's the right thing to do. And with the technologies that we have today, there's no reason why we can't make this happen. <p>So this year, we mark the 80th anniversary of Social Security. We mark the 50th anniversary of Medicare. We've grown so accustomed to these programs being a part of American life&mdash;these bedrock, foundation stones of our society&mdash;sometimes, it's easy to forget how revolutionary they were at the time. They were hard to get done. When FDR tried to pass Social Security, critics called it \\"socialism.\\" When President Kennedy and President Johnson&mdash;and the Dingells&mdash;worked to create Medicare, cynics raised the alarm about Government takeover of health care. Now we've got signs saying, \\"Get your Government hands off of my Medicare.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>The point is, change has always been hard. Detractors always are trying to maximize people's fear of the unknown. But ultimately, hope triumphs over fear. We choose to do big things here in America. Like I said a couple weeks back, three generations ago, we chose to end the era where seniors were left to languish in poverty. Two generations ago, we chose to end an age when Americans in their golden years didn't have the guarantee of health care. This generation, we chose to go even further, and now health care in America is more affordable and available than ever before. <p>In this anniversary of those incredible achievements, we need to recommit ourselves to finishing the work that earlier generations began&mdash;make sure this is a country that remains one where no matter who you are or where you started off, you're treated with dignity, your hard work is rewarded, your contributions are valued, you have a shot to achieve your dreams whatever your age. <p>That's the America we're all working for. And I'm proud to work alongside you. Thank you so much. Congratulations. Have a wonderful conference. Thank you.\" "
"157" "\"Today, after 2 years of negotiations, the United States, together with our international partners, has achieved something that decades of animosity has not: a comprehensive, long-term deal with Iran that will prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon. <p>This deal demonstrates that American diplomacy can bring about real and meaningful change, change that makes our country and the world safer and more secure. This deal is also in line with a tradition of American leadership. It's now more than 50 years since President Kennedy stood before the American people and said, \\"Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.\\" He was speaking then about the need for discussions between the United States and the Soviet Union, which led to efforts to restrict the spread of nuclear weapons. <p>In those days, the risk was a catastrophic nuclear war between two superpowers. In our time, the risk is that nuclear weapons will spread to more and more countries, particularly in the Middle East, the most volatile region in our world. <p>Today, because America negotiated from a position of strength and principle, we have stopped the spread of nuclear weapons in this region. Because of this deal, the international community will be able to verify that the Islamic Republic of Iran will not develop a nuclear weapon. <p>This deal meets every single one of the bottom lines that we established when we achieved a framework earlier this spring. Every pathway to a nuclear weapon is cut off. And the inspection and transparency regime necessary to verify that objective will be put in place. Because of this deal, Iran will not produce the highly enriched uranium and weapons-grade plutonium that form the raw materials necessary for a nuclear bomb. <p>Because of this deal, Iran will remove two-thirds of its installed centrifuges&mdash;the machines necessary to produce highly enriched uranium for a bomb&mdash;and store them under constant international supervision. Iran will not use its advanced centrifuges to produce enriched uranium for the next decade. Iran will also get rid of 98 percent of its stockpile of enriched uranium. <p>To put that in perspective, Iran currently has a stockpile that could produce up to 10 nuclear weapons. Because of this deal, that stockpile will be reduced to a fraction of what would be required for a single weapon. This stockpile limitation will last for 15 years. <p>Because of this deal, Iran will modify the core of its reactor in Arak so that it will not produce weapons-grade plutonium. And it has agreed to ship the spent fuel from the reactor out of the country for the lifetime of the reactor. For at least the next 15 years, Iran will not build any new heavy-water reactors. <p>Because of this deal, we will, for the first time, be in a position to verify all of these commitments. That means this deal is not built on trust, it is built on verification. Inspectors will have 24/7 access to Iran's key nuclear facilities.Iran [Inspectors; White House correction] will have access to Iran's entire nuclear supply chain: its uranium mines and mills, its conversion facility, and its centrifuge manufacturing and storage facilities. This ensures that Iran will not be able to divert materials from known facilities to covert ones. Some of these transparency measures will be in place for 25 years. <p>Because of this deal, inspectors will also be able to access any suspicious location. Put simply, the organization responsible for the inspections, the IAEA, will have access where necessary, when necessary. That arrangement is permanent. And the IAEA has also reached an agreement with Iran to get access that it needs to complete its investigation into the possible military dimensions of Iran's past nuclear research. <p>Finally, Iran is permanently prohibited from pursuing a nuclear weapon under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which provided the basis for the international community's efforts to apply pressure on Iran. <p>As Iran takes steps to implement this deal, it will receive relief from the sanctions that we put in place because of Iran's nuclear program, both America's own sanctions and sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council. This relief will be phased in. Iran must complete key nuclear steps before it begins to receive new sanctions relief. And over the course of the next decade, Iran must abide by the deal before additional sanctions are lifted, including 5 years for restrictions related to arms and 8 years for restrictions related to ballistic missiles. <p>All of this will be memorialized and endorsed in a new United Nations Security Council resolution. And if Iran violates the deal, all of these sanctions will snap back into place. So there's a very clear incentive for Iran to follow through, and there are very real consequences for a violation. <p>That's the deal. It has the full backing of the international community. Congress will now have an opportunity to review the details, and my administration stands ready to provide extensive briefings on how this will move forward. <p>As the American people and Congress review the deal, it will be important to consider the alternative. Consider what happens in a world without this deal. Without this deal, there is no scenario where the world joins us in sanctioning Iran until it completely dismantles its nuclear program. Nothing we know about the Iranian Government suggests that it would simply capitulate under that kind of pressure. And the world would not support an effort to permanently sanction Iran into submission. We put sanctions in place to get a diplomatic resolution, and that is what we have done. <p>Without this deal, there would be no agreed-upon limitations for the Iranian nuclear program. Iran could produce, operate, and test more and more centrifuges. Iran could fuel a reactor capable of producing plutonium for a bomb. And we would not have any of the inspections that allow us to detect a covert nuclear weapons program. In other words, no deal means no lasting constraints on Iran's nuclear program. <p>Such a scenario would make it more likely that other countries in the region would feel compelled to pursue their own nuclear programs, threatening a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region of the world. It would also present the United States with fewer and less effective options to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. I have been President and Commander in Chief for over 6 years now. Time and again, I have faced decisions about whether or not to use military force. It's the gravest decision that any President has to make. Many times, in multiple countries, I have decided to use force. And I will never hesitate to do so when it is in our national security interest. I strongly believe that our national security interest now depends upon preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, which means that without a diplomatic resolution, either I or a future U.S. President would face a decision about whether or not to allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon or whether to use our military to stop it. <p>Put simply, no deal means a greater chance of more war in the Middle East. Moreover, we give nothing up by testing whether or not this problem can be solved peacefully. If, in a worst-case scenario, Iran violates the deal, the same options that are available to me today will be available to any U.S. President in the future. And I have no doubt that 10 or 15 years from now, the person who holds this office will be in a far stronger position with Iran further away from a weapon and with the inspections and transparency that allow us to monitor the Iranian program. <p>For this reason, I believe it would be irresponsible to walk away from this deal. But on such a tough issue, it is important that the American people and their representatives in Congress get a full opportunity to review the deal. After all, the details matter. And we've had some of the finest nuclear scientists in the world working through those details. And we're dealing with a country, Iran, that has been a sworn adversary of the United States for over 35 years. So I welcome a robust debate in Congress on this issue, and I welcome scrutiny of the details of this agreement. <p>But I will remind Congress that you don't make deals like this with your friends. We negotiated arms control agreements with the Soviet Union when that nation was committed to our destruction. And those agreements ultimately made us safer. I am confident that this deal will meet the national security interests of the United States and our allies. So I will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of this deal. <p>We do not have to accept an inevitable spiral into conflict, and we certainly shouldn't seek it. And precisely because the stakes are so high, this is not the time for politics or posturing. Tough talk from Washington does not solve problems. Hard-nosed diplomacy, leadership that has united the world's major powers offers a more effective way to verify that Iran is not pursuing a nuclear weapon. <p>Now, that doesn't mean that this deal will resolve all of our differences with Iran. We share the concerns expressed by many of our friends in the Middle East, including Israel and the Gulf States, about Iran's support for terrorism and its use of proxies to destabilize the region. But that is precisely why we are taking this step, because an Iran armed with a nuclear weapon would be far more destabilizing and far more dangerous to our friends and to the world. <p>Meanwhile, we will maintain our own sanctions related to Iran's support for terrorism, its ballistic missile program, and its human rights violations. We will continue our unprecedented efforts to strengthen Israel's security, efforts that go beyond what any American administration has done before. And we will continue the work we began at Camp David to elevate our partnership with the Gulf States to strengthen their capabilities to counter threats from Iran or terrorist groups like ISIL. <p>However, I believe that we must continue to test whether or not this region, which has known so much suffering, so much bloodshed, can move in a different direction. <p>Time and again, I have made clear to the Iranian people that we will always be open to engagement on the basis of mutual interests and mutual respect. Our differences are real and the difficult history between our nations cannot be ignored. But it is possible to change. The path of violence and rigid ideology, a foreign policy based on threats to attack your neighbors or eradicate Israel&mdash;that's a dead end. A different path, one of tolerance and peaceful resolution of conflict, leads to more integration into the global economy, more engagement with the international community, and the ability of the Iranian people to prosper and thrive. <p>This deal offers an opportunity to move in a new direction. We should seize it. <p>We have come a long way to reach this point: decades of an Iranian nuclear program, many years of sanctions, and many months of intense negotiation. Today I want to thank the Members of Congress from both parties who helped us put in place the sanctions that have proven so effective, as well as the other countries who joined us in that effort. <p>I want to thank our negotiating partners&mdash;the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, China, as well as the European Union&mdash;for our unity in this effort, which showed that the world can do remarkable things when we share a vision of peacefully addressing conflicts. We showed what we can do when we do not split apart. <p>And finally, I want to thank the American negotiating team. We had a team of experts working for several weeks straight on this, including our Secretary of Energy, Ernie Moniz. And I want to particularly thank John Kerry, our Secretary of State, who began his service to this country more than four decades ago when he put on our uniform and went off to war. He's now making this country safer through his commitment to strong, principled American diplomacy. <p>History shows that America must lead not just with our might, but with our principles. It shows we are stronger not when we are alone, but when we bring the world together. Today's announcement marks one more chapter in this pursuit of a safer and more helpful and more hopeful world. <p>Thank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\" "
"158" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, NAACP! Ah, it's good to be back. How you all doing today? You doing fine? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes! <p><i>The President.</i> You're doing fine? You look fine. All right, everybody have a seat. I've got some stuff to say. I've got some stuff to say. <p><i>Audience members.</i> We love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. You know that. <p>So, see, now, whenever people have, like, little signs, you've all got to write it bigger, because I'm getting old now. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I like that picture of me. That's very nice. Thank you. <p>Let's get something out of the way up front. I am not singing today. [<i>Laughter</i>] Not singing. Although I will say your board sang to me as I came in for the photograph. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I know there's some good voices in the auditorium. <p>Let me also say what everybody knows, but doesn't always want to say out loud: You all would rather have Michelle here. [<i>Laughter</i>] I understand. I don't blame you. But I will do my best to fill her shoes. [<i>Laughter</i>] And she sends everybody her love. And Malia and Sasha say hi as well. And&mdash;&mdash; <p>I want to thank your chair, Roslyn Brock. I want to thank your president, Cornell Brooks. I want to thank your Governor, Tom Wolf, who's doing outstanding work and was here. The mayor of Philadelphia, Michael Nutter, who's been a great friend and ally. Governor Dan Malloy of Connecticut, who's here today. And some outstanding Members of Congress who are here. I want to just say thank you to all of you for your love, your&mdash;for your support, but most importantly, for the work that you are doing in your communities all across the country every single day. <p>It's not always received with a lot of fanfare. Sometimes, it's lonely work; sometimes, it's hard work; sometimes, it's frustrating work. But it's necessary work. And it builds on a tradition of this organization that reshaped the Nation. <p>For 106 years, the NAACP has worked to close the gaps between the words of our founding that we are all created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights&mdash;those words&mdash;trying to match those with the realities that we live each and every day. <p>In your first century, this organization stood up to lynching and Jim Crow and segregation; helped to shepherd a Civil Rights Act and a Voting Rights Act. I would not be here, and so many others would not be here, without the NAACP. <p>In your second century, we've worked together to give more of our children a shot at a quality education, to help more families rise up out of poverty, to protect future generations from environmental damage, to create fair housing, to help more workers find the purpose of a good job. And together, we've made real progress, including a \\"My Brother's Keeper\\" initiative to give more young people a fair shot in life; including the passage of a law that declares health care is not a privilege for the few, but a right for all of us. <p>We've made progress, but our work is not done. By just about every measure, the life chances for Black and Hispanic youths still lag far behind those of their White peers. Our kids, America's children, so often are isolated, without hope, less likely to graduate from high school, less likely to earn a college degree, less likely to be employed, less likely to have health insurance, less likely to own a home. <p>And part of this is a legacy of hundreds of years of slavery and segregation and structural inequalities that compounded over generations. It did not happen by accident. Partly, it's a result of continuing, if sometimes more subtle, bigotry, whether in who gets called back for a job interview, or who gets suspended from school, or what neighborhood you are able to rent an apartment in, which, by the way, is why our recent initiative to strengthen the awareness and effectiveness of fair housing laws is so important. So we can't be satisfied, are not satisfied, until the opportunity gap is closed for everybody in America. Everybody. <p>But today I want to focus on one aspect of American life that remains particularly skewed by race and by wealth, a source of inequity that has ripple effects on families and on communities and ultimately on our Nation, and that is our criminal justice system. <p>Now, this is not a new topic. I know sometimes folks discover these things like they just happened. There's a long history of inequity in the criminal justice system in America. When I was in the State legislature in Illinois, we worked to make sure that we had videotaping of interrogations because there were some problems there. We set up racial profiling laws to prevent the kind of bias in traffic stops that too many people experience. Since my first campaign, I've talked about how, in too many cases, our criminal justice system ends up being a pipeline from underfunded, inadequate schools to overcrowded jails. <p>What has changed, though, is that, in recent years, the eyes of more Americans have been opened to this truth. Partly because of cameras&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;partly because of tragedy, partly because the statistics cannot be ignored, we can't close our eyes anymore. And the good news&mdash;and this is truly good news&mdash;is that good people of all political persuasions are starting to think we need to do something about this. <p>So let's look at the statistics. The United States is home to 5 percent of the world's population, but 25 percent of the world's prisoners. Think about that. Our incarceration rate is four times higher than China's. We keep more people behind bars than the top 35 European countries combined. And it hasn't always been the case, this huge explosion in incarceration rates. In 1980, there were 500,000 people behind bars in America&mdash;half a million people in 1980. I was in college in 1980. Many of you were not born in 1980. That's okay. [<i>Laughter</i>] I remember 1980&mdash;500,000. Today, there are 2.2 million. It has quadrupled since 1980. Our prison population has doubled in the last two decades alone. <p>Now, we need to be honest: There are a lot of folks who belong in prison. If we're going to deal with this problem and the inequities involved, then we also have to speak honestly. There are some folks who need to be in jail. They may have had terrible things happen to them in their lives. We hold out the hope for redemption, but they've done some bad things. <p>Murderers, predators, rapists, gang leaders, drug kingpins&mdash;we need some of those folks behind bars. Our communities are safer thanks to brave police officers and hard-working prosecutors who put those violent criminals in jail. And the studies show that up to a certain point, tougher prosecutors and stiffer sentences for these violent offenders contributed to the decline in violent crime over the last few decades, although the science also indicates that you get a point of diminishing returns. But it is important for us to recognize that violence in our communities is serious and that historically, in fact, the African American community oftentimes was underpoliced rather than overpoliced. Folks were very interested in containing the African American community so it couldn't leave segregated areas, but within those areas, there wasn't enough police presence. <p>But here's the thing: Over the last few decades, we've also locked up more and more nonviolent drug offenders than ever before for longer than ever before. And that is the real reason our prison population is so high. In far too many cases, the punishment simply does not fit the crime. If you're a low-level drug dealer or you violate your parole, you owe some debt to society. You have to be held accountable and make amends. But you don't owe 20 years. [<i>Laughter</i>] You don't owe a life sentence. That's disproportionate to the price that should be paid. <p>And by the way, the taxpayers are picking up the tab for that price. Every year, we spend $80 billion to keep folks incarcerated&mdash;$80 billion. Now, just to put that in perspective, for $80 billion, we could have universal preschool for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old in America. That's what $80 billion buys. For $80 billion, we could double the salary of every high school teacher in America. For $80 billion, we could finance new roads and new bridges and new airports, job training programs, research and development. I'm&mdash;we're about to get in a big budget debate in Washington&mdash;what I couldn't do with $80 billion. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's a lot of money. For what we spend to keep everyone locked up for 1 year, we could eliminate tuition at every single one of our public colleges and universities. <p>As Republican Senator and Presidential candidate Rand Paul has said&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;no, and to his credit, he's been consistent on this issue&mdash;imprisoning large numbers of nonviolent drug offenders for long periods of time \\"costs the taxpayers money, without making them any safer.\\" <p>Roughly one-third of the Justice Department's budget now goes toward incarceration&mdash;one-third. And there are outstanding public servants at our Justice Department, starting with our outstanding Attorney General, Loretta Lynch. And we've got some great prosecutors here today, and they do outstanding work&mdash;so many of them. But every dollar they have to spend keeping nonviolent drug offenders in prison is a dollar they can't spend going after drug kingpins or tracking down terrorists or hiring more police and giving them the resources that would allow them to do a more effective job community policing. <p>And then, of course, there are the costs that can't be measured in dollars and cents. Because the statistics on who gets incarcerated show that by a wide margin, it disproportionately impacts communities of color. African Americans and Latinos make up 30 percent of our population; they make up 60 percent of our inmates. About 1 in every 35 African American men, 1 in every 88 Latino men is serving time right now. Among White men, that number is 1 in 214. <p>The bottom line is, is that in too many places, Black boys and Black men, Latino boys and Latino men experience being treated differently under the law. <p>And I want to be clear: This is not just anecdote. This is not just barbershop talk. A growing body of research shows that people of color are more likely to be stopped, frisked, questioned, charged, detained. Americans&mdash;African Americans are more likely to be arrested. They are more likely to be sentenced to more time for the same crime. And one of the consequences of this is, around 1 million fathers are behind bars. Around one in nine African American kids has a parent in prison. <p>What is that doing to our communities? What's that doing to those children? Our Nation is being robbed of men and women who could be workers and taxpayers, could be more actively involved in their children's lives, could be role models, could be community leaders, and right now they're locked up for a nonviolent offense. <p>So our criminal justice system isn't as smart as it should be. It's not keeping us as safe as it should be. It is not as fair as it should be. Mass incarceration makes our country worse off, and we need to do something about it. <p>But here's the good news. <p><i>Audience member.</i> All right, good news. <p><i>The President.</i> Good news. Don't get me preaching now. [<i>Laughter</i>] I am feeling more hopeful today because even now, when, let's face it, it seems like Republicans and Democrats cannot agree on anything&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;a lot of them agree on this. In fact, today, back in Washington, Republican Senators from Utah and Texas are joining Democratic Senators from New Jersey and Rhode Island to talk about how Congress can pass meaningful criminal justice reform this year. That's good news. [<i>Applause</i>] That is good news. Good news. <p>That doesn't happen very often. And it's not just Senators. This is a cause that's bringing people in both Houses of Congress together. It's created some unlikely bedfellows. You've got Van Jones and Newt Gingrich. [<i>Laughter</i>] You've got Americans for Tax Reform and the ACLU. You've got the NAACP and the Koch brothers. [<i>Laughter</i>] No, you've got to give them credit. You've got to call it like you see it. [<i>Laughter</i>] There are States from Texas and South Carolina to California and Connecticut who have acted to reduce their prison populations over the last 5 years and seen their crime rates fall. That's good news. <p>My administration has taken steps on our own to reduce our Federal prison population. So I signed a bill reducing the 100 and 1 sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine. I've commuted the sentences of dozens of people sentenced under old drug laws that we now recognize were unfair, and yesterday I announced that I'm commuting dozens more. <p>Under the leadership of Attorney General Eric Holder, now continued by Loretta Lynch, Federal prosecutors got what he called \\"Smart on Crime,\\" which is refocusing efforts on the worst offenders, pursuing mandatory minimum sentences 20 percent less often than they did the year before. The idea is you don't always have to charge the max. To be a good prosecutor, you need to be proportionate. And it turns out that we're solving just as many cases and there are just as many plea bargains, and it's working. It's just that we've eliminated some of the excess. <p>And recently, something extraordinary happened. For the first time in 40 years, America's crime rate and incarceration rate both went down at the same time. That happened last year. <p>So there's some momentum building for reform. There's evidence mounting for why we need reform. And I want to spend the rest of my time just laying out some basic principles, some simple ideas for what reform should look like, because we're just at the beginning of this process and we need to make sure that we stay with it. And I'm going to focus on what happens in three places: in the community, in the courtroom, and in the cell block. So I want to begin with the community because I believe crime is like any other epidemic: The best time to stop it is before it starts. And I'm going to go ahead and say what I've said a hundred times before or a thousand times before and what you've heard me say before, if we make investments early in our children, we will reduce the need to incarcerate those kids. <p>So one study found that for every dollar we invest in pre-K, we save at least twice that down the road in reduced crime. Getting a teenager a job for the summer costs a fraction of what it costs to lock him up for 15 years. Investing in our communities makes sense. It saves taxpayer money if we are consistent about it and if we recognize that every child deserve opportunity, not just some, not just our own. <p>What doesn't make sense is treating entire neighborhoods as little more than danger zones where we just surround them. We ask police to go in there and do the tough job of trying to contain the hopelessness when we are not willing to make the investments to help lift those communities out of hopelessness. That's not just a police problem, that's a societal problem. <p>Places like West Philly or West Baltimore or Ferguson, Missouri&mdash;they're part of America too. They're not separate. They're part of America like anywhere else. The kids there are American kids, just like your kids and my kids. So we've got to make sure boys and girls in those communities are loved and cherished and supported and nurtured and invested in. And we have to have the same standards for those children as we have for our own children. <p>If you are a parent, you know that there are times where boys and girls are going to act out in school. And the question is, are we letting principals and parents deal with one set of kids and we call the police on another set of kids? That's not the right thing to do. <p>We've got to make sure our juvenile justice system remembers that kids are different. Don't just tag them as future criminals. Reach out to them as future citizens. <p>And even as we recognize that police officers do one of the toughest, bravest jobs around, and as we do everything in our power to keep those police officers safe on the job&mdash;I've talked about this&mdash;we have to restore trust between our police and some of the communities where they serve. And a good place to start is making sure communities around the country adopt the recommendations from the Task Force I set up that included law enforcement, but also included young people from New York and from Ferguson, and they were able to arrive at a consensus around things like better training, better data collection, to make sure that policing is more effective and more accountable, but is also more unbiased. <p>So these are steps in the community that will lead to fewer folks being arrested in the first place. Now, they won't eliminate crime entirely. There's going to be crime. And that's why the second place we need to change is in the courtroom. <p>For nonviolent drug crimes, we need to lower long mandatory minimum sentences or get rid of them entirely; give judges some discretion around nonviolent crimes so that, potentially, we can steer a young person who has made a mistake in a better direction. <p>We should pass a sentencing reform bill through Congress this year. We need to ask prosecutors to use their discretion to seek the best punishment, the one that's going to be most effective, instead of just the longest punishment. We should invest in alternatives to prison, like drug courts and treatment and probation programs, which ultimately can save taxpayers thousands of dollars per defendant each year. <p>Now, even if we're locking up fewer people, even if we are reforming sentencing guidelines, as I've said before, some criminals still deserve to go to jail. And as Republican Senator John Cornyn has reminded us, \\"virtually all of the people incarcerated in our prisons will eventually someday be released.\\" And that's why the third place we need to reform is in the cell block. <p>So on Thursday, I will be the first sitting President to visit a Federal prison. And I'm going to shine a spotlight on this issue, because while the people in our prisons have made some mistakes&mdash;and sometimes big mistakes&mdash;they are also Americans, and we have to make sure that as they do their time and pay back their debt to society that we are increasing the possibility that they can turn their lives around. <p>That doesn't mean that we will turn everybody's life around. That doesn't mean there aren't some hard cases. But it does mean that we want to be in a position in which if somebody in the midst of imprisonment recognizes the error of their ways, is in the process of reflecting about where they've been and where they should be going, we've got to make sure that they're in a position to make the turn. <p>And that's why we should not tolerate conditions in prison that have no place in any civilized country. We should not be tolerating overcrowding in prison. We should not be tolerating gang activity in prison. We should not be tolerating rape in prison. And we shouldn't be making jokes about it in our popular culture. That's no joke. These things are unacceptable. <p>What's more, I've asked my Attorney General to start a review of the overuse of solitary confinement across American prisons. The social science shows that an environment like that is often more likely to make inmates more alienated, more hostile, potentially more violent. Do we really think it makes sense to lock so many people alone in tiny cells for 23 hours a day, for months, sometimes even years at a time? That is not going to make us safer. That's not going to make us stronger. And if those individuals are ultimately released, how are they ever going to adapt? It's not smart. <p>Our prisons should be a place where we can train people for skills that can help them find a job, not train them to become more hardened criminals. <p>And I&mdash;look, I don't want to pretend like this is all easy. But some places are doing better than others. Montgomery County, Maryland, put a job training center inside the prison walls to give folks a head start in thinking about what might you do otherwise than committing crime. That's a good idea. <p>Here's another good idea, one with bipartisan support in Congress: Let's reward prisoners with reduced sentences if they complete programs that make them less likely to commit a repeat offense. Let's invest in innovative new approaches to link former prisoners with employers, help them stay on track. Let's follow the growing number of our States and cities and private companies who've decided to \\"Ban the Box\\" on job applications so that former prisoners who have done their time and are now trying to get straight with society have a decent shot in a job interview. And if folks have served their time, and they've reentered society, they should be able to vote. <p>Communities that give our young people every shot at success, courts that are tough but fair, prisons that recognize eventually the majority will be released and so seek to prepare these returning citizens to grab that second chance, that's where we need to build. <p>But I want to add this. We can't ask our police or our prosecutors or our prison guards or our judges to bear the entire burden of containing and controlling problems that the rest of us are not facing up to and willing to do something about. So yes, we have to stand up to those who are determined to slash investments in our communities at any cost: cutting preschool programs, cutting job training programs, cutting affordable housing programs, cutting community policing programs. That's shortsighted. Those investments make this country strong. We've got to invest in opportunity more than ever. <p>An African American man born roughly at 25 years ago has just a one-in-two chance of being employed today. More than one in three African American children are growing up in poverty. When America's unemployment rate was 9.5 percent, when I first came into office, as it was going up, we properly recognized, this is a crisis. Right now the unemployment rate among African Americans is 9.5 percent. What should we call that? It is a crisis. And we have to be just as concerned about continuing to lift up job opportunities for these young people. <p>So today I've been talking about the criminal justice system, but we have to recognize that it's not something we can view in isolation. Any system that allows us to turn a blind eye to hopelessness and despair, that's not a justice system, it is an injustice system. But that is an extension and a reflection of some broader decisions that we're making as a society. And that has to change. That has to change. <p>What the march&mdash;the marchers on Washington knew, what the marchers in Selma knew, what folks like Julian Bond knew, what the marchers in this room still know, is that justice is not only the absence of oppression, it is the presence of opportunity. <p>Justice is giving every child a shot at a great education no matter what Zip Code they're born into. Justice is giving everyone willing to work hard the chance at a good job with good wages, no matter what their name is, what their skin color is, where they live. <p>Fifty years after the Voting Rights Act, justice is protecting that right for every American. Justice is living up to the common creed that says, I am my brother's keeper and my sister's keeper. Justice is making sure every young person knows they are special and they are important and that their lives matter, not because they heard it in a hashtag, but because of the love they feel every single day; not just love from their parents, not just love from their neighborhood, but love from police, love from politicians, love from somebody who lives on the other side of the country, but says, that young person is still important to me. That's what justice is. <p>And in the American tradition and in the immigrant tradition of remaking ourselves, in the Christian tradition that says none of us is without sin and all of us need redemption, justice and redemption go hand in hand. <p>Right before I came out here, I met with four former prisoners, four ex-offenders. Two of them were African American, one of them was Latino, one of them was White. All of them had amazing stories. One of them dropped out of school when he was a young kid. Now he's making film about his experience in the prison system. <p>One of them served 10 years in prison, then got a job at Five Guys&mdash;which is a tasty burger&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and they gave him an opportunity, and he rose up and became a general manager there and now is doing antiviolence work here in the community. <p>One of them, the young Latino man, he came out of prison and was given an opportunity to get trained on green jobs that are helping the environment, but also gave him a marketable skill. And he talked about how the way he's staying out of trouble is, he just keeps on thinking about his two daughters. And I could relate to that, because you don't want to disappoint your daughters. You don't want to disappoint those baby girls. And so he says, I go to work and I come home, and I grab that little baby and get a kiss, and that's keeping me focused. <p>And then, one of them, Jeff Copeland, was arrested six times before his 38th birthday. He was drinking, using drugs, racked up DUI after DUI, sentence after sentence. And he admits that the sentences he was getting for DUI weren't reflective of all the trouble he was causing, could have been worse. And Jeff spent so much time jogging in place in his cell that inmates nicknamed him the Running Man. And he was literally going nowhere, running in place. <p>And then, somehow, Jeff started examining his life. And he said, \\"This isn't me.\\" So he decided to hold himself accountable. He quit drinking. He went to AA. Met a recruiter from the reentry program at the Community College of Philadelphia, enrolled in classes once he was released, made sure to show up every day. Graduated summa cum laude with a 3.95 GPA. And this fall he'll graduate from Temple University with a major in criminal justice and a minor in social work. And he volunteers helping former inmates get their lives back on track. <p>And \\"it's sort of a clich&eacute;,\\" he says, \\"but we can do anything.\\" And just 2 years ago, \\"The Running Man\\" ran his first marathon, because he's going somewhere now. \\"You never look at crossing the finishing line,\\" he says of his journey, \\"you attack it by putting one mile after the other. It takes steps.\\" It takes steps. That's true for individuals. It's true for our Nation. <p>Sometimes, I get in debates about how to think about progress or the lack of progress when it comes to issues of race and inequality in America. And there are times where people say, \\"Oh, the President, he's too optimistic.\\" Or \\"he's not talking enough about how bad things are.\\" Oh and let me tell you something, I see what happens. My heart breaks when I see families who are impacted. I spend time with those families and feel their grief. I see those young men in street corners and eventually in prisons, and I think to myself, they could be me; that the main difference between me and them is, I had a more forgiving environment so that when I slipped up, when I made a mistake, I had a second chance. And they've got no margin for error. <p>I know how hard things are for a lot of folks. But I also know that it takes steps. And if we have the courage to take that first step, then we take a second step. And if we have the courage to take the second step, then suddenly we've taken 10 steps. The next thing you know, you've taken 100 steps. And that's true not just for us as individuals, but that is true for us as a nation. <p>We are not perfect, but we have the capacity to be more perfect. Mile after mile; step after step. And they pile up one after the other and pretty soon that finish line starts getting into sight, and we are not where we were. We're in a better place because we had the courage to move forward. So we cannot ignore the problems that we have, but we can't stop running the race. That's how you win the race. That's how you fix a broken system. That's how you change a country. <p>The NAACP understands that. Think about the race that you have run. Think about the race ahead. If we keep taking steps toward a more perfect Union, and close the gaps between who we are and who we want to be, America will move forward. There's nothing we can't do. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"159" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Oklahoma! <i>Halito!</i> <p><i>Audience members.</i> <i>Halito!</i> <p><i>The President.</i> Everybody, please have a seat. Have a seat. It's good to see you. How is everybody doing? <p>First of all, Michelle says hi. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I want to thank all of you for helping to build the terrific partnership that we share with the Choctaw Nation. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you too. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I want to first of all thank Chief Gary Batton and the many tribal leaders who are here today. I want to thank the extraordinary young people that I just had a chance to meet with. Give them a big round of applause. They were just exceptional and gave me all kinds of interesting thoughts and ideas about how young people can lead and thrive and reshape America. And I could not be prouder of them. <p>As many of you know, we've held a Tribal Nations Conference each year that I've been President. And just last week, as part of what we call our Generation Indigenous initiative, focused on young people, we hosted our first-ever Tribal Youth Gathering, with over a thousand young leaders from 230 tribes, including several Choctaw youth. And you spend time with these young people from all across the country, and they will blow you away. They are smart, and they're passionate, and they are ready to seize the future. <p>And Michelle and I believe we've got a special obligation to make sure that tribal youth have every opportunity to achieve their potential not just for the benefit of themselves and their communities, but for our entire nation; that all of you young people have a chance to succeed not by leaving your communities, but by coming back and investing in your communities; and that you have a whole range of options that can lift us all up. And so we are really excited about what you're doing, and we're really excited about some of the work that's going to be done not just here, but all across the country. That's why I'm here today. <p>When you step back and look at everything that we've done in the past 6&frac12; years to rebuild our economy on a new foundation&mdash;from retooling our industries to rethinking our schools, reforming our health care system&mdash;all of it's been in pursuit of one goal, and that's creating opportunity for all people, not just some, but everybody. <p>And thanks to the hard work and the resilience of the American people, the work we've done is paying off. So our businesses have created 2.8 [12.8]* million new jobs over the past 64 months in a row. That's the longest streak of private sector job growth on record. The housing market is stronger. The stock market recovered, so people's 401(k)s and retirement accounts got replenished. More than 16 million Americans now have the financial security of having health insurance. We've invested in clean energy. We've made ourselves more independent of foreign oil. We've seen jumps in high school enrollment and college graduation rates. <p>So across the board, there's really no economic measure where we're not doing better than we were when I came into office. That's the good news. But I also made it clear when I came into office that even as we're trying to make sure the entire economy recovers, we also have to pay attention to those communities that all too often have been neglected and fallen behind. And as part of that, I said we're going to do better by our First Americans. We're going to do better. <p>Now, we can't reverse centuries of history: broken treaties, broken promises. But I did believe that we could come together as partners and forge a new path based on trust and respect. And that's what we've tried to do. So we strengthened the sovereignty of tribal nations. We gave more power to tribal courts and police. We restored hundreds of thousands of acres of tribal trust lands. We expanded opportunity by permanently reauthorizing the Indian Health Care Improvement Act and helping businesses and building roads and moving forward on renewable energy projects in Indian Country. We untied tribal hands when it came to dealing with domestic violence, which was really important. <p>Here in Oklahoma, we designated the Choctaw Nation as one of America's first Promise Zones, areas where the Federal Government is partnering with local communities and businesses to jumpstart economic development and job creation, expand educational opportunities, and increase affordable housing and improve public safety. And as a result, you've already received Federal investments in Early Head Start to make sure our young people are getting the best possible beginning in life, childcare, job training, support for young entrepreneurs. And I've called on Congress to pass a Promise Zone tax credit to encourage employment and private sector investment in places like this. <p>So we've made a lot of progress not just in Indian Country, but in America as a whole. But we've got more work to do. We've got more work to do, especially because the economy around the globe is changing so fast. <p>So today I want to focus on one way we can prepare our kids and our workers for an increasingly competitive world, a way that we can help our entrepreneurs sell more goods here at home and overseas, a way where we can get every American ready to seize the opportunities of a 21st-century economy. <p>Today we're going to take another step to close the digital divide in America and make sure everybody in America has access to high-speed broadband Internet. We're taking some initiatives today to make that happen. <p>Now, I don't really have to tell you why this is important. Even old folks like me know it's important. In this digital age, when you can apply for a job, take a course, pay your bills, order a pizza, even find a date&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;by tapping your phone, the Internet is not a luxury, it's a necessity. You cannot connect with today's economy without having access to the Internet. Now, that doesn't mean I want folks on the Internet all the time. I always tell young people when I meet them, sometimes, they just have the phone up, I'm standing right in front of them&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and I've got to tell them, young man, put down that phone. Shake the hand of your President. [<i>Laughter</i>] And then, after you shake my hand and look me in the eye and told me your name, then you can maybe go back to taking pictures. [<i>Laughter</i>] So there's nothing wrong with every once in a while putting the technology aside and actually having a conversation. This is something I talk to Malia and Sasha about. We don't let those phones at the dinner table, but that's a whole other story. I went off track. But if you're not connected today, then it's very hard for you to understand what's happening in our economy. Now, here's the problem. While high-speed Internet access is a given, it's assumed for millions of Americans, it's still out of reach for too many people, especially in low-income and rural communities. More than 90 percent of households headed by a college graduate use the Internet. Fewer than half of households with less than a high school education are plugged into the Internet. So, in other words, the people who could benefit the most from the latest technology are the least likely to have it. <p>So if you're a student and you don't have Internet access at home, that means you could be struggling to type papers or do online homework assignments or learn basic computer skills or try to get help from your teacher. You may have to wait in long lines at public libraries or even in parking lots at the local McDonald's just to try to get digital access. And what that means is, you're not learning the critical tech skills required to succeed in tomorrow's economy. <p>And this has consequences. A lot of you have heard about the achievement gap, how some kids in certain groups consistently lag behind, and the opportunity gap, where certain groups have a tougher time getting attached to the labor market. Well, this starts with a \\"homework gap\\" for a lot of young people and an \\"access to learning\\" gap, which then can translate into a science gap or a math gap and eventually becomes an economic gap for our country. And that's not what America is about. America doesn't guarantee you success. That's never been the promise. But what America does stand for&mdash;has to stand for&mdash;is, if you're willing to work hard and take responsibility, then you can succeed, no matter where you start off. <p>That's the essential American story. That's why we admire stories like Abraham Lincoln's. Starts off in a log cabin, teaches himself to read and write, and becomes our greatest President. That's what America is supposed to be about. <p>And in an increasingly competitive global economy, our whole country will fall behind unless we're got everybody on the field playing. I&mdash;obviously, as President, you travel around a lot, and you go to countries like South Korea where a higher percentage of the population has high-speed broadband&mdash;and by the way, they pay their teachers the way they pay their doctors, and they consider education to be at the highest rung of the professions. Well, we will start falling behind those countries, which is unthinkable when we invented the stuff. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, it's American ingenuity that created the Internet, that created all these technologies. And the notion that now we'd leave some Americans behind in being able to use that, while other countries are racing ahead, that's a recipe for disaster, and it offends our most deeply held values. <p>A child's ability to succeed should not be based on where she lives, how much money her parents make. That's not who we are as a country. We've got a different standard. We're a people who believe we should be able to go as far as our talents and hard work will take us. And just because you don't have money in your household to buy fancy technology, that should not be an obstacle. <p>We've been doing a lot to encourage coding and STEM education: math and science and technology education. And unfortunately, for too many of our kids, that's something that's viewed as out of reach. Listen, people are not born coders. It's not as if suddenly, if you're born in Silicon Valley, you can figure out how to code a computer. That's not&mdash;what happens is, kids get exposed to this stuff early, and they learn, they soak it up like sponges. And somewhere among the millions of young people who don't have access to the digital world could be the next Mark Zuckerberg, the next Bill Gates. Some of them might be right here in the Choctaw Nation. But only if we make sure you have access and exposure. If we don't give these young people the access to what they need to achieve their potential, then it's our loss, it's not just their loss. <p>So that's why my administration has made it a priority to connect more Americans to the Internet and close that digital divide that people have been talking about for 20 years now. We've invested so far in more than a hundred thousand miles of network infrastructure. That's enough to circle the globe four times. We've laid a lot of line. We've supported community broadband. We've championed net neutrality rules to make sure that the Internet providers treat all web traffic equally. And then, we launched something called ConnectEd, and this was targeted at making sure that every school was connected and classrooms were connected. And we're now well on our way to connecting 99 percent of students to high-speed broadband in their classrooms by 2018, and that includes here in Durant. So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>So far, 29 million more students in 55,000 schools are on track to have access to high-speed broadband, and 20 million more have Wi-Fi in their classrooms. And last year, when I visited Standing Rock Nation in North Dakota, I announced that Verizon would connect 10 Native student dorms, Microsoft would donate more tablets to more Native students, including students right here in Oklahoma. So we've been making progress. We're chipping away at this thing. <p>But today we're going to go further. I'm announcing a new initiative called ConnectHome. Now, ConnectEd, the idea was making sure the schools were connected and that you didn't have a situation where in a classroom, even if it was connected to the Internet, you could only have one student at a time or a couple of computers at a time. So we had to make sure that the classroom was state of the art. ConnectHome is designed to make high-speed Internet more affordable to residents in low-income housing units across the country. Because young people today, they're not just learning in the classroom, they're learning outside the classroom as well. So my Department of Housing and Urban Development is going to work with 28 communities, from Boston to Durham, from Seattle to Durant. About 200,000 of our most vulnerable children and their families will soon be able to access affordable Internet in their home. <p>Now, I want to give credit where credit is due. This is not something Government does by itself. I'm proud to say that folks around the country are stepping up to do their part. So businesses like Cox are providing low-cost Internet and devices. Best Buy is committing free computer education and technical support so that folks learn how to make the most of the Internet. Organizations like the Boys & Girls Club will teach digital literacy so that kids in this community can be just as savvy as kids growing up in Silicon Valley. You've got nonprofits like EveryoneOn and U.S. Ignite who are going to help make this work on the ground. So we've got some great businesses and some great non-for-profits who are partnering with us on this. <p>But most importantly, it really requires all of us to be involved&mdash;parents, principals, teachers, neighbors&mdash;because we've got to demand the best in our schools and from our kids. <p>These investments are the right thing to do for our communities. They're the smart thing to do for the national economy. And we can't allow shortsighted cuts to the programs that are going to keep us competitive. <p>So this is a smart investment. These are the kinds of investments we need to make. Sometimes, there's a debate going on in Washington about the size of Government and what we should be spending on. And look, I've said before, there are programs in Washington that don't work, and we don't want taxpayer money wasted. But there are some investments that we make in future generations, there are investments we make in things that help all of us that we can't do by ourselves. We're not going to build a road by ourselves; we've got to do that together. We're not going to invest in basic research to solve Alzheimer's by ourselves. At least, I don't have enough money to do that. We've got to do that together. I'll pay some tax dollars, we'll pool our money, and then, we all invest in the research because we all stand to benefit at some point. We don't know when we might get sick, and it's good for us to keep that cutting edge of science. <p>Well, the same thing is true when it comes to schools and investing in our young people and making sure that they've got the tools they need to succeed. So this idea of ConnectHome, just like ConnectEd, this is going to make the difference for a dad who can now&mdash;because it's not just for the kids&mdash;now he can learn a new skill and apply for a better job after work, because he's working a tough shift to pay the rent, but he knows he wants to advance. He may be able to take an online course because he's got access to the Internet, and that could make all the difference in his family and his future. This will make a difference for the young entrepreneur: got a great idea, wants to start a business, can start it from her home. This will make a difference for the student who can now download the resources he needs to study for that exam that's coming up and then maybe come up with a new theory that's going to make a difference in our understanding of the world. <p>This will make a difference for young people like Kelsey Janway. Where's Kelsey? There's Kelsey, right here. Stand up, Kelsey, so everybody can see you. See&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;so&mdash;all right, Kelsey, I know this is embarrassing, so you can sit down for a second. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Kelsey is 16 years old, a proud member of the Choctaw Nation. This might be a game changer for her. When she was younger, her family only got phone reception if they stood on a particular rock in their yard or on the top window sill in their bathroom. Is that right? <p><i>Heavener, OK, resident Kelsey Janway.</i> Yes. <p><i>The President.</i> You remember the rock. <p><i>Ms. Janway.</i> Yes. <p><i>The President.</i> It was this particular rock. So today, she has spotty, slow Internet service at home. And at school, service is just as bad, which makes it tough for students like Kelsey to learn the skills they need for success. Meanwhile, a high school nearby has much better technology; it gives those kids an advantage that she doesn't have. <p>Now, even though she's seen many of her peers get caught up in trouble or lose motivation and maybe drop out of school, Kelsey is keeping on pushing. She works two jobs, belongs to 11 organizations. Now, we're going to need to talk about that. That's a lot of organizations. I don't know where you're finding that time. She's leading a youth council where she helps guide some of her peers. And she says that even the slow Internet that she's got&mdash;probably that buffer and things coming up all the time is getting on her nerves. Nevertheless, that's opened her mind and introduced her to views outside of her own. \\"I have a sense of a bigger world out there.\\" That's what Kelsey says. <p>And that glimpse of what's possible, that can change everything. So last week, Kelsey represented Choctaw Nation at the White House Tribal Youth Gathering. Had a chance to hear from Michelle, right? And she plans to return to the White House one day as President. So I'm just keeping the seat warm for her until she gets there. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I wanted to point out Kelsey having to stand on a rock trying to get phone service as an example of what we're talking about here. <p>There are amazing young people like Kelsey all across the country. I meet them every day: talented, smart, capable; of every race, of every ethnicity, every faith, every background. They've got big dreams. They're just poised to succeed, and they're willing to work through all kinds of obstacles to make great things happen. But they've got big dreams. We've got to have an interest in making sure that they can achieve those dreams. Kelsey, these young people, young people all across the country, they deserve a country that believes in those dreams and that invests in those dreams and that loves them for their dreams. <p>And ultimately, that's what America is about. You know, I know of&mdash;sometimes, folks get discouraged about Washington&mdash;I know I do&mdash;because the arguments between the parties are just so stark and all the differences are exaggerated and what attracts attention and gets on the news on TV is conflict and shouting and hollering. And as a consequence, everybody kind of goes into their corners, and nobody agrees to anything, and nothing gets done, and everybody gets cynical, and everybody gets frustrated. <p>But the thing is that, for all our disagreements, for all our debates, we are one family. And yes, we may squabble just like families do, but we're one family, from the First Americans to the newest Americans. We're one family. We're in this together. We're bound by a shared commitment to leave a better world for our children. We're bound together by a commitment to make sure that that next generation has inherited all the blessings that we inherited from the previous generation. <p>And that requires work on our part. It requires sacrifice. It requires compromise. And it requires that we invest in that future generation; that we're thinking not just about taking care of our own kids&mdash;because I know Malia and Obama, Natasha \\"Sasha\\"Sasha will be fine&mdash;but I want to make sure Kelsey is fine. I want to make sure every one of these young people are fine. I want to make sure that some kid stuck in the inner city somewhere, that they've got a shot. I can't do it for them, but I want to make sure at least that they've got a shot. I want to make sure that somebody down in some little border town in Texas, whose parents maybe never went to college, that they've got a dream and that they've got a shot. <p>And I'm willing to do something about that. And we all have to be. When we make those commitments to all of our children, the great thing about it is, the blessings are returned back to us, because you end up having a workforce that is better educated, which means, suddenly, companies want to locate, which means, businesses starts booming, which means, businesses start hiring, which means, everybody does better. <p>So not only is it the right thing to do, it's the smart thing to do. That's our tradition. It's not Democratic or Republican, it is the American tradition. And we forget that sometimes because we're so caught up in our day-to-day politics, and we listen to a bunch of hooey on TV or talk radio&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that doesn't really tell the truth about what's going on. <p>So I'm proud of Kelsey. I'm proud of these young people. I'm proud of Choctaw Nation. And I surely am proud of these United States of America. Let's get to work and make sure we're leaving the kind of country we want for our kids. <p>God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you.\" "
"160" "\"I just received a briefing from FBI Director Comey, as well as my White House team, about the tragic shooting that took place in Chattanooga today. We don't know yet all the details. We know that what appears to be a lone gunman carried out these attacks. We've identified a name. And at this point, a full investigation is taking place. The FBI will be in the lead, working closely with local law enforcement. <p>We've also been in contact with the Department of Defense to make sure that all our Defense facilities are properly attentive and vigilant as we sort through exactly what happened. And as details of the investigation proceed, we'll make sure that the FBI as well as local law enforcement are providing the public with all the information that's involved. <p>My main message right now is obviously the deepest sympathies of the American people to the four marines that have been killed. It is a heartbreaking circumstance for these individuals who have served our country with great valor to be killed in this fashion. <p>And although the families are still in the process of being contacted, I want them to know that I speak for the American people in expressing our deepest condolences and knowing that they have their full support&mdash;our full support as they try to overcome the grief that's involved here. <p>I also want to say that there are reports of injuries to Chattanooga local law enforcement officials. Thankfully, as far as we know at this point, they have survived the assault. And we want to make sure that they know that we're thinking of them. They're in our thoughts and prayers. <p>We take all shootings very seriously. Obviously, when you have an attack on a U.S. military facility, then we have to make sure that we have all the information necessary to make an assessment in terms of how this attack took place and what further precautions we can take in the future. And as we have more information, we'll let the public know. <p>But in the meantime, I'd ask all Americans to pray for the families who are grief-stricken at this point. And I want everybody to understand that we will be thorough and prompt in figuring out exactly what happened. <p>All right? Thank you very much\" "
"161" "\"Just very briefly, I want to introduce everybody who have not had a chance to meet her. Ms. Emma Didlake is our oldest living veteran: 110 years old, born in 1905, and served with distinction and honor and received all sorts of commendations for her service during World War II. <p>We are so grateful that she is here with us today. And it's a great reminder of not only the sacrifices that the greatest generation made on our behalf, but also the kind of trailblazing that our women veterans made, African American veterans who helped to integrate our Armed Services. We are very, very proud of them. That's why we got to make sure we do right by them. <p>So it's a great honor to have her here. <p>Thank you, everybody.\" "
"162" "\"This week, the United States and our international partners finally achieved something that decades of animosity has not: a deal that will prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. This deal will make America and the world safer and more secure. Still, you are going to hear a lot of overheated and often dishonest arguments about it in the weeks ahead. So today I want to take a moment to take those on one by one and explain what this deal does and what it means. <p>First, you'll hear some critics argue that this deal somehow makes it easier for Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon. Now, if you think it sounds strange that the United States, Great Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, and some of the world's best nuclear scientists would agree to something like that, you are right. This deal actually closes off Iran's pathway to a nuclear weapon. Today, Iran has enough nuclear material to produce up to 10 nuclear weapons. With this deal, they'll have to ship 98% of that material out of the country, leaving them with a fraction of what it takes to make even one weapon. With this deal, they will have to repurpose two key nuclear facilities so they can't produce materials that could be used for a nuclear weapon. So this deal actually pushes Iran further away from a bomb. And there is a permanent prohibition on Iran ever having a nuclear weapon. <p>Second, you might hear from critics that Iran could just ignore everything that's required and do whatever they want, that they are inevitably going to cheat. Well, that criticism is wrong too. With this deal, we will have unprecedented, 24/7 monitoring of Iran's key nuclear facilities. With this deal, international inspectors will have access to Iran's entire nuclear supply chain. The verification process set up by this deal is comprehensive, and it is intrusive, precisely so we can make sure Iran keeps its commitments. <p>Third, you might hear from critics that Iran faces no consequences if it violates this deal. That is also patently false. If Iran violates this deal, the sanctions we imposed that have helped cripple the Iranian economy&mdash;the sanctions that helped make this deal possible&mdash;would snap back into place promptly. <p>There's a reason this deal took so long to negotiate: because we refused to accept a bad deal. We held out for a deal that met every one of our bottom lines. And we got it. <p>Does this deal resolve all of the threats Iran poses to its neighbors and the world? No. Does it do more than anyone has done before to make sure Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon? Yes. And that was our top priority from the start. That's why it's in everyone's best interest to make sure this deal holds. Because without this deal, there would be no limits on Iran's nuclear program. There would be no monitoring, no inspections. The sanctions we rallied the world to impose would unravel. Iran could move closer to a nuclear weapon. Other countries in the region might race to do the same. And we'd risk another war in the most volatile region in the world. That's what would happen without this deal. <p>On the questions of war and peace, we should have tough, honest, serious debates. We've seen what happens when we don't. That's why this deal is online for the whole world to see. I welcome all scrutiny, fear no questions. As Commander in Chief, I make no apology for keeping this country safe and secure through the hard work of diplomacy over the easy rush to war. And on Tuesday, I will continue to press this case when I address the national convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Because nobody understands the true cost of war better than those who have actually served in this country's uniform. <p>We have before us a historic opportunity to pursue a safer, more secure world for our children. It might not come around again in our lifetimes. That's why we are going to seize it today and keep America a beacon of hope, liberty, and leadership for generations to come. <p>Thank you, and have a great weekend.\" "
"163" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! Well, welcome to the White House. And thank you so much, Haben, for that amazing introduction and for working to make sure that students with disabilities get a world-class education, just like you have. So please give Haben a big round of applause. <p>So on a sunny day 25 years ago&mdash;I don't know if it was as hot as it is today&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;President George H.W. Bush stood on the South Lawn and declared a new American independence day. \\"With today's signing of the landmark Americans [with] Disabilities Act,\\" he said, \\"every man, woman, and child with a disability can now pass through once-closed doors into a bright new era of equality, freedom, and independence.\\" <p>Twenty-five years later, we come together to celebrate that groundbreaking law and all that the law has made possible. Thanks to the ADA, the places that comprise our shared American life&mdash;schools, workplaces, movie theaters, courthouses, buses, baseball stadiums, national parks&mdash;they truly belong to everyone. Millions of Americans with disabilities have had the chance to develop their talents and make their unique contributions to the world. And thanks to them, America is stronger and more vibrant; it is a better country because of the ADA. That's what this law has achieved. <p>So today we honor those who made the ADA the law of the land, many of whom are here today. Tom Harkin&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;Tom Harkin is in the back there, and he&mdash;Tom delivered speeches in sign language on the Senate floor in favor of this law, in part inspired by his brother Frank. <p>Bob Dole is here. A war hero whose combat-related disability informed the way he advocated for all Americans with disabilities. <p>Tony Coelho&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;told he couldn't become a priest because of his epilepsy, so he became a Congressman instead&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and helped to pass the ADA so fewer Americans would find the word \\"no\\" being an obstacle to their dreams. <p>In the 1970s, Judy Heumann helped lead the longest sit-in at a Federal building in U.S. history, in support of disability rights. Today, she's at the State Department, advocating for people with disabilities worldwide. She and all the others I mentioned deserve America's thanks for their tireless efforts. <p>I want to thank some of the activists who are here, folks like Ricardo Thornton and Tia Nelis. In 1999, the Supreme Court ruled that institutionalizing people with disabilities&mdash;isolating them, keeping them apart from the rest of the community&mdash;is not just wrong, it is illegal. Ricardo and Tia have pushed to make sure that ruling is enforced. And I am proud of what my administration has done to ensure that people with disabilities are treated like the valuable members of the communities that they are. <p>And I want to thank all the Members of Congress and members of my administration who are here today, including our outstanding Secretary of Labor, Tom Perez, and the White House's fantastic new Disability Community Liaison, Maria Town is here. [<i>Applause</i>] Yay, Maria! Now, days like today are a celebration of our history. But they're also a chance to rededicate ourselves to the future, to address the injustices that still linger, to remove the barriers that remain. <p>The ADA offered millions of people the opportunity to earn a living and help support their families. But we all know too many people with disabilities are still unemployed, even though they can work, even though they want to work, even though they have so much to contribute. In some cases, it's a lack of access to skills training. In some cases, it's an employer that can't see all that these candidates for a job have to offer. Maybe sometimes, people doubt their own self-worth after experiencing a lifetime of discouragement and expectations that were too low. Whatever the reason, we've got to do better. Our country cannot let all that incredible talent go to waste. <p>A few years ago, I issued an Executive order requiring the Federal Government to hire more Americans with disabilities. And in part because of that Executive order, today, more people with disabilities are working with us than at any point in the last 30 years. Some of these folks are some of my closest colleagues and have been incredible leaders on behalf of the administration on a whole host of issues, and I'm grateful for their contributions every single day. <p>And we've strengthened the rules for Federal contractors to make sure they have plans in place for hiring people with disabilities. I'm hoping more employers follow suit, because Americans with disabilities can do the job, and they're hungry for the chance, and they will make you proud if you give them the chance. <p>The ADA also made our more&mdash;made our Government more responsive to Americans with disabilities. But we've still got more to do to live up to our responsibilities. My administration created the first office within FEMA dedicated to disability, so that when disaster strikes, we're prepared to help everybody, including those with physical or mental conditions requiring extra help. And we created the first Special Adviser for International Disability Rights at the State Department, because this is not just about American rights, it's about human rights, and that's something our Nation has to stand for. <p>So we've still got to do more to make sure that people with disabilities are paid fairly for their labor, to make sure they are safe in their homes and their communities, to make sure they have access to technology, including high-speed Internet, that allows for their full participation in this 21st-century economy. We've still got to do more to make sure that children with disabilities get every opportunity to learn and acquire the skills and the sense of self-worth that will last a lifetime. That is our most sacred charge. And we need Republicans and Democrats in Congress to make sure we have a budget that lets us keep that promise and keep that commitment. <p>So I don't have to tell you, this fight is not over. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Oh, no. <p><i>The President.</i> Oh, no. [<i>Laughter</i>] But we're building a stronger foundation. And thanks to generations of Americans who fought for better laws, who demanded better treatment, who in&mdash;by just being good and decent people and effective workers and working hard every day and treating others with respect and asking the same in return, folks have overcome ignorance and indifference and made our country better. I'm thinking of folks like Hamza Jaka, who's here from Wisconsin with his mom. He gloated that he's a Packers fan&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and they've been beating the Bears a lot lately. But Hamza has cerebral palsy. As he puts it, people always assume his condition must limit him. But the opposite is true. His disability has given him unique experiences and a sense of purpose that he cherishes. He traveled to Syria to meet other young people with disabilities, and together, they created a comic book featuring a Muslim superhero who uses a wheelchair called the \\"Silver Scorpion.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] This fall, he's starting law school, where he's going to learn how to be an even more effective advocate. <p>And then you've got somebody like Leah Katz-Hernandez. Leah is one of my favorites. [<i>Laughter</i>] She is&mdash;her smiling face is one of the first things that people see when they come into the White House. She is the West Wing receptionist. We call her ROTUS. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm POTUS, this is VPOTUS, and that's ROTUS. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And ROTUS is the first deaf American to hold that job. She is poised, she is talented, and as she puts it, a lot of her accomplishments may not have been possible without the ADA. <p>And just on a very practical level, this law meant she could ask for sign language interpretation on job interviews, very straight forward. But without this law and without enforcement of the law, those things don't happen. On a deeper level, the fact that the ADA was passed a few years after Leah was born opened possibilities to her that previous generations didn't always have. She says that, thanks to this law, \\"I grew up knowing I was equal, not subhuman.\\" <p>And I've told this story before, but whenever I think about the ADA, I think about my father-in-law Fraser Robinson, who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in his early thirties. By the time I knew him, he needed crutches to get around. He was holding down a job and raising a family at a time where the ADA had not yet been passed. He never missed a day at work. He had to wake up an hour earlier than everybody else just to put on his shirt, just to get dressed, just to get down to the job, but he was never going to be late. <p>If he went to his son's basketball games, he and the family would have to get there 45 minutes early because he didn't want to interrupt people as he climbed one stair at a time on crutches so that he could cheer on his son. Same thing if he went to Michelle's dance receptions. And just through the power of his example, he opened a lot of people's eyes, including mine, to some of the obstacles that folks with disabilities faced and how important it is that the rest of us do our part to remove those obstacles. <p>And just an aside on this, for a long time, he would not get a motorized wheelchair because he had gotten this disability at a time when they weren't available and it was expensive and they weren't wealthy and insurance didn't always cover it. And it just gave you a sense of&mdash;Michelle and I would talk sometimes about how much more he could have done, how much more he could have seen. As wonderful as a dad as he was and as wonderful as a coworker as he was, he was very cautious about what he could and couldn't do, not because he couldn't do it, but because he didn't want to inconvenience his family and he didn't want to be seen as somehow holding things up. <p>And that's what, even for folks who had amazing will, was the nature of having a disability before this law was passed. It wasn't just physical obstacles. It was also constraining how people thought about what they should or should not do. And that's why this is personal. That's why it's so important for us to remember what this law means. That's what today is all about. We've got to tear down barriers externally, but we also have to tear down barriers internally. That's our responsibility as Americans, and it's our responsibility as fellow human beings. <p>As long as I've got the privilege of serving as your President, I'm going to make sure every single day that I'm working alongside you to tear down those barriers. I know Joe Biden is going to be doing the same. And I am going to make sure that when we look back at&mdash;18 months from now, we're going to say we have made some significant advances. And once I'm no longer President, I'm going to keep on pushing as well. <p>So thank you, everybody. God bless you. Proud of you.\" "
"164" "\"Thank you. Please, please, have a seat. Hello, VFW! <p>Thank you, Commander Stroud. John, as you complete your tenure, we want to thank you for your service to the Air Force, to the VFW, and to our Nation. And I look forward to working with your next commander, John Biedrzycki, a proud Army veteran, and as always, your outstanding executive director and Vietnam vet, Bob Wallace, who's doing a great job. <p>I'd ask you all to join me in saluting Ladies Auxiliary president, Ann Panteleakos; your next president, Francisca Guilford; and everybody in the Ladies Auxiliary, because our military families serve right alongside those in uniform. <p>I want to acknowledge Mayor Bill Peduto, our host here in Pittsburgh; County Executive Rich Fitzgerald; and the people of Pittsburgh, who are hosting us in their beautiful city. And I'm pleased to be joined by our Secretary of Veterans Affairs, who you just heard from, Bob McDonald. <p>Like a true Army Airborne Ranger, Bob is tireless. Like the outstanding business leader that he is, he's bringing new reforms to the VA. At one press conference, Bob even gave out his personal cell phone number. Call him anytime, he said. I think he got some calls. On behalf of all of us, I want to thank you, Bob, for you outstanding service. <p>So it is a great honor to be back with the VFW. And I want to start with the simple message: Thank you. As so many of you remember, there was a time, back during the draft, when virtually every American had, at some point, a loved one or a friend in the military. Today, it's an All-Volunteer Force. So a lot of folks don't always have direct contact with our troops and with our veterans. One of the great privileges of my office is that I do. And that's why, as President, I consider it my obligation to help make sure that, even though less than 1 percent of Americans wear the uniform, that 100 percent of Americans honor your sacrifices and your service. <p>As we mark the 70th anniversary of the second end of the&mdash;or the end of the Second World War, I want to offer a special salute to all of our World War II veterans. As communities across our country continue to mark 50 years since the Vietnam War, we say once more, welcome to all our Vietnam vets. As I think you heard this morning, we have new&mdash;a new POW/MIA agency, new leadership. We're building stronger partnerships with veterans' groups like the VFW. Because bringing home Americans taken prisoner or who've gone missing is a sacred mission, and we are stepping up our efforts for all wars, to never leave a fallen comrade behind&mdash;ever. <p>VFW, when I took office, you were the very first veterans' convention I addressed, and I talked with you about how we needed a new vision of American leadership in the world. For too long, there had been a mindset where the first instinct when facing a challenge in the world was to send in our military. And we have the greatest military in human history. But we learned, painfully, where that kind of thinking can lead; that rushing into war without thinking through the consequences and going it alone without broad international support, getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts and spreading our military too thin actually too often would play into the hands of our enemies. That's what they wanted us to do. <p>And who paid the price? Our men and women in uniform. Our wounded warriors. Our fallen heroes who never come home. Their families, who carry that loss forever. <p>And so I said then that our brave troops and their families deserve better. We cannot expect our military to bear the entire burden of our national security alone. Everybody has to support our national security. <p>And so today, we're pursuing a new kind of leadership, a smarter, broader vision of American strength, one that relies not only on our outstanding military, but on all elements of our national power. And that starts with the recognition that our strength in the world depends on our economic strength here at home. And as Americans, we can be proud of the progress we've achieved together. We've now seen more than five straight years of private sector job growth, nearly 13 million new jobs, which is the longest streak on record. The unemployment rate is near the lowest level in 7 years. American manufacturing, our auto industry are booming. Our exports&mdash;Made in America&mdash;have been at record levels. And wages for American workers are finally rising. <p>The stock market has more than doubled, which has restored 401(k)s for millions of Americans. More than 16 million Americans have gained quality, affordable health care who didn't have it before. We are producing more American energy here at home, which is reducing our dependence on foreign oil. And we've done all this while we've cut the deficit by two-thirds. So that's progress, that's strength, and that's American leadership. That serves as the foundation for our national security. <p>And real leadership also means using our power wisely, especially our military. That's why we refocused our fight in Afghanistan, pushed back the Taliban, trained up Afghan forces so they could take the lead for their own security. Today, we can say that our combat mission in Afghanistan is over. We brought America's longest war to a responsible end. And we salute every member of this 9/11 generation who has sacrificed to keep us safe. <p>Now, as Commander in Chief, my greatest responsibility is ensuring the security of the United States in what is still a dangerous world. And that means keeping our military strong. Yes, our Armed Forces are drawing down after two major wars, but some of the reckless budget cuts, under the name of sequestration, that's going on in Washington right now, that's not the way to keep our Armed Forces ready or to take care of our troops and their families. Or to keep America strong with the education and infrastructure and research and development that we need to thrive. These mindless cuts have to end. <p>There are two ways forward right now. On the one hand, we can keep this sequester, trying to fund our military with gimmicks, shortchange national security programs like counterterrorism, increase risk to our troops. Now, I've got to be honest, that's what the Republican budget does. But I've got a better idea, which is to end sequestration, increase the defense budget, invest in America's strengths. And I'm calling on Republican leaders in Congress to come to the table with Democrats, sit down, negotiate a budget that protects our national security and our economic security. <p>We shouldn't be playing partisan politics when it comes to national security. There's no good reason we can't get it done. And I've said I will veto any budget that locks in the sequester. It is not good for our country. Now, every ally and every adversary needs to know around the world the United States has and will continue to have the strongest, most capable fighting force the world has ever known. No one can match our Army, the greatest land force on Earth. Nobody can match our Navy, the largest and most advanced battle fleet in the world, or our Coast Guard, safeguarding our shores and ports. Nobody can match our Air Force; its reach and precision are unequalled. Nobody can match our Marine Corps, the world's only global expeditionary force. Nobody can match our special operations forces, our remarkable, quiet professionals. <p>And I've shown I will not hesitate to use force to protect our Nation, including from the threat of terrorism. Thanks to the skill of our military and counterintelligence professionals, we've struck major blows against those who threaten us. Usama bin Laden is gone. Anwar Awlaki, a leader of the Al Qaida affiliate in Yemen, gone. Many of Al Qaida's deputies and their replacements, gone. Ahmed Abdi Godane, the leader of the Al Qaida affiliate in Somalia, gone. Abu Anas al-Libi, accused of bombing our Embassies in Africa, captured. Ahmed Abu Khattalah, accused in the attack in Benghazi, captured. The list goes on. If you target Americans, you will have no safe haven. We will defend our Nation. <p>When threats emerge, real leadership means the United States rallies the world to action. We're stronger when we stand with allies and partners. No other nation in the world can match the alliances that we have. It's another source of our strength; it's a force multiplier. And I want to take the opportunity to commend Prime Minister David Cameron and our great British allies and their friends, their recent decision to increase their defense spending to 2 percent. That's what every NATO ally should do. They've got to meet their commitments to our collective security so that we stand together. <p>When we stand together, things happen. Right now we've got a coalition of some 40 nations in Afghanistan. The war may be over that we&mdash;that our ground troops fight, but that country is still dangerous. So we'll persevere in our new mission, which is training and assisting Afghan forces, remaining relentless in our counterterrorism operations against Al Qaida. <p>Likewise, we stand together&mdash;a coalition of some 60 nations, including Arab partners&mdash;in the fight against ISIL. I firmly believe that the United States should not be engaged in another major ground war in the Middle East. That's not good for our national security, and it's not good for our military. But what we can do and what we are doing is to pound ISIL from the air&mdash;more than 50,000 [5,000; White House correction.] air strikes so far&mdash;while training and supporting local forces on the ground in Iraq and Syria as they fight to push ISIL back. <p>Recent losses on the battlefield show that ISIL can be defeated. We're a long way from being finished. I've said this is a long campaign; it will take time. But have no doubt, we will degrade and ultimately destroy this barbaric terrorist organization. We've got the coalition, and we've got right on our side, and it will happen. <p>At the same time, we have to remain vigilant in protecting our homeland. Our law enforcement and homeland security professionals are tireless. They've arrested individuals across our country for attempting to join ISIL or for plotting terrorism. They've thwarted attacks; they've saved American lives. <p>We don't yet know all the details behind the attack in Chattanooga, but we do know that Al Qaida and ISIL have encouraged attacks on American soil, including against our servicemembers. And this threat of lone wolves and small cells is hard to detect and prevent. So our entire Government&mdash;along with State and local partners&mdash;we are going to keep doing everything in our power to protect the American people, including our men and women in uniform. <p>And we honor our five servicemembers killed so senselessly in Chattanooga. We are grateful to the courageous police who stopped the rampage and saved lives. And we draw strength from yet another American community that has come together with an unmistakable message to those who would try to do us harm: We will not give in to fear. You cannot divide Americans. You can never change our way of life or the values of freedom and diversity that make us Americans. <p>Now, as we defend our Nation, real leadership also means something else: having the courage to lead in a new direction, the wisdom to move beyond policies that haven't worked in the past, having the confidence to engage in smart, principled diplomacy that can lead to a better future. <p>That's what we're doing in Cuba, where the new chapter between our peoples will mean more opportunities for the Cuban people. Today, with our American Embassy open in Havana for the first time in 50 years, we reaffirm that we will speak out for freedom and universal values around the world. <p>But we're not scared to engage. We also see the strength of American diplomacy in our comprehensive nuclear deal with Iran, because we must prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. And we're now engaged in an important debate, which is a good thing. We are a democracy. Unfortunately, you may have noticed, there's already a lot of shaky information out there. So even as I make the case of why this is a critical deal to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, we're going to make sure the people know the facts. And here are some basic facts. <p>With this deal, we cut off every single one of Iran's pathways to a nuclear program. Iran is prohibited from pursuing a nuclear weapon permanently. Without a deal, those paths remain open and Iran could move closer to a nuclear bomb. With this deal, we gain unprecedented access to Iran's nuclear facilities and monitor them 24/7. Without a deal, we don't get that. With this deal, if Iran cheats, sanctions snap back on. Without a deal, the sanctions unravel. With this deal, we have a chance to resolve the challenge of Iran trying to get a nuclear weapon, peacefully. Without it, we risk yet another conflict in the Middle East. <p>Now, if Iran tries to get a bomb despite this agreement&mdash;10 years from now or 20 years from now&mdash;the American President will be in a stronger position to take whatever additional steps are necessary, including any option of military action, to prevent that from happening. And those are the facts. That's the choice. And for the sake of our national security and the sake of future generations, we need to make the right choice on this critical issue. <p>And I also want to make a broader point. In the debate over this deal, we're hearing the echoes of some of the same policies and mindset that failed us in the past. And some of the same politicians and pundits that are so quick to reject the possibility of a diplomatic solution to Iran's nuclear program are the same folks who were so quick to go to war in Iraq and said it would take a few months. And we know the consequences of that choice, of what it cost us in blood and treasure. <p>So I believe there's a smarter, more responsible way to protect our national security, and that is what we are doing. Instead of dismissing the rest of the world and going it alone, we've done the hard and patient work of uniting the international community to meet a common threat. Instead of chest-beating that rejects even the idea of talking to our adversaries&mdash;which sometimes sounds good in sound bites, but accomplishes nothing&mdash;we're seeing that strong and principled diplomacy can give hope of actually resolving a problem peacefully. <p>Instead of rushing into another conflict, I believe that sending our sons and daughters into harm's way must always be a last resort and that before we put their lives on the line, we should exhaust every alternative. That's what we owe our troops. That is strength, and that is American leadership. <p>Of course, even with this deal, we'll continue to have serious differences with the Iranian Government: its support of terrorism, proxies that destabilize the Middle East. So we can't let them off the hook. Our sanctions for Iran's support for terrorism and its ballistic missile program and its human rights violations, those sanctions will remain in place. And we will stand with allies and partners, including Israel, to oppose Iran's dangerous behavior. <p>And we are not going to relent until we bring home our Americans who are unjustly detained in Iran. Journalist Jason Rezaian should be released. Pastor Saeed Abedini should be released. Amir Hekmati, a former sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps, should be released. Iran needs to help us find Robert Levinson. These Americans need to be back home with their families. <p>There's one more aspect of American leadership I want to discuss because, even more than sending Americans to war, real strength is measured by how we take care of our veterans when you come home. VFW, working together, we've made real progress. We've won historic increases in veterans funding. We've made VA benefits available to more than 2 million veterans who didn't have them before, including more Vietnam vets exposed to agent orange. That was a commitment I made when I ran for office, we're keeping that commitment. <p>We're devoting unprecedented resources for mental health care. We've helped more than 1.4 million veterans and their families pursue their education under the post-9/11 GI bill. We've reduced the number of homeless veterans by about a third. We're helping more veterans and military spouses find good civilian jobs. And the veterans' unemployment rate continues to go down; it's now lower than the national average. And that's all good news. <p>When problems arise, we work to fix them. Here in Pittsburgh, an outbreak of Legionnaire's disease at the VA a few years ago killed six veterans and infected others. That was a tragedy, and whenever there are any missteps, there is no excuse. So our hearts go out to the families of those who have lost loved ones. And know that there is new leadership now at the Pittsburgh VA. The safety measures now in place are some of the strongest in the Nation, and patient safety is a top priority at VA hospitals, because we have to prevent anything like that from ever happening again. <p>Last year, of course, the full magnitude of broader problems also came to light: long wait times, veterans denied care, some people inexcusably cooking the books. It was unacceptable. And I made it clear I wanted those problems fixed. I brought in Bob McDonald, and I went down to the Phoenix VA to see and hear for myself. I know Bob gave you an update earlier. The VA reached out to vets across the country to get them off those wait lists and in for care. Bob is bringing energetic new leadership. He is working to hold people accountable and make sure the whistleblowers are protected instead of punished. <p>With the new resources of the Choice Act, the VA has hired thousands of new physicians, nurses, staff. They're opening more clinics. So to all the veterans who spoke up, I want you to know we heard you; we changed the rule. Now, if it takes you more than 40 miles to drive to a VA facility, we'll help you go to a doctor outside of the VA. Today, the VA is handling millions more appointments, inside and outside the VA, and delivering more care. On average, veterans are waiting just a few days for an appointment. And that's all good news. Veterans continue to tell us that once they get through the door, the care is often very good. <p>A lot of folks across the VA, many of them veterans themselves, work hard every single day to do right by our veterans, and we thank them. But we've got to acknowledge, our work is not done; we still have a big challenge. Even with all these new resources, the VA is still struggling to keep up with the surge of veterans who are seeking care. <p>The fact is, our veterans are getting older. With the end of the most recent wars, more veterans are now coming home. Our veterans are seeking more care. Our veterans are getting the new lifesaving treatment for Hepatitis C. You put it all together, and in some places, wait times are higher than they were last year. <p>So I want you to know, I'm still not satisfied, Bob is still not satisfied. We are focused on this at the highest levels. We are not going to let up. And we're going to keep pushing forward on the five priorities of our veterans agenda. <p>Number one, we're going to keep fighting for the resources you need. And to help deal with this surge, we've sent an urgent request to Congress: Give the VA more flexibility so it can move funds to where they're needed most right now. <p>I'm calling on Congress to approve this request quickly, this month. Our vets need it, and our hospitals need it. And let me just add, we've protected VA funding from sequestration in the past, and I've proposed another increase in veterans funding for next year. And I would point out that the Republican budget falls short, and it's another reminder that the best way to protect VA funding going forward&mdash;and, VFW, we need you to keep raising your voice on this&mdash;is to get rid of sequestration for good. That's how we're going to make sure that our veterans have the resources they need. <p>Number two, we're going to keep fighting to make sure you actually get the health care you've been promised. We'll keep improving care for our growing number of proud women veterans. We've got to make good on the promise of the Clay Hunt Act: improving care for veterans with posttraumatic stress, increasing outreach and peer support, and recruiting more psychiatrists and mental health counselors. We've got to make sure veterans who are already struggling don't fall through the cracks. <p>And we've also got to end the stigma and shame around mental health once and for all. And every American can help by learning the five signs that someone may be hurting so we can all reach out. Our troops and veterans were there for us. We need to be there for them a hundred percent. We've all got a role to play. <p>Number three, we're going to keep cutting the disability claims backlog. I can report that since its peak 2 years ago, we've now cut the backlog by 80 percent&mdash;by 80 percent. And we're going to keep bringing it down. Instead of all that paper, the VA is now handling almost all your disability claims electronically. <p>And by the way, the accuracy of claims is up as well. But I know that it still has taken too long to get a final answer on your appeals. So one of our next missions has to be fundamental reform of the claims appeals process so that it works for you, our veterans, and you can actually get answers faster&mdash;final answers faster. We've recruited some of the best talent from Silicon Valley and the private sector. We're going to put them on the case. Number four, we'll keep fighting to uphold the dignity of every veteran, and that includes ending veterans' homelessness. As part of their Joining Forces initiative, Michelle and Jill Biden are helping to lead the charge. And they've teamed up with hundreds of elected officials: Governors, mayors, local leaders. <p>New Orleans and Houston have become the first cities to effectively end veterans' homelessness. They deserve their congratulations for that. We're seeing major progress in cities like Salt Lake City and Louisville. So this has become a national movement. And we stand by our pledge: We are going to keep at it until every veteran who has fought for America has a place to call home in America. <p>And finally, we're going to keep fighting to give our troops and veterans every chance to enjoy the American Dream you helped defend. Now, there's already a law to protect our troops and military families against unscrupulous predatory lenders. But I have to tell you, some of the worst abusers, like payday lenders, are exploiting loopholes to trap our troops in a vicious cycle of crushing debt. So today we're taking a new step. The Defense Department is closing these loopholes so we can protect our men and women in uniform from predatory lenders. It is the right thing to do. <p>And since today also marks 5 years since I signed historic Wall Street reform into law, let me say I will not accept any efforts to roll back this law or its strong protections for our economy and the American people, including our military families. <p>And we're going to keep helping our newest veterans transition to civilian life. All 50 States have now taken steps to recognize the skills of our veterans when issuing civilian credentials and licenses. So we've got to make sure these laws are working so our veterans actually get those credentials. We'll keep helping our veterans and their families choose the school that's right for them under the post-9/11 GI bill, and that now includes the surviving spouses of our fallen heroes. <p>In 43 States, veterans now pay in-State tuition. We're working to make sure that happens in all 50 States. I don't know what the other seven States think they're doing. We've got to go ahead and make that happen. <p>We'll keep partnering with communities that step up and welcome our veterans home with jobs and opportunities that are worthy of their skills. And as long as I'm President, I'm going to keep telling every business in America: If you want somebody to get the job done, hire a vet. Hire a veteran, because they know what sacrifice means and duty means and responsibility means. <p>Let's do more nation-building here at home. That's part of our strength, part of our American leadership. <p>VFW, as I look around this auditorium, I see that the love of country and the devotion to duty spans the generations. And that spirit endures in those who wear the uniform today. We saw that, once again, last week in Chattanooga. <p>Back in Massachusetts, Tom Sullivan cheered for his Boston teams. In battle, said a comrade, Sully \\"was just everything that a marine should be.\\" In two tours in Iraq, he earned a Combat Action Ribbon; for his wounds, two Purple Hearts. When he was warned that a gunman was there in Chattanooga, he ran in, so that others could live. Today we echo the words of his community: Gunnery Sergeant Thomas J. Sullivan \\"was our hero and he will never be forgotten.\\" \\"Thank you . . . for protecting us.\\" Growing up in Georgia, Skip Wells was a true servant leader: devoted to God and to his friends, quick to lend a hand or put you on his prayer list. During his hometown's Fourth of July parade, he was so proud to be a marine that he went in his dress uniform. Just 21 years old, a year out of boot camp, easy going, always smiling, even during the hardest drills. A friend said, \\"Skip is the kind of kid you want on your team.\\" As Americans, we are forever grateful that Lance Corporal Squire K. Wells was on our team. <p>As an Eagle Scout in Arkansas, David Wyatt would race up a mountain to be the first on top. He was determined to do his part for our country, found his calling in the Marines. He led with courage in Afghanistan and Iraq and with compassion, as a mentor to comrades with posttraumatic stress. It's said he was a \\"gentleman and a gentle man.\\" And no one knew that better than his wife Lorri and their two young children. Today, we see, as they did, why a friend would say that Staff Sergeant David A. Wyatt was \\"the kind of man this country needs more of.\\" <p>Back home, Carson Holmquist was an embodiment of the spirit of Grantsburg, Wisconsin, population, 1,300. Loved country music, loved to fish, to hunt, to play football. And he loved the Marines, showing up at his old high school in his dress blues. He, too, served in Afghanistan; was devoted to his family, his wife Jasmine and their two-year-old son. Said his old coach, Carson \\"always did the best he could.\\" Today, our Nation is stronger because America saw the best of Sergeant Carson A. Holmquist. <p>And in his hometown in Ohio, Randall Smith is remembered as the high school baseball star with the fierce pitch. He was a fun and outgoing guy&mdash;the guy, they said, you just wanted to be around. His buddies in the Navy knew it&mdash;he had just reenlisted&mdash;and his family knew it too: his wife Angie, who called&mdash;who he liked to call \\"the most beautiful woman in the world,\\" and their young daughters, who he called his \\"little princesses.\\" Today, we join the people of Paulding, Ohio&mdash;including VFW Post 587, with five flags flying&mdash;in honor of Navy Petty Officer 2d Class Randall S. Smith. <p>VFW, our Nation endures because citizens like you put on the uniform and serve to keep us free. We endure because your families serve and stay strong on the home front. We endure because the freedoms and values you protected are now defended by a new generation, Americans just like our five patriots who gave their lives in Chattanooga. As a grateful nation, we must stand up for them and honor them, now and forever. <p>God bless these American heroes. God bless all our troops and all of our veterans. God bless the United States of America. <p>Thank you, VFW. We're proud of what you do.\" "
"165" "\"Well, I've just had the opportunity to hear from businesses all across the country to talk about the importance of reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank. <p>This is not an issue that typically rises to the front page of the newspapers, but for these businesses and for their employees and for the communities that they serve, this is vital. Now, just understand what the Export-Import Bank does and has been doing for 81 years is to help U.S. companies with U.S. employees sell their products overseas. It helps a small coffee company or a quiche company, but also large manufacturers of trains or bridges and infrastructure to be able to go to foreign businesses, foreign markets&mdash;in some cases, foreign governments&mdash;and say to them, America makes the best product in the world, we want to sell to you, and we are prepared to do business with you on terms that allow you initially maybe not to send us all the cash, but we've got&mdash;we're sending the goods to you, you get the cash back. <p>And as a consequence of this arrangement, not only do we not end up subsidizing these companies, these companies are paying a fee to the Export-Import Bank. The Export-Import Bank makes money for the U.S. Government. So I just want to be clear about this. This is not a situation in which taxpayers are subsidizing these companies. In fact, at the end of the day, we have a situation in which the U.S. Treasury is benefiting while at the same time allowing these companies to sell their products overseas. <p>And this historically has been a bipartisan program, under Democratic Presidents and Republican Presidents, with support from Democratic Members of Congress and Republican Members of Congress. Then, the fact that for the first time since its inception Congress failed to reauthorize this is a shame. And this is what Representative Heck was alluding to. Every other advanced country on Earth has a program like this in order to promote their businesses when they're selling overseas. And for us to be the only country that leaves these outstanding companies high and dry makes absolutely no sense. <p>You'll hear some critics suggest that, well, this is just corporate welfare for big multinationals. That is wrong. It is true that Boeing is able to sell planes and GE is able to sell big turbine engines in part because of this kind of financing arrangement, because oftentimes the customer is not prepared to just go ahead and pay cash up front. But Ferra Coffee is a company with 12 employees. It needs this. Susan Axelrod's company makes quiche, but 30 percent of their revenue is from exports. <p>We've got companies here that range from 12 employees up to 500 employees. All of them are savvy business people. If in fact they were able to make effective financial arrangements in the private marketplace, they would do so. But private financing in the traditional banks are not able to provide the same service or have the same expertise about dealing with some of these other markets that the Export-Import Bank does. <p>So this should be a no-brainer. Nobody has presented to me a plausible argument as to why we wouldn't do this. And by the way, this also affects every community in the country. There's a reason why we've got the mayors of Mobile, Alabama, and Mesa, Arizona, here. You've got small companies&mdash;or small companies and small towns in Texas that are being affected. You've got small companies in Portland, New Hampshire, Maine. From coast to coast, people are being affected by this, and we heard stories from these companies right now that orders are on hold, business is endangered, potentially, expansions will stall, fewer employees will be hired if we do not get this done. <p>So we need to get this done. And the good news is, is that you've got outstanding Members of Congress like Maxine Waters and Denny Heck and Gwen Moore and Senators like Sherrod Brown and Heidi Heitkamp and Maria Cantwell who have been working this issue very hard for a long time. These next couple of weeks, before Congress adjourns, is the time for us to go ahead and complete this. We cannot leave these businesses hanging; we cannot unilaterally disarm. Most importantly, we can't have American workers losing jobs because Congress doesn't act or because of some ideological arguments that don't make any sense and don't match up with the facts. <p>So I feel very strongly about this. I know it's not as interesting as some of the other issues and Donald Trump and all that&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but I tell you what, this is actually something that matters to people on the ground. And I'm hoping that we really stay focused on this until Congress reauthorizes. All right? <p>So I want to thank the companies who are being here. We really appreciate you telling your stories. And I'm willing to bet that any of these companies or mayors who are here representing their communities will be happy to meet with some of the members of the media and tell their stories more directly so that you guys can highlight what's at stake here. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"166" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hey! Well, welcome to the White House, everybody. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Thank you! <p><i>The President.</i> You all look good. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Thank you! <p><i>The President. </i>We have some of America's biggest champions for a strong partnership of&mdash;with Africa here today: members of the diplomatic corps from our African partners; we 've got some outstanding Members of Congress; leaders of business; NGOs; members of the faith community. <p>Ambassador Olhaye&mdash;I want to start by saying that tonight our thoughts are with our friends from Djibouti as we mourn the passing of Ambassador Olhaye. He served here since 1988, the longest serving foreign Ambassador in the United States. He was the dean of the diplomatic corps here and at the United Nations. Michelle and I welcomed him to the White House numerous times. He represented his nation and all of Africa with pride. And the legacy of his service, particularly his personal role in helping pass AGOA, is going to endure in the strong partnership between our peoples. <p>I want to thank everybody who is here for everything that you do to strengthen ties between Africa and the United States. Tonight I especially want to thank you because, with your help, we succeeded in achieving the long-term renewal of the African Growth and Opportunity Act. [<i>Applause</i>] That is worth applauding. <p>So our celebration comes at a perfect moment, because tomorrow, I am going to Africa. I will be going to my father's home country of Kenya, and we will be going to Ethiopia as well. That's my first visit there, but this is my fourth visit the sub&mdash;to sub-Saharan Africa, more than any other U.S. President, which, I guess, if you're name is Barack Obama, I guess that make sense. [<i>Laughter</i>] I will also have the honor of being the first U.S. President to address the African Union. <p>My trip, although not long, because we still got a lot of other business to attend to back here, reflects a truth that has guided my approach to Africa. Despite its many challenges&mdash;and we have to be clear eyed about all the challenges that the continent still faces&mdash;Africa is a place of incredible dynamism, some of the fastest growing markets in the world, extraordinary people, extraordinary resilience. And it has the potential to be the next center of global economic growth. <p>And that's why, as President, I have worked so hard to take our relationship with Africa to a new level. We have boosted U.S. exports. We have launched historic initiatives to promote trade and investment, health, agricultural development and food security, Power Africa to promote and expand electrification. We're empowering a new generation of young African leaders, including our inspiring Mandela Fellows, who, when I get back, I will have a chance to meet with here at the White House for the second class of that outstanding group. And part of what gives me the most pleasure is the fact that we're able to do this on a bipartisan basis and in partnership with African countries. By the way, to help move these efforts along, we do still need the Senate confirmation of Gayle Smith as our USAID Administrator. Not only is Gayle brilliant and passionate about the issues and with so many deep, longstanding relationships with people of the continent, but I can always spot her in a crowd because of the hair. [<i>Laughter</i>] All I had to do was just scan, and then, there it was. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now that it's been renewed, AGOA will be central to our efforts to boost the trade and investment that supports hundreds of thousands of jobs both in Africa and the United States, creating opportunities for all of us. And I'm especially pleased that AGOA will continue to encourage good governance and labor and human rights. That's something that we can be proud of. <p>We're going to have to keep on encouraging more American trade and investment in Africa. There's still a lot of misperceptions within the business community. And that's why, last year, the United States hosted its first U.S-Africa Business Forum. <p>Tonight I can announce that we will host the next business forum next year, and I look forward to working with all of you to help unleash the growth and opportunity that we know Africa is capable of, progress that delivers more hope and more progress to Africans across the continent and more jobs and growth here in the United States. <p>The ties to Africa here in the United States obviously are deep; they are long; they are complicated. There have been times where there have been misunderstandings, and there have been times where there have been suspicions. But when you look at every survey, it turns out that the people of Africa love the United States and what it stands for, perhaps unmatched on any continent. And what's also interesting about the surveys is, is that when they look to see who are the happiest and most optimistic of people, what's amazing is, is that Africans always rank high, despite poverty, despite conflict. There is a strength and a resilience there. <p>And the opportunities are extraordinary, and we just have to break down the stereotypes and the barriers. And thanks to the work of all of you; and I particularly want to thank the Members of Congress who are here who have fought so hard for this, and many of them will be going with me on this Africa trip. I really want to commend them, because they are going to help break down those misunderstandings and make things happen. <p>So thank you very much, everybody. Enjoy the reception. Thank you.\" "
"167" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello! How's everybody doing? So, first of all, I want everybody to understand, I am not Wale. [<i>Laughter</i>] Although, I do have Wale's mike, and I've got to give it back to him after I say hi to you guys. <p>Has everybody had a good session here today? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes! <p><i>The President.</i> Right? Now, I understand that you spent time with the true star of the Obama household&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;the First Lady of the United States. But I was not going to let her have all the fun because I wanted to just come by; I've got a lot of stuff going on&mdash;I'm working this, and I'm working that&mdash;but I did want to come by just to explain why I think this conference that got organized is so important. <p>America succeeds only when every young person in America is able to dream big and has the tools to chase their dreams. And if there is one thing that's always set America apart, it's been the idea that no matter what you look like, where you come from, how you started out, what your first name was, last name, what religion you were, what ethnicity, that if you worked hard, you could make it. And we have not always met that ideal, but that's always been the goal, that's what's unified us as a nation. <p>And the intention here at \\"Beating the Odds\\" Summit is just to remind all of us that even when times look tough and even though there are very real frustrations out there in terms of inequality and racism and there are barriers that are put in place that need to be torn down, but haven't gotten torn down yet and sexism and folks who are bullying our LGBT brothers and sisters. Even though those are real problems, this is still a nation of opportunity. <p>And when we see young people like you, we want to make sure that you are mindful of these problems, that hopefully, you will work together in a unified fashion to make even more progress, that you don't ignore these issues, but that you also have confidence that if you're willing to work hard and if you're willing to dig deep and if you're willing to make sacrifices, and if you're willing to embrace the values that are best in us, there's nothing that's going to stop you. And you've got to set your bar high. <p>So if you're already doing well in school, you can do better. If you're already working in the community to make a difference, you can be an even greater leader. There's never been a time in human history where there's more possibility. And you're a generation that, because of that camera that you've got and the phone and&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;because of all that, you've got the world at your fingertips in a way that two generations ago, three generations ago, people could not even imagine. You've got more information in that little thing&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;than the&mdash;than what used to be the world's greatest libraries. You have access to more, and more people have access to you. But you've got to use it. And so, hopefully, the entire concept here has been to show how people did beat the odds and to remind you that there's nothing holding you back except you. And you've got to be aggressive. <p>And look, if a kid born in Hawaii named Barack Obama&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;can end up being President of the United States and a young girl born on the South Side&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;of Chicago can end up being the First Lady, there's nothing you can't do. And hopefully, this summit has given you some sense of the possibilities, and also hopefully, it's given you some relationships and some networks that you can now tap because not only do I expect out of you individual success, but I also expect you to work together to bring about some collective success. Don't buy into the notion that your life's purpose is just about you, because there are a lot of folks who had even less advantages than you did, and you've got to be willing to reach back and bring them along. <p>All right? A'ight. Thank you, everybody. Let's&mdash;I've got to go give the mike back so the main attraction can come back out here. My rapping skills are terrible. [<i>Laughter</i>] I&mdash;that's one thing I can't do is rap. I like rap, but I cannot rap. [<i>Laughter</i>] Although, I've got&mdash;I have enough of a rap that I got Michelle to marry me, though. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm just saying.\" "
"168" "\"Hi, everybody. It's been 7 years since the worst financial crisis in generations spread from Wall Street to Main Street, a crisis that cost millions of Americans their jobs, their homes, their life savings. It was a crisis that cost all of us. It was a reminder that we're in this together, all of us. <p>That's how we battled back these past 6&frac12; years&mdash;together. We still have work to do, but together, we prevented a second Great Depression. Our businesses have created nearly 13 million jobs over the past 64 months. The housing market is healthier. The stock market has more than doubled, restoring the retirement savings of millions. Americans of all stripes buckled down, rolled up their sleeves, and worked to bring this country back. And to protect your efforts, we had to do something more; we had to make sure this kind of crisis never happens again. <p>That's why 5 years ago this week, we enacted the toughest Wall Street reform in history: new rules of the road to protect businesses, consumers, and our entire economy from the kind of irresponsibility that threatened all of us. Five years later, here's what that reform has done. <p>Wall Street reform turned the page on the era of \\"too big to fail.\\" Now, in America, we welcome the pursuit of profits. But if your business fails, we shouldn't have to bail you out. And under the new rules, we won't. The day of taxpayer-funded bailouts are over. <p>Wall Street reform now allows us to crack down on some of the worst types of recklessness that brought our economy to its knees, from big banks making huge, risky bets using borrowed money, to paying executives in a way that rewarded irresponsible behavior. <p>Thanks to Wall Street reform, there's finally an independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with one mission: to protect American consumers. Already, they've gone after predatory or unscrupulous mortgage brokers, student lenders, credit card companies, and they've won, putting nearly $11 billion back into the pockets of more than 26 million consumers who've been cheated. <p>So this law is working. And we're working to protect even more families. Just this week, we announced that we're cracking down on the worst practices of payday lenders on military bases so that our troops and their families don't wind up trapped in a vicious cycle of debt. As long as I'm President, I'm going to keep doing whatever I can to protect consumers, and our entire economy from the kind of irresponsibility that led to the great recession in the first place. <p>None of this has been easy. We've had to overcome fierce lobbying campaigns from the special interests and their allies in Congress. They're still trying to attack everything that these reforms accomplish. They're hiding rollbacks of key protections in unrelated bills. They're blocking the financial cops on the beat from doing their job. And they continue to claim this Wall Street reform is somehow bad for business. Of course, that doesn't explain 13 million new jobs and a stock market near record highs. This law is only bad for business if your business model depends on recklessness that threatens our economy or irresponsibility that threatens working families. We can't put the security of families at risk by returning to the days when big banks or bad actors were allowed to write their own rules. And if any bill comes to my desk that tries to unravel the new rules on Wall Street, I will veto it. We've worked too hard to recover from one crisis just to risk another one. <p>In America, we should reward drive and innovation and fair play. And that's what reform of Wall Street does. It makes sure everybody plays by the same set of rules. And if we keep moving forward, instead of backward&mdash;if we keep building an economy that rewards responsibility instead of recklessness&mdash;we won't just keep coming back, we'll come back stronger than ever. <p>Thanks, everybody, and have a great weekend.\" "
"169" "\"<i>President Obama.</i> Thank you. Thank you so much. Please, please, everybody, have a seat. Good morning! <p><i>Audience members.</i> Good morning! <p><i>President Obama.</i> Thank&mdash;hey!<i> Jambo!</i> <p>Thank you so much, President Kenyatta, for your timely remarks, your warm welcome, and the great work that has gone into hosting this summit. It is wonderful to be back in Kenya. <i>Niaje! Wazi! </i><p><i>Audience members.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>President Obama.</i> <i>Hawayuni!</i> <p>I'm proud to be the first U.S. President to visit Kenya. And Obama, this is personal for me. There's a reason why my name is Barack Hussein Obama. My father came from these parts, and I have family and relatives here. And in my visits over the years, walking the streets of Nairobi, I've come to know the warmth and the spirit of the Kenyan people. <p>Now, what President Kenyatta and I really want to have is a conversation with our panel. And we've got some outstanding young people here today who I think represent the promise of entrepreneurship not only in Africa, but around the world. But I do want to make just a few quick points. <p>We are joined today by inspiring entrepreneurs from more than 120 countries, and many from across Africa. And all of you embody a spirit that we need to take on some of the biggest challenges that we face in the world: the spirit of entrepreneurship, the idea that there are no limits to the human imagination, that ingenuity can overcome what is and create what needs to be. <p>And everywhere I go, across the United States and around the world, I hear from people, but especially young people, who are ready to start something of their own, to lift up people's lives and shape their own destinies. And that's entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship creates new jobs and new businesses, new ways to deliver basic services, new ways of seeing the world. It's the spark of prosperity. It helps citizens stand up for their rights and push back against corruption. Entrepreneurship offers a positive alternative to the ideologies of violence and division that can all too often fill the void when young people don't see a future for themselves. <p>Entrepreneurship means ownership and self-determination, as opposed to simply being dependent on somebody else for your livelihood and your future. Entrepreneurship brings down barriers between communities and cultures and builds bridges that help us take on common challenges together. Because one thing that entrepreneurs understand is, is that you don't have to look a certain way or be of a certain faith or have a certain last name in order to have a good idea. <p>Now, the challenge is&mdash;as so many of you know&mdash;it's very often hard to take those first steps. It's hard to access capital. It's hard sometimes to get the training and the skills to run a business as professionally as it needs to be in this competitive world. It's hard to tap into the networks and mentors that can mean the difference between a venture taking off and one that falls flat. <p>And it's even harder for women and young people in communities that have often been marginalized and denied access to opportunities. You run into old attitudes that say some people, because of where you come from or what you look like, don't have what it takes to lead or create a business. And sometimes, it's subtle. You go into pitch an idea, and maybe the response you get might not be as enthusiastic as if someone else pitched the exact same idea. Sometimes, women or folks from communities that historically have not been viewed as entrepreneurial may not have the means of opening those doors just to get in front of the right person. <p>Of course, the best answer to that kind of thinking is the example that all of you are setting: your success. And that's why I've made encouraging this spirit of entrepreneurship a key part of America's engagement in the world. I launched the first of these summits in Washington 5 years ago. And since then, we've helped empower hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs, giving them a boost to launch thousands of new businesses and initiatives. Here in Africa, our Young African Leaders Initiative is empowering tens of thousands of dynamic leaders not only in business, but also in government and civil society. Because one of the things that we have come to understand&mdash;and this is particularly relevant to Africa&mdash;is that in order to create successful entrepreneurs, the Government also has a role in creating the transparency and the rule of law and the ease of doing business and the anticorruption agenda that creates a platform for people to succeed. <p>So this is our first Global Entrepreneurship Summit in sub-Saharan Africa. We wanted to come here. I wanted to be here because Africa is on the move. Africa is one of the fastest growing regions of the world. People are being lifted out of poverty. Incomes are up. The middle class is growing. And young people like you are harnessing technology to change the way Africa is doing business, as President Kenyatta alluded to. And that creates incredible opportunities for Africans and for the world. It means more growth and trade that creates jobs in all our countries. It's good for all of us. This continent needs to be a future hub of global growth, not just African growth. <p>And the country that's hosting us today is setting an important example. Kenya is leading the way. Today, Kenya is the largest economy in East Africa. High-speed broadband and mobile connectivity are on the rise, unleashing the entrepreneurial spirit of even more Kenyans. Every day around the world, millions of people send and save money with M-Pesa, and it's a great idea that started here in Kenya. <p>From Zimbabwe to Bangladesh, citizens work to keep elections safe, using the crowdsourcing platform Ushahidi, and that's a great idea that started right here in Kenya. Here in Nairobi, startup incubators are nurturing new businesses every day&mdash;maybe some of yours&mdash;each with the potential to be the great next Kenyan innovation. <p>And the good news is that I'm not the only one who sees the promise of Africa. I'm joined on this trip by some leaders not just across my administration, but I'm also joined by 20 Members of the United States Congress from both parties, because supporting a strong partnership with Africa is something that unites Americans. We've got some incredible entrepreneurs and business leaders who are well established from the United States who are with us. They see the promise as well. And they're putting their money where their mouth is. So today we're taking the next steps to partner with you. First, we're offering entrepreneurs more startup capital. At last year's Entrepreneurship Summit, we set a goal of generating $1 billion in new investment for emerging entrepreneurs around the world, with half the money going to support women and young people. A few months ago, I challenged governments, companies, organizations, and individuals to help us reach this target. Today I am proud to announce that not only did we make our goal, we surpassed it. We've secured more than $1 billion in new commitments from banks, foundations, philanthropists, all to support entrepreneurs like you. <p>Second, we're connecting you with the world's top business leaders and innovators. We hand-picked more than 200 seasoned investors and entrepreneurs and brought them to this summit. I've even brought a few of my Presidential ambassadors for entrepreneurship. These are some of America's leading innovators and entrepreneurs. So if you see them, don't be shy. [<i>Laughter</i>] Pin them down. Get their advice. Pitch them your idea. That's why they're here. And don't be discouraged if they say, I'm not sure that's going to work, and they ask you tough questions. Because one of the things every one of these successful entrepreneurs will tell you is that along with incredible successes, they've had some failures as well, and they've learned from them, but they haven't given up. <p>Number three, as I've said, we're stepping it up to support women entrepreneurs. Women are powerhouse entrepreneurs. The research shows that when women entrepreneurs succeed, they drive economic growth and invest more back into their families and communities. The&mdash;we've already helped build a network of more than 1,600 women entrepreneurs across Africa. We're launching three women's entrepreneurial centers: one in Zambia, one opening later this year here in Nairobi, and I'm proud that&mdash;I'm proud to announce that the third center will be located in Mali. [<i>Applause</i>] We've got some folks from Mali in the house. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And as part of that $1 billion that I mentioned earlier, the United States Overseas Private Investment Corporation is contributing $100 million to support Goldman Sachs' 10,000 Women initiative, making more capital available to women-owned enterprises around the world. So congratulations. <p>So as you leave here today, I want you all to know that I believe in you. I believe that you have the drive and the passion to change the world. You can unlock new solutions to the pressing global challenges that we face. I believe that. I believe that as you make these innovations, you'll make life better for all of us. And I'm looking forward to being your partner in that process. <p>So with that, what I think we need to do is to hear from some of these young entrepreneurs themselves. They can tell us a little bit of what they're doing, because I think they're great examples of all the talent that is here today. <p>Thank you very much. <p>[<i>At this point,</i> <i>Hello Tractor Chief Executive Officer Jahiel Oliver, Teddy the Guardian Chief Executive Officer Josipa Majic, Akirachix Cofounder Judith Owegar, and President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya made brief remarks. Mr. Oliver, who moderated the discussion, then made concluding remarks, and President Obama made additional remarks as follows.</i>] <p><i>President Obama.</i> Absolutely. That's well said. I think what's also interesting is, as you listen to these three&mdash;and I think that I'm sure this is true of many of the entrepreneurs here as well&mdash;one of the advantages of this technological revolution that we're going through is that it can be tailored and adapted to different countries, different environments, different circumstances, in some cases enabling countries to leapfrog over old technologies, to individualize what's done for a particular market or a particular need. <p>And the kind of thing that Jahiel is talking about&mdash;the share economy concept&mdash;we've got the founder of Airbnb out here, and you can talk to him a little bit. He's doing pretty good. [<i>Laughter</i>] But there's a recognition that through these technological platforms, what might have previously required huge investments of capital, and as a consequence, big barriers to entry, now you can get a startup moving, and if it's the right idea, it can travel with the speed of how fast you can text. I can't text very fast, but&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I notice Malia and Sasha, they both&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>And so I think that this makes a place like Africa or a Croatia or other countries that historically may not have been viewed as right at the center of the global economy, suddenly, they can compete on a level playing field. And if you have a good idea in Zagreb or in Abuja or wherever, now you potentially have access to a global marketplace in ways that you haven't had before. <p>What President Kenyatta said is absolutely correct though, and that is, for us to take full advantage of this, we have to support programs like Judith's so that our young people are being trained in this technology, that there are no barriers for girls to be trained in this technology. If half of your team is not playing, you've got a problem. And in too many countries, half of the team&mdash;our women and girls&mdash;are not participating enough in this. <p>So we've got to invest in human capital so that they can&mdash;everyone has the opportunity to access this information, and there's got to be the framework for access to capital, reduce regulatory barriers, the ability to start up businesses effectively, making sure that governments are facilitating as opposed to being parasitic on entrepreneurial efforts&mdash;that's our job. <p>And I think that the good news is, is that we're seeing that recognition in more and more governments around the world. Not all of them always are practicing what they preach, but it's a start when governments feel obliged through, for example, initiatives like the Open Government Partnership that we started through the United Nations, where they feel obliged to acknowledge that they've got to get these rule of law issues and accountability issues and human investment issues right, then that gives us a lever to start continually improving the environment for all of you and your operations. <p>And last point I would make&mdash;and then&mdash;President Kenyatta alluded to this&mdash;I think it's very important for the business leaders who are here, the established business leaders, to understand that this is a&mdash;still a neglected market, and access of capital&mdash;accessing capital for entrepreneurs here is still too hard. And we can help&mdash;U.S. Government policy can help&mdash;but some of this is exposure and people having a vision of what's possible. <p>When I was here in Nairobi 10 years ago, it looked very different than it does today. And the incredible progress that's been made, imagine what could happen if more and more of our global business leaders and global capital paid a visit and actually had a conversation, as opposed to just being blinded by some of the stereotypes that are so often promoted. This thing could move even faster. And that's part of the reason why this summit is so important. <p>So I'm proud of all of you. I'm proud of these three entrepreneurs who are here. They represent all the talent that's in this room. Go out there and start something. We're excited about it. We expect great things out of you. <p>Thank you very much.\" "
"170" "\"Now, one other thing I want to point out: So our Power Africa initiative has been leveraging private capital to invest in electrification all across the continent. And our preliminary goal was 10,000 megawatts; now we're looking at 30,000 megawatts, and we're well on our way. <p>Some of those megawatts are going to be generated by very traditional power plants and the traditional financing and large-scale capital. But part of what all these folks represent is the creativity of recognizing that there are going to be a lot of ways of generating power and a lot of different distribution mechanisms. And the models that we have in the United States may not always be perfectly adaptable to a rural region of a country, where you might wait 20 years before you get all the power lines in. <p>Moreover, part of what's taking place is, because&mdash;you notice these solar panels&mdash;this is an opportunity for countries like Africa to leapfrog over dirty energy and immediately go to clean energy. And so this mix of traditional products&mdash;or traditional products combined with these innovative ways of both producing energy and distributing it is why we think this is going to be such a promising initiative over the next several years. <p>There was an article, I think a while back, about, well, how much electricity has Power Africa actually produced lately? And I would just point out that if you wanted to start a power plant in the United States, it doesn't take a year to get that done. In fact, what's happening is, is that financing, the transactions have been completed, plans are underway, and the work that is being done now, we're going to start seeing thousands, then ten of thousands, then hundreds of thousands, and then ultimately millions of households all across this continent with electrical power that can boost productivity and economic growth all across the continent. <p>So it's really promising. We're really excited about it. All right.\" "
"171" "\"<i>President Kenyatta.</i> Thank you very much, Amina. And I appreciate your sentiments. President Barack Obama, President Mwai Kibaki, our distinguished visitors, distinguished guests: Let me begin once again, as I have said severally since the start of this visit, on behalf of the people of the Republic of Kenya, that we are once again delighted to welcome you to this country and to this city. And I know and strongly believe that you have felt the warmth of our people and, indeed, especially you, President Obama, the tremendous joy at your presence here with us in Nairobi and in Kenya. Welcome and welcome again. <p>Mr. President, this is not your first trip to Kenya. And indeed, we have heard severally, Amina has just mentioned, and you yourself have told us that you have been here. But yesterday you returned riding on the wings of history as a President of historic consequence for America, for Africa, and most importantly, for Kenya. <p>As a world leader who has grappled with great challenges of this age and as a builder of bridges, and to you once again, we say, <i>karibu na sana Kenya.</i> <p>The people of Kenya and the United States share such an abiding love of freedom that we have made grim sacrifices to secure it for our children. We then chose to weave our diverse cultures into a national tapestry of harmonious coexistence. Our paths have not been easy. We have not realized these values in full measure, as indeed we have discussed. But our record has been one of steady progress. <p>Indeed, Kenya has been inspired by the immense accomplishments of the United States in its 239 years of independence. We, as a country, are much younger. It has been a mere half century since the dawn of our republic. Yet, in that time, we've had the foundation built for an enduring democracy. On our journey, we have been strengthened by the support of our friends, and few of them have been closer than the United States. <p>In 1959, one of our own national heroes, Tom Mboya, shared a stage with Martin Luther King, Jr., and he said that Africans and the Americans of the civil rights movement were united in a common search for political freedom. He would then join hands with Senator John F. Kennedy, other American philanthropists and activists, to bring hundreds of young Kenyans to American universities. He hoped to prepare a group of educated and committed Kenyans who would complete the transition from colonial domination to self-government. <p>His hopes were more than fulfilled. The Nobel Laureate, the late environmentalist, Professor Wangari Maathai, was one of those who traveled. Another was Barack Obama Senior, your father, who had the same audacious hope that you have and spoke powerfully about it: to make something of his immense promise and to bring development and freedom to his people. <p>To this day, Kenyans still travel to the United States in search of education. Some of those assembled here went to American colleges, and Kenyans now form the second largest group of students from Africa in the United States. Indeed, Mr. President, you and I have constituents in common. [<i>Laughter</i>] The largest part of our diaspora, many holding dual citizenships, and who are now entitled to vote in Kenya as well&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;reside in America. America has shown great generosity in aiding our development efforts and has supported our democratic aspirations. Our relationship has been unbroken for half a century. And, Mr. President, I believe that you and I can deepen this relationship. And together, we can make this region safe again. We can secure democracy, and we can bring our entrepreneurs and investors together for our common prosperity. <p>I, indeed, look forward to continuing our conversation in the coming weeks and months. And indeed, before I conclude, I must say that this is destiny in many ways. Fifty-some years ago, I don't think anybody would ever have realized what we share here today. As those who left Kenyan shores, aided and supported by the American brothers and sisters who shared the very ideals that this country then was fighting for and who welcomed our own men and women at the time, I don't think many ever realized that one day a product of that initiative to support our freedom struggle would one day return and be an engine to propel and to transform the African Continent. <p>This shows the deep partnership that exists between our two countries. This shows that the values we state today, that we share, are not new. These are values that both our nations hold dear. And the truth is, these are values that many of us in our country, Kenya, have chosen to forget. Indeed, it is my wish that today, as we welcome the President of the United States, whose father one day left our shores, and who today returns as President of one of the greatest nations in this world, that we too may learn that greatness is also amongst us if we could just come together, forget our narrow differences, and look towards the future with hope and build on the potential, especially of our young people. <p>And as I was telling the President earlier, and it still remains my strong belief, as many have said, you know, President Obama has not done enough for Africa&mdash;I tend to disagree with that statement. Because \\"enough\\" is not about how much money you put on the table. That's not the issue. Africa no longer wants to hold out its hand, begging bowl in place, how much are you going to put. <p>What President Barack Obama has given back to us is a belief and a hope that, empowered, we can do and achieve for ourselves. He has given us the tools and the belief that it is possible, through our own initiative and hard work, that we can take control of our own destiny, and that we can lead change not just on our continent, but in the world. <p>I don't think there could be a bigger gift. And indeed, as I say that we shall sadly see you depart tomorrow, we wish you safe travels. We look forward to having you back at some stage in the near future. [<i>Laughter</i>] And please, on behalf of the people of this republic, may you convey our warmest regards to your wife, Michelle, to Malia and Sasha, and to say that Kenyans are also looking forward to welcoming them to our shores sometime in the very near future. <p>And with those very few and brief remarks&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;indeed, it is now my pleasure and my honor to ask you all to be up standing and to raise a toast to the President of the United States of America, to the friendship and partnership between our two countries and peoples, now and always. <p>To the President. <p>[<i>At this point, President Kenyatta offered a toast.</i>] <p><i>President Obama. </i>Thank you so much. <i>Habari ya jioni.</i> [<i>Laughter</i>] President Kenyatta, the lovely Madame First Lady, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: I want to once again <p>just express my deepest gratitude to you and the Kenyan people for the incredible hospitality you have shown to me and my delegation, including the Members of Congress who are here today and are doing outstanding work. In my visits here as a younger man, I could have never imagined the outpouring of friendship that I feel today. And so I feel, like my given African name, to be truly blessed. <p>The presence of the Members of Congress who are here today, I think it describes and expresses the deep support for a strong partnership with Africa and with Kenya. We were able to get the AGOA bill passed. And those of you who know American politics, there aren't too many things where Republicans and Democrats agree these days. [<i>Laughter</i>] But expanding trade and investment and deepening our relationship with Africa is something that garnered bipartisan support. And it's an indication of how the American people feel. <p>It's a&mdash;part of what makes this a special evening for me is the presence of my family members who are here. My grandmother, Mama Sarah, who told me I had to come back to Kenya. And when she says you should do something, generally, you have to do it. [<i>Laughter</i>] I've told this story before&mdash;the first time that I visited Kogelo, we&mdash;Auma and I and my brothers were there. She&mdash;Mama Sarah speaks Swahili and Luo, and I speak neither&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and so Auma was serving as a translator. And I think about a half a day had passed before suddenly, she turns to Auma and says something. And Auma starts laughing, and I say, what did she say? She says, he goes to Harvard; if he's so smart, how come he can't talk to his grandmother? [<i>Laughter</i>] Which was a good point. <p>My siblings are here, aunts, uncles. And so tonight I welcome all of them to a somewhat unusual Obama family reunion. I suspect that some of my critics back home are suggesting that I'm back here to look for my birth certificate. [<i>Laughter</i>] That is not the case. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But what is true is, is that obviously there are emotions to a visit like this. Memories come rushing back. When I was in college, and my father was here, I wrote him a letter telling him of my hope to visit. And he wrote me back, and he said, \\"Dear Son, even if it is only for a few days, the important thing is that you know your people.\\" Now, he died in an accident before I was able to make that trip. But in fact, when I came, I did get to know them, the people of Kenya. And although, once again, I'm here only for a few days, I remain grateful for that relationship. <p>I've seen the resolve and the determination to pull together, under a new Constitution, as one people. I've seen your dynamism, as you've built the largest economy in East Africa. And I've seen the resilience, as in the recent reopening of the Westgate Mall, which shows that the spirit of the Kenyan people cannot be broken. <p>And I've seen it in the friendship between our peoples, particularly our young people. As many of you know, our Mandela Fellows program invites promising African youth to the United States so they can develop skills and training, and forge relationships as future leaders here in Africa. And we learn from them, as well. And it's one of the most important ways that we invest in Africa's future. It's something I'm very passionate about personally. <p>In fact, at this very moment, as part of this program, there are 40 young Kenyans across the United States living and working and learning, but also sharing Kenyan culture with their American hosts. Americans are learning Swahili. They're eating chapatti&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and they're listening to Kenyan music. In California, they've been dancing to \\"Sura Yako.\\" <p>So here tonight, and across the United States, Kenyans and Americans are coming together. We're understanding each other better. We're finding new ways to partner. And I believe that if we can build on what we've accomplished on this visit, then we can achieve even more in the years to come: for our people, for our beautiful lands, for our freedom, for peace. <p>I was reflecting on what President Kenyatta said about the past and history. And our fathers were people who lived at the same time and went through independence of this country at the same time, took different paths obviously&mdash;my father was significantly younger&mdash;and it's true that it would have been hard for them to imagine how their sons might be sitting here today. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But there's an expression that says we plant a tree not because we will enjoy its shade, but because our children and grandchildren will. <p>And so I'd like to propose a toast not only to this generation of Kenyans and Africans, not only to future generations of Kenyans and Africans and Americans, but also to our forefathers and our foremothers who laid the groundwork, who planted the seed so that we could enjoy a little bit of shade. <p>To the people of Kenya and to the people of the United States of America, <i>munga abariki Kenya.</i> <p>[<i>President Obama offered a toast.</i>]\" "
"172" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hey! <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hey! <p><i>The President.</i> <i>Habari zenu! </i><p><i>Audience members. Habari zenu! </i><p><i>The President. Wa kenya mpo?</i> It is great to be back in Kenya. Thank you so much for this extraordinary welcome. I know it took a few years, but as President I try to keep my promises, and I said I was going to come, and I'm here. So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>And, everybody, go ahead and have a seat. I'm going to be talking for a while. [<i>Laughter</i>] Relax. <p>I want to thank my sister Auma for a wonderful introduction. I'm so glad that she could be with us here today. And it was&mdash;as she said, it was Auma who first guided me through Kenya almost 30 years ago. <p>To President Kenyatta, I want to thank you once again for the hospitality that you've shown to me and for our work together on this visit, and for being here today. It's a great honor. <p>I am proud to be the first American President to come to Kenya, and of course, I'm the first Kenyan American to be President of the United States. [<i>Laughter</i>] That goes without saying. <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you, Obama! <p><i>President Obama.</i> I love you back. I do. <p>But as Auma was saying, the first time I came to Kenya, things were a little different. When I arrived at Kenyatta Airport, the airline had lost my bags. [<i>Laughter</i>] That doesn't happen on Air Force One. [<i>Laughter</i>] They always have my luggage on Air Force One. [<i>Laughter</i>] As she said, Auma picked me up in an old Volkswagon Beetle, and I think the entire stay I was here, it broke down four or five times. [<i>Laughter</i>] We'd be on the highway; we'd have to call the <i>jua kali</i>. He'd bring his tools. We'd be sitting there, waiting. And I slept on a cot in her apartment. Instead of eating at fancy banquets with the President, we were drinking tea and eating <i>ugali</i>&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and <i>sukuma wiki</i> and&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>So there wasn't a lot of luxury. Sometimes, the lights would go out. <p><i>Audience member. </i>[<i>Inaudible</i>]. <p><i>President Obama.</i> They still do&mdash;is that what someone said? [<i>Laughter</i>] But there was something more important than luxury on that first trip, and that was a sense of being recognized, being seen. I was a young man, and I was just a few years out of university. I had worked as a community organizer in low-income neighborhoods in Chicago. I was about to go to law school. And when I came here, in many ways I was a Westerner, I was an American, unfamiliar with my father and his birthplace, really disconnected from half of my heritage. And at that airport, as I was trying to find my luggage, there was a woman there who worked for the airlines, and she was helping fill out the forms, and she saw my name and she looked up, and she asked if I was related to my father, who she had known. And that was the first time that my name meant something.<i> </i>All right? And that it was recognized. <p>And over the course of several weeks, I'd meet my brothers and aunts and uncles. I traveled to Alego, the village where my family was from. I saw the graves of my father and my grandfather. And I learned things about their lives that I could have never learned through books. And in many ways, their lives offered snapshots of Kenya's history, but they also told us something about the future. <p>My grandfather, for example, he was a cook for the British. And I&mdash;as I went through some of his belongings when I went up country, I found the passbook he had had to carry as a domestic servant. It listed his age and his height, his tribe, listed the number of teeth he had missing. [<i>Laughter</i>] And he was referred to as a boy, even though he was a grown man, in that passbook. <p>And he was in the King's African Rifles during the Second World War and was taken to the far reaches of the British Empire, all the way to Burma. And back home after the war, he was eventually detained for a time because he was linked to a group that opposed British rule. And eventually, he was released. He forged a home for himself and his family. He earned the respect of his village, lived a life of dignity, although he had a well-earned reputation for being so strict that everybody was scared of him and he became estranged from part of his family. <p>So that was his story. And then, my father came of age as Kenyans were pursuing independence, and he was proud to be a part of that liberation generation. And next to my grandfather's papers, I found letters that he had written to 30 American universities asking for a chance to pursue his dream and get a scholarship. And ultimately, one university gave him that chance, the University of Hawaii. And he would go on to get an education and then return home. <p>And here, at first, he found success as an economist and worked with the Government. But ultimately, he found disappointment, in part because he couldn't reconcile the ideas that he had for his young country with the hard realities that had confronted him. <p>And I think sometimes about what these stories tell us, what the history and the past tell us about the future. And they show the enormous barriers to progress that so many Kenyans faced just one or two generations ago. This is a young country. We were talking last night at dinner; the President's father was the first President. We're only a generation removed. And the daily limitations, and sometimes humiliations, of colonialism, that's recent history. The corruption and cronyism and tribalism that sometimes confront young nations, that's recent history. <p>But what these stories also tell us is an arc of progress: from foreign rule to independence, from isolation to education and engagement with a wider world. It speaks of incredible progress. So we have to know the history of Kenya, just as we Americans have to know our American history. All people have to understand where they come from. But we all&mdash;also have to remember why these lessons are important. <p>We know our history so that we can learn from it. We learn our history because we understand the sacrifices that were made before so that when we make sacrifices we understand we're doing it on behalf of future generations. There's a proverb that says, \\"We have not inherited this land from our forebears, we have borrowed it from our children.\\" In other words, we study the past so it can guide us into the future and inspire us to do better. <p>And when it comes to the people of Kenya, particularly the youth, I believe there is no limit to what you can achieve. A young, ambitious Kenyan today should not have to do what my grandfather did and serve a foreign master. You don't need to do what my father did and leave your home in order to get a good education and access to opportunity. Because of Kenya's progress, because of your potential, you can build your future right here, right now. <p>Now, like any country, Kenya is far from perfect, but it has come so far in just my lifetime. After a bitter struggle, Kenyans claimed their independence just a few years after I was born. And after decades of one-party rule, Kenya embraced a multiparty system in the 1990s, just as I was beginning my own political career in the United States. <p>Tragically, just under a decade ago, Kenya was nearly torn apart by violence at the same time that I was running for my first campaign for President. And I remember hearing the reports of thousands of innocent people being killed or driven from their homes. And from a distance, it seemed like the Kenya that I knew&mdash;a Kenya that was able to reach beyond ethnic and tribal lines&mdash;that it might split apart across those lines of tribe and ethnicity. <p>But look what happened. The people of Kenya chose not to be defined by the hatreds of the past. You chose a better history. The voices of ordinary people and political leaders and civil society did not eliminate all these divisions, but you addressed the divisions and differences peacefully. And a new Constitution was put in place, declaring that \\"every person has inherent dignity and the right to have that dignity respected and protected.\\" A competitive election went forward, not without problems, but without the violence that so many had feared. In other words, Kenyans chose to stay together. You chose the path of <i>harambee.</i> <p>And in part because of this political stability, Kenya's economy is also emerging, and the entrepreneurial spirit that people rely on to survive in the streets of Kibera can now be seen in new businesses across the country, from the city square to the smallest villages. M-Pesa is changing the way people use money. New investment is making Kenya a hub for regional trade. When I came here as a U.S. Senator, I pointed out that South Korea's economy was the same as Kenya's when I was and then was 40 times larger than Kenya's. Think about that. It started at the same place; South Korea had gone here, and Kenya was here. But today, that gap has been cut in half just in the last decade, which means Kenya is making progress. <p>And meanwhile, Kenya continues to carve out a distinct place in the community of nations: as a source of peacekeepers for places torn apart by conflict; a host for refugees driven from their homes; a leader for conservation, following the footprints of Wangari Maathai. Kenya is one of the places on this continent that truly observes freedom of the press, and there are fearless journalists and courageous civil society members. And in the United States, we see the legacy of Kip Keino every time a Kenyan wins one of our marathons. And maybe the First Lady of Kenya is going to win one soon. [<i>Laughter</i>] I told the President he has to start running with his wife. [<i>Laughter</i>] We want him to stay fit. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So there's much to be proud of, much progress to lift up. It's a good-news story. But we also know the progress is not complete. There are still problems that shadow ordinary Kenyans every day, challenges that can deny you your livelihood and sometimes deny you lives. <p>As in America and so many countries around the globe, economic growth has not always been broadly shared. Sometimes, people at the top do very well, but ordinary people still struggle. Today, a young child in Nyanza Province is four times more likely to die than a child in Central Province, even though they are equal in dignity in the eyes of God. That's a gap that has to be closed. A girl in Rift Valley is far less likely to attend secondary school than a girl in Nairobi. That's a gap that has to be closed. Across the country, one study shows corruption costs Kenyans 250,000 jobs every year, because every shilling that's paid as a bribe could be put into the pocket of somebody who's actually doing an honest day's work. <p>And despite the hard-earned political progress that I spoke of, that&mdash;those political gains still have to be protected. New laws and restrictions could close off the space where civil society gives individual citizens a voice and holds leaders accountable. Old tribal divisions and ethnic divisions can still be stirred up. I want to be very clear here: A politics that's based solely on tribe and ethnicity is a politics that's doomed to tear a country apart. It is a failure, a failure of imagination. <p>Of course, here in Kenya, we also know the specter of terrorism has touched far too many lives. And we remember the Americans and Kenyans who died side by side in the attack on our Embassy in the nineties. We remember the innocent Kenyans who were taken from us at Westgate Mall. We weep for the nearly 150 people slaughtered at Garissa, including so many students who had such a bright future before them. We honor the memory of so many other innocent Kenyans whose lives have been lost in this struggle. <p>So Kenya is at a crossroads, a moment filled with peril, but also enormous promise. And with the rest of my time here today, I'd like to talk about how you can seize the moment, how you can make sure we leave behind a world that's better, a world that we've borrowed from our children. <p>When I first came to sub-Saharan Africa as President, I made clear my strong belief that the future of Africa is up to Africans. For too long, I think that many looked to the outside for salvation and focused on somebody else being at fault for the problems of the continent. And as my sister said, ultimately, we are each responsible for our own destiny. And I'm here as President of a country that sees Kenya as an important partner. I'm here as a friend who wants Kenya to succeed. <p>And the pillars of that success are clear: strong democratic governance, development that provides opportunity for all people and not just some, a sense of national identity that rejects conflict for a future of peace and reconciliation. <p>And today, we can see that future for Kenya on the horizon. But tough choices are going to have to be made in order to arrive at that destination. In the United States, I always say that what makes America exceptional is not the fact that we're perfect, it's the fact that we struggle to improve. We're self-critical. We work to live up to our highest values and ideals, knowing that we're not always going to achieve them perfectly, but we keep on trying to perfect our Union. <p>And what's true for America is also true for Kenya. You can't be complacent and accept the world just as it is. You have to imagine what the world might be and then push and work towards that future. Progress requires that you honestly confront the dark corners of our own past, extend rights and opportunities to more of your citizens, see the differences and diversity of this country as a strength, just as we in America try to see the diversity of our country as a strength and not a weakness. So you can choose the path to progress, but it requires making some important choices. First and foremost, it means continuing down the path of a strong, more inclusive, more accountable and transparent democracy. <p>Democracy begins with a peacefully elected government. It begins with elections, but it doesn't stop with elections. So your Constitution offers a roadmap to governance that's more responsive to the people, through protections against unchecked power, more power in the hands of local communities. For this system to succeed, there also has to be space for citizens to exercise their rights. <p>And we saw the strength of Kenya's civil society in the last election, when groups collected reports of incitement so that violence could be stopped before it spun out of control. And the ability of citizens to organize and advocate for change, that's the oxygen upon which democracy depends. Democracy is sometimes messy, and for leaders, sometimes, it's frustrating. Democracy means that somebody is always complaining about something. [<i>Laughter</i>] Nobody is ever happy in a democracy about their government. If you make one person happy, somebody else is unhappy. Then, sometimes, somebody who you made happy, later on, now they're not happy. [<i>Laughter</i>] They say, what have you done for me lately? [<i>Laughter</i>] But that's the nature of democracy. That's why it works, is because it's constantly challenging leaders to up their game and to do better. <p>And such civic participation and freedom is also essential for rooting out the cancer of corruption. Now, I want to be clear. Corruption is not unique to Kenya. [<i>Laughter</i>] There&mdash;I mean, I want everybody to understand that there's no country that's completely free of corruption. Certainly, here in the African Continent, there are many countries that deal with this problem. And I want to assure you, I speak about it wherever I go, not just here in Kenya. So I don't want everybody to get too sensitive. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But the fact is, too often, here in Kenya, as is true in other places, corruption is tolerated because that's how things have always been done. People just think that that is sort of the normal state of affairs. And there was a time in the United States where that was true too. My hometown of Chicago was infamous for Al Capone and the mob and organized crime corrupting law enforcement. But what happened was that over time, people got fed up, and leaders stood up and they said, we're not going to play that game anymore. And you changed a culture, and you changed habits. <p>Here in Kenya, it's time to change habits and decisively break that cycle. Because corruption holds back every aspect of economic and civil life. It's an anchor that weighs you down and prevents you from achieving what you could. If you need to pay a bribe and hire somebody's brother&mdash;who's not very good and doesn't come to work&mdash;in order to start a business, well, that's going to create less jobs for everybody. If electricity is going to one neighborhood because they're well connected and not another neighborhood, that's going to limit development of the country as a whole. If someone in public office is taking a cut that they don't deserve, that's taking away from those who are paying their fair share. <p>So this is not just about changing one law, although, it's important to have laws on the books that are actually being enforced. It's important that not only low-level corruption is punished, but folks at the top, if they are taking from the people, that has to be addressed as well. But it's not something that is just fixed by laws or that any one person can fix. It requires a commitment by the entire nation&mdash;leaders and citizens&mdash;to change habits and to change culture. <p>Tough laws need to be on the books. And the good news is, your Government is taking some important steps in the right direction. People who break the law and violate the public trust need to be prosecuted. NGOs have to be allowed to operate who shine a spotlight on what needs to change. And ordinary people have to stand up and say, \\"Enough is enough, it's time for a better future.\\" And as you take these steps, I promise that America will continue to be your partner in supporting investments in strong, democratic institutions. <p>Now, we're also going to work with you to pursue the second pillar of progress, and that is development that extends economic opportunity and dignity for all of Kenya's people. <p>America partners with Kenya in areas where you're making enormous progress, and we focus on what Kenyans can do for themselves and building capacity: on entrepreneurship, where Kenya is becoming an engine for innovation; on access to power, where Kenya is developing clean energy that can reach more people; on the important issue of climate change, where Kenya's recent goal to reduce its emissions has put it in the position of being a leader on the continent; on food security, where Kenyan crops are producing more to meet the demands of your people and a global market; and on health, where Kenya has struck huge blows against HIV/AIDS and other diseases, while building up the capacity to provide better care in your communities. <p>America is also partnering with you on an issue that's fundamental to Kenya's future: We are investing in youth. We are investing in the young people of Kenya and the young people of this continent. Robert F. Kennedy once said, \\"It is a revolutionary world that we live in,\\" and \\"it is the young people who must take the lead.\\" It's the young people who must take the lead. <p>So through our Young African Leaders Initiative, we are empowering and connecting young people from across the continent who are filled with energy and optimism and idealism and are going to take Africa to new heights. And these young people, they're not weighed down by the old ways. They're creating a new path. And these are the elements for success in this 21st century. <p>To continue down this path of progress, it will be vital for Kenya to recognize that no country can achieve its full potential unless it draws on the talents of all its people, and that must include the half of Kenyans&mdash;maybe a little more than half&mdash;who are women and girls. Now, I'm going to spend a little time on this just for a second. Every country and every culture has traditions that are unique and help make that country what it is. But just because something is a part of your past doesn't make it right. It doesn't mean that it defines your future. <p>Look at us in the United States. Recently, we've been having a debate about the Confederate flag. Some of you may be familiar with this. This was a symbol for those States who fought against the Union to preserve slavery. Now, as a piece of&mdash;as a historical artifact, it's important. But some have argued that it's just a symbol of heritage that should fly in public spaces. The fact is, it was a flag that flew over an army that fought to maintain a system of slavery and racial subjugation. So we should understand our history, but we should also recognize that it sends a bad message to those who were liberated from slavery and oppression. <p>And in part because of an unspeakable tragedy that took place recently, where a young man who was a fan of the Confederate flag and racial superiority shot helpless people in a church, more and more Americans of all races are realizing now that that flag should come down. Just because something is a tradition doesn't make it right. Well, so around the world, there is a tradition of repressing women and treating them differently and not giving them the same opportunities and husbands beating their wives and children not being sent to school. Those are traditions. Treating women and girls as second-class citizens, those are bad traditions. They need to change. They're holding you back. <p>Treating women as second-class citizens is a bad tradition. It holds you back. There's no excuse for sexual assault or domestic violence. There's no reason that young girls should suffer genital mutilation. There's no place in civilized society for the early or forced marriage of children. These traditions may date back centuries; they have no place in the 21st century. <p>These are issues of right and wrong in any culture. But they're also issues of success and failure. Any nation that fails to educate its girls or employ its women and allowing them to maximize their potential is doomed to fall behind in a global economy. <p>You know, we're in a sports center. Imagine if you have a team and you don't let half of the team play. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's stupid. [<i>Laughter</i>] That makes no sense. And the evidence shows that communities that give their daughters the same opportunities as their sons, they are more peaceful, they are more prosperous, they develop faster, they are more likely to succeed. That's true in America. That's true here in Kenya. It doesn't matter. <p>And that's why one of the most successful development policies you can pursue is giving girls an education and removing the obstacles that stand between them and their dreams. And by the way, if you educate girls, they grow up to be moms, and they, because they're educated, are more likely to produce educated children. So Kenya will not succeed if it treats women and girls as second-class citizens. I want to be very clear about that. <p>Now, this leads me to the third pillar of progress, and that's choosing a future of peace and reconciliation. Now, there are real threats out there. President Kenyatta and I spent a lot of time discussing the serious threat from al-Shabaab that Kenya faces. The United States faces similar threats of terrorism. We are grateful for the sacrifices made by Kenyans on the front lines as part of AMISOM. We're proud of the efforts that we're making to strengthen Kenya's capabilities through our new Security Governance Initiative. We're going to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with you in this fight against terrorism for as long as it takes. <p>But, as I mentioned yesterday, it is important to remember that violent extremists want us to turn against one another. That's what terrorists typically try to exploit. They know that they are a small minority; they know that they can't win conventionally. So what they try to do is target societies where they can exploit divisions. That's what happens in Iraq. That's what happens around the world. That's what happened in Northern Ireland. Terrorists who try to sow chaos, they must be met with force, and they must also be met, though, with a forceful commitment to uphold the rule of law and respect for human rights and to treat everybody who's peaceful and law-abiding fairly and equally. <p>Extremists who prey on distrust must be defeated by communities who stand together and stand for something different. And I'll&mdash;the most important example here is, is that the United States and Kenya both have Muslim minorities, but those minorities make enormous contributions to our countries. These are our brothers; they are our sisters. And so in both our countries, we have to reject calls that allow us to be divided. <p>This is true for any diverse society. And Kenya is rich with diversity, with many dozens of tribes and ethnicities and languages and religious groups. And time and again, just as we've seen the dangers of religious or ethnic violence, we've seen that Kenya is stronger when Kenyans stand united, with a sense of national identity. That was the case on December 12, 1963, when cities and villages across this country celebrated the birth of a nation. It was true in 2010, when Kenya replaced the anarchy of ethnic violence with the order of a new Constitution. <p>So we can all appreciate our own identities, our bloodlines, our beliefs, our backgrounds. That is&mdash;that tapestry is what makes us who we are. But the history of Africa, which is both the cradle of human progress and a crucible of conflict, shows us that when define ourselves narrowly, in opposition to somebody just because they're of a different tribe or race or religion, and we ignore who is a good person or a bad person, are they working hard or not, are they honest or not, are they peaceful or violent&mdash;when we start making distinctions solely based on status and not what people do, then we're taking a wrong path, and we inevitably suffer in the end. <p>This is why Martin Luther King called on people to be judged not by the color of their skin, but the content of their character. And in the same way, people should not be judged by their last name or their religious faith, but by their content of their character and how they behave. Are they good citizens? Are they good people? <p>In the United States, we embrace the motto: \\"E pluribus unum\\"&mdash;in Latin, that means, out of many, one. In Kenya, <i>harambee</i>&mdash;we are in this together. Whatever the challenge, you will be stronger if you face it not as Christians or Muslims, Masai, Kikuyu, Luo, any other tribe, but as Kenyans. And ultimately, that unity is the source of strength that will empower you to seize this moment of promise. That's what will help you root out corruption. That's what will strengthen democratic institutions. That's what will help you combat inequality. That's what will help you extend opportunity and educate youth and face down threats and embrace reconciliation. <p>So I want to say particularly to the young people here today, Kenya is on the move. Africa is on the move. You are poised to play a bigger role in this world, as the shadows of the past are replaced by the light that you offer an increasingly interconnected world. And in the light of this new day, we have to learn to see ourselves in one another. We have to see that we are connected, our fates are bound together. Because, in the end, we're all part of one tribe: the human tribe. And no matter who we are or where we come from or what we look like or who we love or what God we worship, we're connected. Our fates are bound up with one another. <p>Kenya holds within it all that diversity. And with diversity, sometimes comes difficulty. But I look to Kenya's future filled with hope. And I'm hopeful because of you, the people of Kenya, especially the young people. <p>There are some amazing examples of what's going on right now with young people. I'm hopeful because of a young man named Richard Ruto Todosia. Richard helped build Yes Youth Can. I liked the phrase, Yes Youth Can. It became one of the most prominent civil society organizations in Kenya, with over one million members. And after the violence of 2007, 2008, Yes Youth Can stood up to incitement, helped bring opportunity to young people in places that were scarred by conflict. That's the kind of young leadership that we need. <p>I'm hopeful because of a young woman named Josephine Kulea. So Josephine founded Samburu Girls Foundation. And she's already helped to rescue over a thousand girls from abuse and forced marriage and helped place them in schools. A member of the Samburu tribe herself, she's personally planned rescue missions to help girls as young as 6 years old. And she explains that \\"the longer a girl is in school, everything for her&mdash;for her income, for her family, for this country&mdash;everything changes.\\" She gives me hope. I'm hopeful because of a young woman named Jamila Abass. So Jamila founded M-Farm, which is a mobile platform that is already used by over 14,000 people across Kenya. M-Farm makes it easy for farmers to get information that lets them match their crops with what the market demands. And studies show that it can help farmers double their sales. So here's what Jamila said: \\"I love Kenya because you feel you are home anywhere you go.\\" <p>Home anywhere you go. That's the Kenya that welcomed me nearly 30 years ago as a young man. You helped make me feel at home. And standing here today as President of the United States, when I think about those young people and all the young people in attendance here, you still make me feel at home. And I'm confident that your future is going to be written across this country and across this continent by young people like you, young men and women who don't have to struggle under a colonial power, who don't have to look overseas to realize your dreams. Yes, you can realize your dreams right here, right now. <p>\\"We have not inherited this land from our forebears, we have borrowed it from our children.\\" So now is the time for us to do the hard work of living up to that inheritance, of building a Kenya where the inherent dignity of every person is respected and protected, and there's no limit to what a child can achieve. <p>I am here to tell you that the United States of America will be a partner for you every step of the way. <p>God bless you. Thank you. <i>Asante sana.</i>\" "
"173" "\"Well, let me just express my appreciation to the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Prime Minister Hailemariam, as well as all the leaders represented here. They have shown extraordinary leadership in trying to address the continuing situation in South Sudan, and this gives me and the U.S. delegation an opportunity to learn from them what progress has been made, where there appear to be continued roadblocks, and how we can partner with them to make progress. <p>So I want to thank IGAD for the outstanding work that they're doing, the African Union for their leadership as well. And as a consequence of this discussion, our hope is, is that we can actually bring about the kind of peace that the people of South Sudan so desperately need. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"174" "\"<i>Prime Minister Hailemariam. </i>Your Excellency, the President of the United States of America, Mr. Barack Obama, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: In the history of the relationship by Ethiopia and the United States of America, this is an exceptional occasion. Never before did we have the opportunity to be able to welcome a sitting President of the United States for an official visit to Ethiopia. <p>And, Mr. President, we welcome you and all the members of your delegation to Ethiopia with open arms. Your visit is a mark of the long friendship between our two countries and our two peoples, a friendship that I am certain will be further enhanced in the future. It shows the strengths and depths of the diplomatic and cultural relations we enjoy today and underlines our hopes for the future. <p>Mr. President, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, our links were formally established at the beginning of the last century when a treaty of commerce was signed during the reign of Emperor Menelik and President Theodore Roosevelt administration in 1903. Since then, and even earlier, the United States provided an inspiration for the advancement of science and technology and, indeed, of democracy and good governance. <p>Ethiopia, similarly, as the only surviving vessel of freedom and independence in Africa, offered an inspiration to many in America. It was a source of an inspiration for a great African American thinker and philosopher, Du Bois, as well as more recently, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. And many saw a source of enlightenment in the spirit of Ethiopia. They saw the courageous struggle of Ethiopia as the symbol of the struggle of the whole community of Africans across the world for civil liberty, equality, and freedom. <p>Ours is a relationship established on the basis of mutual understanding, respect, and dignity and matured in the struggle against fascism. The role of the United States to the struggle can only be described as historic. People all over the country protested against Italy's invasion of Ethiopia. You raised funds and sent medical supplies. People in New York, Harlem, Oklahoma, Texas, and many other cities paraded in support of Ethiopia. Thousands offered to enlist to fight for us. And even after the war, many more came to Ethiopia to help in our post-war reconstruction. <p>It is perhaps appropriate to single out one person, as I feel this is an appropriate moment to mention one African American hero who grew up in Mississippi during the early 1920s and came to Ethiopia in 1935 to help us in our struggle against fascism and colonial aggression. Colonel John Robinson was, I believe, one of the first Americans to take up arms against fascism. Having earlier established an aviation school in Alabama, Colonel Robinson was largely responsible for founding the Ethiopian Air Force during the Italian invasion. Called here the Brown Condor of Ethiopia, he then became the first commander of the Air Force. <p>He was a wonderful example of those Americans who did so actively support Ethiopia both in time of peace and conflict. And here, let me also mention the exemplary dedication displayed by your youth in the Peace Corps, both in the 1960s, all over the way through today. In this context, let me also remember all those Americans who have given their lives to Ethiopia, not least the late Congressman Mickey Leland who worked so hard to build the relationship between our two countries on the basis of dignity, faith and hope. He would have very much appreciated this visit as a symbol of the friendship that has been built up over the years and which he did so much to encourage. <p>We, and indeed other Africans, who owe very real gratitude to your administration and the Members of Congress for the recent renewal of the African Growth and Opportunity Act for another decade. And this bipartisan action by Congress was an impressive example of the way the United States is prepared to assist in the development and growth in Africa. I cannot speak too highly of those Congress women and men who were so active and for so many years in support of this cause. I believe I can see a number of you here today. May I offer my very sincere thanks for your determined efforts. You showed a very real example of the understanding that the people of America have for the problems of Africa. <p>Your effort also provides another clear demonstration of the way we can and do work together, closely and harmoniously, for joint development of our people. <p>Mr. President, Excellencies, today we are celebrating a longstanding, time-tested, and exceptional relationship. I believe I can speak for us all when I say that this closeness could now be expressed at a new level of contact and development. The United States, of course, continues to play major role in global efforts for peace and development. <p>There are the central issues for us as well, and I believe I can say that we have similar views on major regional and global issues. We have been cooperating closely at the United Nations, in the African Union, and in our regional organization, IGAD. We greatly appreciate this support we have received and continue to receive from the United States for the resolution of conflict and peace-building and stability in our region. We are most grateful for your steadfast support to our collective efforts in the fight against violent extremism and terrorism. <p>Mr. President, with all this in mind, we in Ethiopia would like to infuse a new level of commitment into our relationship with the United States. We have built a firm relationship on the basis of mutual trust and respect, and now we'd like to extend this and raise our links to a new level, to explore further opportunities for development and build a wider network of activity that can strengthen our bilateral relationship. It is something from which I believe we can both benefit. <p>Mr. President, you have here a very trusted friend, a country and people that highly appreciate what the United States stands for. Now, in the spirit of the friendship, I would therefore like to propose a toast to the bright future that awaits the people of our two countries and to the good health and happiness of Your Excellency. <p>Distinguished guests, may I ask you to stand and join me in a toast to the President of the United States of America and to all the people of the great nation. Long live Ethiopia-U.S friendship. Cheers. <p>[<i>At this point, Prime Minister Hailemariam offered a toast.</i>] <p><i>President Obama.</i> Thank you so much. Good evening, everybody. I would greet you in all the languages of Ethiopia, but I'm told that there are more than 80. [<i>Laughter</i>] So that would keep us here all night. [<i>Laughter</i>] So let me just say <i>indemin walachu</i>. <p>Prime Minister Hailemariam and distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: It is a great honor for me to be here tonight as the first sitting United States President to visit Ethiopia. And I want to thank the great people of Ethiopia, including Teddy Mak&mdash;he's the one who sang that catchy song upon my welcome. I want to thank all of you for the wonderful reception we've received. <p>You know Ethiopians are an ancient people in an ancient land. We honor Ethiopia as the birthplace of humankind. In fact, I just met Lucy, our oldest ancestor. [<i>Laughter</i>] As your great poet laureate wrote, \\"Here is the land where the first harmony in the rainbow was born. . . . Here is the root of the Genesis of Life; the human family was first planted here.\\" <p>When you see our ancestor, 3.5 million years old, we are reminded that Ethiopians, Americans, all the people of the world are part of the same human family, the same chain. And as one of the professors who was describing the artifacts correctly pointed out, so much of the hardship and conflict and sadness and violence that occurs around the world is because we forget that fact. We look at superficial differences as opposed to seeing the fundamental connection that we all share. <p>And for more than a century, our two nations have enjoyed a harmony that enriched us both. We've worked together to lift up the fortunes of those most in need. Tonight we also remember former Prime Minister Meles and his dedication to reducing poverty. Together, we've sheltered and cared for refugees fleeing conflict. We've sought to secure our shared future against those who would threaten us. <p>Of course, of the many contributions Ethiopia has made to the world over the centuries, I'm certain that Americans want to thank you for one in particular, discovering something that sustains people around the world, day and night, and many people in the White House, and that is coffee. [<i>Laughter</i>] Thank you, Ethiopia. We are large consumers of coffee in the White House. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And Ethiopia has ignited the imagination of Americans for generations. Before African Americans won their civil rights, many of them were inspired by this country&mdash;a nation that never suffered the indignities of colonialism, people who defended their freedom and their right in self-determination. You already mentioned, Mr. Prime Minister, Colonel John Robinson, an American who was one of the fathers of the Tuskegee Airmen, he was nicknamed the Brown Condor, who then came to Ethiopia and trained Ethiopian pilots to tame their heavens and, as you indicated, helped to set up the Ethiopian Air Force. You sparked the passion of American poets like Paul Laurence Dunbar and Langston Hughes, who saw in Ethiopia a dignity to be celebrated and emulated. <p>Ethiopia kindled a commitment to service for generations of young Americans who volunteered for the Peace Corps and who have for decades worked alongside the people of this proud land. For my part, I was impressed by the courage of the Ethiopian journalist that I welcomed to the White House earlier this year, moved by her determination to champion a robust free press, and I very much appreciated the comments you made at the press conference today about the evolution that's taking place to deepen democracy here. <p>So the deep connections between our peoples is built on the values that we share. We saw that so clearly 2 years ago when the Boston Marathon suffered that horrendous terrorist bombing. And in a gesture of great solidarity and compassion, the runner who won the race, an Ethiopian, returned his medal to honor the victims of the attack. And at this year's Marathon, Americans cheered all the harder when he once again crossed the finish line first with an even faster time. And that, I think, is the hallmark of the American and Ethiopian bond. We don't give in or give up when things get hard, but we come back better and we come back stronger. So there's no doubt that Ethiopians and Americans are sprung from the same root of life&mdash;we have evidence of that. Tonight I'd like to offer a toast: To another century of friendship, to our one human family, and to a bright future for the land where the first harmony of the rainbow was born. <i>Letenachin</i>. For you Americans, that means \\"to our health\\" or \\"cheers.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Thank you very much.\" "
"175" "\"<i>The President</i>. So just really quickly, for the press who is here, one of the signature projects that we've been initiating is something called Feed the Future. And the goal is to drastically increase the productivity of small-holder farmers all throughout Africa. Because what we know is, is that a huge percentage of Africans are still getting their incomes from agriculture and most of them are very small plots and not a lot of technology and not a lot of inputs, but with just a few smart interventions, a little bit of help, they can make huge improvements in their overall yield. <p>So I don't know if everybody was able to hear, but one of our farmers who is part of this program increased her yields threefold. All right? So this used to be corn that she was able to produce; this is the corn she's producing now. With three times the yields, not only did she get enough income to build a new house and get some nice clothes, she also was able to buy a cow, which, in turn, obviously gives her additional resources to support her family. She's now able to send her children to school. <p>And what Feed the Future is doing is not just helping the farmer to increase their yield, now what we're also able to do is to then connect the small farmers to factories like this one so that they have a market and they're able to sell their products for a fair price. In turn, this factory is taking corn, soy, and other foodstuffs and able to package them into nutritious, low-cost meals that are actually then supplemented with vitamins and are enhancing the nutrition of low-income peoples all across Ethiopia. <p>So by some smart interventions, what we're able to do is not only increase the incomes of millions of people all across Africa, but we're also able to create new markets and food processing alongside the product&mdash;the foodstuffs themselves. And that helps grow the economy as a whole. <p>We were talking about how Ethiopia has been seeing significant growth, one of the fastest growing economies in the world; a lot of that is because of outstanding women like this who are out there and they triple their income, that's good for the entire country. <p>[<i>At this point, the President greeted Gifty Jemal Hussein, one of the farmers participating in the Feed the Future program.</i>] <p><i>The President</i>. So it's so nice to meet you. <p>[<i>Ms. Gifty greeted the President, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows</i>.] <p><i>Ms. Gifty</i>. I'm glad that we met as well. <i> </i><p><i>The President</i>. I am glad that we met too. We need a good picture. Pete? <p>[<i>The President posed for a photograph with Ms. Gifty</i>.] <p>Come. We've got to get our translator and the whole team here. All right. <p>[<i>The President posed for a group photograph</i>.] So just to give you a sense, so far about 7 million farmers have been impacted by Feed the Future so far. And we're going to continue to increase that in the years to come, and we've gotten terrific cooperation from governments all across Africa. It's one of the things I'll be talking about at the Africa Union today. <p>Thanks, guys.\" "
"176" "\"Thank you so much. Well, Madam Chairwoman, thank you so much for your kind words and your leadership. To Prime Minister Hailemariam and the people of Ethiopia, once again, thank you for your wonderful hospitality and for hosting this pan-African institution. To members of the African Union, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: Thank you for welcoming me here today. It is a great honor to be the first President of the United States to address the African Union. <p>I'm grateful for this opportunity to speak to the representatives of more than 1 billion people of the great African Continent. We're joined today by citizens, by leaders of civil society, by faith communities, and I'm especially pleased to see so many young people who embody the energy and optimism of today's Africa. Hello! Thank you for being here. <p>I stand before you as a proud American. I also stand before you as the son of an African. Africa and its people helped to shape America and allowed it to become the great nation that it is. And Africa and its people have helped shape who I am and how I see the world. In the villages in Kenya, where my father was born, I learned of my ancestors and the life of my grandfather, the dreams of my father, the bonds of family that connect us all as Africans and Americans. <p>As parents, Michelle and I want to make sure that our two daughters know their heritage, European and African, in all of its strengths and all of its struggle. So we've taken our daughters and stood with them on the shores of West Africa, in those Doors of No Return, mindful that their ancestors were both slaves and slave owners. We've stood with them in that small cell on Robben Island where Madiba showed the world that, no matter the nature of his physical confinement, he alone was the master of his fate. For us, for our children, Africa and its people teach us a powerful lesson: that we must uphold the inherent dignity of every human being. <p>Dignity, that basic idea that by virtue of our common humanity, no matter where we come from or what we look like, we are all born equal, touched by the grace of God. Every person has worth. Every person matters. Every person deserves to be treated with decency and respect. Throughout much of history, mankind did not see this. Dignity was seen as a virtue reserved to those of rank and privilege, kings and elders. It took a revolution of the spirit, over many centuries, to open our eyes to the dignity of every person. And around the world, generations have struggled to put this idea into practice in laws and in institutions. <p>So, too, here in Africa. This is the cradle of humanity, and ancient African kingdoms were home to great libraries and universities. But the evil of slavery took root not only abroad, but here on the continent. Colonialism skewed Africa's economy and robbed people of their capacity to shape their own destiny. Eventually, liberation movements grew. And 50 years ago, in a great burst of self-determination, Africans rejoiced as foreign flags came down and your national flags went up. As South Africa's Albert Luthuli said at the time, \\"the basis for peace and brotherhood in Africa is being restored by the resurrection of national sovereignty and independence, of equality and the dignity of man.\\" A half century into this independence era, it is long past time to put aside old stereotypes of an Africa forever mired in poverty and conflict. The world must recognize Africa's extraordinary progress. Today, Africa is one of the fastest growing regions in the world. Africa's middle class is projected to grow to more than 1 billion consumers. With hundreds of mobile phones&mdash;hundreds of millions of mobile phones, surging access to the Internet, Africans are beginning to leapfrog old technologies into new prosperity. Africa is on the move, a new Africa is emerging. <p>Propelled by this progress and in partnership with the world, Africa has achieved historic gains in health. The rate of new HIV/AIDS infections has plummeted. African mothers are more likely to survive childbirth and have healthy babies. Deaths from malaria have been slashed, saving the lives of millions of African children. Millions have been lifted from extreme poverty. Africa has led the world in sending more children to school. In other words, more and more African men, women, and children are living with dignity and with hope. <p>And Africa's progress can also be seen in the institutions that bring us together today. When I first came to sub-Saharan Africa as a President, I said that Africa doesn't need strongmen, it needs strong institutions. And one of those institutions can be the African Union. Here, you can come together, with a shared commitment to human dignity and development. Here, your 54 nations pursue a common vision of an \\"integrated, prosperous, and peaceful Africa.\\" <p>As Africa changes, I've called on the world to change its approach to Africa. So many Africans have told me, we don't want just aid, we want trade that fuels progress. We don't want patrons, we want partners who help us build our own capacity to grow. We don't want the indignity of dependence, we want to make our own choices and determine our own future. <p>And as President, I've worked to transform America's relationship with Africa so that we're truly listening to our African friends and working together as equal partners. And I'm proud of the progress that we've made. We've boosted American exports to this region, part of trade that supports jobs for Africans and Americans. To sustain our momentum, and with the bipartisan support of some of the outstanding Members of Congress who are here today&mdash;20 of them who are here today&mdash;I recently signed the 10-year renewal of the African Growth and Opportunity Act. And I want to thank them all. Why don't they stand very briefly so you can see them, because they've done outstanding work. <p>We've launched major initiatives to promote food security and public health and access to electricity and to prepare the next generation of African leaders and entrepreneurs, investments that will help fuel Africa's rise for decades to come. Last year, as the Chairwoman noted, I welcomed nearly 50 African Presidents and Prime Ministers to Washington so we could begin a new chapter of cooperation. And by coming to the African Union today, I'm looking to build on that commitment. <p>I believe Africa's rise is not just important for Africa, it's important to the entire world. We will not be able to meet the challenges of our time&mdash;from ensuring a strong global economy to facing down violent extremism, to combating climate change, to ending hunger and extreme poverty&mdash;without the voices and contributions of one billion Africans. <p>Now, even with Africa's impressive progress, we must acknowledge that many of these gains rest on a fragile foundation. Alongside new wealth, hundreds of millions of Africans still endure extreme poverty. Alongside high-tech hubs of innovation, many Africans are crowded into shantytowns without power or running water, a level of poverty that's an assault on human dignity. <p>Moreover, as the youngest and fastest growing continent, Africa's population in the coming decades will double to some 2 billion people, and many of them will be young, under 18. Now, on the one hand, this could bring tremendous opportunities as these young Africans harness new technologies and ignite new growth and reforms. Economists will tell you that countries, regions, continents grow faster with younger populations. It's a demographic edge, an advantage, but only if those young people are being trained. We need only to look at the Middle East and North Africa to see that large numbers of young people with no jobs and stifled voices can fuel instability and disorder. <p>I suggest to you that the most urgent task facing Africa today and for decades ahead is to create opportunity for this next generation. And this will be an enormous undertaking. Africa will need to generate millions more jobs than it's doing right now. And time is of the essence. The choices made today will shape the trajectory of Africa and, therefore, the world for decades to come. And as your partner and your friend, allow me to suggest several ways that we can meet this challenge together. <p>Africa's progress will depend on unleashing economic growth, not just for the few at the top, but for the many, because an essential element of dignity is being able to live a decent life. That begins with a job. And that requires trade and investment. <p>Many of your nations have made important reforms to attract investment. It's been a spark for growth. But in many places across Africa, it's still too hard to start a venture, still too hard to build a business. Governments that take additional reforms to make doing business easier will have an eager partner in the United States. <p>And that includes reforms to help Africa trade more with itself, as the Chairwoman and I discussed before we came out here today, because the biggest markets for your goods are often right next door. You don't have to just look overseas for growth, you can look internally. And our work to help Africa modernize customs and border crossings started with the East African Community. Now we're expanding our efforts across the continent, because it shouldn't be harder for African countries to trade with each other than it is for you to trade with Europe and America. <p>Now, most U.S. trade with the region is with just three countries&mdash;South Africa, Nigeria, and Angola&mdash;and much of that is in the form of energy. I want Africans and Americans doing more business together in more sectors, in more countries. So we're increasing trade missions to places like Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mozambique. We're working to help more Africans get their goods to market. Next year, we'll host another U.S.-Africa Business Forum to mobilize billions of dollars in new trade and investment so we're buying more of each other's products and all growing together. <p>Now, the United States isn't the only country that sees your growth as an opportunity. And that is a good thing. When more countries invest responsibly in Africa, it creates more jobs and prosperity for us all. So I want to encourage everybody to do business with Africa, and African countries should want to do business with every country. But economic relationships can't simply be about building countries' infrastructure with foreign labor or extracting Africa's natural resources. Real economic partnerships have to be a good deal for Africa; they have to create jobs and capacity for Africans. And that includes the point that Chairwoman Zuma made about illicit flows with multinationals, which is one of the reasons that we've been a leading advocate, working with the G-7, to assist in making sure that there's honest accounting when businesses are investing here in the United&mdash;here in Africa and making sure that capital flows are properly accounted for. That's the kind of partnership America offers. <p>Nothing will unlock Africa's economic potential more than ending the cancer of corruption. And you are right that it is not just a problem of Africa, it is a problem of those who do business with Africa. It is not unique to Africa; corruption exists all over the world, including in the United States. But here in Africa, corruption drains billions of dollars from economies that can't afford to lose billions of dollars. That's money that could be used to create jobs and build hospitals and schools. And when someone has to pay a bribe just to start a business or go to school or get an official to do the job they're supposed to be doing anyway, that's not \\"the African way,\\" it undermines the dignity of the people you represent. <p>Only Africans can end corruption in their countries. As African governments commit to take action, the United States will work with you to combat illicit financing and promote good governance and transparency and rule of law. And we already have strong laws in place that say to U.S. companies, \\"You can't engage in bribery to try to get business,\\" which not all countries have. And we actually enforce it and police it. <p>And let me add that criminal networks are both fueling corruption and threatening Africa's precious wildlife and, with it, the tourism that many African economies count on. So America also stands with you in the fight against wildlife trafficking. That's something that has to be addressed. <p>But ultimately, the most powerful antidote to the old ways of doing things is this new generation of African youth. History shows that the nations that do best are the ones that invest in the education of their people. You see, in this Information Age, jobs can flow anywhere, and they typically will flow to where workers are literate and highly skilled and online. And Africa's young people are ready to compete. I've met them. They are hungry; they are eager. They're willing to work hard. So we've got to invest in them. As Africa invests in education, our entrepreneurship programs are helping innovators to start new businesses and create jobs right here in Africa. And the men and women in our Young African Leaders Initiative today will be the leaders who can transform business and civil society and governments tomorrow. <p>Africa's progress will depend on development that truly lifts countries from poverty to prosperity, because people everywhere deserve the dignity of a life free from want. A child born in Africa today is just as equal and just as worthy as a child born in Asia or Europe or America. At the recent development conference here in Addis, African leadership helped forge a new global compact for financing that fuels development. And under the AU's leadership, the voice of a united Africa will help shape the world's next set of development goals, and you're pursuing a vision of the future that you want for Africa. <p>And America's approach to development&mdash;the central focus of our engagement with Africa&mdash;is focused on helping you build your own capacity to realize that vision. Instead of just shipping food aid to Africa, we've helped more than 2 million farmers use new techniques to boost their yields, feed more people, reduce hunger. With our new alliance of government and the private sector investing billions of dollars in African agriculture, I believe we can achieve our goal and lift 50 million Africans from poverty. <p>Instead of just sending aid to build power plants, our Power Africa initiative is mobilizing billions of dollars in investment from governments and businesses to reduce the number of Africans living without electricity. Now, an undertaking of this magnitude will not be quick. It will take many years. But working together, I believe we can bring electricity to more than 60 million African homes and businesses and connect more Africans to the global economy. <p>Instead of just telling Africa, you're on your own in dealing with climate change, we're delivering new tools and financing to more than 40 African nations to help them prepare and adapt. By harnessing the wind and sun, your vast geothermal energy and rivers for hydropower, you can turn this climate threat into an economic opportunity. And I urge Africa to join us in rejecting old divides between North and South so we can forge a strong global climate agreement this year in Paris. Because sparing some of the world's poorest people from rising seas, more intense droughts, shortages of water and food is a matter of survival and a matter of human dignity. <p>Instead of just sending medicine, we're investing in better treatments and helping Africa prevent and treat diseases. As the United States continues to provide billions of dollars in the fight against HIV/AIDS, and as your countries take greater ownership of health programs, we're moving toward a historic accomplishment: the first AIDS-free generation. And if the world learned anything from Ebola, it's that the best way to prevent epidemics is to build strong public health systems that stop diseases from spreading in the first place. So America is proud to partner with the AU and African countries in this mission. Today I can announce that of the $1 billion that the United States is devoting to this work globally, half will support efforts here in Africa. <p>I believe Africa's progress will also depend on democracy, because Africans, like people everywhere, deserve the dignity of being in control of their own lives. We all know what the ingredients of real democracy are. They include free and fair elections, but also freedom of speech and the press, freedom of assembly. These rights are universal. They're written into African constitutions. The African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights declares that \\"every individual shall have the right to the respect of the dignity inherent in a human being.\\" From Sierra Leone, Ghana, Benin, to Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, democracy has taken root. In Nigeria, more than 28 million voters bravely cast their ballots, and power transferred as it should, peacefully. <p>Yet, at this very moment, these same freedoms are denied to many Africans. And I have to proclaim, democracy is not just formal elections. When journalists are put behind bars for doing their jobs or activists are threatened as governments crack down on civil society, then you may have democracy in name, but not in substance. And I'm convinced that nations cannot realize the full promise of independence until they fully protect the rights of their people. <p>And I&mdash;and this is true even for countries that have made important democratic progress. As I indicated during my visit to Kenya, the remarkable gains that country has made with a new Constitution, with its election, cannot be jeopardized by restrictions on civil society. Likewise, our hosts, Ethiopians, have much to be proud of. I've been amazed at all the wonderful work that's being done here, and it's true that the elections that took place here occurred without violence. But as I discussed with Prime Minister Hailemariam, that's just the start of democracy. I believe Ethiopia will not fully unleash the potential of its people if journalists are restricted or legitimate opposition groups can't participate in the campaign process. And to his credit, the Prime Minister acknowledged that more work will need to be done for Ethiopia to be a full-fledged, sustainable democracy. So these are conversations we have to have as friends. American democracy is not perfect. We've worked for many years, but one thing we do is, we continually reexamine to figure out how can we make our democracy better. And that's a source of strength for us, being willing to look and see honestly what we need to be doing to fulfill the promise of our founding documents. <p>And every country has to go through that process. No country is perfect, but we have to be honest and strive to expand freedoms, to broaden democracy. The bottom line is that when citizens cannot exercise their rights, the world has a responsibility to speak out. And America will, even if it's sometimes uncomfortable, even when it's sometimes directed towards our friends. <p>And I know that there's some countries that don't say anything&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and maybe that's easier to&mdash;for leaders to deal with. [<i>Laughter</i>] But you're kind of stuck with us. This is how we are. We believe in these things, and we're going to keep on talking about them. <p>And I want to repeat, we do this not because we think our democracy is perfect or we think that every country has to follow precisely our path. For more than two centuries since our independence, we're still working on perfecting our Union. We're not immune from criticism. When we fall short of our ideals, we strive to do better. When&mdash;but when we speak out for our principles, at home and abroad, we stay true to our values, and we help lift up the lives of people beyond our borders. And we think that's important. And it's especially important, I believe, for those of us of African descent, because we've known what it feels like to be on the receiving end of injustice. We know what it means to be discriminated against. We know what it means to be jailed. So how can we stand by when it's happening to somebody else? <p>I'll be frank with you: It can't just be America that's talking about these things, fellow African countries have to talk about these things. I mean, just as other countries championed your break from colonialism, our nations must all raise our voices when universal rights are being denied. For if we truly believe that Africans are equal in dignity, then Africans have an equal right to freedoms that are universal. That's a principle we all have to defend. And it's not just a Western idea, it's a human idea. <p>I have to also say that Africa's democratic progress is also at risk when leaders refuse to step aside when their terms end. Now, let me be honest with you: I do not understand this. [<i>Laughter</i>] I am in my second term. It has been an extraordinary privilege for me to serve as the President of the United States. I cannot imagine a greater honor or a more interesting job. I love my work. But under our Constitution, I cannot run again. [<i>Laughter</i>] I can't run again. I actually think I'm a pretty good President. I think if I ran, I could win. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I can't. <p>So there's a lot that I'd like to do to keep America moving, but the law is the law. [<i>Laughter</i>] And no one person is above the law. Not even the President. And I'll be honest with you: I'm looking forward to life after being President. [<i>Laughter</i>] I won't have such a big security detail all the time. [<i>Laughter</i>] It means I can go take a walk. I can spend time with my family. I can find other ways to serve. I can visit Africa more often. The point is, I don't understand why people want to stay so long. [<i>Laughter</i>] Especially when they've got a lot of money. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>When a leader tries to change the rules in the middle of the game just to stay in office, it risks instability and strife, as we've seen in Burundi. And this is often just a first step down a perilous path. And sometimes, you'll a leader say, well, we're&mdash;I'm the only person who can hold this nation together. [<i>Laughter</i>] If that's true, then that leader has failed to truly build their nation. <p>You look at Nelson Mandela. Madiba, like George Washington, forged a lasting legacy not only because of what they did in office, but because they were willing to leave office and transfer power peacefully. And just as the African Union has condemned coups and illegitimate transfers of power, the AU's authority and strong voice can also help the people of Africa ensure that their leaders abide by term limits and their constitutions. Nobody should be President for life. <p>And your country is better off if you have new blood and new ideas. I'm still a pretty young man, but I know that somebody with new energy and new insights will be good for my country. It will be good for yours too, in some cases. <p>Africa's progress will also depend on security and peace, because an essential part of human dignity is being safe and free from fear. In Angola, Mozambique, Liberia, Sierra Leone, we've seen conflicts end and countries work to rebuild. But from Somalia and Nigeria to Mali and Tunisia, terrorists continue to target innocent civilians. Many of these groups claim the banner of religion, but hundreds of millions of African Muslims know that Islam means peace. And we must call groups like Al Qaida, ISIL, al-Shabaab, Boko Haram, we must call them what they are: murderers. <p>In the face of threats, Africa&mdash;and the African Union&mdash;has shown leadership. Because of the AU force in Somalia, al-Shabaab controls less territory and the Somali Government is growing stronger. In Central Africa, the AU-led mission continues to degrade the Lord's Resistance Army. In the Lake Chad Basin, forces from several nations&mdash;with the backing of the AU&mdash;are fighting to end Boko Haram's senseless brutality. And today we salute all those who serve to protect the innocent, including so many brave African peacekeepers. <p>Now, I&mdash;as Africa stands against terror and conflict, I want you to know that the United States stands with you. With training and support, we're helping African forces grow stronger. The United States is supporting the AU's effort to strengthen peacekeeping, and we're working with countries in the region to deal with emerging crises with the African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership. <p>The world must do more to help as well. This fall, at the United Nations, I will host a summit to secure new commitments to strengthen international support for peacekeeping, including here in Africa. And building on commitments that originated here in the AU, we'll work to develop a new partnership between the U.N. and the AU that can provide reliable support for AU peace operations. If African governments and international partners step up with strong support, we can transform how we work together to promote security and peace in Africa. <p>Now, our efforts to ensure our shared security must be matched by a commitment to improved governance. Those things are connected. Good governance is one of the best weapons against terrorism and instability. Our fight against terrorist groups, for example, will never be won if we fail to address legitimate grievances that terrorists may try to exploit, if we don't build trust with all communities, if we don't uphold the rule of law. There's a saying, and I believe it is true: If we sacrifice liberty in the name of security, we risk losing both. <p>This same seriousness of purpose is needed to end conflicts. In the Central African Republic, the spirit of dialogue recently shown by ordinary citizens must be matched by leaders committed to inclusive elections and a peaceful transition. In Mali, the comprehensive peace agreement must be fulfilled. And leaders in Sudan must know their nation will never truly thrive so long as they wage war against their own people. The world will not forget about Darfur. <p>In South Sudan, the joy of independence has descended into the despair of violence. I was there at the United Nations when we held up South Sudan as the promise of a new beginning. And neither Mr. Kiir nor Mr. Machar have shown, so far, any interest in sparing their people from this suffering or reaching a political solution. <p>Yesterday I met with leaders from this region. We agree that, given the current situation, Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar must reach an agreement by August 17, because if they do not, I believe the international community must raise the costs of intransigence. And the world awaits the report of the AU Commission of Inquiry, because accountability for atrocities must be part of any lasting peace in Africa's youngest nation. <p>And finally, Africa's progress will depend on upholding the human rights of all people. For if each of us is to be treated with dignity, each of us must be sure to also extend that same dignity to others. As President, I make it a point to meet with many of our Young African Leaders. And one was a young man from Senegal. He said something wonderful about being together with so many of his African brothers and sisters. He said: \\"Here, I have met Africa&mdash;the [Africa] I've always believed in. She's beautiful. She's young. She's full of talent and motivation and ambition.\\" I agree. <p>Africa is the beautiful, talented daughters who are just as capable as Africa's sons. And as a father, I believe that my two daughters have to have the same chance to pursue their dreams as anybody's son. And that same thing holds true for girls here in Africa. Our girls have to be treated the same. <p>We can't let old traditions stand in the way. The march of history shows that we have the capacity to broaden our moral imaginations. We've come to see that some traditions are good for us&mdash;they keep us grounded&mdash;but that, in our modern world, other traditions set us back. When African girls are subjected to the mutilation of their bodies or forced into marriage at the ages of 9 or 10 or 11, that sets us back. That's not a good tradition. It needs to end. <p>When more than 80 percent of new HIV cases in the hardest hit countries are teenage girls, that's a tragedy. That sets us back. So America is beginning a partnership with 10 African countries&mdash;Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe&mdash;to keep teenage girls safe and AIDS-free. And when girls cannot go to school and grow up not knowing how to read or write, that denies the world future women engineers, future women doctors, future women business owners, future women Presidents. That sets us all back. That's a bad tradition, not providing our girls the same education as our sons. <p>I was saying in Kenya, nobody would put out a football team and then just play half the team. You'd lose. The same is true when it comes to getting everybody an education. You can't leave half the team off: our young women. So as part of America's support for the education and the health of our daughters, my wife Michelle is helping to lead a global campaign, including a new effort in Tanzania and Malawi, with a simple message: \\"Let Girls Learn\\". Let girls learn so they grow up healthy and they grow up strong. And that will be good for families. And they will raise smart, healthy children, and that will be good for every one of your nations. <p>Africa is the beautiful, strong women that these girls grow up to become. The single best indicator of whether a nation will succeed is how it treats its women. When women have health care and women have education, families are stronger, communities are more prosperous, children do better in school, nations are more prosperous. Look at the amazing African women here in this hall. If you want your country to grow and succeed, you have to empower your women. And if you want to empower more women, America will be your partner. <p>Let's work together to stop sexual assault and domestic violence. Let's make clear that we will not tolerate rape as a weapon of war. It's a crime, and those who commit it must be punished. Let's lift up the next generation of women leaders who can help fight injustice and forge peace and start new businesses and create jobs&mdash;and some might hire some men too. [<i>Laughter</i>] We'll all be better off when women's&mdash;women have equal futures. <p>And Africa is the beautiful tapestry of your cultures and ethnicities and races and religions. Last night we saw this amazing dance troupe made up of street children who had formed a dance troupe, and they performed for the Prime Minister and myself. And there are 80 different languages, and I don't know how many ethnic groups. And there were, like, 30 different dances that were being done. And the Prime Minister was trying to keep up with&mdash;okay, I think that one is Oromo&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and they were moving fast. And that diversity here in Ethiopia is representative of diversity all throughout Africa. And that's a strength. <p>Now, yesterday I had the privilege to view Lucy. You may know Lucy. She's our ancestor, more than 3 million years old. In this tree of humanity, with all of our branches and diversity, we all go back to the same root. We're all one family, we're all one tribe. And yet so much of the suffering in our world stems from our failure to remember that, to not recognize ourselves in each other. <p>We think because somebody's skin is slightly different or their hair is slightly different or their religious faith is differently expressed or they speak a different language that it justifies somehow us treating them with less dignity. And that becomes the source of so many of our problems. And we think somehow that we make ourselves better by putting other people down. And that becomes the source of so many of our problems. When we begin to see other as somehow less than ourselves, when we succumb to these artificial divisions of faith or sect or tribe or ethnicity, then even the most awful abuses are justified in the minds of those who are thinking in those ways. And in the end, abusers lose their own humanity as well. <p>Nelson Mandela taught us, \\"to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.\\" <p>Every one of us is equal. Every one of us has worth. Every one of us matters. And when we respect the freedom of others&mdash;no matter the color of their skin or how they pray or who they are or who they love&mdash;we are all more free. Your dignity depends on my dignity, and my dignity depends on yours. Imagine if everyone had that spirit in their hearts. Imagine if governments operated that way. Just imagine what the world could look like, the future that we could bequeath these young people. <p>Yes, in our world, old thinking can be a stubborn thing. That's one of the reasons why we need term limits: Old people think old ways. And I'm&mdash;you can see my gray hair, I'm getting old. [<i>Laughter</i>] The old ways can be stubborn. But I believe the human heart is stronger. I believe hearts can change. I believe minds can open. That's how change happens. That's how societies move forward. It's not always a straight line. Step by halting step, sometimes, you go forward, you move back a little bit. But I believe we are marching, we are pointing towards ideals of justice and equality. That's how your nations won independence, not just with rifles, but with principles and ideals. That's how African Americans won our civil rights. That's how South Africans&mdash;Black and White&mdash;tore down apartheid. That's why I can stand before you today as the first African American President of the United States. <p>New thinking. Unleashing growth that creates opportunity. Promoting development that lifts all people out of poverty. Supporting democracy that gives citizens their say. Advancing the security and justice that delivers peace. Respecting the human rights of all people. These are the keys to progress, not just in Africa, but around the world. And this is the work that we can do together. <p>And I am hopeful. As I prepare to return home, my thoughts are with that same young man from Senegal, who said: Here, I have met Africa, the Africa I've always believed in; she's beautiful and young, full of talent and motivation and ambition. To which I would simply add, as you build the Africa you believe in, you will have no better partner, no better friend than the United States of America. <p>God bless Africa. God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.\" "
"177" "\"Well, I am about to sign a 3-month extension of our highway funding. And that's a good thing, because if this wasn't in front of me and ready for signature, we would end up having projects all across the country that would be closing after midnight. <p>On the other hand, we have now made it a habit where instead of 5-year funding plans for transportation, instead of long-term approaches where we can actually strategize on what are the most important infrastructure projects, how are they getting paid for, providing certainties to Governors and mayors and States and localities about how they are going to approach critical infrastructure projects&mdash;roads, bridges, ports, airports&mdash;instead, we operate as if we're hand-to-mouth, 3 months at a time, which freezes a lot of construction, which makes people uncertain, which leads to businesses not being willing to hire because they don't have any long-term certainty. It's a bad way for the U.S. Government to do business. <p>So I want to make sure that before I sign this, Congress gets a clear message, and that is, we should not be leaving all the business of the U.S. Government to the last minute. Think about the things that are still undone as Congress is about to go on vacation. They haven't reauthorized the Export-Import Bank, which creates tens of thousands of jobs all across the country&mdash;good-paying jobs&mdash;because it increases our exports. When I was in Ethiopia on our trip, we had sold a score of planes to Ethiopian Airlines from Boeing; that produces jobs not just in Boeing's plant in Seattle, but across the supply chain&mdash;small businesses and medium-sized businesses, all who benefit from us being able to facilitate the sale of U.S. products to other countries. <p>I had a group of small-businesspeople here with employees ranging from 12 employees to 500 employees who were saying that their business sales were starting to be affected by congressional inaction on what has traditionally, for 81 years, been a bipartisan support of the Export-Import Bank. That needs to get done. <p>Congress has had all year to do a budget, and yet Congress is leaving on vacation without the budget done. And when they get back, they're going to have about 2 weeks in order to do the people's business. And this is going to be critical. We've got big issues that we have to deal with on the defense side, in terms of making sure that we're paying for our campaign against ISIL, the support we're providing our allies in the Gulf in dealing with some very big problems, and around the world the extraordinary commitments that our Armed Services have to make in order to keep us safe. <p>On the domestic side, I've already said that we're not going to accept sequester-level budgets that result in effective cuts to critical programs like education that are imperative for our long-term growth. <p>So my hope is, is that, although I wish Congress well during the next 6 weeks&mdash;they probably deserve some time with their families to refuel a little bit&mdash;that some of these next 6 weeks are prepared to come up with a plan and approach whereby Democrats and Republicans sit down and negotiate a budget that works for everybody, and that everybody comes back with a spirit of compromise and a spirit of how do we make sure that our defense budget and our domestic budget is reflective of the core needs that are going to improve prospects for people's lives not just this year, but for years to come. <p>I also hope that we can go ahead and get Export-Import Bank done, because that's going to be critical for our exports and for jobs here in the United States. And I hope that we have a longer term approach to transportation. We can't keep on funding transportation by the seat of our pants, 3 months at a time. It's just not how the greatest country on Earth should be doing its business. <p>I guarantee you this is not how China, Germany, other countries around the world&mdash;other big, powerful countries around the world&mdash;handle their infrastructure. And we can't have bridges collapsing and potholes not being filled because Congress can't come up with a adequate plan to fund our infrastructure budget for more than 3 or 5 or 6 months at a time. Okay? <p>With that, I'm going to sign this. And I hope that Members of Congress are listening, and I hope that Republicans can work things out among themselves as well as work out things with Democrats. I think we've got to do some intraparty negotiations as well as negotiations between the parties. <p>[<i>At this point, the President signed the bill.</i>] <p>There you go. Thank you, everybody.\" "
"178" "\"Hi, everybody. This week, there was a big birthday you might have missed. Medicare and Medicaid turned 50 years old. And that's something worth celebrating. <p>If one of the best measures of a country is how it treats its more vulnerable citizens&mdash;seniors, the poor, the sick&mdash;then America has a lot to be proud of. Think about it. Before Social Security, too many seniors lived in poverty. Before Medicare, only half had some form of health insurance. Before Medicaid, parents often had no help covering the costs of care for a child with a disability. <p>But as Americans, we declared that our citizens deserve a basic measure of security and dignity. And today, the poverty rate for seniors is less than half of what it was 50 years ago. Every American over 65 has access to affordable health care. And today, we're finally finishing the job. Since I signed the Affordable Care Act into law, the uninsured rate for all Americans has fallen by about one-third. <p>These promises we made as a nation have saved millions of our own people from poverty and hardship, allowing us new freedom, new independence, and the chance to live longer, better lives. That's something to be proud of. It's heroic. These endeavors&mdash;these American endeavors&mdash;they didn't just make us a better country. They reaffirmed that we are a great country. <p>And a great country keeps the promises it makes. Today, we're often told that Medicare and Medicaid are in crisis, but that's usually a political excuse to cut their funding, privatize them, or phase them out entirely, all of which would undermine their core guarantee. The truth is, these programs aren't in crisis. Nor have they kept us from cutting our deficits by two-thirds since I took office. What is true is that every month, another 250,000 Americans turn 65 years old, and become eligible for Medicare. And we all deserve a health care system that delivers efficient, high-quality care. So to keep these programs strong, we'll have to make smart changes over time, just like we always have. <p>Today, we're actually proving that's possible. The Affordable Care Act has already helped secure Medicare's funding for another 13 years. The Affordable Care Act has saved more than 9 million folks on Medicare 15 billion dollars on their prescription drugs. It's expanded Medicaid to help cover 12.8 million more Americans and to help more seniors live independently. And we're moving our health care system toward models that reward the quality of the care you receive, not the quantity of care you receive. That means healthier Americans and a healthier Federal budget. <p>Today, these programs are so fundamental to our way of life that it's easy to forget how hard people fought against them at the time. When FDR created Social Security, critics called it socialism. When JFK and LBJ worked to create Medicare, the cynics said it would take away our freedom. But ultimately, we came to see these programs for what they truly are: a promise that if we work hard and play by the rules, we'll be rewarded with a basic measure of dignity, security, and the freedom to live our lives as we want. It's a promise that previous generations made to us and a promise that our generation has to keep. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"179" "\"<i>The President.</i> Everybody, please have a seat. Thank you. Well, good afternoon, everybody. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Good afternoon. <p><i>The President.</i> Gina, I want to thank you not just for the introduction, but for the incredible work that you and your team have been doing, not just on this issue, but on generally making sure that we've got clean air, clean water&mdash;a great future for our kids. <p>I want to thank all the Members of Congress who are here as well, who have been fighting this issue and, sometimes, at great odds with others, but are willing to take on what is going to be one of the key challenges of our lifetimes and future generations. I want to thank our Surgeon General, who's just been doing outstanding work and is helping to make the connection between this critical issue and the health of our families. <p>Over the past 6&frac12; years, we've taken on some of the toughest challenges of our time, from rebuilding our economy after a devastating recession, to ending our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and bringing almost all of our troops home, to strengthening our security through tough and principled diplomacy. But I am convinced that no challenge poses a greater threat to our future and future generations than a changing climate. And that's what brings us here today. <p>Now, not everyone here is a scientist&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but some of you are among the best scientists in the world. And what you and your colleagues have been showing us for years now is that human activities are changing the climate in dangerous ways. Levels of carbon dioxide, which heats up our atmosphere, are higher than they've been in 800,000 years; 2014 was the planet's warmest year on record. And we've been setting a lot of records in terms of warmest years over the last decade. One year doesn't make a trend, but 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have fallen within the first 15 years of this century. <p>Climate change is no longer just about the future that we're predicting for our children or our grandchildren, it's about the reality that we're living with every day, right now. The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. While we can't say any single weather event is entirely caused by climate change, we've seen stronger storms, deeper droughts, longer wildfire seasons. Charleston and Miami now flood at high tide. Shrinking ice caps forced National Geographic to make the biggest change in its atlas since the Soviet Union broke apart. <p>Over the past three decades, nationwide asthma rates have more than doubled, and climate change puts those Americans at greater risk of landing in the hospital. As one of America's Governors has said, \\"We're the first generation to feel the impact of climate change and the last generation that can do something about it.\\" And that's why I committed the United States to leading the world on this challenge, because I believe there is such a thing as being too late. Most of the issues that I deal with&mdash;and I deal with some tough issues that cross my desk&mdash;by definition: I don't deal with issues if they're easy to solve because somebody else has already solved them. [<i>Laughter</i>] And some of them are grim. Some of them are heartbreaking. Some of them are hard. Some of them are frustrating. But most of the time, the issues we deal with are ones that are temporally bound and we can anticipate things getting better if we just kind of plug away at it, even incrementally. But this is one of those rare issues&mdash;because of its magnitude, because of its scope&mdash;that if we don't get it right, we may not be able to reverse, and we may not be able to adapt sufficiently. There is such a thing as being too late when it comes to climate change. <p>Now, that doesn't&mdash;that shouldn't make us hopeless; it's not as if there's nothing we can do about it. We can take action. Over the past several years, America has been working to use less dirty energy, more clean energy, waste less energy throughout our economy. We've set new fuel economy standards that mean our cars will go twice as far on a gallon of gas by the middle of the next decade. Combined with lower gas prices, these standards are on pace to save drivers an average of $700 at the pump this year. We doubled down on our investment in renewable energy. We're generating three times as much wind power, 20 times as much solar power as we did in 2008. <p>These steps are making a difference. Over the past decade, even as our economy has continued to grow, the United States has cut our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth. That's the good news. But I am here to say that if we want to protect our economy and our security and our children's health, we're going to have to do more. The science tells us we have to do more. <p>This has been our focus these past 6 years. And it's particularly going to be our focus this month. In Nevada, later in August, I'll talk about the extraordinary progress we've made in generating clean energy&mdash;and the jobs that come with it&mdash;and how we can boost that even further. I'll also be the first American President to visit the Alaskan Arctic, where our fellow Americans have already seen their communities devastated by melting ice and rising oceans, the impact on marine life. We're going to talk about what the world needs to do together to prevent the worst impacts of climate change before it's too late. <p>And today we're here to announce America's Clean Power Plan: a plan 2 years in the making and the single most important step America has ever taken in the fight against global climate change. <p>Now, right now our power plants are the source of about a third of America's carbon pollution. That's more pollution than our cars, our airplanes, and our homes generate combined. That pollution contributes to climate change, which degrades the air our kids breathe. But there have never been Federal limits on the amount of carbon that power plants can dump into the air. Think about that. We limit the amount of toxic chemicals like mercury and sulfur and arsenic in our air or our water, and we're better off for it. But existing power plants can still dump unlimited amounts of harmful carbon pollution into the air. <p>For the sake of our kids and the health and safety of all Americans, that has to change. For the sake of the planet, that has to change. So 2 years ago, I directed Gina and the Environmental Protection Agency to take on this challenge. And today, after working with States and cities and power companies, the EPA is setting the first-ever nationwide standards to end the limitless dumping of carbon pollution from power plants. Here's how it works: over the next few years, each State will have the chance to put together its own plan for reducing emissions, because every State has a different energy mix. Some generate more of their power from renewables, some from natural gas or nuclear or coal. And this plan reflects the fact that not everybody is starting in the same place. So we're giving States the time and the flexibility they need to cut pollution in a way that works for them. <p>And we'll reward the States that take action sooner instead of later, because time is not on our side here. As States work to meet their targets, they can build on the progress that our communities and businesses are already making. <p>A lot of power companies have already begun modernizing their plants, reducing their emissions and, by the way, creating new jobs in the process. Nearly a dozen States have already set up their own market-based programs to reduce carbon pollution. About half of our States have set energy efficiency targets. More than 35 have set renewable energy targets. Over a thousand mayors have signed an agreement to cut carbon pollution in their cities. And last week, 13 of our biggest companies, including UPS and Walmart and GM, made bold, new commitments to cut their emissions and deploy more clean energy. <p>So the idea of setting standards and cutting carbon pollution is not new. It's not radical. What is new is that, starting today, Washington is starting to catch up with the vision of the rest of the country. And by setting these standards, we can actually speed up our transition to a cleaner, safer future. <p>With this Clean Power Plan, by 2030, carbon pollution from our power plants will be 32 percent lower than it was a decade ago. And the nerdier way to say that is that we'll be keeping 870 million tons of carbon dioxide pollution out of our atmosphere. The simpler, layman's way of saying that is, it's like cutting every ounce of emission due to electricity from 108 million American homes. Or it's the equivalent of taking 166 million cars off the road. <p>By 2030, we will reduce premature deaths from power plant emissions by nearly 90 percent, and thanks to this plan, there will be 90,000 fewer asthma attacks among our children each year. And by combining this with greater investment in our booming clean energy sector and smarter investments in energy efficiency and by working with the world to achieve a climate agreement by the end of this year, we can do more to slow&mdash;and maybe even eventually stop&mdash;the carbon pollution that's doing so much harm to our climate. <p>So this is the right thing to do. I want to thank, again, Gina and her team for doing it the right way. Over the longest engagement process in EPA history, they fielded more than 4 million public comments, they worked with States, they worked with power companies and environmental groups and faith groups and people across our country to make sure that what we were doing was realistic and achievable, but still ambitious. <p>And some of those people are with us here today. So Tanya Brown&mdash;Tanya, wave, go ahead. There's Tanya. Tanya Brown has joined up with moms across America to spread the word about the dangers climate change pose to the health of our children, including Tanya's daughter Sanaa. There's Sanaa, right there. [<i>Laughter</i>] Dr. Sumita Khatri has spent her career researching the health impacts of pollution at the Cleveland Clinic and helping families whose lives are impacted every single day. Doctor, thank you. Sister Joan Marie Steadman has helped rally Catholic women across America to take on climate. Sister, thank you so much for your leadership. And she's got a pretty important guy on her side: As Pope Francis made clear in his encyclical this summer, taking a stand against climate change is a moral obligation. And Sister Steadman is living up to that obligation every single day. <p>Now, let's be clear. There will be critics of what we're trying to do. There will be cynics that say it cannot be done. Long before the details of this Clean Power Plan were even decided, the special interests and their allies in Congress were already mobilizing to oppose it with everything they've got. They will claim that this plan will cost you money, even though this plan, the analysis shows, will ultimately save the average American nearly $85 a year on their energy bills. <p>They'll claim we need to slash our investments in clean energy, it's a waste of money, even though they're happy to spend billions of dollars a year in subsidizing oil companies. They'll claim this plan will kill jobs, even though our transition to a cleaner energy economy has the solar industry, to just name one example, creating jobs 10 times faster than the rest of the economy. <p>They'll claim this plan is a \\"war on coal,\\" to scare up votes, even as they ignore my plan to actually invest in revitalizing coal country and supporting health care and retirement for coal miners and their families and retraining those workers for better paying jobs and healthier jobs. Communities across America have been losing coal jobs for decades. I want to work with Congress to help them, not to use them as a political football. Partisan press releases aren't going to help those families. <p>Even more cynical&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;we've got critics of this plan who are actually claiming that this will harm minority and low-income communities, even though climate change hurts those Americans the most, who are the most vulnerable. Today, an African American child is more than twice as likely to be hospitalized from asthma; a Latino child is 40 percent more likely to die from asthma. So if you care about low-income, minority communities, start protecting the air that they breathe and stop trying to rob them of their health care. And the&mdash;you could also expand Medicaid in your States, by the way; that would help. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Here's the thing: We've heard these same stale arguments before. Every time America has made progress, it's been despite these kind of claims. Whenever America has set clear rules and smarter standards for our air, our water, our children's health, we get the same scary stories about killing jobs and businesses and freedom. It's the&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member</i>. [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President</i>. It's true. I'm going to go off script here just for a second&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;because this is important. Because sometimes, I think we feel as if there's nothing we can do. What&mdash;tomorrow's my birthday, so I'm starting to reflect on age. And in thinking about what we were doing here today, I was reminded about landing in Los Angeles to attend a college as a freshman, as an 18-year-old. And it was late August. I was moving from Hawaii. And I got to the campus, and I decided I had a lot of pent-up energy, and I wanted to go take a run. And after about 5 minutes, suddenly, I had this weird feeling: I couldn't breathe. And the reason was, is back in 1979, Los Angeles still was so full of smog that there were days where people who were vulnerable just could not go outside, and they were fairly frequent. <p>And folks who are older than me can remember the Cuyahoga River being&mdash;burning because of pollution and acid rain threatening to destroy all the great forests of the Northeast. And you fast-forward 30, 40 years later, and we solved those problems. But at the time, the same characters who are going to be criticizing this plan were saying, this is going to kill jobs, this is going to destroy businesses, this is going to hurt low-income people, it's going to be wildly expensive. And each time, they were wrong. <p>And because we pushed through, despite those scaremongering tactics, you can actually run in Los Angeles without choking. And folks can actually take a boat out on that river. And those forests are there. <p>So we've got to learn lessons. We've got to know our history. The kinds of criticisms that you're going to hear are simply excuses for inaction. They're not even good business sense. They underestimate American business and American ingenuity. <p>In 1970, when Republican President Richard Nixon decided to do something about the smog that was choking our cities, they warned that the new pollution standards would decimate the auto industry. It didn't happen. Catalytic converters worked. Taking the lead out of gasoline worked. Our air got cleaner. <p>In 1990, when Republican President George H.W. Bush decided to do something about acid rain, they said the bills would go up, our lights would go off, businesses would suffer \\"a quiet death.\\" It didn't happen. We cut acid rain dramatically, and it cost much less than anybody expected, because businesses, once incentivized, were able to figure it out. <p>When we restricted leaded fuel in our cars, cancer-causing chemicals in plastics, it didn't end the oil industry; it didn't end the plastics industry. American chemists came up with better substitutes. The fuel standards we put in place a couple of years ago didn't cripple automakers. The American auto industry retooled. Today, our automakers are selling the best cars in the world at a faster pace than they have in almost a decade. They've got more hybrids and more plug-ins and more high-fuel-efficient cars, giving consumers more choice than ever before and saving families at the pump. <p>We can figure this stuff out as long as we're not lazy about it, as long as we don't take the path of least resistance. Scientists, citizens, workers, entrepreneurs&mdash;together as Americans, we disrupt those stale, old debates, upend old ways of thinking. Right now we're inventing whole new technologies, whole new industries, not looking backwards, we're looking forwards. <p>And if we don't do it, nobody will. The only reason that China is now looking at getting serious about its emissions is because they saw that we were going to do it too. When the world's&mdash;when the world faces its toughest challenges, America leads the way forward; that's what this plan is about. <p>Now, I don't want to fool you here. This is going to be hard; dealing with climate change in its entirety, it's challenging. No single action, no single country will change the warming of the planet on its own. But today, with America leading the way, countries representing 70 percent of the carbon pollution from the world's energy sector have announced plans to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. In December, with America leading the way, we have a chance to put in place one of the most ambitious international climate agreements in human history. <p>And it's easy to be cynical and to say climate change is the kind of challenge it's just too big for humanity to solve. I am absolutely convinced that's wrong. We can solve this thing. But we have to get going. It's exactly the kind of challenge that's big enough to remind us that we're all in this together. <p>Last month, for the first time since 1972, NASA released a Blue Marble: a single snapshot of the Earth taken from outer space. And so much has changed in the decades between that first picture and the second. Borders have shifted, generations have come and gone, our global population has nearly doubled. But one thing hasn't changed: Our planet is as beautiful as ever. It still looks blue. And it's as vast, but also as fragile, as miraculous as anything in this universe. This Blue Marble belongs to all of us. It belongs to these kids who are here. There are more than 7 billion people alive today; no matter what country they're from, no matter what language they speak, every one of them can look at this image and say, \\"That's my home.\\" And \\"we're the first generation to feel the impact of climate change; we're the last generation that can do something about it.\\" We only get one home. We only get one planet. There's no plan B. <p>I don't want my grandkids not to be able to swim in Hawaii or not to be able to climb a mountain and see a glacier because we didn't do something about it. I don't want millions of people's lives disrupted and this world more dangerous because we didn't do something about it. That'd be shameful of us. This is our moment to get this right and leave something better for our kids. Let's make most of that opportunity. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you.\" "
"180" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. Hello, everybody. Have a seat, have a seat. Look at you guys with all your gadgets. [<i>Laughter</i>] Sit down, come on. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Happy Birthday! <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you! [<i>Laughter</i>] Thank you very much. Thank you. I'm so gray. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I feel good otherwise. <p>Welcome to the White House, everybody. As a birthday treat to me, I thought I'd invite business leaders, investors, and government officials here for the first-ever White House Demo Day. [<i>Applause</i>] Yes. I think it's fair to say that when I was 8, I would have been confused by that choice. [<i>Laughter</i>] But now I think it's really cool, and I am so grateful to have all of you participating. <p>On a typical Demo Day, entrepreneurs, like many of you, pitch your ideas to potential investors in venture capital or elsewhere. And it is a high-stress, make-or-break moment that can change the course of your life. You don't&mdash;folks are peppering you with questions; you don't know what's going to be coming. Today was much more relaxed because you just had to pitch the President of the United States your ideas. [<i>Laughter</i>] So it's no problem&mdash;in front of TV cameras that everybody is going to watch. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Fortunately, everybody did a stellar job that I had a chance to meet. And here in this room, we've got some of the best and brightest entrepreneurs America has to offer, folks from all across the country who are working every day to transform the way we live and learn and communicate. They have taken over my house. [<i>Laughter</i>] We've got people who are developing the next generation of lithium-ion batteries; a system of radio sensors that notices when a senior takes a fall while they're in their home; a robotic teddy bear that helps kids with diabetes learn about managing their health and staying active. There was an app that helps military families transition to their new communities, another app that helps you order replacement parts just by snapping a photo of the old one. And then, there are the folks at Astrobotics Technology in Pittsburgh. They are shooting for the moon, literally&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;with plans to land a rover on the lunar surface in the next couple of years, which is pretty exciting. I wouldn't mind seeing how that turns out. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>You know, in America, that's who we've always been. We explore next frontiers, we're pioneers with a vision for tomorrow, whether it's Lewis and Clark, Sally Ride. We're the nation of Franklin and Edison and Carver and Salk; Jobs, Gates. And the folks here today are heirs to that legacy, and they're the driving force in a 21st-century economy. <p>Startups, young firms account for almost 40 percent of new hires. And as we've fought back from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes, those firms have helped our private sector create more than 12.8 million jobs over the last 64 straight months, which is the longest streak of private sector job growth on record. <p>So as President, I've worked to make it easier for entrepreneurs to strike out on their own. We've made it easier for folks to buy health insurance, making it portable so you can strike out and do your thing. We've made it easier to pay off student loan debt, although there was an app that I just saw, somebody who's really good at working with businesses to help manage student loan debt in an efficient way. <p>We have tried to download government data sets for new apps and innovations, following in the path of the National Weather Service and other data that's turned into commercial ventures. We've worked to connect to high-speed broadband and open access for a free and open Internet. And we're working on trade agreements to open up new markets for companies to sell their products overseas. Thanks to the bipartisan JOBS Act that I signed, it's easier for innovative companies to take the next step and go public. And when it's fully implemented, more startups and small businesses will be able to accept support from regular investors through crowdfunding. <p>So today, America is home to more high-tech companies than anyplace else in the world. And business leaders have declared that China is no longer the world's number-one place to invest, America is. With technological advancements like cloud computing and big data and 3-D printing, the fact is, there has never been a better time to launch an idea and bring it to scale right here in the United States, right now. <p>But we've got to make sure that we're taking full advantage of this moment by tapping all the talent America has to offer, no matter who they are or where they set up shop. And obviously, there are chronic challenges for any entrepreneur. Capital is tough to come by, but it's even tougher if you're not in one of a handful of cities that have a well-developed venture capital presence. It's always hard to get in front of the right people, but sometimes, it's harder if you're a woman or an underrepresented minority who all too often have to fight just to get a seat at the table. <p>Right now one study shows that fewer than 3 percent of venture-capital-backed companies have a woman as their CEO. Another study showed that fewer than 1 percent have an African American founder. Yet we've seen again and again that companies with diverse leadership often outperform those that don't. That's the market that is out there, not just here in the United States, but globally. So that lack of participation from everybody isn't good for business. <p>We've got to make sure that everybody is getting a fair shot; the next Steve Jobs might be named Stephanie or Esteban. [<i>Laughter</i>] They might never set foot in Silicon Valley. We've got to unleash the full potential of every American, not leave more than half the team on the bench. <p>And that's something that a growing number of tech companies have begun to recognize. So, in January, Intel announced that by 2020 they would achieve full representation of women and minorities in their U.S. workforce. Last week, Pinterest also announced ambitious new diversity goals of their own. Today we've got a series of public and private commitments to build on those efforts. <p>We've got more than 40 leading venture capital firms who are pledging more&mdash;pledging to do more to track and hire and support women and underrepresented minorities and veterans at their firms and portfolio companies. A pair of leading pension funds are committing to diversifying the ranks of those who manage their money. We've got companies like Xerox, Box, and others that are going to institute their own version of the NFL's Rooney Rule, named after my good friend Dan Rooney, of the Pittsburgh Steelers, which means interviewing at least one woman and one person of color for every senior position, just so that folks get a chance to get in the door. And more than a hundred deans at America's engineering schools are committing to recruit and retain more diverse student bodies, building the pipeline for the next generation of innovators and entrepreneurs, because this is something we are seeing again and again and again. We are not producing all the technical talent, all the engineers that we need. And part of the reason is because too many girls and too many young people of color are getting intimidated and winnowed out of the process, not being mentored, not being encouraged, and we deprive ourselves of the talent that we need in order for us to continue to be a dynamic, innovative economy, because that's the part of the population that's growing. <p>So my administration is also going to do our part. We're expanding our TechHire initiative to 10 new cities and States, bringing together employers and local governments to create newer, faster training pathways, like coding boot camps, so that a more diverse group of workers can get hired and perhaps eventually start a business of their own. We're scaling up the National Science Foundation's successful Innovation Corps program at six more Federal agencies so we can help more of our scientists move their ideas out of the lab and into the marketplace. <p>More than 50 new cities have signed up to our \\"Startup in a Day\\" initiative. Many of them have earned cash prizes from the Small Business Administration to help them clear away all the red tape so that a local entrepreneur can apply for all the licenses and permits that they need to start a business in just 1 day. <p>So we hope that these efforts are going to open up new opportunities for all of our entrepreneurs&mdash;all of our would-be entrepreneurs. And in the months ahead, I look forward to seeing more folks across this country&mdash;investors, accelerators, universities, civic leaders, corporate giants, growing startups&mdash;all take new steps to build on these actions. Because you never know who's going to have the next big idea or what path will lead them there. <p>So I'm just going to give you a couple of examples because these are folks who are here. Take the story of Ramona Pierson. Where's Ramona? There&mdash;Ramona is right back here. So I was just talking to Ramona. Ramona is&mdash;this is a pretty remarkable story. Back in 1984, when she was 22 years old, Ramona had already been a U.S. Marine. She was a young, dedicated, highly skilled professional in the prime of her life. One day, she's out for a run, and she was hit by a drunk driver. And she was in a coma for 18 months, woke up 18 months later, weighed 64 pounds, was bald and was blind, could not walk, could not speak, was moved into a nursing home. I think it's fair to say that a lot of people would be broken by that. In that nursing home, Ramona was surrounded by dozens of senior citizens, folks with a lifetime of knowledge and expertise and skills of their own as parents and teachers and community leaders. And they helped coach Ramona back to health. And she&mdash;they became her mentors. And over the next few years, Ramona had to relearn the most basic skills&mdash;walking, speaking, crossing the street&mdash;and she gained the perspective of others with challenges. <p>And decades later now, Ramona looks back on that process of learning by connecting with others as the catalyst for a startup she launched 3 years ago called Declara. And it's a technology platform that combines the power of a search engine with a worldwide network of experts so that we can all learn things faster from our fellow citizens and their lifetimes of knowledge. It's sort of like a Google meets Facebook, but it's there's all kind of stuff to it. Ramona was explaining it to me, and it was fascinating, and I understood about half of it. [<i>Laughter</i>] So today, Declara has users all around the world. It's attracted millions of dollars of capital. They've got a team of 65 employees, with women serving as CEO, COO, and head of data sciences. That's the power of a good idea. And when Ramona was in that nursing home, I don't think anybody would have imagined that she was going to be a candidate to be a significant tech entrepreneur. Ideas can come from anybody and anywhere and can be inspired by any kind of life experience. And we've got to judge those ideas on their merits. We've got to make sure they're not filtered by misperceptions about who people are or who's capable of dreaming something up. That's at the very heart of America, the idea that any of us can make it if we try. <p>And together, if we have enough effort and enough urgency, our idea can move the world. We can all be a part of making sure everybody has that chance. And that's what the Demo Day is about here today. That's what our initiatives are about. That's what our outstanding 40 partners that are making announcements are all about here today. I'm very proud of them. And I can't wait to see what all of you end up doing. <p>And keep in mind that in about 18 months, I'm going to need a job. [<i>Laughter</i>] I've got some skills. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. Appreciate it.\" "
"181" "\"Thank you so much. Everybody, please have a seat. Thank you very much. I apologize for the slight delay. Even Presidents have problems with toner. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>It is a great honor to be back at American University, which has prepared generations of young people for service in public life. I want to thank President Kerwin and the American University family for hosting us here today. <p>Fifty-two years ago, President Kennedy, at the height of the cold war, addressed this same university on the subject of peace. The Berlin Wall had just been built. The Soviet Union had tested the most powerful weapons ever developed. China was on the verge of acquiring a nuclear bomb. Less than 20 years after the end of World War II, the prospect of nuclear war was all too real. With all of the threats that we face today, it's hard to appreciate how much more dangerous the world was at that time. <p>In light of these mounting threats, a number of strategists here in the United States argued that we had to take military action against the Soviets, to hasten what they saw as inevitable confrontation. But the young President offered a different vision. Strength, in his view, included powerful Armed Forces and a willingness to stand up for our values around the world. But he rejected the prevailing attitude among some foreign policy circles that equated security with a perpetual war footing. Instead, he promised strong, principled American leadership on behalf of what he called a \\"practical\\" and \\"attainable peace,\\" a peace \\"based not on a sudden revolution in human nature, but on a gradual evolution in human institutions, on a series of concrete actions and effective agreements.\\" <p>Such wisdom would help guide our ship of state through some of the most perilous moments in human history. With Kennedy at the helm, the Cuban missile crisis was resolved peacefully. Under Democratic and Republican Presidents, new agreements were forged: a Non-Proliferation Treaty that prohibited nations from acquiring nuclear weapons, while allowing them to access peaceful nuclear energy; the SALT and START Treaties, which bound the United States and Soviet Union to cooperation on arms control. Not every conflict was averted, but the world avoided nuclear catastrophe, and we created the time and the space to win the cold war without firing a shot at the Soviets. <p>The agreement now reached between the international community and the Islamic Republic of Iran builds on this tradition of strong, principled diplomacy. After 2 years of negotiations, we have achieved a detailed arrangement that permanently prohibits Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. It cuts off all of Iran's pathways to a bomb. It contains the most comprehensive inspection and verification regime ever negotiated to monitor a nuclear program. As was true in previous treaties, it does not resolve all problems; it certainly doesn't resolve all our problems with Iran. It does not ensure a warming between our two countries. But it achieves one of our most critical security objectives. As such, it is a very good deal. <p>Today I want to speak to you about this deal and the most consequential foreign policy debate that our country has had since the invasion of Iraq, as Congress decides whether to support this historic diplomatic breakthrough or instead blocks it over the objection of the vast majority of the world. Between now and the congressional vote in September, you are going to hear a lot of arguments against this deal, backed by tens of millions of dollars in advertising. And if the rhetoric in these ads&mdash;and the accompanying commentary&mdash;sounds familiar, it should, for many of the same people who argued for the war in Iraq are now making the case against the Iran nuclear deal. <p>Now, when I ran for President 8 years ago as a candidate who had opposed the decision to go to war in Iraq, I said that America didn't just have to end that war, we had to end the mindset that got us there in the first place. It was a mindset characterized by a preference for military action over diplomacy; a mindset that put a premium on unilateral U.S. action over the painstaking work of building international consensus; a mindset that exaggerated threats beyond what the intelligence supported. Leaders did not level with the American people about the costs of war, insisting that we could easily impose our will on a part of the world with a profoundly different culture and history. And of course, those calling for war labeled themselves strong and decisive, while dismissing those who disagreed as weak, even appeasers of a malevolent adversary. <p>More than a decade later, we still live with the consequences of the decision to invade Iraq. Our troops achieved every mission they were given. But thousands of lives were lost, tens of thousands wounded. That doesn't count the lives lost among Iraqis. Nearly a trillion dollars was spent. Today, Iraq remains gripped by sectarian conflict, and the emergence of Al Qaida in Iraq has now evolved into ISIL. And ironically, the single greatest beneficiary in the region of that war was the Islamic Republic of Iran, which saw its strategic position strengthened by the removal of its longstanding enemy, Saddam Hussein. <p>I raise this recent history because now more than ever, we need clear thinking in our foreign policy. And I raise this history because it bears directly on how we respond to the Iranian nuclear program. <p>That program has been around for decades, dating back to the Shah's efforts with U.S. support in the 1960s and seventies to develop nuclear power. The theocracy that overthrew the Shah accelerated the program after the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, a war in which Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons to brutal effect, and Iran's nuclear program advanced steadily through the 1990s, despite unilateral U.S. sanctions. When the Bush administration took office, Iran had no centrifuges&mdash;the machines necessary to produce material for a bomb&mdash;that were spinning to enrich uranium. But despite repeated warnings from the United States Government, by the time I took office, Iran had installed several thousand centrifuges, and showed no inclination to slow, much less halt, its program. <p>Among U.S. policymakers, there's never been disagreement on the danger posed by an Iranian nuclear bomb. Democrats and Republicans alike have recognized that it would spark an arms race in the world's most unstable region and turn every crisis into a potential nuclear showdown. It would embolden terrorist groups like Hizballah and pose an unacceptable risk to Israel, which Iranian leaders have repeatedly threatened to destroy. More broadly, it could unravel the global commitment to nonproliferation that the world has done so much to defend. <p>The question, then, is not whether to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, but how. Even before taking office, I made clear that Iran would not be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon on my watch, and it's been my policy throughout my Presidency to keep all options&mdash;including possible military options&mdash;on the table to achieve that objective. But I have also made clear my preference for a peaceful, diplomatic resolution of the issue, not just because of the costs of war, but also because a negotiated agreement offered a more effective, verifiable, and durable resolution. And so, in 2009, we let the Iranians know that a diplomatic path was available. Iran failed to take that path, and our intelligence community exposed the existence of a covert nuclear facility at Fordow. <p>Now, some have argued that Iran's intransigence showed the futility of negotiations. In fact, it was our very willingness to negotiate that helped America rally the world to our cause and secured international participation in an unprecedented framework of commercial and financial sanctions. Keep in mind, unilateral U.S. sanctions against Iran had been in place for decades, but had failed to pressure Iran to the negotiating table. What made our new approach more effective was our ability to draw upon new U.N. Security Council resolutions, combining strong enforcement with voluntary agreements from nations like China and India, Japan and South Korea, to reduce their purchases of Iranian oil, as well as the imposition by our European allies of a total oil embargo. <p>Winning this global buy-in was not easy. I know. I was there. [<i>Laughter</i>] In some cases, our partners lost billions of dollars in trade because of their decision to cooperate. But we were able to convince them that absent a diplomatic resolution, the result could be war, with major disruptions to the global economy and even greater instability in the Middle East. In other words, it was diplomacy, hard, painstaking diplomacy&mdash;not saber-rattling, not tough talk&mdash;that ratcheted up the pressure on Iran. <p>With the world now unified beside us, Iran's economy contracted severely and remains about 20 percent smaller today than it would have otherwise been. No doubt this hardship played a role in Iran's 2013 elections, when the Iranian people elected a new Government that promised to improve the economy through engagement with the world. A window had cracked open. Iran came back to the nuclear talks. And after a series of negotiations, Iran agreed with the international community to an interim deal, a deal that rolled back Iran's stockpile of near-20-percent-enriched uranium and froze the progress of its program so that the P-5-plus-1&mdash;the United States, China, Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and the European Union&mdash;could negotiate a comprehensive deal without the fear that Iran might be stalling for time. <p>Now, let me pause here just to remind everybody that when the interim deal was announced, critics&mdash;the same critics we're hearing from now&mdash;called it \\"a historic mistake.\\" They insisted Iran would ignore its obligations. They warned that sanctions would unravel. They warned that Iran would receive a windfall to support terrorism. <p>The critics were wrong. The progress of Iran's nuclear program was halted for the first time in a decade. Its stockpile of dangerous materials was reduced. The deployment of its advanced centrifuges was stopped. Inspections did increase. There was no flood of money into Iran, and the architecture of the international sanctions remained in place. In fact, the interim deal worked so well that the same people who criticized it so fiercely now cite it as an excuse not to support the broader accord. Think about that. What was once proclaimed as a historic mistake is now held up as a success and a reason to not sign the comprehensive deal. So keep that in mind when you assess the credibility of the arguments being made against diplomacy today. <p>Despite the criticism, we moved ahead to negotiate a more lasting, comprehensive deal. Our diplomats, led by Secretary of State John Kerry, kept our coalition united. Our nuclear experts&mdash;including one of the best in the world, Secretary of Energy Ernie Moniz&mdash;worked tirelessly on the technical details. In July, we reached a comprehensive plan of action that meets our objectives. Under its terms, Iran is never allowed to build a nuclear weapon. And while Iran, like any party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, is allowed to access peaceful nuclear energy, the agreement strictly defines the manner in which its nuclear program can proceed, ensuring that all pathways to a bomb are cut off. <p>Here's how. Under this deal, Iran cannot acquire the plutonium needed for a bomb. The core of its heavy-water reactor at Arak will be pulled out, filled with concrete, and replaced one&mdash;with one that will not produce plutonium for a weapon. The spent fuel from that reactor will be shipped out of the country, and Iran will not build any new heavy-water reactors for at least 15 years. <p>Iran will also not be able to acquire the enriched uranium that could be used for a bomb. As soon as this deal is implemented, Iran will remove two-thirds of its centrifuges. For the next decade, Iran will not enrich uranium with its more advanced centrifuges. Iran will not enrich uranium at the previously undisclosed Fordow facility, which is buried deep underground, for at least 15 years. Iran will get rid of 98 percent of its stockpile of enriched uranium, which is currently enough for up to 10 nuclear bombs, for the next 15 years. Even after those 15 years have passed, Iran will never have the right to use a peaceful program as cover to pursue a weapon. <p>And in fact, this deal shuts off the type of covert path Iran pursued in the past. There will be 24/7 monitoring of Iran's key nuclear facilities. For decades, inspectors will have access to Iran's entire nuclear supply chain, from the uranium mines and mills where they get raw materials to the centrifuge production facilities where they make machines to enrich it. And understand why this is so important: For Iran to cheat, it has to build a lot more than just one building or a covert facility like Fordow. It would need a secret source for every single aspect of its program. No nation in history has been able to pull off such subterfuge when subjected to such rigorous inspections. And under the terms of the deal, inspectors will have the permanent ability to inspect any suspicious sites in Iran. <p>And finally, Iran has powerful incentives to keep its commitments. Before getting sanctions relief, Iran has to take significant, concrete steps like removing centrifuges and getting rid of its stockpiles. If Iran violates the agreement over the next decade, all of the sanctions can snap back into place. We won't need the support of other members of the U.N. Security Council; America can trigger snapback on our own. On the other hand, if Iran abides by the deal and its economy begins to reintegrate with the world, the incentive to avoid snapback will only grow. <p>So this deal is not just the best choice among alternatives, this is the strongest nonproliferation agreement ever negotiated. And because this is such a strong deal, every nation in the world that has commented publicly, with the exception of the Israeli Government, has expressed support. The United Nations Security Council has unanimously supported it. The majority of arms control and nonproliferation experts support it. Over 100 former Ambassadors&mdash;who served under Republican and Democratic Presidents&mdash;support it. I've had to make a lot of tough calls as President, but whether or not this deal is good for American security is not one of those calls. It's not even close. <p>Unfortunately, we're living through a time in American politics where every foreign policy decision is viewed through a partisan prism, evaluated by headline-grabbing sound bites. And so before the ink was even dry on this deal&mdash;before Congress even read it&mdash;a majority of Republicans declared their virulent opposition. Lobbyists and pundits were suddenly transformed into armchair nuclear scientists&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;disputing the assessments of experts like Secretary Moniz, challenging his findings, offering multiple&mdash;and sometimes contradictory&mdash;arguments about why Congress should reject this deal. But if you repeat these arguments long enough, they can get some traction. So let me address just a few of the arguments that have been made so far in opposition to this deal. <p>First, there are those who say the inspections are not strong enough because inspectors can't go anywhere in Iran at any time with no notice. Well, here's the truth: Inspectors will be allowed daily access to Iran's key nuclear sites. If there is a reason for inspecting a suspicious, undeclared site anywhere in Iran, inspectors will get that access, even if Iran objects. This access can be with as little as 24 hours' notice. And while the process for resolving a dispute about access can take up to 24 days, once we've identified a site that raises suspicion, we will be watching it continuously until inspectors get in. And by the way, nuclear material isn't something you hide in the closet. [<i>Laughter</i>] It can leave a trace for years. The bottom line is, if Iran cheats, we can catch them, and we will. <p>Second, there are those who argue that the deal isn't strong enough because some of the limitations on Iran's civilian nuclear program expire in 15 years. Let me repeat: The prohibition on Iran having a nuclear weapon is permanent. The ban on weapons-related research is permanent. Inspections are permanent. It is true that some of the limitations regarding Iran's peaceful program last only 15 years. But that's how arms control agreements work. The first SALT Treaty with the Soviet Union lasted 5 years. The first START Treaty lasted 15 years. And in our current situation, if 15 or 20 years from now, Iran tries to build a bomb, this deal ensures that the United States will have better tools to detect it, a stronger basis under international law to respond, and the same options available to stop a weapons program as we have today, including, if necessary, military options. <p>On the other hand, without this deal, the scenarios that critics warn about happening in 15 years could happen 6 months from now. By killing this deal, Congress would not merely pave Iran's pathway to a bomb, it would accelerate it. <p>Third, a number of critics say the deal isn't worth it because Iran will get billions of dollars in sanctions relief. Now, let's be clear: The international sanctions were put in place precisely to get Iran to agree to constraints on its program. That's the point of sanctions. Any negotiated agreement with Iran would involve sanctions relief. So an argument against sanctions relief is effectively an argument against any diplomatic resolution of this issue. <p>It is true that if Iran lives up to its commitments, it will gain access to roughly $56 billion of its own money, revenue frozen overseas by other countries. But the notion that this will be a game changer, with all this money funneled into Iran's pernicious activities, misses the reality of Iran's current situation. Partly because of our sanctions, the Iranian Government has over half a trillion dollars in urgent requirements, from funding pensions and salaries to paying for crumbling infrastructure. Iran's leaders have raised the expectations of their people that sanctions relief will improve their lives. Even a repressive regime like Iran's cannot completely ignore those expectations. And that's why our best analysts expect the bulk of this revenue to go into spending that improves the economy and benefits the lives of the Iranian people. <p>Now, this is not to say that sanctions relief will provide no benefit to Iran's military. Let's stipulate that some of that money will flow to activities that we object to. We have no illusions about the Iranian Government or the significance of the Revolutionary Guard and the Quds Force. Iran supports terrorist organizations like Hizballah. It supports proxy groups that threaten our interests and the interests of our allies, including proxy groups who killed our troops in Iraq. They try to destabilize our Gulf partners. But Iran has been engaged in these activities for decades. They engaged in them before sanctions and while sanctions were in place. In fact, Iran even engaged in these activities in the middle of the Iran-Iraq war, a war that cost them nearly a million lives and hundreds of billions of dollars. The truth is that Iran has always found a way to fund these efforts, and whatever benefit Iran may claim from sanctions relief pales in comparison to the danger it could pose with a nuclear weapon. <p>Moreover, there's no scenario where sanctions relief turns Iran into the region's dominant power. Iran's defense budget is eight times smaller than the combined budget of our Gulf allies. Their conventional capabilities will never compare with Israel's, and our commitment to Israel's qualitative military edge helps guarantee that. Over the last several years, Iran has had to spend billions of dollars to support its only ally in the Arab world, Bashar al-Asad, even as he's lost control of huge chunks of his country. And Hizballah has suffered significant blows on this same battlefield. And Iran, like the rest of the region, is being forced to respond to the threat of ISIL in Iraq. <p>So, contrary to the alarmists who claim that Iran is on the brink of taking over the Middle East, or even the world, Iran will remain a regional power with its own set of challenges. The ruling regime is dangerous, and it is repressive. We will continue to have sanctions in place on Iran's support for terrorism and violation of human rights. We will continue to insist upon the release of Americans detained unjustly. We will have a lot of differences with the Iranian regime. <p>But if we're serious about confronting Iran's destabilizing activities, it is hard to imagine a worse approach than blocking this deal. Instead, we need to check the behavior that we're concerned about directly: by helping our allies in the region strengthen their own capabilities to counter a cyber attack or a ballistic missile, by improving the interdiction of weapons shipments that go to groups like Hizballah, by training our allies' special forces so that they can more effectively respond to situations like Yemen. All these capabilities will make a difference. We will be in a stronger position to implement them with this deal. And by the way, such a strategy also helps us effectively confront the immediate and lethal threat posed by ISIL. <p>Now, the final criticism&mdash;this is sort of a catch-all that you may hear&mdash;is the notion that there's a better deal to be had. \\"We should get a better deal.\\" That's repeated over and over again. \\"This a bad deal, need a better deal\\"&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;one that relies on vague promises of toughness and, more recently, the argument that we can apply a broader and indefinite set of sanctions to squeeze the Iranian regime harder. <p>Those making this argument are either ignorant of Iranian society or they're just not being straight with the American people. Sanctions alone are not going to force Iran to completely dismantle all vestiges of its nuclear infrastructure, even those aspects that are consistent with peaceful programs. That oftentimes is what the critics are calling a better deal. Neither the Iranian Government or the Iranian opposition or the Iranian people would agree to what they would view as a total surrender of their sovereignty. <p>Moreover, our closest allies in Europe or in Asia&mdash;much less China or Russia&mdash;certainly are not going to agree to enforce existing sanctions for another 5, 10, 15 years according to the dictates of the U.S. Congress. Because their willingness to support sanctions in the first place was based on Iran ending its pursuit of nuclear weapons. It was not based on the belief that Iran cannot have peaceful nuclear power. And it certainly wasn't based on a desire for regime change in Iran. <p>As a result, those who say we can just walk away from this deal and maintain sanctions are selling a fantasy. Instead of strengthening our position as some have suggested, Congress's rejection would almost certainly result in multilateral sanctions unraveling. If, as has also been suggested, we tried to maintain unilateral sanctions, beefing them up, we would be standing alone. We cannot dictate the foreign, economic, and energy policies of every major power in the world. <p>In order to even try to do that, we would have to sanction, for example, some of the world's largest banks. We'd have to cut off countries like China from the American financial system. And since they happen to be major purchasers of or our debt, such actions could trigger severe disruptions in our own economy and, by the way, raise questions internationally about the dollar's role as the world's reserve currency. <p>That's part of the reason why many of the previous unilateral sanctions were waived. What's more likely to happen, should Congress reject this deal, is that Iran would end up with some form of sanctions relief without having to accept any of the constraints or inspections required by this deal. So, in that sense, the critics are right: Walk away from this agreement and you will get a better deal&mdash;for Iran. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, because more sanctions won't produce the results that the critics want, we have to be honest. Congressional rejection of this deal leaves any U.S. administration that is absolutely committed to preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon with one option: another war in the Middle East. <p>I say this not to be provocative. I am stating a fact. Without this deal, Iran will be in a position, however tough our rhetoric may be, to steadily advance its capabilities. Its breakout time, which is already fairly small, could shrink to near zero. Does anyone really doubt that the same voices now raised against this deal will be demanding that whoever is President bomb those nuclear facilities? <p>And as someone who does firmly believes that Iran must not get a nuclear weapon and who has wrestled with this issue since the beginning of my Presidency, I can tell you that alternatives to military action will have been exhausted once we reject a hard-won diplomatic solution that the world almost unanimously supports. <p>So let's not mince words. The choice we face is ultimately between agreement diplomacy or some form of war, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not 3 months from now, but soon. And here's the irony. As I said before, military action would be far less effective than this deal in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. That's not just my supposition. Every estimate, including those from Israeli analysts, suggest military action would only set back Iran's program by a few years at best, which is a fraction of the limitations imposed by this deal. It would likely guarantee that inspectors are kicked out of Iran. It is probable that it would drive Iran's program deeper underground. It would certainly destroy the international unity that we've spent so many years building. <p>Now, there are some opponents&mdash;I have to give them credit&mdash;there are opponents of this deal who accept the choice of war. In fact, they argue that surgical strikes against Iran's facilities will be quick and painless. But if we've learned anything from the last decade, it's that wars in general and wars in the Middle East in particular are anything but simple. The only certainty in war is human suffering, uncertain costs, unintended consequences. We can also be sure that the Americans who bear the heaviest burden are the less than 1 percent of us, the outstanding men and women who serve in uniform, and not those of us who send them to war. <p>As Commander in Chief, I have not shied from using force when necessary. I have ordered tens of thousands of young Americans into combat. I have sat by their bedside sometimes when they come home. I've ordered military action in seven countries. There are times when force is necessary, and if Iran does not abide by this deal, it's possible that we don't have an alternative. But how can we in good conscience justify war before we've tested a diplomatic agreement that achieves our objectives, that has been agreed to by Iran, that is supported by the rest of the world, and that preserves our options if the deal falls short? How could we justify that to our troops? How could we justify that to the world or to future generations? <p>In the end, that should be a lesson that we've learned from over a decade of war. On the front end, ask tough questions. Subject our own assumptions to evidence and analysis. Resist the conventional wisdom and the drumbeat of war. Worry less about being labeled weak; worry more about getting it right. <p>I recognize that resorting to force may be tempting in the face of the rhetoric and behavior that emanates from parts of Iran. It is offensive. It is incendiary. We do take it seriously. But superpowers should not act impulsively in response to taunts or even provocations that can be addressed short of war. Just because Iranian hardliners chant \\"Death to America\\" does not mean that that's what all Iranians believe. <p>In fact, it's those hardliners who are most comfortable with the status quo. It's those hardliners chanting \\"Death to America\\" who have been most opposed to the deal. They're making common cause with the Republican caucus. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>The majority of the Iranian people have powerful incentives to urge their Government to move in a different, less provocative direction, incentives that are strengthened by this deal. We should offer them that chance. We should give them that opportunity. It's not guaranteed to succeed. But if they take it, that would be good for Iran, it would be good for the United States, it would be good for a region that has known too much conflict&mdash;it would be good for the world. <p>And if Iran does not move in that direction, if Iran violates this deal, we will have ample ability to respond. The agreements pursued by Kennedy and Reagan with the Soviet Union, those agreements, those treaties involved America accepting significant constraints on our arsenal. As such, they were riskier. This agreement involves no such constraints. The defense budget of the United States is more than $600 billion. To repeat, Iran's is about $15 billion. Our military remains the ultimate backstop to any security agreement that we make. I have stated that Iran will never be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon. I have done what is necessary to make sure our military options are real. And I have no doubt that any President who follows me will take the same position. <p>So let me sum up here. When we carefully examine the arguments against this deal, none of them stand up to scrutiny. That may be why the rhetoric on the other side is so strident. I suppose some of it can be ascribed to knee-jerk partisanship that has become all too familiar, rhetoric that renders every decision that's made a disaster, a surrender&mdash;\\"you're aiding terrorists; you're engendering&mdash;endangering freedom.\\" <p>On the other hand, I do think it's important to acknowledge another, more understandable motivation behind the opposition to this deal or at least skepticism to this deal, and that is, a sincere affinity for our friend and ally Israel, an affinity that, as someone who has been a stalwart friend to Israel throughout my career, I deeply share. <p>When the Israeli Government is opposed to something, people in the United States take notice. And they should. No one can blame Israelis for having a deep skepticism about any dealings with a government like Iran's, which includes leaders who have denied the Holocaust, embrace an ideology of anti-Semitism, facilitate the flow of rockets that are arrayed on Israelis&mdash;Israel's borders, are pointed at Tel Aviv. In such a dangerous neighborhood, Israel has to be vigilant, and it rightly insists that it cannot depend on any other country&mdash;even its great friend the United States&mdash;for its own security. So we have to take seriously concerns in Israel. <p>But the fact is, partly due to American military and intelligence assistance, which my administration has provided at unprecedented levels, Israel can defend itself against any conventional danger, whether from Iran directly or from its proxies. On the other hand, a nuclear-armed Iran changes that equation. <p>And that's why this deal ultimately must be judged by what it achieves on the central goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. This deal does exactly that. I say this as someone who has done more than any other President to strengthen Israel's security. And I have made clear to the Israeli Government that we are prepared to discuss how we can deepen that cooperation even further. Already, we've held talks with Israel on concluding another 10-year plan for U.S. security assistance to Israel. We can enhance support for areas like missile defense, information sharing, interdiction, all to help meet Israel's pressing security needs and to provide a hedge against any additional activities that Iran may engage in as a consequence of sanctions relief. <p>But I have also listened to the Israeli security establishment, which warned of the danger posed by a nuclear-armed Iran for decades. In fact, they helped develop many of the ideas that ultimately led to this deal. So to friends of Israel and to the Israeli people I say this: A nuclear-armed Iran is far more dangerous to Israel, to America, and to the world than an Iran that benefits from sanctions relief. <p>I recognize that Prime Minister Netanyahu disagrees, disagrees strongly. I do not doubt his sincerity. But I believe he is wrong. I believe the facts support this deal. I believe they are in America's interest and Israel's interest. And as President of the United States, it would be an abrogation of my constitutional duty to act against my best judgment simply because it causes temporary friction with a dear friend and ally. I do not believe that would be the right thing to do for the United States. I do not believe it would be the right thing to do for Israel. <p>Over the last couple weeks, I have repeatedly challenged anyone opposed to this deal to put forward a better, plausible alternative. I have yet to hear one. What I've heard instead are the same types of arguments that we heard in the runup to the Iraq war: Iran cannot be dealt with diplomatically; we can take military strikes without significant consequences; we shouldn't worry about what the rest of the world thinks, because once we act, everyone will fall in line; tougher talk, more military threats will force Iran into submission; we can get a better deal. <p>I know it's easy to play on people's fears, to magnify threats, to compare any attempt at diplomacy to Munich. But none of these arguments hold up. They didn't back in 2002 and 2003; they shouldn't now. The same mindset, in many cases offered by the same people who seem to have no compunction with being repeatedly wrong&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;led to a war that did more to strengthen Iran, more to isolate the United States than anything we have done in the decades before or since. It's a mindset out of step with the traditions of American foreign policy, where we exhaust diplomacy before war and debate matters of war and peace in the cold light of truth. \\"Peace is not the absence of conflict,\\" President Reagan once said. It is \\"the ability to cope with conflict by peaceful means.\\" President Kennedy warned Americans \\"not to see conflict as inevitable, accommodation as impossible, and communication as nothing more than the exchange of threats.\\" It is time to apply such wisdom. The deal before us doesn't bet on Iran changing; it doesn't require trust. It verifies and requires Iran to forsake a nuclear weapon just as we struck agreements with the Soviet Union at a time when they were threatening our allies, arming proxies against us, proclaiming their commitment to destroy our way of life, and had nuclear weapons pointed at all of our major cities&mdash;a genuine existential threat. <p>We live in a complicated world, a world in which the forces unleashed by human innovation are creating opportunities for our children that were unimaginable for most of human history. It is also a world of persistent threats, a world in which mass violence and cruelty is all too common and human innovation risks the destruction of all that we hold dear. In this world, the United States of America remains the most powerful nation on Earth, and I believe that we will remain such for decades to come. But we are one nation among many. <p>And what separates us from the empires of old, what has made us exceptional, is not the mere fact of our military might. Since World War II, the deadliest war in human history, we have used our power to try to bind nations together in a system of international law. We have led an evolution of those human institutions President Kennedy spoke about: to prevent the spread of deadly weapons, to uphold peace and security, and promote human progress. <p>We now have the opportunity to build on that progress. We've built a coalition and held it together through sanctions and negotiations, and now we have before us a solution that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon without resorting to war. As Americans, we should be proud of this achievement. And as Members of Congress reflect on their pending decision, I urge them to set aside political concerns, shut out the noise, consider the stakes involved with the vote that you will cast. <p>If Congress kills this deal, we will lose more than just constraints on Iran's nuclear program or the sanctions we have painstakingly built. We will have lost something more precious: America's credibility as a leader of diplomacy, America's credibility as the anchor of the international system. <p>John F. Kennedy cautioned here, more than 50 years ago, at this university, that \\"the pursuit of peace is not as dramatic as the pursuit of war.\\" But it's so very important. It is surely the pursuit of peace that is most needed in this world so full of strife. <p>My fellow Americans, contact your representatives in Congress. Remind them of who we are. Remind them of what is best in us and what we stand for so that we can leave behind a world that is more secure and more peaceful for our children. <p>Thank you very much. Thank you. \" "
"182" "\"Thank you so much. Everybody, have a seat. Thank you. <p>First of all, I love John Lewis. And I don't know where he gets the energy&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;where he gets the drive, what stores of passion he's still able to muster after fighting the good fight for so long. I do know that many of us would not be here in this auditorium today had it not been for the heroism and dedication of Congressman John Lewis. So I'm so appreciative of him. <p>I'm proud to be joined by our Attorney General. Loretta Lynch has already shown herself to be a champion on behalf of not just the powerful, but the powerless, and is every single day, along with her team, fighting to make sure that we are all equal in the eyes of the law and that everybody is getting a fair shot. And so we are very grateful for her presence here today. <p>And I want to thank all of our partners, all the organizations, all the leadership from around the country that is represented in this auditorium, but also are listening over this live feed as we reaffirm our commitment to one of the most fundamental, sacred rights of any democracy, and that is the right to vote. <p>As John indicated, 50 years ago today, President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law to protect this precious right. It broke down legal barriers at the State level and at the local level that were keeping African Americans from exercising their constitutional right to vote. And all of us have a great debt to not just John Lewis, but the thousands&mdash;many of them unnamed&mdash;who were courageous enough to walk up and try to register time and time again, that were threatened because of their efforts to register: sharecroppers and maids and ordinary folks. Had it not been for them awakening the conscience of a nation, the President could not have mustered the political support that was required to ultimately get this seminal law passed. <p>We had the opportunity to honor some of the sacrifices that were made earlier this year in Selma, along with a hundred Members of Congress, Democratic and Republican Members. It was heartening to see the bipartisan attendance. It signified that in the abstract, at least, everybody today believes in the right to vote. [<i>Laughter</i>] Conceptually, everybody is in favor of the right to vote. [<i>Laughter</i>] You will not hear anybody defend the notion that the law can discriminate against persons because of their color or their faith or their ethnicity when it comes to going to cast a ballot. That's huge progress, a normative shift in how we think about our democracy. Everybody in theory is supposed to be included. <p>But part of the reason we're here today, part of the reason it's so important for us to focus attention on this right, is because in practice, we've still got problems. <p>On the ground, there are still too many ways in which people are discouraged from voting. Some of the protections that had been enshrined in the Voting Rights Act itself have been weakened as a consequence of court decisions and interpretations of the law. State legislatures have instituted procedures and practices that, although on the surface may appear neutral, have the effect of discouraging people from voting, may have a disproportional effect on certain kinds of folks voting. And if in fact those practices, those trends, those tendencies are allowed to continue unanswered, then over time, the hard-won battles of 50 years ago erode, and our democracy erodes. And that means that the decisions that are made in the corridors of power all across this country begin to reflect the interests of the few, instead of the interests of the many. <p>So we've got serious business to attend to here. One order of business is for our Congress to pass an updated version of the Voting Rights Act that would correct some of the problems that have arisen. And I said when I was in Selma that we're glad you're here, Members of Congress&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but we'll be even more glad, we'll be in an even more celebratory mood, if you go back to Washington and reaffirm America's commitment to what was fought for here at this bridge. <p>Now, so far, that hasn't happened. John Lewis is ready to do it. There's legislation pending. There are people of good will on both sides of the aisle who are prepared to move it. But it keeps on slipping as a priority. Part of the reason we're here is to reaffirm to Members of Congress, this has to be a priority. If this isn't working, then nothing is working. We've got to get it done. <p>At the State levels, we've got some outstanding members of State legislatures&mdash;California, Florida&mdash;who have been championing mechanisms to get more people voting: Early voting, online registration. But sadly, too many States are making it harder for folks to vote, instituting photo ID laws that on the surface sound good. If you poll the average American, they'll say, yes, well, you should have to show your photo ID. But in practice, it turns out that for seniors and for poorer folks, that's not always easy to do. And by the way, it doesn't actually address a real problem&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;because there are almost no instances of people going to vote in somebody else's name. It's just not a&mdash;it turns out, it's just not a common crime. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Folks might think about shoplifting. Attorney General, you know more about the crime statistics than I do, but I am certain, because we've actually looked at the data on this, that almost nobody wakes up saying, I'm going to go vote in somebody else's name. [<i>Laughter</i>] Doesn't happen. So the only reason to pass this law, despite the reasonableness of how it sounds, is to make it harder for folks to vote. <p>You've got State legislatures that are rolling back early voting. I don't understand why anybody would be opposed to spreading out voting so that people can arrange to vote depending on their schedule. Because it's hard: If you are working the midnight shift and have got to get your kid to school and had to travel by bus and you're a single mom, it may be difficult for you to be able to vote precisely in that window that's provided. And there's no evidence that, as a consequence of early voting, that has increased fraud; that people somehow have become less committed to democracy; that they don't feel that same sense of civic pride as they do if there's just 1 day of voting. There's no evidence of that. The reason to roll back early voting is because you want to make it harder for folks to vote. <p>So, in theory, everybody is in favor of the right to vote. In practice, we have State legislatures that are deliberately trying to make it harder for people to vote. <p>And some of them, frankly, are not that shy about saying so. [<i>Laughter</i>] Think about that. Think about that. How can you rationalize making it harder for people to vote? How can you rationalize penalizing people because they don't have a lot of money not being able to vote? That's contrary to who we are. That's not what we believe. That's not what John Lewis fought for. In the United States of America, we should have no patience and no tolerance for laws that aim at disenfranchising our fellow citizens. So we've got to keep pushing. At the Federal level, we need a new Voting Rights Act passed. At the State and local levels, we've got to fight back against efforts to make it harder to vote, and we've got to embrace those legislators that are prepared to make it easier to vote. <p>But there's one last aspect to this, and that is the job of citizens in actually exercising the franchise. This isn't always a popular thing to say in front of progressive groups. Everybody is fired up and rightly so. But the reason that the voting rate in the last midterm election was 30-something percent is not attributable to a photo ID law. The fact of the matter is that far more people disenfranchise themselves than any law does by not participating, by not getting involved. <p>So yes, we have to be vigilant in pushing back against laws that seek to disenfranchise people. Yes, we should be fighting back against laws, for example, that say ex-felons, no matter how long they've been living a correct life, no matter how well they've paid their dues, that they can never vote again in that State. There are all kinds of battles we have to fight. But we miss the forest for the trees if we don't also recognize that huge chunks of us, citizens, just give away our power. We'd rather complain than do something about it. We won't vote, and then we'll talk about the terrible political process that isn't doing anything. <p>And I like barber shop talk. [<i>Laughter</i>] I like grumbling and complaining. I can't always do it in public. [<i>Laughter</i>] But what I know is, it doesn't get anything accomplished. So the groups that are here today, one of the things that we're looking forward to is how do we mobilize, how do we galvanize, how do we get people focused not only on laws, but also on our habits, our habits of citizenship? How do we instill in people a sense of why this is so critically important? <p>And that is why we are proclaiming September 22 National Voter Registration Day. September 22. And we're going to have groups fanning out all across the country. And on September 22, we're going to try to get everybody to register to vote. We probably won't get everybody&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but we're going to try. <p>I want to thank so many of you who are involved in this&mdash;including the NAACP, which started their Journey to Justice, a march from Selma to Washington, earlier this week&mdash;because you're shining a light on this issue. And I want to make sure that we are fully mobilized across the country on September 22. <p>Bottom line is, everybody here has a part to play. Members of Congress need to do the right thing. State legislators and Governors, they need to do the right thing. Businesses, make it easier for your employees to vote. Do the right thing. Universities, other civic institutions: Help register people to vote, provide civic education. Do the right thing. <p>Most of all, citizens, seize the power that you have. Make this democracy work. Do not succumb to cynicism. Heroic things happen when people get involved. Heroic things happen when a young man without any official title joins up with a bunch of other young and not-so-young people of every color and every persuasion and are willing to march across a bridge. That's the power that is in all of us. We've got to take advantage of it. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.\" "
"183" "\"Well, first of all, over the last 6 years, the American people have worked really hard to bounce back from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. We got jobs numbers today, showing that America had created another 210,000 new jobs. That makes 65 consecutive months of private sector job growth. This is the strongest 2-year run of private sector job growth that we've seen in the last 15 years. And it is a testament, I think, to the incredible ingenuity and resilience and hard work of the American people. <p>So even as we continue to focus on rebuilding our economy, providing more opportunity, one of the things that we've also been trying to focus on is leaving a legacy for the next generation in preserving this incredible beauty, the God-given blessings, that we've received, those of us who have lived here in the United States of America. <p>I think everybody here knows that one of the prettiest States that we have, with some of the greatest national treasures, is the great State of Idaho. I am very proud to be able to sign this piece of legislation, enacted by the House of Representatives, entitled the Sawtooth National Recreation Area and the Jerry Peak Wilderness Additions Act. And what this does is, it designates three additional wilderness designations in the great State of Idaho. <p>This is a remarkable area. It is used by fishermen, hunters, rafters, people taking hikes. It is not only beautiful, but it's also an important economic engine for the State, attracting tourism and creating jobs. And thanks to the work of a broad-based coalition of folks in Idaho, but spearheaded here in Congress by Congressman Mike Simpson&mdash;who was able to receive not a single \\"no\\" vote&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;which does not happen often in the House of Representatives&mdash;something that folks have been working on for quite some time is going to be reality. <p>And so we want to congratulate all of them. We want to urge the American people to visit these new, incredible wilderness areas and recognize that not only will this give opportunities to people in Idaho, but it's going to be there for future generations as well. <p>One last point I want to make: We want to be thinking during the course of this summer about the firefighters who are taking on some really tough fires all across the Western States. As I've noted before, we've seen a consistent escalation of the severity and the length of wildfire season. And a lot of that is attributable to the fact that climate change is going to be raising temperatures and creating less water, more vulnerability for a lot of forests out there. <p>One of the things we're trying to work on with Congress is making sure that we are able to properly fund firefighting efforts, but also that we're engaged in the kind of conservation planning to ensure that we're preventing fires from happening in the first place. <p>And so that's a project that, at least in the Western States, you get a lot of bipartisan support for. And hopefully, we'll be able to get that same kind of support here in Washington. <p>So, again, congratulations to all of you. Mike, congratulations for the great work you've done. <p>I will now sign this designation. [<i>At this point, the President signed the bill.</i>] <p>I'm getting a lot of practice doing this, but I want even more. [<i>Laughter</i>] There you go. Good job.\" "
"184" "\"Hi, everybody. The right to vote is one of the most fundamental rights of any democracy. Yet for too long, too many of our fellow citizens were denied that right, simply because of the color of their skin. <p>Fifty years ago this week, President Lyndon Johnson signed a law to change that. The Voting Rights Act broke down legal barriers that stood between millions of African Americans and their constitutional right to cast a ballot. It was and still is one of the greatest victories in our country's struggle for civil rights. <p>But it didn't happen overnight. Countless men and women marched and organized, sat in and stood up, for our most basic rights. For this they were called agitators and un-American; they were jailed, and they were beaten. Some were even killed. But in the end, they reaffirmed the idea at the very heart of America: that people who love this country can change it. <p>Our country is a better place because of all those heroes did for us. But as one of those heroes, Congressman John Lewis, reminded us in Selma this past March, \\"There is still work to be done.\\" Fifty years after the Voting Rights Act, there are still too many barriers to vote and too many people trying to erect new ones. We've seen laws that roll back early voting, force people to jump through hoops to cast a ballot, or lead to legitimate voters being improperly purged from the rolls. Over the years, we've seen provisions specifically designed to make it harder for some of our fellow citizens to vote. In a democracy like ours, with a history like ours, that's a disgrace. <p>That's why, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, I'm calling on Congress to pass new legislation to make sure every American has equal access to the polls. It's why I support the organizers getting folks registered in their communities. And it's why, no matter what party you support, my message to every American is simple: Get out there and vote, not just every 4 years, but every chance you get. Because your elected officials will only heed your voice if you make your voice heard. <p>The promise that all of us are created equal is written into our founding documents, but it's up to us to make that promise real. Together, let's do what Americans have always done: Let's keep marching forward, keep perfecting our Union, and keep building a better country for our kids. <p>Thanks, everybody. Have a great weekend.\" "
"185" "\"Hi, everybody. It's now been a year since the tragic death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. His death&mdash;along with the events in Cleveland, Staten Island, Baltimore, Cincinnati, and other communities&mdash;sparked protests and soul searching all across our country. Over the past year, we've come to see, more clearly than ever, the frustration in many communities of color and the feeling that our laws can be applied unevenly. <p>After Ferguson, I said that we have to face these issues squarely. I convened a Task Force on community policing to find commonsense steps that can help us drive down crime and build up trust and cooperation between communities and police, who put their lives on the line every single day to help keep us safe. And I've met personally with rank and file officers to hear their ideas. <p>In May, this Task Force made up of police officers, activists, and academics proposed 59 recommendations: everything from how we can make better use of data and technology, to how we train police officers, to how law enforcement engages with our schools. And we've been working with communities across America to put these ideas into action. <p>Dozens of police departments are now sharing more data with the public, including on citations, stops and searches, and shootings involving law enforcement. We've brought together leaders from across the country to explore alternatives to incarceration. The Justice Department has begun pilot programs to help police use body cameras and collect data on the use of force. This fall, the Department will award more than $160 million in grants to support law enforcement and community organizations that are working to improve policing. And all across the country&mdash;from States like Illinois and Ohio, to cities like Philadelphia, Boston, and Nashville&mdash;local leaders are working to implement the Task Force recommendations in a way that works for their communities. <p>So we've made progress. And we'll keep at it. But let's be clear: The issues raised over the past year aren't new, and they won't be solved by policing alone. We simply can't ask our police to contain and control issues that the rest of us aren't willing to address as a society. That starts with reforming a criminal justice system that too often is a pipeline from inadequate schools to overcrowded jails, wreaking havoc on communities and families all across the country. So we need Congress to reform our Federal sentencing laws for nonviolent drug offenders. We need to keep working to help more prisoners take steps to turn their lives around so they can contribute to their communities after they've served their time. <p>More broadly, we need to truly invest in our children and our communities so that more young people see a better path for their lives. That means investing in early childhood education, job training, pathways to college. It means dealing honestly with issues of race, poverty, and class that leave too many communities feeling isolated and segregated from greater opportunity. It means expanding that opportunity to every American willing to work for it, no matter what ZIP Code they were born into. <p>Because, in the end, that's always been the promise of America. And that's what I'll keep working for every single day that I'm President. Thanks, everybody, and have a great weekend.\" "
"186" "\"Hi, everybody. Seven years after the worst economic crisis in generations, our economy continues to grow and create jobs. In fact, our businesses have created 13 million new jobs over the past 5&frac12; years. <p>But if we want to keep this momentum going, to make sure that working families feel like their hard work is being rewarded with a basic sense of security, then we all need to do our part. <p>That's why my administration has been partnering with States and cities to help grow the middle class. Over the past few years, nearly 20 cities and counties have implemented paid sick days. Six states have enacted paid sick days or paid family leave. Seventeen States, and more than two dozen cities and counties, have raised their minimum wage. All of this will help working families. And across the country, folks are proving that preparing all our kids for the future doesn't have to be a partisan issue. Seattle, a city with a Democratic mayor, just passed universal pre-K, while Indianapolis, a city with a Republican mayor, is starting citywide preschool scholarships. All told, 34 States have increased funding for preschool, and that's good for all of us. <p>Now we need Congress to do its part to boost the economy as well. Unfortunately, Congress left town for 5 full weeks, and they left behind a stack of unfinished business. For the first time ever, Congress failed to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. That left thousands of business owners and their employees at a serious disadvantage compared to their competitors overseas. That's not good for jobs. It's not good for our economy. When it returns from recess, reauthorizing the Bank ought to be a top agenda for Members of Congress. <p>Congress also hasn't passed a budget, and when they return from vacation, they'll only have a few weeks to do so or shut down the Government for the second time in 2 years. They've had all year to do this. Months ago, I put forward a detailed plan to strengthen our economy and our national security in a fiscally responsible way. And for months, I've said I will veto any budget that locks in the sequester, those senseless cuts to domestic and national security priorities. Remember, we can't cut our way to prosperity. We should be investing in things that help our economy grow today and tomorrow, like education or infrastructure or scientific research. <p>Democrats in Congress have made it clear they're ready to sit down and work with Republicans to find common ground on this. After all, Americans expect Congress to help keep our country strong and growing, not threaten to shut down our Government. When Congress gets back, they should prevent a shutdown, pass a responsible budget, and prove that this is a country that looks forward, a country that invests in our future and keeps our economy growing for all Americans. <p>Thanks, everybody, and have a great weekend.\" "
"187" "\"Thank you, everybody. Please, please, have a seat. We're all about saving energy here. [<i>Laughter</i>] Sit down. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Hello, Las Vegas! It's good to be back on the road after spending a little downtime with my family, recharging my own batteries, so to speak. And it is great to join you at this Clean Energy Summit to see the work that you're all doing on what I consider to be one of the most important issues not just of our time, but of any time. <p>I want to thank Mandalay Bay, MGM's chairman, Jim Murren, for hosting us today. I want to thank my dear friend, your outstanding Senator, Harry Reid, for holding this summit and for keeping us focused on this challenge. I want to thank him, by the way, for his strong statement over the weekend in support of a deal that is going to make sure that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon, which is a top priority of my administration. And Harry's leadership matters. It sends a message that Congress should support this historic diplomatic breakthrough, and not block it over the objections of most of the world. It reflects the best of American foreign policy. We don't rely on bluster or bravado; we focus on strong, principled diplomacy that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon&mdash;and showing once again to the entire world what American leadership really means. <p>Now, we're here today because we believe that no challenge poses a greater threat to our future than climate change. It's something that I've spoken at length about a few weeks ago; it's something that I'll speak about at length next week when I travel throughout Alaska. <p>But we're also here because we hold another belief, and that is, we are deeply optimistic about American ingenuity. We think we can do good and do well at the same time. We believe we have the power, the dynamism, the creativity to solve a big problem while keeping the engines of the American economy moving. <p>Six and a half years ago, I took office after decades in which our addiction to fossil fuels and foreign oil perennially threatened our planet and our national security. And together, we've begun to change that, a lot of people in this room working with us. Yes, we've become the world's number-one producer of oil and natural gas, but we've also become a major player in clean energy. And these advances have helped to grow our economy and created a steady stream of well-paying jobs. They've also helped us reduce the dangerous emissions that contribute to climate change. And we've done it in three big ways. <p>First of all, we're wasting less energy. We've set new fuel economy standards on cars and trucks, new efficiency standards on appliances like refrigerators and dishwashers, and these advances are already saving folks money at the pump. It's saving money on their electricity bills. And steps like these also mean that factories and businesses aren't just paying for energy, they're getting paid not to waste energy. The economy as a whole is producing a lot more using less energy. And we're also using less dirty energy. <p>Earlier this month, I unveiled our Clean Power Plan, the first set of nationwide standards to end the limitless dumping of carbon pollution from our power plants, the single most important step America has ever taken to combat climate change. Now, the Clean Power Plan is also going to accelerate the third way that we're cutting emissions, creating jobs, saving folks money, and that's by generating more clean energy. <p>When I took office, I pledged to double our production of wind and solar by the end of my first term. We've met that goal ahead of schedule. As Harry just mentioned, 6 years ago, the Recovery Act marked the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history. And by the way, what we did was not revolutionary. We did what the Federal Government has always done: We invested in promising new technologies to spur private sector investment and innovation all across the country. <p>Today, there are thousands of renewable energy projects employing tens of thousands of Americans all across the country. Right here in Nevada, for example, renewable energy generation has increased 180 percent since I took office. Today, America is number one in wind power, generating three times as much wind energy as we did in 2008. There are now more than 500 wind manufacturers across 43 States supplying the wind industry, an industry that supports more than 50,000 jobs and supplies enough energy to power 16 million homes. <p>Some States have made even greater strides. Last year, for example, Iowa generated nearly 30 percent of its electricity from the wind. And if we keep investing in wind, rather than making shortsighted cuts or chasing mindless austerity, wind could provide as much as 35 percent of America's electricity and supply renewable power in all 50 States by the year 2050. <p>As well as we're doing in wind, we're making even more progress on solar. I notice you've got a lot of sun around here. [<i>Laughter</i>] America generates 20 times as much solar power as we did in 2008&mdash;20 times. Last year was solar's biggest year ever. Prices fell by 10 percent; installations climbed by 30 percent. Every 3 minutes, another home or business in America goes solar. Every 3 weeks, we installed as much solar capacity as we did in all of 2008. And the world's largest solar installation came online last year, with 9 million solar panels generating enough electricity to power more than a hundred thousand homes with clean, renewable energy, not in Germany, not in China, not in Saudi Arabia, right here in the United States of America. <p>In fact, over the past 6 years, the Federal Government has approved 34 commercial-scale solar projects and the transmission infrastructure that goes with them on public lands across the West. We approved one new project just today in California that will ultimately power another 100,000-plus homes. And right here in Las Vegas, we've cut the time it takes to permit solar projects in half. <p>And one of the reasons we've done this is not just because it's good for the environment and good for the overall economy; it takes workers to install all this new capacity. And that's why, last year, the solar industry added jobs 10 times faster than the rest of the economy. Solar has helped a lot of construction workers find work while Congress was dragging its feet on funding infrastructure projects. In fact, the solar industry now employs twice as many Americans as mining coal. We're helping more veterans find work with our Solar Ready Vets program, with a goal of training 75,000 solar workers who have been veterans by 2020. That is a goal we can achieve. <p>So Federal investments have helped support all this innovation, and now is not the time to pull back on those investments. Now is not the time to insist on massive cuts to the investments in R&D that help drive our economy, including the hundreds of millions of dollars in cuts that many Republicans want to take from these successful, job-creating clean energy programs. It's thanks in part to these investments that there are already places across the country where clean power from the Sun is finally cheaper than conventional power from your utility, power often generated by burning coal or gas. <p>And it's impossible to overstate what this means. For decades, we've been told that it doesn't make economic sense to switch to renewable energy. Today, that's no longer true. And you don't have to take my word for it. Many of our biggest businesses are backing up that fact. Walmart has the most installed onsite solar capacity of any company in America. They're not in the business of giving away money. [<i>Laughter</i>] Google is the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world, companies like Apple and Costco close behind. They're not doing this just out of altruism. They're doing it because it means big cost savings. And that can mean big things for local communities. <p>I'll just give you one example. Google plans to retrofit the site of a retired coal plant in Alabama into a data hub run entirely on renewable energy. Recently, they created a new online tool that lets you plug in your address to see if solar power is the smart choice for you. <p>So if you care about climate change, the very fact that companies realize clean energy and energy efficiency are not only cost-effective, but cost-saving, should give you a big jolt of hope. <p>The point is, America is making incredible progress on this issue. And that's one of the reasons why I recently committed this country to getting 20 percent of our energy from renewables beyond hydroelectric power by 2030. And by the way, when we do smart things in America, that wakes up the world. So Brazil's President joined me for that announcement, committed her country to the same goal. But to meet that goal, we have to triple where we are today. So I'm here to give you hope, but not complacency. <p>The private sector is increasingly all in. Cities and States are increasingly doing their part. Just today 15 cities, from Seattle to Chicago to New York, are joining 19 cities that have already pledged to reduce emissions and invest in climate resilience. Leaders in California are aiming to generate 50 percent of their electricity from renewables by 2030&mdash;50 percent&mdash;while cutting carbon pollution from oil by 50 percent. <p>And as long as I'm President, the Federal Government is going to do its part beyond the investments that we've already made to promote this issue. So last month, we announced a new initiative to make it easier for businesses and low-income households to install low-cost solar. Today we're announcing new public and private sector commitments that will add new solar capacity on more than 40 military bases. And that's an investment that will create jobs, save taxpayer dollars, and reduce emissions. <p>The Department of Energy is announcing a new push to deploy innovative distributed energy resources like microgrids or rooftop solar with battery storage and will offer loan guarantees for projects like these. And we're going to make it even easier for individual homeowners to put solar panels on their roof with no upfront cost. So specifically, we're going to take steps to expand the use of a tool we call PACE, which helps you pay for solar panels through the future savings on your energy bills. <p>So we're taking steps that allow more Americans to join this revolution with no money down. You don't have to share my passion for fighting climate change. A lot of Americans are going solar and becoming more energy efficient not because they're tree huggers, although, trees are important&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;just want you to know&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but because they're cost cutters. They like saving money. And I'm all for consumers saving money, because that means they can spend it on other stuff. Solar isn't just for the green crowd anymore, it's for the green eyeshade crowd too. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, we've still got a lot of work to do, and significant obstacles remain. And obviously, all of you know that very well. For all the promise of solar, it's still a small share of our economy mix&mdash;energy mix, less than 1 percent. Wind makes up almost 5 percent. But here's the thing: Solar made up almost one-third of all new generating capacity last year. Wind power made up another 20 percent. So we see the trend lines. We see where technology is taking us. We see where consumers want to go. And that, let's be honest, has some big fossil fuel interests pretty nervous, to the point where they're trying to fight renewable energy. <p>Now, it's one thing if you're consistent in being free market. It's another thing when you're free market until it's solar that's working and people want to buy, and suddenly, you're not for it anymore. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's a problem. <p>There's a big shift going underway that goes beyond simply putting solar panels on your home. Yes, the number of homes with rooftop solar has grown from fewer than 20,000 to about 600,000 over the past decade or so. More than 80 percent of that capacity was added in the past 4 years. But the real revolution going on here is that people are beginning to realize, they can take more control over their own energy: what they use, how much, when. <p>For decades, our energy system basically worked one way. Utilities generated power, usually by burning fossil fuels. They ran lines into the home or business. We paid for it. It wasn't a real exciting business; there wasn't a lot of innovation. We didn't think about it much in our daily lives, until the energy bill came in the mail. And the economy grew under that model, at a time when we were less worried about dependence on foreign fuels and at a time when we were less conscious about the impacts it was having on the environment. <p>But in just a few short years, that's begun to change in a profound way. Six years ago, smart meters were pretty rare. Today, 60 million consumers have access to detailed information about how much energy we use, how we use it, when we use it. So we can use that information to change our habits, use energy more efficiently, save more money without a whole lot of sacrifice. We can control our thermostats from our smartphones. New appliances and smart devices can tell when energy prices are cheapest and do laundry or wash the dishes or charge our car at those times. <p>We've got windows and building materials that can actually generate power. And we can even tell our utility company that we want our homes powered by renewable energy, or we can call up a contractor and put solar panels on our roof by the weekend, and that empowers us not only to generate affordable clean energy, but to store it in battery packs or sell it back to the grid. <p>And that's power. That's the future. That's happening right now. It's an American energy revolution that's like evolving from the telegraph to the smartphone in less than a decade. It's happening fast. <p>Now, the good news is, some utilities recognize this; they see what's happening. They're adapting their business model to seize the opportunities of this emerging energy reality. And we have to lift up some of those success stories and the innovations that are taking place. <p>So San Antonio's municipal utility is standing up its own rooftop solar program. Southern Company is partnering with Nest and Tesla on power storage so we can use renewable energy better. Oklahoma Gas and Electric is empowering its customers to enroll in smart metering that uses electricity when it's cheaper, not when it's most expensive. But while change this fast presents new opportunities, it is invariably going to create resistance from some fossil fuel interests who want to protect the old, outdated status quo. And there are some legitimate issues around how does a new distributed system work and folks have sunk costs and how do we deal with those things, and those are important for us to address. But when you start seeing massive lobbying efforts backed by fossil fuel interests or conservative think tanks or the Koch brothers pushing for new laws to roll back renewable energy standards or prevent new clean energy businesses from succeeding, that's a problem. That's not the American way. That's not progress. That's not innovation. That's rent-seeking and trying to protect old ways of doing business and standing in the way of the future. <p>I mean, think about this. Ordinarily, these are groups that tout themselves as champions of the free market. If you start talking to them about providing health care for folks who don't have health insurance, they're going crazy: This is socialism; this is going to destroy America. But in this situation, they're trying to undermine competition in the marketplace and choke off consumer choice and threaten an industry that's churning out new jobs at a fast pace. And that has the potential to hurt a lot of communities and set back America's leadership in fighting climate change. They're even fighting to protect billions of dollars of taxpayer dollars in corporate welfare each year that's going to fossil fuel companies. <p>Now, what's interesting is that their actions have conjured up some pretty strange bedfellows. In some States, we've got Green Party and Tea Party teaming up to protect our freedom to choose clean energy. It is rare that the Tea Party leaders and I are on the same side of an issue. [<i>Laughter</i>] I agree with them here. And just because I agree with them, I don't want them to change their minds now. [<i>Laughter</i>] I promise, there are all kinds of other things you can whoop me. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But this is important, and they are absolutely right on this fight. This is not, and should not be, a Republican versus Democratic issue. This should be an issue that can bring everybody together. If you're a progressive, you should care about this. If you're a libertarian, you should care about this. If you just want to save some money, you should care about it. And if you care about the future of our children and grandchildren, you should care about it. <p>So here and across the country, this is about whether big polluters control the system, or whether consumers have freedom to choose cleaner, cheaper, more efficient energy; whether we protect old ways of doing business even when they're not efficient, or we dream up new business models that bring new technologies into our homes and businesses and new jobs into our communities. This is about the past versus the future. And America believes in the future. <p>And to make that future a reality, we've got to have everybody&mdash;utilities, entrepreneurs, workers, businesses, consumers, energy regulators, tree huggers, Tea Partiers&mdash;everybody has got to seize the opportunities before us. <p>There is something big happening in America right now. For the first time, we can actually see what our clean energy future looks like. And yes, the closer we get to this future, opposition will fight even harder to keep things the way they've been. Folks will get louder in some of that backlash, and they'll put out press releases suggesting that somehow this is bad for America. We can't pay attention to that. Folks whose interests or ideologies run counter to where we need to go, we've got to be able to politely, but firmly say, sorry, we're moving forward. <p>And anybody who suggests that moving to a clean energy economy is going to somehow cripple our economy or lead to fewer jobs, if they hold up snowballs in February&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;as if that somehow disproves decades of scientific data, if they suggest that we've got to set our sights lower and do less or delay action because we can't figure this stuff out, I just want everybody to remember, we've heard these arguments before. We have engaged in this debate many times before. It's taken different forms, but this is a age-old debate in America. It's a debate between the folks who say, \\"No, we can't,\\" and the folks who say, \\"Yes, we can.\\" Because those&mdash;between those who fear the future and those who are eager to seize the future. <p>And although sometimes, it&mdash;there are some growing pains, America always comes down on the side of the future. We've always been a people who reach&mdash;proudly and boldly and unafraid&mdash;to that more promising future. We refuse to surrender the hope of a clean energy future to those who fear it and fight it and sometimes provide misinformation about it. <p>Because the naysayers always underestimate what the American people are capable of. And we prove that every day. All across this country right now, you've got once-dusty plains and rundown buildings that are now solar fields and rooftop arrays. All across this country right now, once-shuttered factories are humming, retraining workers to build wind turbines, technology that we're importing&mdash;we're not just importing now, now we're making it here, and we're exporting it: technology made in America. All across this country, once-darkened plants are now full of rehired autoworkers manufacturing some of the world's most energy efficient cars, cars that make you proud to be an American. <p>This generation of Americans is hammering into place the high-tech foundations of a clean energy age. It's the same people who first harnessed the power of the atom, the power of the Sun; the same spirit of people who connected the continent by road and by rail, who connected the world through our science and our imaginations; the same people who set foot on the Moon and put a rover on Mars and probes the farthest reaches of our solar system. <p>That's what Americans do. We can do anything. And you guys are proving it every single day, and I'm going to be right there beside you. Congratulations. <p>God bless you. God bless this country we love. Thank you.\" "
"188" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody. Well, welcome to the White House. Congratulations to the 2014 WNBA Champion, Phoenix Mercury! And I want to acknowledge WNBA President Laurel Richie&mdash;Laurel&mdash;and WNBA Coach of the Year Sandy Brondello. [<i>Applause</i>] Yay! <p>I would be happy to be here, except that the Mercury getting here involved beating the Chicago Sky in the finals. [<i>Laughter</i>] In fact, Diana, backstage, was trash-talking me. [<i>Laughter</i>] You have kept yet another Chicago sports team from getting into the White House. [<i>Laughter</i>] But there's always next year. <p>It's been a while since the Mercury last visited here 5 years ago. And in that time, this team has appeared in four more Western Conference Finals. Last year, they cracked the code again. Last season, the Mercury set a WNBA record with 29 regular season wins. And obviously, their fans had their backs; Phoenix had the highest attendance rate in the league. <p>In the Western Conference finals, they got some payback against their archrivals, the Minnesota Lynx, and set themselves up for the championship. But it was not always easy. Brittney Griner had a breakout season; we expected that after having seen her at Baylor. And she was tearing it up in the playoffs before going down with an injury in the finals. So, in the clinching game, the rest of the team had to step up. And so Diana Taurasi was good for 24 points; she apparently can shoot the ball pretty good. [<i>Laughter</i>] With less than a minute to go, the game tied at 82, she put the Mercury ahead for good. As Coach Brondello says about Diana, \\"When you put the ball in her hands, in the money, crunch time, she makes things happen.\\" <p>So these are some outstanding basketball players&mdash;Diana and Brittney, but also Candice Dupree, DeWanna Bonner, Erin Phillips, and Penny Taylor, who sealed the championship with two clutch free throws. Penny said that: \\"Nobody is left out of anything on the Mercury. Everybody has to listen, everybody is involved, one through 11.\\" <p>And that sense of teamwork extends to the work that they're doing in the Phoenix community as well. These women have spent more than 150 hours cleaning up courts and running basketball clinics for underserved kids and working with high school basketball teams that they adopt every year. And during the playoffs&mdash;&mdash; <p>[<i>At this point, a baby cried.</i>] <p><i>The President. </i>That's okay, it's an excited fan. [<i>Laughter</i>] And during the playoffs, the Mercury raised awareness for the national bone marrow donor registry by enlisting an honorary assistant coach named Mia McPoland, a 12-year-old who's waiting and hoping to find a donor. <p>So this is a team that I think is representative of what the WNBA is all about. They're doing good in their community. They're great athletes. They and women across the WNBA are changing the way that young girls, including my daughters, see themselves. And as a dad, I've witnessed the shift just in the last 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, in terms of it just being taken for granted that women are great athletes and great leaders. And that does not happen unless these outstanding women perform the way they do. Plus, they look so good. [<i>Laughter</i>] You know? They clean up pretty good. <p>And so I am very pleased to congratulate this outstanding team behind me, not only for winning a championship, but for being great representatives of not only the WNBA, but of basketball as a whole. <p>And with that, I think Diana has a few words that she's going to say. And I just want to warn&mdash;last year, somebody slipped off the podium wearing high heels. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I want you&mdash;so I just&mdash;before anything else happens. She saved herself. I was impressed because she was coming off the second riser. But it was a little stressful. So all right, Diana, come on. <p><i>Guard Diana L. Taurasi.</i> Well, on behalf of the Phoenix Mercury and the WNBA, we want to give you a 2014 WNBA Championship jersey. <p><i>The President.</i> Nice! <p><i>Ms. Taurasi.</i> It's an XL. [<i>Laughter</i>] So we might have to get on the Atkins. But thank you very much for having us, Mr. President. <p>[<i>At this point, the President was presented with a team jersey.</i>]<i> </i><p><i>The President.</i> Thank you so much. <p><i>Ms. Taurasi.</i> It's an honor. <p><i>The President</i>. Thank you. You bet. Thank you. Let's strike this podium.\" "
"189" "\"Okay, I'm going to have a chance to make a longer set of remarks later, but I just wanted to point out where we are. The Faubourg Lafitte area in Trem&eacute; is part of one of the most historic districts in New Orleans and Louisiana and America. A lot of folks think this is where jazz really first started taking root. It is obviously close to downtown and the French Quarter, one of the most important historic African American communities in the country. <p>And like so much of this area, it was devastated during the storm. But what you're seeing here is an example of the incredible Federal, State, local partnerships that have helped to revitalize this community&mdash;not just with this housing, which is all new and was helped&mdash;funded through a program called Hope IV&mdash;but also a new school in that direction, a new community center in that direction. And part of our goal has always been to make sure not just that we recovered from the storm, but also that we started dealing with some of the structural inequities that existed long before the storm happened. <p>And I'm going to say nice things about him later, but I'm going to make sure to say that none of this would have happened had it not been for the outstanding leadership of Mayor Mitch Landrieu, who has been just an unbelievable partner throughout this entire process. We're really proud of what he's doing. You can see the results here. <p>Now, just because the houses are nice doesn't mean our job is done. This is a community, obviously, that still has a lot of poverty. This is an area where young people still, too often, are taking the wrong path before they graduate from high school. This is a community that still needs resources and still needs help. <p>But the fact that we can make this many strides 10 years after a terrible, epic disaster, I think, is an indication of the kind of spirit that we have in this city. And it's reflected in our Mayor. So we're proud of you. <p>Okay, guys, we're going to see you later.\" "
"190" "\"I am here at the Sanchez Community Center, and we've got some outstanding State officials, local officials; Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana; some folks like Thad Allen, who were involved in the early recovery efforts here in Katrina; philanthropies like the Red Cross and the Rockefeller Foundation; and local community leadership like the Foundation for Louisiana and the Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center. <p>And what we've been doing is just looking at the lessons that have been learned over the course of the last decade and sharing a sense of pride for the excellent coordination that's taken place between Federal, State and local governments in the rebuilding process, but also some humility and some sense of urgency about the work that still needs to be done. <p>So we had a chance to talk about the progress that's been made around protecting New Orleans and protecting the Louisiana coast and water management. And behind me, you can see all kinds of charts and maps that indicate that we now have one of the best water management systems and storm management systems in the world right here in New Orleans, thanks to the work of State and local authorities as well as the Army Corps of Engineers. We talked about the need to continue to restore wetlands and the natural barriers that can mitigate the harm from significant storms. <p>So that's infrastructure resilience. We also talked about community resilience and human resilience. And what's, I think, been critically important over the last decade is to recognize that it's one thing to stop water from pouring in, it's another thing to make sure that individuals and families have the resources and the structure to rebuild after a tough storm hits. And that means that attention has to be paid to housing; attention has to be paid to employment; attention has to be paid to preparedness; attention has to be paid to equity. And the city of New Orleans, with the help of some private sector as well as public dollars, has been doing some terrific work in making sure that the rebuilding process integrates all those concerns. <p>And we also talked about lessons learned going forward and how we can share the data that's been learned over the last decade with other communities. So, for example, Robin Barnes of Greater New Orleans, Inc., who specializes in helping small businesses and economic development, actually has worked with us on the Hurricane Sandy recovery efforts, because New Orleans is increasingly becoming a laboratory for the kind of good work that we're going to have to do all across the country and around the world. <p>And so everybody here has done some outstanding work, but they also recognize that there's a lot more work to be done. I just want to appreciate all of you for participating and helping me learn a little something here today. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And one recurrent theme that's emerged out of this discussion is that perhaps the biggest lesson to be learned from Katrina is making sure that there is trust and effective communication between citizens, their governments, civil society, because when people know each other, trust each other, are accountable to each other, like any human enterprise, mistakes will happen, natural disasters occur, but there's no problem that we as Americans can't solve if we're working together. And that's what New Orleans has been starting to do over the last several years, and it's really showing all across this city. <p>All right? Thank you very much, everybody. I'll give a longer speech in a second. [<i>Laughter</i>] Appreciate it.\" "
"191" "\"<i>The President.</i> Everybody, have a seat. Hello, everybody! Where y'at? It is good to be back in the Big Easy. And this is the weather in August all the time, right? [<i>Laughter</i>] Every year? As soon as I land in New Orleans, the first thing I do is get hungry. [<i>Laughter</i>] When I was here with the family a few years ago, I had a shrimp po'boy at Parkway Bakery and Tavern. I still remember it; that's how good it was. And one day, after I leave office, maybe I'll finally hear Rebirth at the Maple Leaf on Tuesday night. I'll get a chance to \\"see the Mardi Gras,\\" and somebody will tell me what Carnival for. [<i>Laughter</i>] But right now I just go to meetings. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to thank Michelle for the introduction and, more importantly, for the great work she's doing, what she symbolizes, and what she represents in terms of the city bouncing back. I want to acknowledge a great friend and somebody who has been working tirelessly on behalf of this city, and he's following a family legacy of service: your mayor, Mitch Landrieu. Proud of him. His beautiful wife Cheryl. Senator Bill Cassidy is here. Where did Senator Cassidy go? There he is. Congressman Cedric Richmond. Where's the Congressman? There he is over there. We've got a lifelong champion of Louisiana in your former Senator, Mary Landrieu, in the house. [<i>Applause</i>] Mary! I want to acknowledge a great supporter to the efforts to recover and rebuild, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries from New York, who has traveled down here with us. <p>To all the elected officials from Louisiana and Mississippi who are here today, thank you so much for your reception. <p>I'm here to talk about a specific recovery. But before I begin to talk just about New Orleans, I want to talk about America's recovery, take a little moment of Presidential privilege to talk about what's been happening in our economy. This morning we learned that our economy grew at a stronger and more robust clip back in the spring than anybody knew at the time. The data always lags. We already knew that over the past 5&frac12; years, our businesses have created 13 million new jobs. These new numbers that came out, showing that the economy was growing at a 3.7-percent clip, means that the United States of America remains an anchor of global strength and stability in the world, that we have recovered faster, more steadily, stronger than just about any economy after the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. <p>And it's important for us to remember that strength. It's been a volatile few weeks around the world. And there's been a lot of reports in the news and the stock market swinging and worries about China and about Europe. But the United States of America, for all the challenges that we still have, continue to have the best cards. We've just got to play them right. <p>Our economy has been moving and continues to grow, and unemployment continues to come down. And our work is not yet done, but we have to have that sense of steadiness and vision and purpose in order to sustain this recovery so that it reaches everybody and not just some. It's why we need to do everything we can in government to make sure our economy keeps growing. That requires Congress to protect our momentum, not kill it. Congress is about to come back from a 6-week recess. The deadline to fund the Government is, as always, the end of September. And so I want everybody just to understand that Congress has about a month to pass a budget that helps our economy grow. Otherwise, we risk shutting down the Government and services that we all count on for the second time in 2 years. That would not be responsible. It does not have to happen. <p>Congress needs to fund America in a way that invests in our growth and our security and not cuts us off at the knees by locking in mindless austerity or shortsighted sequester cuts to our economy or our military. I've said I will veto a budget like that. I think most Americans agree. We've got to invest in, rather than cut, things like military readiness, infrastructure, schools, public health, the research and development that keeps our companies on the cutting edge. <p>That's what great nations do. [<i>Applause</i>] That's what great nations do. So&mdash;and eventually, we're going to do it anyway, so let's just do it without too much drama. [<i>Laughter</i>] Let's do it without another round of threats to shut down the Government. Let's not introduce unrelated partisan issues. Nobody gets to hold the American economy hostage over their own ideological demands. You, the people who send us to Washington, expect better. Am I correct? <p><i>Audience members</i>. That's right. <p><i>The President</i>. So my message to Congress is: Pass a budget. Prevent a shutdown. Don't wait until the last minute. Don't worry our businesses or our workers by contributing unnecessarily to global uncertainty. Get it done, and keep the United States of America the anchor of global strength that we are and always should be. <p>Now, that's a process of national recovery that from coast to coast we've been going through. But there's been a specific process of recovery that is perhaps unique in my lifetime, right here in the State of Louisiana, right here in New Orleans. <p>Not long ago, our gathering here in the Lower 9 probably would have seemed unlikely. As I was flying here today with a homegirl from Louisiana, Donna Brazile, she was&mdash;she saved all the magazines, and she was whipping them out, and one of them was a picture of the Lower Ninth right after the storm had happened. And it&mdash;the notion that there would be anything left seemed unimaginable at the time. <p>Today, this new community center stands as a symbol of the extraordinary resilience of this city, the extraordinary resilience of its people, the extraordinary resilience of the entire Gulf Coast and of the United States of America. You are an example of what is possible when, in the face of tragedy and in the face of hardship, good people come together to lend a hand, and brick by brick, block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood, you build a better future. <p>And that, more than any other reason, is why I've come back here today&mdash;plus, Mitch Landrieu asked me to. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member</i>. [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President</i>. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's been 10 years since Katrina hit, devastating communities in Louisiana and Mississippi, across the Gulf Coast. In the days following its landfall, more than 1,800 of our fellow citizens&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;lost their lives. Some folks in this room may have lost a loved one in that storm. <p>Thousands of people saw their homes destroyed, livelihoods wiped out, hopes and dreams shattered. Many scattered in an exodus to cities across the country, and too many still haven't returned. Those who stayed and lived through that epic struggle still feel the trauma sometimes of what happened. As one woman from Gentilly recently wrote me, \\"A deep part of the whole story is the grief.\\" So there was grief then, and there is still some grief in our hearts. <p>Here in New Orleans, a city that embodies a celebration of life suddenly seemed devoid of life. A place once defined by color and sound&mdash;the second line down the street, the crawfish boils in backyards, the music always in the air&mdash;suddenly, it was dark and silent. And the world watched in horror. We saw those rising waters drown the iconic streets of New Orleans. Families stranded on rooftops. Bodies in the streets. Children crying, crowded in the Superdome. An American city dark and under water. <p>And this was something that was supposed to never happen here. It&mdash;maybe someplace else, but not here, not in America. And we came to realize that what started out as a natural disaster became a manmade disaster, a failure of government to look out for its own citizens. And the storm laid bare a deeper tragedy that had been brewing for decades, because we came to understand that New Orleans, like so many cities and communities across the country, had for too long been plagued by structural inequalities that left too many people, especially poor people, especially people of color, without good jobs or affordable health care or decent housing. Too many kids grew up surrounded by violent crime, cycling through substandard schools where few had a shot to break out of poverty. And so like a body weakened already, undernourished already, when the storm hit, there was no resources to fall back on. <p>Shortly after I visited&mdash;shortly after the storm, I visited with folks, not here because we couldn't distract local recovery efforts. Instead, I visited folks in a shelter in Houston, many who had been displaced. And one woman told me, \\"We had nothing before the hurricane, and now we have less than nothing.\\" We had nothing before the hurricane; now we had less than nothing. <p>And we acknowledge this loss and this pain not to dwell on the past, not to wallow in grief; we do it to fortify our commitment and to bolster our hope, to understand what it is that we've learned and how far we've come. <p>Because this is a city that slowly, unmistakably, together, is moving forward. Because the project of rebuilding here wasn't just to restore the city as it had been. It was to build a city as it should be: a city where everyone, no matter what they look like, how much money they've got, where they come from, where they're born, has a chance to make it. <p>And I'm here to say that on that larger project of a better, stronger, more just New Orleans, the progress that you have made is remarkable. [<i>Applause</i>.] The progress you've made is remarkable. <p>That's not to say things are perfect. Mitch would be the first one to say that. We know that African Americans and folks in hard-hit parishes like Plaquemines and St. Bernard are less likely to feel like they've recovered. Certainly, we know violence still scars the lives of too many youth in this city. As hard as rebuilding levees are&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> Mental health! <p><i>The President. </i>As hard as&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> Our children need mental health! <p><i>The President.</i> I agree with that. But I'll get to that. Thank you, ma'am. <p>As hard as rebuilding levees is, as hard as rebuilding housing is, real change&mdash;real lasting, structural change&mdash;that's even harder. And it takes courage to experiment with new ideas and change the old ways of doing things. That's hard. Getting it right and making sure that everybody is included and everybody has a fair shot at success, that takes time. That's not unique to New Orleans. We've got those challenges all across the country. <p>But I'm here to say, I'm here to hold up a mirror and say, because of you, the people of New Orleans, working together, this city is moving in the right direction. And I have never been more confident that together we will get to where we need to go. <p>You inspire me. Your efforts inspire me. And no matter how hard it's been and how hard and how long the road ahead might seem, you're working and building and striving for a better tomorrow. I see evidence of it all across this city. And by the way, along the way, the people of New Orleans didn't just inspire me, you inspired all of America. Folks have been watching what's happened here, and they've seen a reflection of the very best of the American spirit. <p>As President, I've been proud to be your partner. Across the board, I've made the recovery and rebuilding of the Gulf Coast a priority. I made promises when I was a Senator that I'd help. And I've kept those promises. <p>We're cutting redtape to help you build back even stronger. We're taking the lessons we've learned here, we've applied them across the country, including places like New York and New Jersey after Hurricane Sandy. <p>If Katrina was initially an example of what happens when government fails, the recovery has been an example of what's possible when government works together&mdash;State and local, community&mdash;everybody working together as true partners. <p>Together, we've delivered resources to help Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida rebuild schools and hospitals, roads, police and fire stations, restore historic buildings and museums. And we're building smarter, doing everything from elevating homes to retrofitting buildings to improving drainage, so that our communities are better prepared for the next storm. <p>Working together, we've transformed education in this city. Before the storm, New Orleans public schools were largely broken, leaving generations of low-income kids without a decent education. Today, thanks to parents and educators, school leaders, nonprofits, we're seeing real gains in achievement, with new schools, more resources to retain and develop and support great teachers and principals. We have data that shows before the storm, the high school graduation rate was 54 percent. Today, it's up to 73 percent. Before the storm, college enrollment was 37 percent. Today, it's almost 60 percent. We still have a long way to go, but that is real progress. New Orleans is coming back better and stronger. <p>Working together, we're providing housing assistance to more families today than before the storm, with new apartments and housing vouchers. And we will keep working until everybody who wants to come home can come home. <p>Together, we're building a New Orleans that is as entrepreneurial as any place in the country, with a focus on expanding job opportunities and making sure that more people benefit from a growing economy here. We're creating jobs to rebuild the city's transportation infrastructure, expanding training programs for industries like high-tech manufacturing, but also water management, because we've been building some good water management around here&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and we want to make sure everybody has access to those good, well-paying jobs. Small businesses like Michelle's are growing. It's small businesses like hers that are helping to fuel 65 straight months of private sector job growth in America. That's the longest streak in American history. <p>Together, we're doing more to make sure that everyone in this city has access to great health care. More folks have access to primary care at neighborhood clinics so that they can get the preventive care that they need. We're building a brand new VA Medical Center downtown, alongside a thriving biosciences corridor that's attracting new jobs and investment. We are working to make sure that we have additional mental health facilities across the city and across the country. And more people have access to quality, affordable health care, some of the more than 16 million Americans who have gained health insurance over the past few years. <p>All of this progress is the result of the commitment and drive of the people of this region. I saw that spirit today. We&mdash;Mitch and I started walking around a little bit. Such a nice day outside. And we went to Faubourg Lafitte, we were in Trem&eacute;, and we saw returning residents living in brandnew homes, mixed income, new homes near schools and clinics and parks, childcare centers, more opportunities for working families. <p>We saw that spirit today at Willie Mae's Scotch House. After Katrina had destroyed that legendary restaurant, some of the best chefs from the country decided America could not afford to lose such an important place. So they came down here to help, helped rebuild. And I just sampled some of her fried chicken. [<i>Laughter</i>] It was really good&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;although, I did get a grease spot on my suit. [<i>Laughter</i>] But that's okay. If you come to New Orleans and you don't have a grease spot somewhere, then you didn't enjoy the city. Just glad I didn't get it on my tie. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We all just heard that spirit of New Orleans in the remarkable young people from Roots of Music. When the storm washed away a lot of middle school music programs, Roots of Music helped fill that gap. And today, it's building the next generation of musical talent: the next Irma Thomas or the next Trombone Shorty or the next Dr. John. There's a Marsalis kid in here somewhere. How you doing? <p>And I saw it in the wonderful young men I met earlier who are part of \\"NOLA for Life,\\" which is focused on reducing the number of murders in the city of New Orleans. This is a program that works with the White House's \\"My Brother's Keepers\\" initiative to make sure that all young people, and particularly our boys and young men of color, who so disproportionately are impacted by crime and violence, have the opportunity to fulfill their full potential. <p>In fact, after the storm, this city became a laboratory for urban innovation across the board. And we've been tackling with you, as a partner, all sorts of major challenges: fighting poverty, supporting our homeless veterans. And as a result, New Orleans has become a model for the Nation as the first city&mdash;the first major city to end veterans' homelessness, which is a remarkable achievement. <p>You're also becoming a model for the Nation when it comes to disaster response and resilience. We learned lessons from Katrina. So the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers developed stricter standards, more advanced techniques for levees. Here in Louisiana, we built a $14 billion system of improved levees and pump stations and gates, a system that stood the test of Hurricane Isaac. <p>We've revamped FEMA&mdash;and I just have to say, by the way, there's a man named Craig Fugate who runs FEMA and has been doing extraordinary work, and his team, all across the country, every time there's a disaster. I love me some Craig Fugate. [<i>Laughter</i>] Although, it's a little disturbing. He gets excited when there are disasters&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;because he gets restless if everything is just quiet. But we've&mdash;under his leadership, we've revamped FEMA into a stronger, more efficient agency. In fact, the whole Federal Government has gotten smarter at preventing and recovering from disasters and serving as a better partner to local and State governments. <p>And as I'll talk about next week, when I visit Alaska, making our communities more resilient is going to be increasingly important, because we're going to see more extreme weather events as the result of climate change: deeper droughts, deadlier wildfires, stronger storms. That's why, in addition to things like new and better levees, we've also been investing in restoring wetlands and other natural systems that are just as critical for storm protection. <p>So we've made a lot of progress over the past 10 years. You've made a lot of progress. That gives us hope. But it doesn't allow for complacency. It doesn't mean we can rest. Our work here won't be done when almost 40 percent of children still live in poverty in this city. That's not a finished job. That's not a full recovery. Our work won't be done when a typical Black household earns half the income of White households in this city. The work is not done yet. <p>Our work is not done when there's still too many people who have yet to find good, affordable housing, and too many people&mdash;especially African American men&mdash;who can't find a job. Not when there are still too many people who haven't been able to come back home; folks who, around the country, every day, live the words sung by Louis Armstrong: \\"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans?\\" <p>But the thing is, the people of New Orleans, there's something in you guys that is just irrepressible. You have a&mdash;you guys have a way of making a way out of no way. You know the Sun comes out after every storm. You've got hope. Especially your young people reflect hope, young people like Victor York-Carter. Where's Victor? Victor York-Carter. There&mdash;stand up Victor. I was just talking to Victor. I had some lunch with him. These are these fine young men that I just met with. Stand up everybody. See, these are the guys who I had chicken with. Really impressive, have overcome more than their fair share of challenges, but are still focused on the future. You guys, sit down. I don't want you to start getting embarrassed. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So I'll just give you one example. Victor grew up in the Eighth Ward. Gifted art student, loved math. He was 13 when Katrina hit. And he remembers waking up to what looked like something out of a disaster movie. He and his family waded across the city, towing his younger brother in a trash can to keep him afloat. <p>They were eventually evacuated to Texas. Six months later, they returned, and the city was almost unrecognizable. Victor saw his peers struggling to cope, many of them still traumatized, their lives still disordered. So he joined an organization called Rethink to help young people get more involved in rebuilding New Orleans. And recently, he finished a coding boot camp at Operation Spark; today, he's studying to earn a high-tech job. He wants to introduce more young people to science and technology and civics so that they have the tools to change the world. <p>And so Victor and these young men that I just met with, they've overcome extraordinary odds. They've lived through more than most of us will ever have to endure. They've made some mistakes along the way. But for all that they've been through, they have been just as determined to improve their own lives, to take responsibility for themselves, but also to try to see if they can help others along the way. So when I talk to young men like that, that gives me hope. It's still hard. I told them they can't get down on themselves. Tough stuff will happen along the way. But if they've come this far, they can keep on going. <p>And Americans like you&mdash;the people of New Orleans, young men like this&mdash;you're what recovery has been all about. You're why I'm confident that we can recover from crisis and start to move forward. You've helped this country recover from a crisis and helped it move forward. You're the reason 13 million new jobs have been created. You're the reason the unemployment rate fell from 10 percent to 5.3. You're the reason that layoffs are near an alltime low. You're the reason the uninsured rate is at an alltime low and the high school graduation rate is at an alltime high and the deficit has been cut by two-thirds and two wars are over. And nearly eight&mdash;180,000 American troops who were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan have now gone down to 15,000. And a clean energy revolution is helping to save this planet. <p>You're the reason why justice has expanded and now we're focused on making sure that everybody is treated fairly under the law, and why people have the freedom to marry whoever they love from sea to shining sea. <p>I tell you, we're moving into the next Presidential cycle, the next political season, and you will hear a lot of people telling you everything that's wrong with America. And that's okay. That's a proper part of our democracy. One of the things about America is, we're never satisfied. We keep pushing forward. We keep asking questions. We keep challenging our government. We keep challenging our leaders. We keep looking for the next set of challenges to tackle. We find what's wrong because we have confidence that we can fix it. <p>But it's important that we remember what's right and what's good and what's hopeful about this country. It's worth remembering that for all the tragedy, for the all images of Katrina in those first few days, in those first few months, look at what's happened here. It's worth remembering the thousands of Americans like Michelle and Victor and Mrs. Willie Mae and the folks who rallied around her, Americans all across this country who, when they saw neighbors and friends or strangers in need, came to help. And people who today still spend their time every day helping others: rolling up their sleeves, doing the hard work of changing this country without the need for credit or the need for glory; don't get their name in the papers, don't see their day in the sun, do it because it's right. <p>These Americans live the basic values that define this country, the value that we've been reminded of in these past 10 years as we've come back from a crisis that changed this city and an economic crisis that spread throughout the Nation: the basic notion that I am my brother's keeper and I am my sister's keeper and that we look out for each other and that we're all in this together. <p>That's the story of New Orleans, but that's also the story of America: a city that, for almost 300 years, has been the gateway to America's soul. Where the jazz makes you cry, the funerals make you dance&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;the bayou makes you believe all kinds of things. [<i>Laughter</i>] A place that has always brought together people of all races and religions and languages. And everybody adds their culture and their flavor into this city's gumbo. You remind our Nation that for all of our differences, in the end, what matters is, we're all in the same boat. We all share a similar destiny. <p>If we stay focused on that common purpose, if we remember our responsibility to ourselves, but also our responsibilities and obligations to one another, we will not just rebuild this city, we will rebuild this country.

Thank you.\" "
"192" "\"Hi, everybody. This Monday, I'm heading to Alaska for a 3-day tour of the State. Now, I've been looking forward to this for a long time, not only because Alaska is one of the most beautiful places in a country that's full of beautiful places, but because I'll have several opportunities to meet with everyday Alaskans about what's going on in their lives. I'll travel throughout the State, meeting with Alaskans who live above the Arctic Circle, with Alaska Natives, and with folks who earn their livelihoods through fishing and tourism. And I expect to learn a lot. <p>One thing I've learned so far is that a lot of these conversations begin with climate change. And that's because Alaskans are already living with its effects: more frequent and extensive wildfires, bigger storm surges as sea ice melts faster, some of the swiftest shoreline erosion in the world, in some places, more than 3 feet a year. <p>Alaska's glaciers are melting faster too, threatening tourism and adding to rising seas. And if we do nothing, Alaskan temperatures are projected to rise between 6 and 12 degrees by the end of the century, changing all sorts of industries forever. <p>This is all real. This is happening to our fellow Americans right now. In fact, Alaska's Governor recently told me that four villages are in \\"imminent danger\\" and have to be relocated. Already, rising sea levels are beginning to swallow one island community. <p>Think about that. If another country threatened to wipe out an American town, we'd do everything in our power to protect ourselves. Climate change poses the same threat right now. <p>That's why one of the things I'll do while I'm in Alaska is to convene other nations to meet this threat. Several Arctic nations have already committed to action. And since the United States and China worked together to set ambitious climate targets last year, leading by example, many of the world's biggest emitters have come forward with new climate plans of their own. And that's a good sign as we approach this December's global climate negotiations in Paris. <p>Now, one of the ways America is leading is by transitioning away from dirty energy sources that threaten our health and our environment and by going all-in on clean, renewable energy sources like wind and solar. And Alaska has the natural resources to be a global leader in this effort. <p>Now, even as we accelerate this transition, our economy still has to rely on oil and gas. And as long as that's the case, I believe we should rely more on domestic production than on foreign imports and we should demand the highest safety standards in the industry: our own. Still, I know that there are Americans who are concerned about oil companies drilling in environmentally sensitive waters. Some are also concerned with my administration's decision to approve Shell's application to drill a well off the Alaskan coast, using leases they purchased before I took office. I share people's concerns about offshore drilling. I remember the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico all too well. <p>And that's precisely why my administration has worked to make sure that our oil exploration conducted under these leases is done at the highest safety standards possible, with requirements specifically tailored to the risks of drilling off Alaska. We don't rubberstamp permits. We make it clear that Shell has to meet our high standards in how they conduct their operations, and it's a testament to how rigorously we've applied those standards that Shell has delayed and limited its exploration off Alaska while trying to meet them. The bottom line is, safety has been and will continue to be my administration's top priority when it comes to oil and gas exploration off America's precious coasts, even as we push our economy and the world to ultimately transition off of fossil fuels. <p>So I'm looking forward to talking with Alaskans about how we can work together to make America the leader on climate change around the globe. And we're going to offer unique and engaging ways for you to join me on this trip all week at whitehouse.gov/Alaska. Because what's happening in Alaska is happening to us. It's our wakeup call. And as long as I'm President, America will lead the world to meet the threat of climate change before it's too late. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"193" "\"Well, I am thrilled to be in Alaska. And I look forward to spending the next few days with everyday Alaskans to tell me what's going on in their lives and what's going on in this remarkable State. <p>I want to thank our Governor, Governor Walker, Lieutenant Governor Byron Mallott, as well as Senator Lisa Murkowski, and Secretary Sally Jewell of the Department of Interior for joining us. <p>But the main purpose of this meeting was to give me an opportunity to interact and listen to some of Alaska Native tribal leaders. A number of them I've met with before during the tribal summits that we've had in Washington. But this gave me a chance to focus more intensely on specifically what's happening in Alaska. And they don't just represent a large portion of Alaska's population, these are communities that have been around for 10,000 years or so. So it's worth paying attention to them because they know a little bit from all that history. <p>Since I took office, I've been committed to sustaining a government-to-government relationship between the United States and our tribal nations. We host tribal leaders in Washington every year. I've visited Indian Country at the Standing Rock Reservation and the Choctaw Nation. This week, we're going to be visiting two more tribal communities here in Alaska: in Dillingham and Kotzebue. <p>And in fact, by the end of my time in office, I'll have visited more communities&mdash;more tribal communities than any previous sitting President, which I feel pretty good about&mdash;in case anybody is keeping track. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>One of the things that we've been focused on is, how can we work together and improve communication, consultation, collaboration, and participation in dealing with the issues that face Native communities? And we've made progress so far in providing support for tribal youth, expanding access to health care, improving disaster assistance, making sure that we're addressing squarely the profound issues around violence against Native women. <p>We've also made a couple of news announcements today. Obviously the big one was returning the most magnificent peak in our Nation to its original name&mdash;Mount Denali&mdash;something that the people of Alaska had been working on and petitioning consistently since 1970. And I'm glad that we were able to respond to that. <p>My administration also is taking new action to make sure that Alaska Natives have direct input into the management of Chinook salmon stocks, something that has been of great concern here. <p>But one of the biggest things that I heard during this discussion was the need for us to work more intensively and more collaboratively with communities, particularly in rural areas, that are burdened by crippling energy costs, that are obviously continually concerned about hunting and fishing rights and their ability to sustain their way of life in the face of profound climate change that's taking place&mdash;taking place, in fact, faster&mdash;twice as fast here in Alaska as it is in the lower 48. And so, in addition to initiatives around renewable energy and how we can be more creative in helping local communities deal with high energy costs and bringing them down, housing construction that's more energy efficient, that can save people money, we're also going to be paying a lot of attention to how we can work together and tap into the wisdom and knowledge of tribal communities in managing and conserving land in the face of what is a profound global challenge. <p>Many of the issues that were raised here&mdash;everything from voting rights to land trusts&mdash;are issues that my agencies will be following up with on an ongoing basis. And we've already had a lot of visits from various Cabinet Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries, working with the people around this table. That's going to continue for as long as I remain President. And hopefully, we will have set a new pattern and a new set of relationships that will extend well beyond my own Presidency, because when it comes to the First Americans, how we interact with these communities says a lot about who we are as a country. And I think the people of Alaska understand that as well as anybody. <p>So again, I want to thank all the leadership here for everything that they've done in working with us. I want to thank you for all the great ideas that you offered. And I want to thank the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and the Senator for their participation as well. They obviously feel very deeply about these issues in their home State as well. <p>All right? Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, pool.\" "
"194" "\"Thank you so much. Thank you. Please. Well, it is wonderful to be here in the great State of Alaska. <p>I want to thank Secretary Kerry and members of my administration for your work here today. Thank you to the many Alaskans, Alaska Natives, and other indigenous peoples of the Arctic who have traveled a long way, in many cases, to share your insights and your experiences. And to all the Foreign Ministers and delegations who have come here from around the world, welcome to the United States, and thank you all for attending this GLACIER Conference. <p>The actual name of the conference is much longer. It's a mouthful, but the acronym works because it underscores the incredible changes that are taking place here in the Arctic that have impact not just the nations that surround the Arctic, but have an impact for the entire world, as well. <p>I want to thank the people of Alaska for hosting this conference. I look forward to visiting more of Alaska over the next couple of days. The United States is, of course, an Arctic nation. And even if this isn't an official gathering of the Arctic Council, the United States is proud to chair the Arctic Council for the next 2 years. And to all the foreign dignitaries who are here, I want to be very clear: We are eager to work with your nations on the unique opportunities that the Arctic presents and the unique challenges that it faces. We are not going to&mdash;any of us&mdash;be able to solve these challenges by ourselves. We can only solve them together. <p>Of course, we're here today to discuss a challenge that will define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other, and that's the urgent and growing threat of a changing climate. <p>Our understanding of climate change advances each day. Human activity is disrupting the climate, in many ways faster than we previously thought. The science is stark. It is sharpening. It proves that this once-distant threat is now very much in the present. <p>In fact, the Arctic is the leading edge of climate change, our leading indicator of what the entire planet faces. Arctic temperatures are rising about twice as fast as the global average. Over the past 60 years, Alaska has warmed about twice as fast as the rest of the United States. Last year was Alaska's warmest year on record, just as it was for the rest of the world. And the impacts here are very real. <p>Thawing permafrost destabilizes the earth on which a hundred thousand Alaskans live, threatening homes, damaging transportation and energy infrastructure, which could cost billions of dollars to fix. <p>Warmer, more acidic oceans and rivers and the migration of entire species threatens the livelihoods of indigenous peoples and local economies dependent on fishing and tourism. Reduced sea levels leaves villages unprotected from floods and storm surges. Some are in imminent danger; some will have to relocate entirely. In fact, Alaska has some of the swiftest shoreline erosion rates in the world. I recall what one Alaska Native told me at the White House a few years ago. He said: \\"Many of our villages are ready to slide off into the waters of Alaska, and in some cases, there will be absolutely no hope. We will need to move many villages.\\" <p>Alaska's fire season is now more than a month longer than it was in 1950. At one point this summer, more than 300 wildfires were burning at once. Southeast of here, in our Pacific Northwest, even the rainforest is on fire. More than 5 million acres in Alaska have already been scorched by fire this year. That's an area about the size of Massachusetts. If you add the fires across Canada and Siberia, we're talking 300 [30; White House correction.] million acres, an area about the size of New York. <p>This is a threat to many communities, but it's also an immediate and ongoing threat to the men and women who put their lives on the line to protect ours. Less than 2 weeks ago, three highly trained firefighters lost their lives fighting a fire in Washington State. Another has been in critical condition. We are thankful to each and every firefighter for their heroism, including the Canadian firefighters who've helped fight the fires in this State. <p>But the point is, is that climate change is no longer some far-off problem. It is happening here. It is happening now. Climate change is already disrupting our agriculture and ecosystems, our water and food supplies, our energy, our infrastructure, human health, human safety. Now, today. And climate change is a trend that affects all trends: economic trends, security trends. Everything will be impacted. And it becomes more dramatic with each passing year. <p>Already, it's changing the way Alaskans live. And considering the Arctic's unique role in influencing the global climate, it will accelerate changes to the way that we all live. Since 1979, the summer sea ice in the Arctic has decreased by more than 40 percent, a decrease that has dramatically accelerated over the past two decades. One new study estimates that Alaska's glaciers alone lose about 75 gigatons&mdash;that's 75 billion tons&mdash;of ice each year. <p>To put that in perspective, one scientist described a gigaton of ice as a block the size of the National Mall in Washington, from Congress all the way to the Lincoln Memorial, four times as tall as the Washington Monument. Now imagine 75 of those ice blocks. That's what Alaska's glaciers alone lose each year. The pace of melting is only getting faster. It's now twice what it was between 1950 and 2000&mdash;twice as fast as it was just a little over a decade ago. And it's one of the reasons why sea levels rose by about 8 inches over the last century and why are they projected to rise another 1 to 4 feet this century. <p>Consider, as well, that many of the fires burning today are actually burning through the permafrost in the Arctic. So this permafrost stores massive amounts of carbon. When the permafrost is no longer permanent, when it thaws or burns, these gases are released into our atmosphere over time, and that could mean that the Arctic may become a new source of emissions that further accelerates global warming. <p>So if we do nothing, temperatures in Alaska are projected to rise between 6 and 12 degrees by the end of the century, triggering more melting, more fires, more thawing of the permafrost, a negative feedback loop, a cycle&mdash;warming leading to more warming&mdash;that we do not want to be a part of. And the fact is that climate is changing faster than our efforts to address it. That, ladies and gentlemen, must change. We're not acting fast enough. I've come here today, as the leader of the world's largest economy and its second largest emitter, to say that the United States recognizes our role in creating this problem, and we embrace our responsibility to help solve it. And I believe we can solve it. That's the good news. Even if we cannot reverse the damage that we've already caused, we have the means&mdash;the scientific imagination and technological innovation&mdash;to avoid irreparable harm. <p>We know this because last year, for the first time in our history, the global economy grew and global carbon emissions stayed flat. So we're making progress, we're just not making it fast enough. <p>Here in the United States, we're trying to do our part. Since I took office 6&frac12; years ago, the United States has made ambitious investments in clean energy and ambitious reductions in our carbon emissions. We now harness three times as much electricity from wind and 20 times as much from the Sun. Alaskans now lead the world in the development of hybrid wind energy systems from remote grids, and it's expanding its solar and biomass resources. <p>We've invested in energy efficiency in every imaginable way: in our buildings, our cars, our trucks, our homes, even the appliances inside them. We're saving consumers billions of dollars along the way. Here in Alaska, more than 15,000 homeowners have cut their energy bills by 30 percent on average. And that collectively saves Alaskans more than $50 million each year. We've helped communities build climate-resilient infrastructure to prepare for the impacts of climate change that we can no longer prevent. <p>Earlier this month, I announced the first set of nationwide standards to end the limitless dumping of carbon pollution from our power plants. It's the single most important step America has ever taken on climate change. And over the course of the coming days, I intend to speak more about the particular challenges facing Alaska and the United States as an Arctic power, and I intend to announce new measures to address them. <p>So we are working hard to do our part to meet this challenge. And in doing so, we're proving that there doesn't have to be a conflict between a sound environment and strong economic growth. But we're not moving fast enough. None of the nations represented here are moving fast enough. <p>And let's be honest, there's always been an argument against taking action. The notion is, somehow, this will curb our economic growth. And at a time when people are anxious about the economy, that's an argument oftentimes for inaction. We don't want our lifestyles disrupted. In countries where there remains significant poverty, including here in the United States, the notion is, can we really afford to prioritize this issue? The irony, of course, is, is that few things will disrupt our lives as profoundly as climate change. Few things can have as negative an impact on our economy as climate change. <p>On the other hand, technology has now advanced to the point where any economic disruption from transitioning to a cleaner, more efficient economy is shrinking by the day. Clean energy and energy efficiency aren't just proving cost-effective, but also cost-saving. The unit costs of things like solar are coming down rapidly. But we're still underinvesting in it. <p>Many of America's biggest businesses recognize the opportunities and are seizing them. They're choosing a new route. And a growing number of American homeowners are choosing to go solar every day. It works. All told, America's economy has grown more than 60 percent over the last 20 years, but our carbon emissions are roughly back to where they were 20 years ago. So we know how to use less dirty fuel and grow our economy at the same time. But we're not moving fast enough. More Americans every day are doing their part though. Thanks to their efforts, America will reach the emission target that I sent 6 years ago. We're going to reduce our carbon emissions in the range of 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. And that's why, last year, I set a new target: America is going to reduce our emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 10 years from now. <p>And that was part of a historic joint announcement we made last year in Beijing. The United States will double the pace at which we cut our emissions, and China committed, for the first time, to limiting its emissions. Because the world's two largest economies and two largest emitters came together, we're now seeing other nations stepping up aggressively as well. And I'm determined to make sure that American leadership continues to drive international action, because we can't do this alone. Even America and China together cannot do this alone. Even all the countries represented around here cannot do this alone. We have to do it together. <p>This year, in Paris, has to be the year that the world finally reaches an agreement to protect the one planet that we've got while we still can. <p>So let me sum up. We know that human activity is changing the climate. That is beyond dispute. Everything else is politics if people are denying the facts of climate change. We can have a legitimate debate about how we are going to address this problem; we cannot deny the science. We also know the devastating consequences if the current trend lines continue. That is not deniable. And we are going to have to do some adaptation, and we are going to have to help communities be resilient. Because some of these trend lines we are not going to be able to stop on a dime, we're not going to be able to stop tomorrow. <p>But if those trend lines continue the way they are, there's not going to be a nation on this Earth that's not impacted negatively. People will suffer. Economies will suffer. Entire nations will find themselves under severe, severe problems: more drought, more floods, rising sea levels, greater migration, more refugees, more scarcity, more conflict. <p>That's one path we can take. The other path is to embrace the human ingenuity that can do something about it. This is within our power. This is a solvable problem if we start now. And we're starting to see that enough consensus is being built internationally and within each of our own body politics that we may have the political will, finally, to get moving. <p>So the time to heed the critics and the cynics and the deniers is past. The time to plead ignorance is surely past. Those who want to ignore the science, they are increasingly alone. They are on their own shrinking island. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;and let's remember, even beyond the climate benefits of pursuing cleaner energy sources and more resilient, energy-efficient ways of living, the byproduct of it is, is that we also make our air cleaner and safer for our children to breathe. We're also making our economies more resilient to energy shocks on global markets. We're also making our countries less reliant on unstable parts of the world. We are gradually powering a planet on its way to 9 billion humans in a more sustainable way. <p>These are good things. This is not simply a danger to be avoided, this is an opportunity to be seized. But we have to keep going. We're making a difference, but we have to keep going. We are not moving fast enough. <p>If we were to abandon our course of action, if we stop trying to build a clean energy economy and reduce carbon pollution, if we do nothing to keep the glaciers from melting faster and oceans from rising faster and forests from burning faster and storms from growing stronger, we will condemn our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair: submerged countries, abandoned cities, fields no longer growing. Indigenous peoples who can't carry out traditions that stretch back millennia. Entire industries of people who can't practice their livelihoods. Desperate refugees seeking the sanctuary of nations not their own. Political disruptions that could trigger multiple conflicts around the globe. <p>That's not a future of strong economic growth. That is not a future where freedom and human rights are on the move. Any leader willing to take a gamble on a future like that, any so-called leader who does not take this issue seriously or treats it like a joke, is not fit to lead. <p>On this issue, of all issues, there is such a thing as being too late. And that moment is almost upon us. That's why we're here today. That's what we have to convey to our people&mdash;tomorrow and the next day and the day after that. And that's what we have to do when we meet in Paris later this year. It will not be easy. There are hard questions to answer. I am not trying to suggest that there are not going to be difficult transitions that we all have to make. But if we unite our highest aspirations, if we make our best efforts to protect this planet for future generations, we can solve this problem. <p>And when you leave this conference center, I hope you look around. I hope you have the chance to visit a glacier. Or just look out your airplane window as you depart and take in the God-given majesty of this place. For those of you flying to other parts of the world, do it again when you're flying over your home countries. Remind yourself that there will come a time when your grandkids&mdash;and mine, if I'm lucky enough to have some&mdash;they'll want to see this. They'll want to experience it, just as we've gotten to do in our own lives. They deserve to live lives free from fear and want and peril. And ask yourself, are you doing everything you can to protect it? Are we doing everything we can to make their lives safer and more secure and more prosperous? <p>Let's prove that we care about them and their long-term futures, not just short-term political expediency. <p>I had a chance to meet with some Native peoples before I came in here, and they described for me villages that are slipping into the sea and the changes that are taking place: changing migratory patterns; the changing fauna so that what used to feed the animals that they, in turn, would hunt or fish beginning to vanish. It's urgent for them today. But that is the future for all of us if we don't take care. <p>Your presence here today indicates your recognition of that. But it's not enough just to have conferences. It's not enough just to talk the talk. We've got to walk the walk. We've got work to do, and we've got to do it together. <p>So thank you. And may God bless all of you and your countries. And thank you, Alaska, for your wonderful hospitality. Thank you.\" "
"195" "\"So you guys have been seeing these signs as we've walked that mark where the glacier used to be: 1917, 1951. This glacier has lost about a mile and a half over the last couple hundred years. But the pace of the reductions of the glacier are accelerating rapidly each and every year. And this is as good of a signpost of what we're dealing with when it comes to climate change as just about anything. <p>This is one of the most studied glaciers because it's so easily accessible. But what it indicates, because of the changing patterns of winters with less snow, longer, hotter summers, is how rapidly the glacier is receding. And it sends a message about the urgency that we're going to need to have when it comes to dealing with this, because obviously, when the glaciers erode, that's also a sign of the amount of water that's being introduced into the oceans, rising sea levels. And the warming generally is having an impact on the flora and fauna of this national park. <p>It is spectacular though. And we want to make sure that our grandkids can see this.\" "
"196" "\"We're going to go out and look at some of these spectacular fjords on one of our Coast Guard cutters. But before we go out, I just wanted to mention that one of the things we've been trying to highlight during this trip is the changing nature of the Arctic, partly as a consequence of climate change. There's a whole series of strategic implications&mdash;economic and national security&mdash;and one of the things that we have to think about is how do we maintain our capabilities when it comes to maritime issues and commerce. <p>After World War II, we had seven icebreakers: four under the Navy, three under the Coast Guard. Today, in part because we haven't been reinvesting, although we technically have three, operationally, we really only have two, and only one heavy icebreaker. Just to give you a sense of contrast, Russia has about 40, and 11 icebreakers either planned or under construction. <p>Now, in light of the changes that are going to be taking place and the fact that we're going to be seeing more commercial vessels going through the Arctic, even if we're on top of the climate change issues, some of the change is already happening and is going to be inevitable. It's important that we are prepared so that whether it's for search-and-rescue missions, whether it's for national security reasons, whether it's for commercial reasons, that we have much greater capabilities than we currently have. <p>So one of the things that I'm announcing today is a proposal to accelerate the construction of at least one additional heavy icebreaker and to work with Congress to make sure that we are producing a sufficient fleet to meet our economic, commercial, maritime, and national security needs. <p>And this is something that's been championed by Republicans like Senator Sullivan here in Alaska, but also Democrats like Maria Cantwell in Washington. We think that we should be able to generate some bipartisan support, although it's going to be a lot easier to do if we are not continuing to labor under the burdens of sequester that threaten our domestic priorities and investments, but also burden our military and our national security long-term investments. <p>These icebreakers are examples of something that we need to get on line now. They can't wait. And I'm looking forward to trying to work with Congress to make that happen. All right? <p>Enjoy the trip, guys. Stay warm out there.\" "
"197" "\"<i>The President.</i> Let me just say something real quick. Wait. Do I need&mdash;can you guys get&mdash;catch me from here? The&mdash;so, obviously, we're thankful for the incredible display of fishing skill that has been built up over hundreds of years. And all the folks here engage in subsistence fishing, which is part of the traditional way of life for so many here on Bristol Bay. <p>Even though we've got a cloudy day, I think everybody has a sense of how beautiful this place is. And the scale of fish that come through here is remarkable. If you catch&mdash;or if you've eaten wild salmon, it's likely to have come from here. And this has some of the biggest salmon runs, sockeye, in the world. And it's part of the reason why it's so critical that we make sure that we protect this incredible natural resource, not just for the people whose livelihood depends on it, but for the entire country. About 40 percent of the wild-caught seafood in America is caught right here on Bristol Bay. <p>And it represents not just a critical way of life that has to be preserved, but it also represents one of the most important natural resources that the United States has. This is one of the reasons why we have shut off oil and gas exploration in this region. It is too fragile, and it is too important&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> Thank you. <p><i>The President. </i>&mdash;&mdash;for us to be able to endanger it in any sort of way. And this is something that obviously has strong support for the people whose livelihoods depend on it and for the people of Alaska. <p>But there are other threats to this environment that we've always got to be alert to. And hopefully, by us coming here, we're highlighting the need for us to keep this pristine and make sure that this is there for the children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren of all these wonderful fishermen. <p>So we very much appreciate it. And by the way, that fish jerky, outstanding. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I strongly recommend it. You guys should get some samples before you get out of here. <p><i>Audience member</i>. Yes. Please do. Please, and you're welcome to have some more. <p><i>The President</i>. Thank you, guys.\" "
"198" "\"[<i>At this point</i>, <i>the President began greeting store patrons</i>.] <p>So the&mdash;one of the reasons we stopped by, along with Ralph, is just to highlight the fact that obviously this is a great grocery store, folks who do great work, but because everything has to be shipped in, the costs for folks living in Dillingham and a lot of the villages along Bristol Bay end up being extraordinary. You're looking at prices that are double, in some cases, or even higher for basic necessities like milk, like orange juice, like other produce. <p>That's part of the reason why the subsistence economy is so important and why fishing is so important. But it's also why folks like Ralph and some of the various tribal organizations are trying to do more economic development in the area in order to start making some of these things more affordable, but also having more locally produced stuff that can end up cutting prices and create jobs in the region. So we're going to be working on some ideas on economic development in the region. <p>But in the meantime, if you need something&mdash;I thought the press corps might need to get some supplies. Feel free to grab something. We're not going to be here too long though. I'm going to be shaking some hands. All right. Thank you. <p>[<i>The President continued to greet patrons.</i>] <p>Well, it's so nice to be here everybody. We appreciate you. And hopefully I'll be able to bring Michelle and the girls back some time soon. All right. Thank you.\" "
"199" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Alaska! Hello, Kotzebue! Go Huskies! Thank you so much! Thank you for that wonderful, wonderful reception. Please give Millie a big round of applause for the great job. <p>Everybody, have a seat. Have a seat. Just relax. I'm going to be here for a while. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Well, it is wonderful to be in Alaska. And I look forward to spending some quality time here. And I've gotten such a wonderful welcome all across the State, so I want to thank all of you. Thanks to the mayor of the Northwest Arctic Borough, Reggie Joule. Where's Reggie? Reggie, right here. Your mayor, Maija Lukin. I want to acknowledge the presence of our Lieutenant Governor here&mdash;thank you so much, Byron Mallott. And all of you for the warm I&ntilde;upiaq reception here in Kotzebue. We are so grateful. Thank you. <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> I think that's a good thing, whatever happened right here. [<i>Laughter</i>] When you're President, you never know. [<i>Laughter</i>] Sometimes, you get some hecklers. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I did have my team look into what other Presidents have done when they visited Alaska. I'm not the first President to come to Alaska. Warren Harding spent more than 2 weeks here, which I would love to do. But I can't leave Congress alone that long. [<i>Laughter</i>] Something might happen. When FDR visited&mdash;Franklin Delano Roosevelt&mdash;his opponents started a rumor that he left his dog Fala on the Aleutian Islands and spent 20 million taxpayer dollars to send a destroyer to pick him up. Now, I'm astonished that anybody would make something up about a President. [<i>Laughter</i>] But FDR did not take it lying down. He said: \\"I don't resent attacks, and my family doesn't resent attacks. But Fala does resent attacks. He's not been the same dog since.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>President Carter did some fishing when he visited. And I wouldn't mind coming back to Alaska to do some fly fishing someday. You cannot see Alaska in 3 days. It's too big. It's too vast. It's too diverse. So I'm going to have to come back. I may not be President anymore, but hopefully, I still get a pretty good reception. I'm going to&mdash;the&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. And just in case, I'll bring Michelle, who I know will get a good reception. <p>In fact, on Monday, Governor Walker and Byron personally gave me a fishing license. Thank you, Lieutenant Governor. I think it expires, though, pretty quick, and I haven't gotten out there yet. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But there's one thing no American President has done before, and that's travel above the Arctic Circle. So I couldn't be prouder to be the first and to spend some time with all of you. <p>Before I begin my remarks, I want to thank our veterans who are in the audience, because we have so many Alaska Natives who serve our country and defend us. And in fact, I've met some World War II vets and Korean war vets. And we want to make sure that they know how much we appreciate everything that they've done on our behalf. So we appreciate them very much. And I want to thank everybody in Kotzebue for something else, which is taking such good care of my team over the past week. I know that when I come to town there are a lot of people who come first, and it's a big footprint. But all of them have told me incredible stories of your kindness. I heard that you stuffed them full of all kinds of meat at Cariboufest. [<i>Laughter</i>] John Baker, who was the winner of the 2011 Iditarod, let them play with his Husky puppies. I heard about offers to go berry picking on the tundra, last night's cultural night. And I heard that you're even teaching them some I&ntilde;upiaq. I don't know how good they are. [<i>Laughter</i>] They're probably a little better than me. But the teams that advance my trip, they spend a lot of time far away from home. They do great work. Most of them are really young people. So I just want to say thank you to all of you for making them feel so at home even when they're 4,000 miles away. <p>So I've had a great week here in Alaska. Flying in on Monday, I had the view of something extraordinary from Air Force One: \\"the Great One,\\" Denali. We restored its Alaska Native name. I know that it's been a long time coming for Alaskans. I've had a chance to sit in the cockpit of a floatplane. But the Secret Service didn't let me fly it. [<i>Laughter</i>] I still enjoyed it. We had a chance to hike to the Exit Glacier in Kenai Fjords National Park. I went out on Resurrection Bay and saw dolphins and a humpback whale and otters and puffins. <p>And in Dillingham, just earlier today, I watched Alaska Native fishermen bring in their salmon catch and a tribal elder prepare it in the traditional way. I had a chance to visit a middle school where Alaska Native youth performed a traditional Yup'ik dance. And I participated. It's on video. <p>So the warmth and hospitality has been incredible, and I'm so grateful for it. <p>We talk a lot about the pioneering, independent spirit of America. It's something that we're very proud of as Americans. But what's clear is that, up here, it's not just a spirit, it's not just a slogan, it's a way of life. The&mdash;and it is out of necessity. You've got to be self-reliant up here. You can't just drive down to the shopping mall to get what you need. Help, if you need it, is a long way away. This far north, everybody has to look out for each other. And even with all those efforts, there's still isolation, and there's poverty, and it can be harsh. <p>And that means that you depend on each other. It makes family and community and tradition all the more important. Now, I grew up in Hawaii, which obviously, the weather is a little different. [<i>Laughter</i>] But there's a similarity, what's called the Aloha spirit there. And I know you have the same spirit here, the notion that we're all in this together. And that's all the more profound in a place above the Arctic Circle. <p>We know that Alaska is big, and sometimes, I have to describe for people in the lower 48, if you dropped it on the lower 48, it would stretch from Florida to California, from the Dakotas to Texas. That's how big it is. So the people of Alaska can be just as different as all the differences that exist across America. But even though we all look different and come from different places and believe in different things, we all stand united around some similar values. We all want a chance at opportunity. We all want to be able to pass down our traditions and our culture and our language to our kids. We all want the same chance at the American Dream as everybody else. <p>We believe that every community deserves access to great jobs. And that's why, to boost commerce in the Arctic and to maintain America's status as an Arctic power, we've called for the accelerated replacement of the Coast Guard's heavy-duty icebreaker, and we're planning for construction of more icebreakers. And I'm urging Congress to make sure we've got the resources to do this. To boost tourism, I'm asking Congress to speed up maintenance and modernization of our national parks in time for the centennial next year, including right here in Alaska. <p>We believe every child deserves a shot at a great education. One of the initiatives I'm proudest of is something we call ConnectEd, and it's a program we started to close the technology gaps in our schools and connect 99 percent of America's students to high-speed Internet by the year 2018. And if you want to see the difference this can make in a child's life, look at Nanwalek, on Alaska's southern coast. It is remote. Like a lot of Alaskan communities, you can only get there by boat or by plane. But today, with the help of Apple, all 80 of its students, most of whom are Native&mdash;Alaska Natives, now learn in classrooms with fast Internet and iPads and digital content. Most of these kids don't have Internet at home. But in the classroom, they've got the tools to compete with any child around the world. <p>And I know you're taking advantage of this program here in Kotzebue, with wireless Internet and 3-D printing. And that's great, because that's what we want for all these kids. We want nothing less than the best. And as President, one of the reasons I'm here is to tell you that I'm behind those efforts. I want to make sure these young people know we care about them and we're fighting for them. <p>We believe every American deserves access to quality, affordable health care. And since I signed the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;we signed it 5&frac12; years ago&mdash;since then, 16 million Americans have gotten covered. More than 18,000 Alaskans have been able to purchase private plans through healthcare.gov. Thanks to the leadership of Governor Walker and Lieutenant Governor Mallott, another 17,000 are projected to gain access to health insurance under Medicaid next year. So we appreciate that. And that means more Alaskans can get things like mammograms and physicals. And it means fewer Alaskans will go broke just because they get sick. It will save this State an estimated $20 million in costs of care for people who can't afford to pay for it. So it's going to make a difference. <p>We also believe in being good stewards of our land and our planet for the next generation. And that's what I want to spend the rest of my time talking about. One of the reasons I came up here is to really focus on what is probably the biggest challenge our planet faces. If there's one thing that threatens opportunity and prosperity for everybody, wherever we live, it's the threat of a changing climate. <p>I don't need to tell people here in Alaska what's happening. And over the past few years, I've been trying to make the rest of the country more aware of a changing climate, but you're already living it. You've got longer, more dangerous fire seasons in Alaska, thawing permafrost that threatens homes and infrastructure. Faster glacier melt. Rising seas. Melting sea ice that contributes to some of the fastest coastal erosion in the world. <p>I met Alaska Natives whose way of life that they've practiced for centuries is in danger of slipping away. On Monday, one Alaska Native woman told me she doesn't want her way of life to go on the endangered species list. And I've talked with folks whose villages are literally in danger of slipping away. <p>So on my way here, I flew over the island of Kivalina, which is already receding into the ocean. That's what Millie was talking about. Waves sweep across the entire island at times, from one side clear across the other. And for many of those Alaskans, it's no longer a question of if they're going to relocate, but when. And think about it: If another country threatened to wipe out an American town, we'd do everything in our power to protect it. Well, climate change poses the same threat right now. And that's why I care so deeply about this. If we do nothing, temperatures in Alaska are projected to rise between 6 and 12 degrees by the end of the century. That means more melting, more fires, more erosion, more thawing of the permafrost, more warming after that. And it threatens all of us with hardship, not just people up north. <p>There aren't many other places in America that have to deal with those questions right now. But there will be. And what's happening here is America's wakeup call. It should be the world's wakeup call. And that's why, over the past 6 years, we've been working to do something about it. We are the number-one producer of oil and gas. But we're transitioning away from energy that creates the carbon that's warming the planet and threatening our health and our environment, and we're going all in on clean, renewable energy sources like wind and solar. And Alaska has the natural resources to be a global leader in this effort. <p>America right now harnesses three times as much electricity from the wind and 20 times as much from the sun as we did back in 2008. That's how much progress we've already made. And Alaskans now lead the world in the development of hybrid wind energy systems for remote grids, which help, obviously, villages that aren't hooked up to a big power grid. And you're expanding your solar and biomass resources. So Kodiak Island, for example, recently achieved 99.7 percent of its electricity from renewable sources. Its wind power alone displaces more than 2 million gallons of diesel fuel every year. So people are saving money and helping the environment. And today Kodiak Island announced a $3 million public-private partnership that will make the island the first in the world to adopt new technology that lets it stabilize and store the energy it generates from the wind. <p>And I know you guys have started putting up solar panels and wind turbines around Kotzebue. And because energy costs are pretty severe up here, for remote Alaskan communities, one of the biggest problems is high energy costs. So we're going to deploy more new clean energy projects on Native lands, and that's going to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, promote new jobs and new growth in your communities. <p>We've also invested in energy efficiency in every imaginable way: in our buildings, in our cars, our trucks, our homes, our appliances. And all that saves billions of dollars for consumers along the way. So more than 15,000 Alaska homeowners have cut their energy bills by 30 percent on average, and that saves folks here in Alaska more than $50 million a year. <p>Anchorage became the first city in the world to replace more than a quarter of its roadway lighting with LED lighting, and that saves the city $260,000 a year, cuts its energy consumption from lighting by nearly 60 percent. In the town of Tok, the school district replaced its expensive diesel heating and power systems with one fueled by biomass; saved enough money to rehire the counselor, the music teacher, and the boiler operator. That's a good story. <p>And last month, I announced the first set of nationwide standards to end the limitless carbon emissions from our power plants. And that's the most important step we've ever taken on climate change. <p>So the good news is, we've made a lot of progress in the last 6 years. But I'm here to tell you we've got to do more. We've got to move faster. We're not moving fast enough. And for the sake of our kids, we've got to keep going. America has to lead the world in transitioning to a clean energy economy. Now, as we make this transition, we've also got to take more seriously our obligation to help those communities that are already at risk so that they can become more resilient in the face of climate change. Because some of it we're not going to be able to avoid. The planet is already getting warmer. And so communities are already going to be affected, and that's especially pressing here in Alaska. <p>And that's why today I'm announcing that the Denali Commission will serve as a central coordinator in building what we call climate resilience, helping people adapt. And this is going to cut through bureaucracy and redtape, frees up communities like yours to develop and implement solutions for events like coastal erosion and flooding, and permafrost degradation. And the Denali Commission is also committing $2 million to support voluntary relocation efforts for vulnerable rural communities. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is going to consult with Arctic coastal tribes, on a nation-to-nation basis, on your unique needs. <p>And we're also going to help communities build more resilient infrastructure. You shouldn't wait until disaster strikes. We should see if we can invest in communities before the disaster strikes to prevent it. <p>So today we're announcing more than $17 million in USDA rural water grants for infrastructure projects in remote Alaskan communities, including one right here in Kotzebue. And we're launching a new competition to support cutting-edge energy efficiency solutions. So the Department of Energy is going to offer technical assistance and advice. If your communities come up with the best strategy for sustainable, efficient energy that's tailored for your community, you're going to get Federal support to make your plans a reality. <p>And to help Alaskans better plan for sustainable development, the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency and the National Science Foundation are leading a public-private collaboration to create the first-ever publicly available, high-resolution, satellite-based elevation map of Alaska by next year and the entire Arctic by the year after that so that we know exactly what's taking place all across this great State. <p>So before we came up here, we had a conference down in Anchorage, not just with Americans but from&mdash;leaders from around the world. And I told them that when it comes to climate change, there is such a thing as being too late. The effects can be irreversible if we don't act. And that moment is almost here. And you know this better than anybody. I want you to know, as your President, I'm here to make sure that you get the support that you need. But we should be optimistic about what can be accomplished, because there's nothing that we can't do if we work together. America is full of dreamers. We push new frontiers by choice. That's what makes us Americans. Whether we live in the Arctic Circle or on the Hawaiian Islands, whether we're in big cities or small towns, we're one people. And our future is only as good as the efforts that we put into it. <p>But when people are determined and hopeful and generous, as the people here in Kotzebue are, it makes me optimistic. It tells me that this country's best days are still ahead. <p>So I want to thank all of you. I especially want to thank the young people for being here today. Thank you, Kotzebue. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you.\" "
"200" "\"Hi, everybody. I hope most of you are gearing up for a long weekend with family and friends: maybe some barbecues, road trips, or fantasy drafts. But I wanted to take a moment to talk to you about the real meaning of Labor Day, a day we set aside every year to honor the hard-working men and women who fought for so many of the rights that we take for granted today. <p>The 8-hour workday, 40-hour workweek, weekends. Overtime and the minimum wage. Safer workplaces. Health insurance, Social Security, Medicare, and retirement plans. All of those gains were fought for and won by the labor movement, folks who were working not just for a bigger paycheck for themselves, but for more security and prosperity for the folks working next to them as well. That's how we built the great American middle class. <p>And that's the spirit we've been working to restore these past 6&frac12; years. On Friday, we found out that the economy created another 173,000 jobs in August. Over the past 5&frac12; years, our businesses have created 13.1 million new jobs in total, the longest streak of job creation on record. The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 percent, the lowest it's been in 7 years. The American auto industry is on track to sell more cars and trucks this year than it has in more than a decade. Sixteen million Americans have gained the security of health insurance. Seventeen States and about 30 cities and counties have raised the minimum wage. And we've proposed extending overtime protections to as many as 5 million Americans. All of that is progress. <p>Now, this month, Congress has an opportunity to continue that progress. As always, the deadline for Congress to pass a budget is the end of September. Every year. This is not new. And if they don't, they'll shut down the Government for the second time in 2 years. At a time when the global economy faces headwinds and America's economy is a relative bright spot in the world, a shutdown of our Government would be wildly irresponsible. It would be an unforced error that saps the momentum we've worked so hard to build. Plain and simple, a shutdown would hurt working Americans. <p>It doesn't have to happen. If Congress wants to support working Americans and strengthen our middle class, they can pass a budget that invests in, not makes cuts to, the middle class. If they pass a budget with shortsighted sequester cuts that harm our military and our economy, I will veto it. If they make smart investments in our military readiness, our infrastructure, our schools, public health, and research, I'll sign that budget, and they know that. <p>So let's get it done. Our economy doesn't need another round of threats and brinkmanship. Nobody gets to play games with our economy or the middle class I grew up in and you grew up in. Tell Congress to pass a budget that reflects the values we honor on Labor Day: rewarding hard work, giving everybody a fair shot, and working together to give all of our kids a better life. <p>Thanks, everybody, and enjoy your weekend.\" "
"201" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Boston! Well, everybody, have a seat. Everybody, have a seat. Happy Labor Day, everybody. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Thank you. Happy Labor Day to you! <p><i>The President.</i> This is a day where we celebrate the grit, the resilience, and the hard work of America's working families. Let me start by thanking your mayor, Mayor Walsh, who has stood up for working folks for a long time, since before he held this office. You've got two outstanding Senators: Elizabeth Warren in the house and Ed Markey. I brought along our Labor Secretary, Tom Perez, who's fighting for you every day. I know we must have some other Members of Congress here&mdash;I love them&mdash;and labor leaders who have devoted their lives to working Americans. Some of them caught a ride with me on the way over here. Mary Kay Henry from SEIU. Randi Weingarten from AFT. Arturo Rodriguez from UFW. Billy Hite from my hometown of Chicago, from UA. We've got Massachusetts AFL-CIO President, Steve Tolman. And give it up for Rich Rogers and everybody from the Greater Boston Labor Council for hosting this great breakfast. <p>It's always good to be back in Boston, especially when the weather is like this. [<i>Laughter</i>] But pretty soon fall is going to be in the air. Students coming back. Pats kick off on Thursday. Brady is free. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I've got a lot of good memories about this city. As we were driving up past the Commons, I was thinking about when I was a student here. The truth is, I was in the library most of the time, so I didn't get to have as much fun as I should have. <p>A couple years ago, I stood with you as you showed the world that no tragedy can compete with \\"Boston Strong.\\" And then, there was that convention that you hosted back in 2004, before I had a motorcade&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;traffic from Logan was a little tougher back then, but you were kind enough to give a warm Boston welcome to an unknown State senator with a funny name. <p>And it's been 11 years since then. I have added a few gray hairs. I've earned every one of them. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member.</i> Woo! So handsome! <p><i>The President.</i> Oh, see there&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I'm sorry, what was that? <p><i>Audience members.</i> You're handsome! <p><i>The President.</i> There you go. [<i>Laughter</i>] See, now I really feel good. <p>But the words that I spoke that night in 2004 are the same ones that generations of Americans worked for and fought for. That's the belief that America is the most extraordinary of countries: a place only this country, where somebody like me could rise to the heights of political office; a conviction that no matter who you are or what you look like, or how much money you were born into, we can all make something of ourselves. We can clock in at a job that rewards our work with dignity and security. We can give our kids something better if we're willing to work for it, and instill in them the values of hard work and respect for other people, and love of country, and the notion that here in America we're all in it together, that we are the United States of America. We're a Union. <p>And those are the beliefs that built this country. Those are the beliefs that built the strongest middle class the world has ever seen. But it wasn't just beliefs, it wasn't just words, that built the middle class in this country. You've got to say more than America is great and that's it. You've got to work for it. It's not enough just to say America is exceptional. You've got to prove it. You've got to work to keep it that way. And that's what generations of the labor movement have done. It was hard-working Americans who marched and organized to help working families get ahead. It was hard-working folks who demanded not simply a bigger paycheck for themselves, but more security for the folks working next to them too. They were the ones who were out in the cold on picket lines. They were the folks who were dealing with the Pinkertons. They were the folks who sometimes got beat or got fired for organizing; got threatened and stood up for an idea that everybody deserves a fair shake. <p>And those folks&mdash;your parents, grandparents, great-grandparents&mdash;they're the ones who gave us the 40-hour workweek. They're the ones who gave us overtime and the minimum wage and all kinds of things that folks now take for granted. It was those fights that gave us health insurance and Social Security and Medicare and retirement plans. All those gains are union-made. They're stamped with the union label. They're what we celebrate today. <p>And those values that built the middle class&mdash;working people's values, ordinary folks' values&mdash;that's what's guided me every day as President. I came in during the worst recession any of us have ever seen. And we've worked to rebuild our economy on a new foundation&mdash;to make it stronger for everybody. It's working folks who helped power our economy to 66 straight months of private-sector job growth&mdash;the longest streak on record. Five and a half straight years, 13.1 million new jobs overall. The lowest unemployment rate in 7 years. <p>It was working people, middle class values that restored the meaning of the word \\"Made in America,\\" \\"Made in the U.S.A.\\" We had an auto industry that was flat on its back when I came into office. Now we're on track to sell more cars and trucks this year than we have in more than a decade. American manufacturing had been declining for a decade, and then we came in and we nearly created 900,000 jobs in 5&frac12; years. Fastest manufacturing growth that we've seen in a very long time. <p>When I came into office, business leaders said the best place to invest was in China. Well, they don't say that no more. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now the number-one place to invest is right here in the United States of America. That's because we've got the best workers in the world. That's progress. <p>Now, we're entering into political season. I'm so glad I'm not on the ballot. [<i>Laughter</i>] But it's political season. It starts earlier and earlier, and so now we're starting to hear a lot about middle-class values. Everybody wants to talk about the middle class. But some folks seem confused about what exactly that means. So let me provide a refresher course. <p>For me, for us, middle class values means providing tax cuts to 98 percent of Americans, but then asking the top 2 percent to pay a little bit more. That's helping middle class families. For us, middle class values means protecting Main Street from another crisis with the toughest Wall Street reforms in history that your Senators helped to make happen. It means reforming student loans and increasing Pell Grants so every kid can afford a college education. And we've got to keep working to make 2 years of community college free for everybody who's willing to work for it. It means helping 16 million Americans gain the security of health insurance, because nobody in America should have to live in fear of going broke just because they or somebody in their family got sick. That's what it means to us to have middle class values. <p>And we know we've got more work to do to make sure more families feel the gains of this recovery. But the fact is that the verdict is in. Middle class economics works. Looking out for working people works. Bottom-up economics works. Middle class-out economics works. When you make sure everybody gets a fair shot and a fair shake and you're fighting for decent wages for workers and making sure they've got decent benefits, when you reward people who are playing by the rules, that's how everybody does better. That's how America gets ahead. That's how it's always been in this country. <p>Unfortunately, there are some folks in Washington&mdash;and some folks who are trying to get to Washington&mdash;who don't want to face these facts. No matter whether we're supporting working families or signing up folks for health care or anything else that we do, we keep on hearing back from them: \\"Oh, you're going to destroy jobs. You're going to destroy business. You're going to crush freedom. You can't have a minimum wage for people; it's bad for business, bad for jobs. You can't provide people health care; it's going to destroy the economy.\\" <p>In their world, the only way to help the country grow and help people get ahead is to cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires and loosen up rules on big banks and polluters, and then you just wait, and then you look up at the sky, and prosperity will come raining down on us&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;from the top of the whatever high rise is in your city. But that's not how the economy works. That's not how working people get ahead. And that mindset, that ideology is what's been shrinking wages and increasing inequality and wrecking the economy for a long, long time. And we're fighting to reverse it. But these folks are pretty stubborn. I will give them credit; they don't let facts or evidence get in the way. [<i>Laughter</i>] They really don't. <p>And as I said, that&mdash;they're&mdash;Republicans in Washington are trying to rebrand themselves as the party of the middle class. I'm glad they're doing it, really. I mean, I want them to start rethinking their positions on issues. I'd love to work with them on stuff. But you can't just talk the talk, you've got to walk the walk. You can't talk middle class and then do things that hurt the middle class. You can't say you care about working people and then do things that hurt working people. <p>I'll give you an example. Right now Republicans in Washington have the chance to prove they really care about working families. Congress has to pass a budget by the end of this month, or they risk shutting down the Government for the second time in 2 years. Now, everybody knows the world economy is pretty volatile right now. Our economy is a relative bright spot. We're doing better than just about everybody else. So a shutdown would be completely irresponsible. It would be an unforced error, a fumble on the goal line. It would be like a ground ball slipping through somebody's legs. [<i>Laughter</i>] You guys have won a couple since that time, so I can make that joke. If you hadn't had so many World Series wins, I wouldn't make that joke. <p>Point is, it doesn't have to happen. Congress can pass a budget that does away with this so-called sequester that just lops things off whether it's good or not for the economy, harms our military, hurts working people. We could instead invest in working families, invest in our military readiness, invest in our schools, rebuild our roads, rebuild our ports, rebuild our airports, put people back to work right now. I'll sign that budget. I'm ready to work with them. <p>But so far at least, instead of hearing about how we can all move together, what we're hearing from those folks is threats that they might shut down the Government over things that don't even have to do with the budget. Try to stop the budget in order to force us to do something that would restrict women's health care, for example. That's not a good idea. And you're seeing all kinds of mindless proposals that would harm our military readiness and cut job training, cut Head Start, cut preschools, cut K-through-12 education. <p>They're still talking about repealing Obamacare. I mean, they've taken 56 votes to repeal this thing. Everybody says it's working. It's working better than even I expected&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and costing less. And they're still talking about repealing. And what we're seeing from them is this constant war against unions, a constant attack on working Americans, by weakening worker protections, undermining workplace safety, gutting your ability to save for retirement, preventing you from forming a union. <p>I mean, this is a party that says it wants to rebrand itself. I'm going to quote them here. They said they want to be \\"the party of the American worker and the party of higher wages.\\" Well, that's great. But think about it. They oppose raising the minimum wage. They're doing everything they can to bust unions. And then, they want to claim to be the party of the American worker. I&mdash;take a look at some of the folks who want to be their standard bearer in the next election. I won't quote&mdash;I won't say their names, but you can kind of attach the quote to their names. So one candidate, he is bragging about how he destroyed collective bargaining rights in his State. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> And says that busting unions prepares him to fight ISIL. [<i>Laughter</i>] I didn't make that up. That's what he said. Really? A whole bunch of them are hoping to make \\"right to work\\" the law of the land. They think that's the answer to economic prosperity. You had one who blamed unions for the women's pay gap. Think about that. So what if there were no unions, then suddenly women are all going to be paid equal? These are the same folks who fought against equal pay legislation in Congress. <p>And then there was the guy&mdash;these guys are running for office; they're running for the Presidency&mdash;who said a union deserves a punch in the face. [<i>Laughter</i>] Really? Tell me how you really feel. It reminds me of something our old friend Ted Kennedy used to say: \\"What is it about working men and women that [they] find so offensive?\\" Why are they so mad about folks just trying to make a living, keep a roof over their heads, and go to work every day, look after their families, rebuild their community? Why are you mad about that? These are the folks who built America. These are the folks that allowed businesses to prosper. Why are you attacking ordinary people who are just out there trying to do their jobs? <p>I've said it before. I'll say it again: If I were looking for a good job that lets me build some security for my family, I'd join a union. If I wanted somebody who had my back, I'd join a union. I've&mdash;I travel a lot, I've been to countries that don't have unions, that prohibit unions. That's where you've got, still, child labor. That's where you have terrible exploitation, and workers are constantly being injured and hurt, and there are no protections. And no&mdash;and that's true for everybody because there's no union movement. Even Brady is happy he's got a union. [<i>Laughter</i>] They had his back. So you know if Brady needs a union, we definitely need unions. [<i>Laughter</i>] So&mdash;because the fact of the matter is, even kids understand this: You're stronger when you stand together. <p>And job&mdash;and a job is about more than a paycheck. Employees are more than just cogs in a wheel. They're moms and dads with dreams for their kids. They're folks who pick up the extra shift to help out another worker who's in a jam. They're folks who are trying to save for retirement after years of sacrifice. Folks who clock in every morning and stay late to make sure the job is done right and then donate some of that hard-earned money to their church or their YMCA. There's a pride and there's a dignity inherent in any job, whether you've got the security of a union or not. But a union will help express that dignity and that sense of voice in what you do every single day. <p>And I believe that all workplaces should reflect the worth and the dignity of our working families. And that's why we fought for worker safety. That's why we fight for the right to organize. That's why we're hosting a White House Summit on Worker Voice next month&mdash;to make sure that working Americans share in the blessings of this country&mdash;and why people who aren't in unions right now need to understand why unions are so important. It's why last summer we hosted a Working Families Summit to talk about issues like higher pay and fairer pay and childcare and workplace flexibility and paid leave. These things aren't just good for working women and working families, they're good for business too. They're good for the economy as a whole. <p>Now, the good news is, for the past couple of years, working in concert with great Members of Congress like Ed and Elizabeth, we've taken steps to address some issues facing working families. And we've had the cooperation of Governors and mayors in a lot of places. Seventeen States, about 30 cities, have answered the call to raise the minimum wage. I raised wages for Federal contractors. In June, we proposed action to protect a worker's right to overtime, extending protections to as many as 5 million Americans who weren't getting a fair shake when it came to overtime rules. It's a pretty straightforward proposition: If you're working harder and longer, you should get paid for it. <p>I believe that you should be able to talk openly about how much you get paid to make sure everybody is getting paid the same. That's how we know if there's unfairness in the workplace. That's something Lilly Ledbetter had to deal with and helped contribute to the pay gap. So last spring, I acted to combat pay secrecy. Working with Tom Perez, we are finalizing a rule this week that makes sure that what people are getting paid is out there so you know if you're getting cheated. If you find out you're getting shortchanged, you shouldn't live in fear of getting fired because you raise your voice. You should be able to press your claim. <p>And I believe that working Americans should have the basic security of paid leave. Right now we are the only advanced nation on Earth that does not guarantee paid maternity leave. Think about that. You had one study found that nearly one in four working moms return to work within 2 weeks of childbirth. Think about that. Now, for the men in the audience in particular, think about that. We wouldn't even go to work if we had to carry around somebody for 9 months. The human race would evaporate. We couldn't even take it. [<i>Laughter</i>] And then, the notion that after you had that baby, you had to go back to work 2 weeks later. <p>Only 12 percent of our private sector workers have access to paid family leave. We've got millions of people who can't care for a loved one with a serious illness without losing a paycheck or risking their job. And there's a good proposal out there&mdash;the FAMILY Act&mdash;that would deal with some of these issues. I'm calling on Congress: Take a cue from the rest of the world, work together in a bipartisan fashion, find a way to make paid leave&mdash;paid family and medical leave&mdash;a reality for all Americans. That's something we should be doing. It's past time to do it. It will be good for business, not bad for business. <p>And while we're at it, pass a national policy for paid sick days as well. Right now about 40 percent of private-sector workers&mdash;44 million people in America&mdash;don't have access to paid sick leave. You've got parents who have to choose between losing income or staying home with their sick child. You have victims of domestic violence or sexual assault who can't seek medical attention or counseling because they might have their pay docked. Let's face it, nobody wants a waiter who feels like they have to come to work when they're coughing or contagious. But if they don't have sick leave, what are they going to do? They've got to pay the rent. That's not good for anybody. <p>Now, unfortunately, only Congress has the power to give this security to all Americans. But where I can act, I will. And by the way, I just did. As we were flying over here, I signed a new Executive order requiring Federal contractors to allow employees who work on our contracts to earn up to 7 paid sick days a year. This will give about 300,000 working Americans access to paid sick leave for the first time. <p>And it builds on the growing momentum of people who are answering the call on paid leave across the country. Right now you've got dozens of cities&mdash;Pittsburgh, Philly, Atlanta&mdash;who have adopted paid sick leave or paid family leave policies. You've got companies like Hilton; and Johnson and Johnson; and others that are expanding paid leave. Microsoft, Facebook requiring it from their contractors and vendors. And we've seen that many companies, including small businesses, support these policies because they understand it helps with recruitment and retention. It helps you keep good employees. One study in Connecticut shows that three-quarters of companies are on board with their State's paid sick leave law. <p>And here in Massachusetts, you're already ahead of the game. Last fall, folks easily approved paid sick leave throughout the Commonwealth. In May, Mayor Walsh signed an ordinance allowing for up to 6 weeks of paid parental leave for city employees. You all should be proud of what you're doing for working families in this State. <p>But that's not a new story here in Massachusetts. You all have always been a little ahead of the curve. Almost two centuries ago, there were the \\"Mill Girls\\" up in Lowell, the Nation's first union of working women. Folks in Boston helped lead the way to an 8-hour workday. Generation by generation, from the textile and trolley workers to the hotel and parking workers of today, hard-working men and women like all of you in this Commonwealth have stood up for working families. <p>And what's been true in Massachusetts has been true all across the country. You understand that we're stronger together than when we're apart. When we are together, we carry each other up to heights we can't reach on our own. And that's what we honor every day on Labor Day. And whenever I'm with you, I'm optimistic about America, because while I know that it's not going to happen in 1 day or 1 month, won't even be completed under two terms of one President, I know working together we're going to build a better future for ourselves and our kids, and for working families all across the country. I have seen it. You have seen it. And now we've just got to keep working to make it a reality for every single working person in America. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless this country we love. Thank you.\" "
"202" "\"<i>The President.</i> Welcome to the White House, everybody. Hope you all had a good Labor Day. Let's give it up for the National Champion, Duke Blue Devils! We thought about inviting the Cameron Crazies here, but I didn't want any blue paint smudging my walls, so&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;we weren't sure if the risers could take it if they were jumping up and down. So you'll just have to shout and scream from your seats. <p>We've got some big Duke fans here today, including some Members of Congress, our Transportation Secretary, a native of North Carolina, Anthony Foxx. I'd like to recognize the Chairman of Duke's Board of Trustees, David Rubenstein, who's here. Duke President Richard Brodhead is here. Athletic Director Kevin White is here. And an up-and-coming coach named Mike Krzyzewski. [<i>Applause</i>] Hey! <p><i>Audience members.</i> Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! <p><i>The President.</i> [<i>Laughter</i>] We think he has a lot of potential. [<i>Laughter</i>] Although, he does look the same. Have you noticed? There's like that Dorian Gray mirror thing going on somewhere. <p>True to Coach K's Army roots, we've also got Secretary of the Army, John McHugh is here. Where's John? Right here. And our new Chief of Staff of the Army, General Mark Milley, is here as well. <p>So it's good to see the Blue Devils again. This is the second time that I've hosted them here at the White House. It is. [<i>Applause</i>] And my old body man, Reggie Love, played for Coach K, helped me win a lot of pickup games. [<i>Laughter</i>] And then there's Derek Rhodes. Where's Derek? Derek was an intern here last summer before being head manager for the championship run. So a little White House magic rubbed off on this team. I'm just saying. <p>And I can relate to this program. Does well in the classroom. Won twice in the past 4 years. [<i>Laughter</i>] Know what it's like for people to oppose you no matter what you try to do. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, when I flip on ESPN and I see a documentary about how people still \\"hate\\" Christian Laettner&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;a guy who played for Duke 23 years ago, I realize, well, maybe I don't have it so bad. Or I think this is going to be a long 23 years. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But here's the thing. If folks didn't like this year's Blue Devils, they were just being haters because&mdash;or they lived in Chapel Hill. That's a possibility as well. Because these guys were fun. They ran off 14 straight wins to start the season. But by tournament time, they were down to just eight scholarship players: four freshmen and one senior. <p>They had a soft-spoken All-American in the middle, Jahlil Okafor&mdash;from the Chicago area, I might just add&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;whose size and footwork bent defenses in a way that people hadn't seen in a very long time. There was the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player, Tyus Jones&mdash;or \\"Tyus Stones\\"&mdash;because of all the shots he made. [<i>Laughter</i>] There was freshmen Justise Winslow flying all over the place&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;dominating some of the games in the tournament. Senior Quinn Cook provided senior leadership, setting a school all-time assist-to-turnover record. And then, there was Grayson Allen, who just went crazy&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;who clearly didn't know any better and just said, well, I'm going to score eight straight points at the end of a game. <p>And in that championship game against Wisconsin, the four freshmen scored every point in the second half. The Blue Devils shut down the most efficient offense in the country when they needed to. And that lockdown defense&mdash;which, let's face it, had not been evident in every game during the season&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;was the key to Duke's fifth title run. <p>And Coach K described this year's championship as \\"the best moment of his coaching career.\\" And with five career championships, second to only to the legendary John Wooden, that's saying something. Last season, Coach K became the first Division I men's college coach to win 1,000 games. And somehow he did it without ever saying a bad word to a referee. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Head Coach Michael W. Krzyzewski.</i> That's true. That's true. Only what they deserved. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Only what they deserved, he said. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's what I say about some of my opponents. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But everybody knows this program is not just about winning on the hardwood. Five players made the all-conference academic squad this year&mdash;Tyus, Justise, Grayson, Amile Jefferson, and Marshall Plumlee. That is worth applause. Marshall also spent much of this summer in leadership training at Fort Knox as he works to become a commissioned officer in the U.S. Army. So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. I was saying to Marshall, though, I feel bad for his parents trying to pay those grocery bills. When you've got, like, three folks 7 feet, you know they're eating a lot. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's a big grocery bill. <p>This team also visited Durham elementary schools for the \\"Read With the Blue Devils\\" campaign. Coach K authored an op-ed on the importance of early childhood education. Players volunteered as mentors at the Emily Krzyzewski Center, which is named for the Coach's mother and aims to break the cycle of poverty through out-of-school programs that help young people reach college. <p>So this is the kind of program that we hope for at any institution of higher learning. They represent their university well on and off the court. And that's why their fans are so passionate. That's why sometimes there are going to be some haters. [<i>Laughter</i>] But they deserve every accolade. They've got a great leader in Coach K, and it's an outstanding university, an outstanding program, and they deserve our hearty congratulations. Very proud of you guys. <p>Thank you. Good. Coach. <p><i>Coach Krzyzewski.</i> Thank you. Mr. President, thanks for opening up your home. [<i>Laughter</i>] We've been to your house twice, and you've never been to our house. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> We'll have to correct that. <p><i>Coach Krzyzewski.</i> We have to correct that in about a little over a year. <p><i>The President.</i> A little over a year. <p><i>Coach Krzyzewski.</i> And we hope to do that. By the way, the guys already ultimately respect you, but seeing you perform here, once your term is over, \\"Saturday Night Live\\" should have a permanent host, I think. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Comedian in Chief, I could do a good job. <i>Coach Krzyzewski.</i> It would be great. The cool thing about our group was that they were fun. And even the energy that&mdash;when I walk into a room, I always&mdash;like, is it a locker room that needs to be picked up? Or are you already picked up? And you guys are already up. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And&mdash;but that's what these guys did for me and my staff the entire year. And I just want to tell them publicly that we love them, and it was amazing. And thanks for sharing that year with me. And the guys coming back, if you could do that again, I wouldn't mind. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We have loved being here. Last night, David Rubenstein made it available for us to have a dinner at the National Archives, so it was an unbelievable night. And in front of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence, our guys were awarded their championship rings last night. <p><i>The President.</i> That's great. <p><i>Coach Krzyzewski.</i> So that was a cool night. They're pretty big, by the way. <p><i>The President.</i> They are. [<i>Laughter</i>] Show it again. <p><i>Coach Krzyzewski.</i> I'm from Chicago. A little bit of bling is not&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;it's not bad. <p>But the last 24 hours to be in front of&mdash;in that great building, in front of those documents and realizing the great men that started this country, but also then to come here and be in your house. And on behalf of our Duke community, we want to thank you for serving our country over these last two terms. You've been an amazing leader for our country. And it's not just you, but your family and the sacrifices. So thank you very much for your service. [<i>Applause</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. <p><i>Coach Krzyzewski.</i> When we visit&mdash;and you won't have to do this when you visit our house&mdash;but usually, when you visit someone's house, you bring a gift. So we brought a few gifts. And I want to explain them and then going to have Amile and Quinn, our cocaptains, give them. But we have a jersey. <p><i>The President.</i> I need a jersey. <p><i>Coach Krzyzewski.</i> We have a ball, all right. <p><i>The President.</i> You've got a ball. I need a ball. <p><i>Coach Krzyzewski.</i> And we have&mdash;I know you&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The President.</i> My bracket again? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Coach Krzyzewski.</i> No, no. We&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p><i>The President.</i> He did this to me last time. <p><i>Coach Krzyzewski.</i> No, no. But any time you take a test and you put your answers there, you should always want the approved solution. [<i>Laughter</i>] So that&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The President.</i> This is the second time. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Coach Krzyzewski.</i> But the other thing is not material, it's&mdash;I know you can't do it while you're President. But after you're through, we would like to scholarship you to our fantasy camp. [<i>Laughter</i>] We run a fantasy camp. <p><i>The President.</i> Oh, excellent. Yes. [<i>Laughter</i>] <i>Coach Krzyzewski.</i> Reggie said you can play and little&mdash;pound the ball a little bit, is what he said. <p><i>The President.</i> Let's do it. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Coach Krzyzewski.</i> But for 35&mdash;but for guys 35 and older. <p><i>The President.</i> Yes. I'll dominate. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Coach Krzyzewski.</i> He's not unlike the other 80 guys who come&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and then, they find out the truth. [<i>Laughter</i>] But anyway, you have a scholarship. <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. I'm honored. Thank you. <p><i>Coach Krzyzewski.</i> Yes. But again, thank you for inviting us for this very, very special day. And if Quinn and Amile&mdash;will you guys come down? If you guys would come in and present that. You can leave the bracket. That was a joke. <p>[<i>At this point, guard Quinn Cook and forward Amile Jefferson presented the gifts to the President.</i>] <p><i>The President. </i>Thank you so much. Fantastic. Thank you. Let's strike the podium, and we'll get good pictures in. Come on, guys.\" "
"203" "\"<i>The President.</i> All right. Hello, Michigan! Oh, it's good to be back at Macomb. Go, Monarchs! <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. I do. Yeah! <p>I want to begin by thanking your president, Jim Jacobs, for hosting us. We have got also two outstanding members of Congress here who support every single initiative that we've got here in the state of Michigan. We've got Sandy Levin and Brenda Lawrence. We've got your mayor, James Fouts, here. [<i>Applause</i>] Well, somebody was really excited about you, James. [<i>Laughter</i>] And of course, we've got my favorite community college professor, Dr. Jill Biden, here. Jill was not fibbing; on Air Force One, she was grading papers. [<i>Laughter</i>] She was. And I was&mdash;I had flashbacks to when I was teaching law and grading papers. It's not as bad as writing papers&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but reading them is tough too, sometimes. <p>Jill works with Michelle to support our military families. She's leading the new College Promise Advisory Board. On top of that, she teaches full time at a community college in Virginia. And her husband is not so bad either. [<i>Laughter</i>] He's okay. Love Joe Biden. <p>The&mdash;so, across our country, young people&mdash;and some just young-at-heart people&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p><i>Audience member</i>. All right, all right. <p><i>The President</i>. You're young, you're young&mdash;are going back to school. Just yesterday Malia started her first day of senior year. You know, I was sitting in her room because I was going to see her off her first day of school. She puts her head on my shoulder, and she says, \\"Daddy, you know, you realize this is probably going to be the last time that you ever send me off for my first day of school.\\" <p><i>Audience members.</i> Aww. <p><i>The President.</i> And I started&mdash;I had to look away. You know? I didn't want to just be such a crybaby. [<i>Laughter</i>] It makes no sense. Michelle and I are way too young to have daughters both&mdash;who are both almost in college now. And so as a parent, I was a little freaked out. <p>But as President, this time of year does inspire me, because students like the ones here are not just making the best investment in your future, but you're also making the best possible investment in the country's future. If you put in the hard work to earn your education, then it's up to all of us to make sure that hard work pays off. And that's something that I'm going to be focusing on over the next couple of weeks. <p>You see, education has always been the secret sauce, the secret to America's success. More than 150 years ago, Abraham Lincoln helped establish land-grant colleges all across America. About a hundred years ago, we started moving from an agrarian economy, a farm economy, to an industrial economy. And we became the first country in the world to say that every child deserves a shot at a high school education, even if they weren't born rich. And it's because we were ahead of the curve that we ended up having the most educated workforce. And that was good for the entire economy and good for businesses. <p>After World War II, we gave returning heroes like my grandfather the chance to go to college on the GI bill. And in those postwar years, the investments that we made in our future made us the best educated nation on Earth. That's one of the reasons we built the world's largest economy. That's the reason we built the biggest, strongest middle class. And in places like Macomb County, you could feel secure, knowing that if you worked hard, you'd have a chance to find a good job, buy a home, raise a family, send your kids to college. We didn't promise everybody that they'd get rich, but we promised that everybody who worked hard would have a chance to get ahead and have the dignity of a decent-paying job with decent-paying benefits. That's what it meant to be middle class. <p>Now, in more recent decades, the economy has begun to change again. And other countries have caught up. Good jobs, in some cases, went overseas. And rather than redouble our efforts to make ourselves once again at the cutting edge and educate more and more of our young people, we decided to cut taxes for the very top. We stopped investing as much as we needed to in higher education. Tuition started going up because State legislators were providing less support. Folks who were already doing extraordinarily well, they did even better, but prosperity didn't trickle down to the middle class, which was working harder than ever. And then, finally, in 2008, a crisis spread all the way from Wall Street out to Main Street that cost millions of Americans their jobs, their homes, their savings&mdash;everything that they had worked so hard to build all their lives. <p>So we, together, have spent the last 7 years fighting back, getting focused on middle class economics once again. Today, our businesses have created more than 13 million new jobs over the last 5&frac12; years. This is the longest streak of job creation on record: 66 straight months of job creation. So the unemployment rate is now at 5.1 percent, which is the lowest it's been since April of 2008. Another 16 million Americans have the security of health insurance. Our high school dropout rate is at an alltime low. More Americans are graduating college than ever before. <p>And something that's relevant to this area, because we refused to walk away from the American auto industry, our autoworkers, our automakers are on track to sell more cars and trucks this year than we have done in more than a decade. Workers right here in Michigan who thought they might never build a car again, they can't build them fast enough now. Chrysler has added more than a thousand jobs at the truck plant right down the road. In May, GM announced plans to invest $1 billion at its Warren Tech Center, adding 2,600 new jobs. <p>So we placed our bets on American businesses and American workers, and that bet is paying off. Michigan is coming back. America is coming back. Detroit is coming back too. I mean, I don't know how the Lions are going to be this year, but I'm talking about the economy&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> Super Bowl! <p><i>Audience member.</i> Bears! <p><i>The President.</i> Okay. Yes. The Bears too, yes. [<i>Laughter</i>] Oh, uh-oh. Watch it now. I've got Secret Service. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But look, it's not enough to get back to where we were. It's good that we've recovered, but for the sake of future generations, we've got to do better than that. The biggest problem we have right now in today's economy is that although we're creating jobs, the unemployment rate is down, inequality is still creeping up. A lot of times the jobs aren't paying enough. Wages are still flat. <p><i>Audience member.</i> I know. <p><i>The President.</i> I know. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, some of that has to do with the fact that companies that are making record profits just aren't sharing enough of those profits with their workers. And that's a problem. And in some cases, our tax policies continue to incentivize jobs moving overseas. <p>But a big part of making sure that today's economy works better for ordinary folks goes back to what I started with: this issue of education. Every American willing to work hard should have a shot at a higher education. Because as the economy globally becomes more competitive, everybody has got to upgrade their skills just a little bit. Right? It's not enough just to have the same skills for 30 years, because what worked 30 years ago isn't going to work now and what works now is not going to work 5 years from now or 10 years from now, because everything is moving too fast. And if you don't have the skills to get the new jobs that pay better, if you don't have the knowledge to adapt and be creative with new machinery, new systems, new techniques, you're going to fall behind. And then, the wages for unskilled work will go down, and you'll be trapped. <p>Compared to those with a high school diploma, college graduates earn about $1 million more over the course of their lifetimes. That's a lot of money, a million dollars. Even today. If you have a degree from a 2-year college, you earn $10,000 a year more than somebody who only finished high school. So one study found that over their lifetimes, workers who complete an on-the-job apprenticeship earn around $300,000 more than their peers who didn't go through an apprenticeship program. So whether it's through a community college, an apprenticeship program, upgrading your skills pays off. The unemployment rate for those folks are lower, and they're going to earn more money over their lifetimes. <p>By the end of the decade, two in three job openings will require some form of postsecondary education, some form of higher education. Now, you don't have to necessarily to go to a 4-year college to get a good job, but you have to have some sort of specialized skill in order for you to advance. It's not enough just to be strong and willing to work. It used to be you walked into an auto plant, and you said, look, I'm going to get to work on time. I don't mind getting dirty. I'm willing to work hard. And that was enough. It helped, by the way, that there were strong unions. And that's a whole&mdash;I talked about that during Labor Day, by the way. <p>Part of what gives workers more leverage to get higher pay when the company is making a lot of money is, is that they've got a union behind them. <p>But whether it is a bachelor's degree, an associate's degree, a journeyman's card from an apprenticeship program, having a credential above and beyond your high school diploma, that's the surest ticket to the middle class. And in global competition for jobs and industries, having the best educated workforce in the world is the surest way for America to stay on top. <p>So that's why I believe no kid should be priced out of a college education. No hard-working young person should be denied a shot at success just because of where they started out in life. Because you don't know&mdash;that's the thing about America, where you start off doesn't determine where you're going to end up. I was the child of a single mom. And we weren't rich, and I turned out okay. But the reason is, I got an education. Same thing with Michelle, same thing with Jill Biden, same thing with a lot of you. And that's why, since I took office, we've increased Pell grants for low-income students by 70 percent. We've helped over 2 million more young people afford college. We created a new college opportunity tax credit for working families, averaging about $1,800 a year. With our new GI bill for our veterans, our heroes coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan, we've helped more than 700,000 veterans and their family members earn a college education. <p>We took on a student loan system that was letting big banks be the middlemen on student loans. And so they were taking $10 billion&mdash;tens of billions of dollars in unnecessary subsidies; we said we'll cut out the middlemen, give the money directly to our students, the folks who need it. <p>And back in 2009, when I had no gray hair&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I had a little bit, but you couldn't see it. [<i>Laughter</i>] And now you can see it. I still look good though? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes! <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. I was fishing for that compliment. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member.</i> Better now. <p><i>The President.</i> Better? Okay. [<i>Laughter</i>] Where was I? [<i>Laughter</i>] I got all flushed. I was blushing a little bit. <p>Back in 2009, I came here, and I announced my plan to invest in community colleges like this one. And sometimes, it can feel like 4-year colleges get all the attention, but that has to change. And I've tried to make sure that it changes. I have been focused on community colleges. They're at the heart of the American Dream. Community colleges are everywhere. They're accessible. They're a gateway for folks who&mdash;maybe their parents didn't go to college, maybe they can't afford a 4-year college, maybe they&mdash;the career path they want to follow isn't the traditional one. <p>This becomes the kind of place where you can earn the skills you need to start a great career right away. It's the kind of place where you don't have to choose between pursuing an education and supporting a family; you can do both because it's flexible. It gives folks who have to start working right away the chance to also get a skill or a degree. <p>It's the kind of place where young people can save money before they start a 4-year school&mdash;they can transfer their credits&mdash;a place where older workers can retool and retrain, take their careers to the next level. <p>Over the last 7 years, America has been graduating more students from community colleges than ever before. But I'm not satisfied. We can go further. So in my State of the Union Address, I announced my plan to bring down the cost of community college to zero. Zero. <p>For every young person willing to work hard, I want 2 years of college to be as free and universal as high school is today. I mean, back in the day, there were kids who got high school educations if they had a lot of money. But the point was, we realized, no, we want to make everybody educated. That will be good for all of us. And that's what we did. Well, I want to do the same thing now for community college educations. <p>It's easy for politicians to say that all of you are the future. You know? Every speech, right, is all you guys are the future. But it's not good enough just to say it. You've got to walk the walk, not just talk the talk. So this is a concrete way&mdash;a concrete way&mdash;to reduce the costs of higher education for young people, to improve the skills of workers so they get higher paying jobs, to grow our economy. It shouldn't be controversial. <p>And I want to work with folks back in Washington, both Democrats and Republicans, to pass a responsible budget that invests in you. If students and workers and businesses live up to their responsibilities, we should be able to make it easier for you to succeed. <p>And by the way, in my original budget what I said was, it does cost some money to make 2 years of community college free. I said, well, the Federal Government will help States and counties and local communities, and we'll pay for it by closing up some of these corporate tax loopholes that don't help grow the economy and aren't fair anyway. <p>Now, unfortunately, so far at least, I've gotten a little resistance from Members of Congress. That will shock you. [<i>Laughter</i>] But at a time when we should be growing our investments in job training and apprenticeships, we've got Republicans in Congress who are going in the opposite direction. Some are even talking about shutting down the Government at the end of the month. That's what would happen if Congress fails to pass a budget. It would be wildly irresponsible. I mean, right now our economy is actually a bright spot in a pretty volatile world economy. After all the hard work American&mdash;the American people have done to get us back on our feet, to recover from that great recession, now is not the time to play games. You'd pull the rug right from under the economy. But there's a lot of talk about that in Washington for unrelated reasons that, by the way, don't even have to do with the budget. They have to do with politics and Presidential elections and posturing and all that good stuff. <p>Here's the good news. Investing in community colleges should be a cause that can get bipartisan support, because both parties have supported it in the past. Outside of Washington, away from Congress, people are stepping up. <p>So this fall, Tennessee is enrolling 15,000 students in its community college program. Not one of them had to take out a loan to pay for tuition. Just in the last 6 months, 6 more States and communities have created new programs to provide free community college, including one in Milwaukee just announced today. More than 10 others have introduced new legislation to get this done. So there's a movement going on here. It's an idea whose time has come: Free community college for responsible students. It's an idea that makes sense. <p>Now, to help more States adopt that idea, as Jill mentioned, we're announcing a new, independent College Promise Advisory Board. It's going to be led by two outstanding leaders: Dr. Jill Biden and former Republican Governor Jim Geringer. And they're going to work with businesses and charities and colleges and labor groups and nonprofits to make sure every young person who works hard has a shot at a great education. <p>And if you want more information&mdash;because we're going to need grassroots support for this idea&mdash;we want you to go to the website, headsupamerica.us&mdash;headsupamerica.us. And we call it Heads Up America because we're giving folks a heads-up. If you want a great shot at a good-paying job, then community college might be the right path for you. And if you work hard, then community college should be free. <p>Of course, we don't just want every student to be able to attend community college, we want them to attend a great community college. And that's the other reason I came back to Macomb. All right? This is one of the best, most innovative community colleges in the country. Under your president's leadership, you work directly with local employers and labor unions to make sure students are getting the skills that they need to get a job right now. You help students find support for their housing and childcare so that it's easier to stay in school. Your early childhood&mdash;or early college programs gives high school students the chance to take college courses and earn credits towards a degree. <p>Whenever you can, you help students get out of the classroom and get hands-on training for jobs that need to be filled right now. You're learning tech skills, advanced manufacturing skills. And instead of taking on more debt for this training, a lot of you are already drawing a paycheck. That's the kind of education you want. <p>So we want to give workers across America the same chance that you have to get real-world experience that leads directly to a good job. The average starting wage for a worker who's finished an apprenticeship is now more than $50,000 a year. And by the way, our competitors understand how important these programs are to their economies. On a per capita basis, England has 15 times as many apprentices as we do. Germany has 16 times as many. So that's giving them a leg up when it comes to filling jobs of the future. <p>Now, if England and Germany can do it&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I mean, listen, I love the English and the Germans. I'm just saying, this isn't that hard. It's not rocket science. It requires some political will. So today we're taking action to change that. <p>My administration has already made the largest investment in apprenticeships in nearly a decade. We're going to build on that momentum with $175 million in grants to 46 apprenticeship programs all across the country. And here at Macomb, together with Grand Rapids Community College, Macomb is going to work with partners across the region to give you more opportunities to \\"earn as you learn.\\" Just down the road, Focus: HOPE is going to help folks living in Detroit earn new jobs or get better paying jobs. <p>Across America, companies like Northrup Grumman and Rolls Royce will help prepare workers for jobs in advanced manufacturing. You've got companies like Cisco that are helping them to prepare for jobs in IT. Companies like Pfizer will help prepare them for jobs in health care. Unions like the UAW and the AFL-CIO are going to help workers earn new jobs or better paying ones. <p>So this thing is something everybody can get behind. When our businesses are creating good jobs and our community colleges and training programs are helping workers get the skills they need to fill those jobs, you can't stop us. There's nothing we can't accomplish. <p>You know, just over 30 years ago, as part of his reelection campaign, President Ronald Reagan came right here to Macomb Community College. Here's what he told young people in the field house that day. \\"Our duty,\\" he said, \\"is to make sure that you have the same America of opportunity and hope and dreams and future that we had when we were your age.\\" Now, Ronald Reagan and I belonged to two different parties. We had a different vision about how our economy could grow. But I agree with those words. In America, it should not matter who you are, where you come from, what your last name is, who you love. Everybody deserves a chance to make it. Everybody deserves \\"opportunity and hope and dreams and future.\\" <p>And today, with a record streak of job growth and an auto industry that's back on its feet and wages that are starting to finally rise a little bit, I've never been more optimistic about America. We are not there yet. We've got more work to do. But if we just keep on building on the progress that we've already made, if we keep restoring the link between hard work and success, then we won't just recover from that recession that we had, we're not just going to retrain a workforce, we're going to renew our Nation's promise. We're going to rebuild our middle class. We'll remind the world why it is that America is the greatest country on Earth. <p>Thank you, Michigan. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"204" "\"Well, I am joined today not only by Secretary John Kerry, but by an incredible group of veterans who have served our Nation proudly in different services, different ranks, from infantrymen to some of our top generals, who served in Iraq, who served in Afghanistan. And we also have two Gold Star mothers here whose sons gave everything, that last full measure of devotion, on behalf of American security. I want to begin by thanking all of them for their extraordinary service and sacrifices. <p>These veterans have come together in their defense of our national security. They believe in maintaining the strongest military the world has ever known. They are proud of our military capabilities and recognize that there are times when it is necessary that we take military action and go to war. What they also understand is that American power relies as well on strong and principled diplomacy. <p>And that's why, working together, they have been active and instrumental in promoting the need for us to implement this Iran deal. They do so not because they trust Iran; they do so not because they fail to recognize the real dangers that Iran in the past has posed and continues to pose to regional stability; but they do so because they understand that our ability to solve a massive national security problem and prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons without resort to war is a historic achievement and has to be pursued. <p>And I just had a chance to thank them for their efforts because I'm absolutely convinced that their willingness and ability to tell their stories to Members of Congress, to describe the losses they've experienced of Army buddies or families members, to be able to describe what they've seen as the costs of war has allowed, I think, a lot of Members who may be feeling political pressure from different directions to remember what a sober and important decision this has been, and it's allowed&mdash;created the space for us to be able to make an argument on the merits as to why this deal is right for the American people and our allies and the safety and security of the world. <p>There are times where, in a debate like this, we hear a lot of loose talk, casual threats of military force, false promises that military actions will be easy or simple or relatively costless. These veterans and their families remind us that that is not the case. They know the consequences when we rush into war. They understand what it means when we act without broad international support and when we fail to consider unintended consequences. <p>And I want to repeat: None of them are under any illusions. They understand that this is a dangerous world. And it is precisely for that reason that they want to make sure Iran doesn't get a nuclear weapon. And what I indicated to them is that even as this debate winds down, I am hopeful that their voices continue to be heard on a wide range of foreign policy debates. Because we live in a complicated world and we live in a world where terrible things happen, and American leadership is going to be vital in addressing those issues. <p>But the one principle that I want us to remember every time we make a decision is that American power is not restricted just to our military actions, that we have a lot of tools in the toolkit, and that we have to try to solve problems without resort to military force, understanding that at the end of the day, there may be times where we have to act militarily, but we don't do so as a first resort, and we certainly don't do so on the basis of political considerations. Because the sacrifices are too significant, and the stakes are too high. And I think these veterans and Gold Star family members, they can remind us of that each and every day. <p>I will continue over the next 14 months to have to make some tough decisions, in concert with Secretary Kerry and Secretary Carter and the rest of my national security team. I guarantee, the next President is going to continue to be confronted with difficult decisions. And as we lead into this next political season, I just hope that everybody is listening to the veterans around this room and the organizations that they represent, because I think the American people will be well served if they're hearing from the perspective of those who actually fight and the moms who will be visiting Arlington to remember and be with their children. That kind of sobriety in our foreign policy decisionmaking, I think, is necessary and useful. <p>And so, to all of you, I want to thank you very much for everything you've done. All right? <p>Thank you, guys.\" "
"205" "\"<i>The President</i>. Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat, have a seat. I always do pretty good with writers and scientists. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's sort of my crew. <p>Hello, everybody. <p><i>Audience members</i>. Hello. <p><i>The President</i>. On behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the White House for one of our favorite events of the year&mdash;love this event&mdash;when truly extraordinary artists and innovators and thinkers are recognized for their brilliance while the rest of us look on and feel totally inadequate. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to start by thanking a few members of our audience who help sustain the arts and the humanities in America. We have Members of Congress here. We have National Endowment for the Arts Chairman Jane Chu. Where's Jane? There she is. The National Endowment for the Humanities Chairman, Bro Adams, is here. And the Cochairs of the Presidential Committee on Arts and Humanities, George Stevens and Margo Lions. There they are. <p>One of our great poets, Emily Dickinson, once said that \\"truth is such a rare thing, it is delightful to tell it.\\" The truth is so rare, it is delightful to tell it. And that's especially true in Washington. [<i>Laughter</i>] The men and women that we honor today, recipients of the National Medals for the Arts and the Humanities, are here not only because they've shared rare truths, often about their own experience, but because they've told rare truths about the common experiences that we have as Americans and as human beings. <p>They span mediums and methods. We have artists, actors, writers, musicians, historians, a landscape architect, and a chef. Without them there would be no Edible Schoolyard&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;no Jhumpa Lahiri novels, no really scary things like \\"Carrie\\" and \\"Misery.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>They are versatile&mdash;poets and opera singers who were also master teachers at liberal arts colleges and Detroit Public Schools; philosophers who wrote novels. They are visual artists who work filling pages that spilled over to screens, three-dimensional gallery floors, and most of a New York City block. <p>And they all have one thing in common: They do what they do because of some urgent inner force, some need to express the truth that they experience, that \\"rare truth.\\" And as a result, they help us understand ourselves in ways that we might not otherwise recognize. They deepen and broaden our great American story and the human story. <p>So we celebrate writers like Larry McMurtry, who grew up on a Texas ranch without books, but went on to pen a multitude of memoirs and essays, more than 30 novels, and cowrote screenplays for films like \\"Brokeback Mountain.\\" He wrote about the Texas he knew from his own life, and then the old West as he heard it through the stories of his grandfather's&mdash;on his grandfather's porch. And in \\"Lonesome Dove,\\" the story of two ex-Texas Rangers in the 19th century, readers found out something essential about their own souls, even if they'd never been out West or been on a ranch. <p>We celebrate historians like Everett Fly, who studied to become both a building and landscape architect and who got his start studying forgotten African American towns and communities. Deep in the stacks of the National Archives, he encountered a map of a Freedman's Village that is now Arlington National Cemetery, which inspired him to research further. \\"Once I got to the National Archives and saw all of those records,\\" Everett says, \\"I knew I just had to keep on working.\\" And because he kept on working, we have come to know some 1,300 African American and Native American towns and structures across our country. <p>We celebrate incomparable musicians like Meredith Monk, who has been making music with the instrument of her voice for 50 years. Her singular blend of harmonies, yowls, rasps&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;have punctuated concert halls and films, as well as the performances of her fellow recipients here today. \\"I've been in fashion and out of fashion,\\" she says. I can relate to that. [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"I just keep on trucking along. It's an inner necessity to work, and that's not going to change. I need to create.\\" I need to create. <p>I suspect those are words that every honoree here has felt throughout their lives. And as individuals, as a nation, we are beneficiaries of that need. Fifty years ago this month, right here at the White House, President Johnson signed the Arts and Humanities Bill into law and created the NEA and the NEH. At the time, he said, \\"In countless American towns there live thousands of obscure and unknown talents. What this bill really does is to bring active support to this great national asset.\\" <p>Half a century later&mdash;because of their raw talent and their passion and their need to create, but also because our country invests in the arts and the humanities as great national assets&mdash;some of those once obscure and unknown talents are rightly being recognized. That's what we celebrate here today&mdash;our fellow citizens, from all walks of life, who share their gifts with all of us, who make our lives and our world more beautiful, and richer, and fuller, and I think, most importantly, help us understand each other a little bit better. They help us connect. <p>And, as Emily Dickinson would say, that is the truth. It's delightful to tell. Or in the words of one of the recipients today, we like you. We really like you. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now it is my privilege to present these medals to each of our recipients as their citations are read by my Military Aide. And I'm going to stand right here. <p>[<i>At this point, Lt. Cmdr. Jillian C. Malzone, USCG, Coast Guard Aide to the President read the citations, and the President presented the medals, assisted by Maj. Wesley N. Spurlock III, USAF, Air Force Aide to the President.</i>] <p>Let's give one more big round of applause to our outstanding recipients. [<i>Applause</i>]. Yay! <p>So, obviously, we are extraordinarily honored to be able to just provide this moment of recognition to just some outstanding artists and writers and historians and actresses. We are grateful for the joy that you've brought us, and I'm grateful that I've gotten promises for at least a couple of signed books. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I think Alice said she's going to cook me something. [<i>Laughter</i>] So nothing unethical, just a little bit of&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but I want everybody to enjoy the White House. We're not kicking you out right away. [<i>Laughter</i>] I think that there's a wonderful reception to be had here. <p>And once again, on behalf of Michelle and myself, let me just say thank you to all of you for everything that you've done for us. Okay? Thank you very much.\" "
"206" "\"Hi, everybody. Next week marks 7 years since a financial crisis on Wall Street that would usher in some hard years for working families on Main Street. Soon after that, I took office. And we set out to rebuild our economy on a new foundation for growth and prosperity by investing in things that grow our middle class: things like jobs, health care, and education. <p>Today, our businesses have created more than 13 million new jobs over the last 5&frac12; years. The unemployment rate is the lowest it's been in more than 7 years. Another 16 million Americans have gained health insurance. Our high school graduate rate is the highest it's ever been, and more people are graduating from college than ever before. We are coming back and stronger. <p>Still, in an economy that's increasingly based on knowledge and innovation, some higher education is the surest ticket to the middle class. By the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education. And that's one reason why a degree from a 2-year college will earn you $10,000 more each year than someone who only finished high school. One study showed that a degree from a 4-year university earns you $1 million more over the course of a lifetime. <p>The country with the best educated workforce in the world is going to win the 21st-century economy. I want that to be America. But as college costs and student debt keep rising, the choices that Americans make when searching for and selecting a college have never been more important. That's why everyone should be able to find clear, reliable, open data on college affordability and value, like whether they're likely to graduate, find good jobs, and pay off their loans. Right now, however, many existing college rankings reward schools for spending more money and rejecting more students at a time when America needs our colleges to focus on affordability and supporting all students who enroll. That doesn't make sense, and it has to change. <p>So today my Administration is launching a new College Scorecard, designed with input from those who will use it the most: students, families, and counselors. Americans will now have access to reliable data on every institution of higher education. You'll be able to see how much each school's graduates earn, how much debt they graduate with, and what percentage of a school's students can pay back their loans, which will help all of us see which schools do the best job of preparing America for success. And to reach more folks, we're working with partners in the academic, nonprofit, and private sectors that will help families use this new data to navigate the complicated college process and make informed decisions. <p>The status quo serves some colleges and the companies that rank them just fine. But it doesn't serve always our students well, and that doesn't serve any of us well. There are colleges dedicated to helping students of all backgrounds learn without saddling them with debt. We should hold everybody to that standard. Our economic future depends on it. <p>Now, this work is just beginning. In the coming weeks and months, we'll continue to improve the Scorecard based on what we learn from students, parents, counselors, and colleges themselves. The goal is to help everybody who's willing to work for a higher education search for and select a college that fits their goals. Together, we can make sure that every student has the chance to get a great education and achieve their full potential. <p>Thanks, everybody. And have a great weekend.\" "
"207" "\"Everybody, have a seat. Welcome to the White House. And welcome back to the&mdash;surprisingly enough&mdash;NCAA Champions, the UConn Huskies! We have some rabid Members of Congress here today. And not only do we have the&mdash;some of the current delegation, but we also have Connecticut's own former Senator Chris Dodd here. <p>We have the chairman of the University of Connecticut's Board of Trustees, Larry McHugh is here. Give him a big round of applause. The Huskies' athletic director, Warde Manuel, who is having a pretty good run, it appears. And a frequent visitor and friend to the White House, Coach Geno Auriemma. <p>As some of you may be aware, this is Coach's 10th championship. This is this team's third visit in a row. They are now certified to provide White House tours. [<i>Laughter</i>] I was telling folks, this is becoming like the annual Christmas tree lighting. [<i>Laughter</i>] We do this every year around this time. <p>Now, last season began with something unusual for these Huskies, which was a loss. In their second game, Stanford needed overtime to snap UConn's 47-game winning streak. For this team, it was just a wakeup call. There was, as Associate Head Coach Chris Dailey would say, no dilly and no dally. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So Breanna Stewart, the National Player of the Year 2 years in a row&mdash;she has game&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;she reminded everybody how hard this team works to be the best. She said, \\"We make it look easier than it is, but it comes with a lot of hard work. We don't just step on the court and get the trophy. We have to get better. Each year, it seems there is someone else trying to test us and push us to our breaking point.\\" <p>So Breanna may have been Player of the Year, but she was far from alone. This group of young women understand the concept of team. And this team was loaded. Kia Nurse. Morgan Tuck. Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, who I will not challenge in a \\"horse\\" game. [<i>Laughter</i>] The Huskies' point guard in the past two championships, Moriah Jefferson, who's got speed. After they won this last championship game, Moriah said: \\"I think this one for me is by far the most exciting. It's definitely one of the ones that means the most because we had to fight so hard.\\" <p>And so now, here they are. And like my daughters, they apparently like Beyonc&eacute;, and they are now running the world. <p>That competitive spirit extends to their marathon Uno tournaments in the locker room. Kiah Stokes, one of the hardest working players on and off the court, is the reigning locker room Uno champion. Raise&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. Go ahead and&mdash;she's proud of that. They're also academic all-stars. These women won an award for achieving the highest GPA of any women's basketball team in their conference, and half the team made the Dean's List. So that deserves a big round of applause. [<i>Applause</i>] Way to go. I do&mdash;you know, when I see the men's teams, generally I say, you know, have you paid attention to the women's teams? [<i>Laughter</i>] And they go, yeah. [<i>Laughter</i>] Over the past 4 years, every Husky who has completed their 4 years of eligibility at UConn has graduated. And that's something worth celebrating. <p>These women are also all-stars in their communities. They run Thanksgiving and winter food drives. They help stock shelves at local food banks. They put on a Christmas party for children with terminal illnesses. They spend their afternoon with senior citizens. They host basketball clinics and bike drives for kids in downtown Hartford. <p>So they are outstanding basketball players, more importantly, outstanding citizens, outstanding role models for our kids and not just for our girls, but also for our boys. They are fun to be with, I've gotten used to it. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I couldn't be prouder of them. <p>And I always say this, but it bears repeating: When I've got two daughters who are tall and gorgeous and athletic, for them to know that they've got a whole bunch of people ahead of them who are doing great stuff, it empowers them, and it makes me feel very proud to be with these outstanding young women. <p>So congratulations to all the Huskies. I don't want to jinx it: No team has ever won four in a row. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm just saying. [<i>Laughter</i>] You get here one more time, we might have to name the White House Basketball Court after you, or at least, you can guide the tour. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So with that, let me have Coach Auriemma say a few words. And as I said before, no bunny ears this time. [<i>Laughter</i>] All right.\" "
"208" "\"Well, these three gentlemen really don't need any introduction. I think all of you are familiar with the incredible story of three high school friends who were getting together&mdash;two of whom had served in uniform on behalf of the United States Armed Forces&mdash;thinking that they were just going to have a fun reunion up in Paris and ended up engaging a potential catastrophic situation and pinning down someone who clearly was intent on doing a lot of harm to a lot of people and inflicting terror on the French people. <p>Because of their courage, because of their quick thinking, because of their teamwork, it's fair to say that a lot of people were saved and a real calamity was averted. And the French people have already bestowed on them the highest honor that they can&mdash;the Legion of Honor&mdash;at a ceremony presided over by President Hollande of France. I had an opportunity to talk to him, and he told me that he could not have been more grateful for what these three outstanding young Americans did. <p>And I just wanted to make sure that, having talked to them on the phone right after the event, that I had a chance to shake their hands in person and tell them what I think they've heard from a lot of people, which is, they represent the very best of America: American character. And it's these kinds of young people who make me extraordinarily optimistic and hopeful about our future. <p>And I want to thank each and every one of them and wish them well. I'm glad to see that Spencer, apparently, his hand is in pretty good shape and making real progress. And he intends to continue to pursue his work in medicine and caring for people. Anthony is interested in sports medicine and therapy. And Aleksander, as soon as he is finished on \\"Dancing With the Stars\\"&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;plans to get into law enforcement. <p>Whatever they do, they're going to do it well. And we just want to say thank you to them for not only saving so many lives, but also for making America look so good. All right? <p><i>Mr. Sadler.</i> Thank you, sir. <p><i>Mr. Skarlatos.</i> Thank you. <p><i>Mr. Stone. </i>Thank you. <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. Come on, let's get one more&mdash;we'll get one good picture with everybody.\" "
"209" "\"Hello, everybody! Hello, hello, hello. Everybody, please have a seat, have a seat. Have a seat. Well, I just wanted to stop by&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and just say thank you, because we have in this audience some people who are doing outstanding work on behalf of criminal justice reform. I want to thank Angie for the introduction. I want to recognize a couple of Members of Congress who are here, who have been great champions of this. Congresswoman Frederica Wilson from the great State of Florida. And a great champion of this issue, he is working tirelessly in the Senate to advance some important legislation, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey. <p>We also have former Attorney General and buddy of mine, Eric Holder. I know our current Attorney General I think had to leave a little bit earlier, but obviously is deeply involved in these efforts. I want to thank Shane Smith and everybody at VICE for the great work and efforts that they've made in the production of what you're going to be seeing here today. And then there's a guy named Al Sharpton over here. [<i>Laughter</i>] What's up, Al? He's been working on these issues for a while. <p>America spends $80 billion a year keeping folks locked up. We represent 5 percent of the world's population, 25 percent of its inmates. That's not an indicator that we want to be the leader in. Keep in mind that I'm the father of two kids, and I care about them being safe, and I am fiercely protective of them. And I think it is important for all of us to recognize that in too many communities, crime destroys lives and hope and opportunity, and we cannot diminish the impact of crime. And I think everybody here recognizes that we have to have a criminal justice system that is effective and that prosecutes individuals in a fair way to ensure that we as a society are able to maintain peace and order and security. That's not something that anybody here would argue against. <p>But what we also know is that for too many individuals, particularly nonviolent offenders caught up in an environment in which drugs are pervasive and opportunity is lacking, the punishment does not fit the crime. <p>Too often, prosecutions, arrests are not being applied in a way that reflects our belief in equality under the law. And the effects of this mass incarceration ripple through families and communities, especially communities of color in ways that are not just a problem of the here and now, but continue across generations. So as a society, we have to acknowledge that there is something wrong when we are locking up this many folks with this kind of frequency, concentrated in a handful of communities in cities and towns and counties across this country. <p>And that's why, in July, I visited the El Reno Federal penitentiary in Oklahoma&mdash;the first President, apparently, to have ever visited a prison&mdash;because the people in these prisons are deserving of our attention. They're human beings with hopes and dreams, who in many cases have made profound mistakes, but are American citizens nonetheless. <p>It was interesting, during that visit, we had a chance to meet with corrections officers and wardens and those who manage the system. They have an extremely difficult and often dangerous job. And we expressed our appreciation for what they do. But they also recognized that we could be doing better in how we administer justice. <p>And I met with a group of prisoners, and what was striking was the degree to which so many of these young people&mdash;and many of them were young; there were some older ones who were there, often because they had been serving time for mistakes they had made during their youth. And I said at the time&mdash;I think I&mdash;you may hear me say it in this program&mdash;that they weren't so different from me. I made mistakes when I was young. I didn't always follow a straight path. The primary difference between me and them was, I had more of a cushion. I had second chances. In some cases, I had resources, or I was in an environment in which when I made a mistake as a teen, that I could recover from it. And these young people didn't have any margin for error. <p>And that notion that as a consequence of youthful mistakes, they could end up in a lifelong cycle of crime to where the prospect of them being able to recover and reenter society with gainful employment and the ability to be part of their children's lives and to be citizens appeared remote&mdash;that the notion that that's how we think our criminal justice system should work, that that should be the end result, there's something un-American about that. <p>This is a country that believes in second chances. And right now we've got millions of people who aren't getting it. So we've got to make sure that our criminal justice system works. We've got to make sure that our criminal justice system keeps people safe. We have to respect the incredibly difficult job that police officers have and remind ourselves that they are protecting and serving us and they have a right to go home too. We have to recognize that there are prosecutors and judges throughout the system who want to do the right thing and feel compassion and understand the human stories that are involved in this thing, but are bound by laws that all too often have been created because of politics or misguided theories as opposed to being based on the evidence and what's required to keep people safe. <p>The bottom line is, we've got to make sure that our criminal justice system does not perpetuate a cycle of hopelessness, but rather lifts people up. And there's no contradiction between us being concerned and vigilant when it comes to keeping our streets safe and our children safe and also making sure that our system is fair and just and does not consign an entire class of people to a life on the margins. <p>And that means that we've got to support sentencing reform efforts, like the one that these Members of Congress are supporting, so that we can more effectively use our resources to protect the public. It means that we have to stay focused on prevention programs and alternatives like drug courts that can intercede with young people before they're locked into a path from which they cannot recover. It means that providing education and job training and focus inside of prisons is not being soft on crime; it is being smart about what is needed in order to make sure that people can recover from their mistakes. <p>And the good news is that people from Federal, State, and local governments, from law enforcement and the judiciary, from business and entertainment, and local communities are finding common ground on this issue. What's encouraging is, this is one of the few areas where we're seeing some really important bipartisan conversations taking place and members of the faith community stepping up alongside civil rights advocates in really significant and meaningful ways. And so I'm encouraged by it. <p>You represent the possibilities of shaping a coalition that makes this aspect of America more consistent with our ideals and our values. And for your extraordinary work, I want to thank you. But recognize this is going to be hard work. It is not going to be easy. It is not going to happen soon. We are just going to have to keep on pushing at the Federal level, but also at the State and local levels. We've got a great Attorney General currently, and we had a previous Attorney General who cared deeply about this. <p>But we need States attorneys and local prosecutors, and sheriffs, and departments all across this country to internalize these issues as well, because the Federal system is just a very&mdash;is a small portion of our overall criminal justice system. And it's not something that I can direct by fiat to change. This is something that's going to have to be a collaboration with everybody. <p>So that's enough talking. Thank you for the great work you're doing. And enjoy the show. All right? <p>Thank you.\" "
"210" "\"Hi, everybody. It is hard to believe, but it was 7 years ago this week that one of Wall Street's biggest investment banks went bankrupt, triggering a meltdown on Wall Street and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. And in the months that followed, millions of Americans lost their jobs, their homes, and the savings they'd worked so hard to build. <p>Today's a different story. Over the past 5&frac12; years, our businesses have created more than 13 million new jobs. The unemployment rate is lower than it's been in over 7 years. Manufacturing is growing. Housing is bouncing back. We've reduced our deficits by two-thirds. And 16 million more Americans now know the security of health insurance. <p>This is your progress. It's because of your hard work and sacrifice that America has come back from crisis faster than almost every other advanced nation on Earth. We remain the safest, strongest bet in the world. <p>Of course, you might not know all that if you only listened to the bluster of political season, when it's in the interest of some politicians to paint America as dark and depressing as possible. But I don't see it that way. I've met too many Americans who prove, day in and day out, that this is a place where anything is possible. Yes, we have a lot of work to do to rebuild a middle class that's had the odds stacked against it now for decades. But that's the thing about America: Our work is never finished. We always strive to be better, to perfect ourselves. <p>We just have to make the right choices. And if Republicans want to help, they can choose, right now, to pass a budget that helps us grow our economy even faster, create jobs even faster, lift people's incomes and prospects even faster. But they've only got until the end of the month to do it, or they'll shut down our Government for the second time in 2 years. <p>Democrats are ready to sit down and negotiate with Republicans right now. But it should be over legitimate issues like how much do we invest in education, job training, and infrastructure, not unrelated ideological issues like Planned Parenthood. We need to set our sights higher than that. We need to reverse harmful cuts to middle class economic priorities, close loopholes that benefit only a fortunate few at the top, and invest more in the things that help our entire economy grow. <p>There's nothing principled about the idea of another Government shutdown. There's nothing patriotic about denying the progress you've worked so hard to make. America is great right now, not because of our Government or our wealth or our power, but because of everyone who works hard every day to move this country forward. Now Congress needs to work as hard as you do. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"211" "\"Hello, CBC! I guess I get the fancier lectern here. Everybody, please have a seat. Have a seat. I know it's late. You're ready for the after parties. I should have ditched the speech and brought my playlist. [<i>Laughter</i>] Everybody looks beautiful, handsome, wonderful. Thank you, Don, for that introduction. Thank you to the CBC Foundation. And thank you to the members of the CBC. <p>On the challenges of our times, from giving workers a raise to getting families health coverage; on the threats of our time, from climate change to nuclear proliferation, members of the CBC have been leaders moving America forward. With your help, our businesses have created over 13 million new jobs. With your help, we've covered more than 16 million Americans with health insurance, many for the first time. Three years ago, Republicans said they'd get the unemployment rate down to 6 percent by 2017. It's down to 5.1 right now. You didn't hear much about that in the debate on Monday&mdash;on Wednesday night. <p>Point is, though, none of this progress would have been possible without the CBC taking tough votes when it mattered most. Whatever I've accomplished, the CBC has been there. I was proud to be a CBC member when I was in the Senate; I'm proud to be your partner today. But we're not here just to celebrate, we're here to keep going. Because with the unemployment rate for African Americans still more than double than Whites, with millions of families still working hard and still waiting to feel the recovery in their own lives, we know that the promise of this Nation, where every single American, regardless of the circumstances in which they were born, regardless of what they look like, where they come from, has the chance to succeed&mdash;that promise is not yet fulfilled. <p>The good thing about America, the great project of America, is that perfecting our Union is never finished. We've always got more work to do. And tonight's honorees remind us of that. They remind us of the courage and sacrifices, the work that they've done, and not just at the national level, but in local communities all across the country. We couldn't be prouder of them. The heroes of the civil rights movement whom we lost last month remind us of the work that remains to be done. American heroes like Louis Stokes and Julian Bond and Amelia Boynton Robinson. <p>Now, Ms. Robinson&mdash;some of you know, earlier this year, my family and I joined many in Selma for the 50th anniversary of that march. And as we crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge, I held Ms. Amelia's hand. And I thought about her and all the extraordinary women like her who were really the life force of the movement. Women were the foot soldiers. Women strategized boycotts. Women organized marches. Even if they weren't allowed to run the civil rights organizations on paper, behind the scenes, they were the thinkers and the doers making things happen each and every day, doing the work that nobody else wanted to do. They couldn't prophesize from the pulpits, but they led the charge from the pews. They were no strangers to violence. They were on the front lines. So often they were subject to abuse, dehumanized, but kept on going, holding families together. Mothers were beaten and gassed on Bloody Sunday. Four little girls were murdered in a Birmingham church. Women made the movement happen. Of course, Black women have been a part of every great movement in American history, even if they weren't always given a voice. They helped plan the March on Washington, but were almost entirely absent from the program. And when pressed, male organizers added a tribute highlighting six women, none of them who were asked to make a speech. And Daisy Bates introduced her fellow honorees in just 142 words that were written by a man. Of course, Marian Anderson and Mahalia Jackson sang. But in a 3-hour program, the men gave women just 142 words. That may sound familiar to some of the women in the room here tonight. [<i>Laughter</i>] The organizers even insisted on two separate parades: male leaders marching along the main route on Pennsylvania Avenue and leaders like Dorothy Height and Rosa Parks relegated to Independence Avenue. America's most important march against segregation had its own version of separation. <p>Black women were central in the fight for women's rights, from suffrage to the feminist movement, and yet despite their leadership, too often they were also marginalized. But they didn't give up. They didn't let up. They were too fierce for that. Black women have always understood the words of Pauli Murray that \\"Hope is a song in a weary throat.\\" <p>It's thanks to Black women that we've come a long way since the days when a girl like Ruby Bridges couldn't go to school, when a woman like Amelia couldn't cast her vote, when we didn't have a Congressional Black Caucus and its 20 women members. <p>So I'm focusing on women tonight because I want them to know how much we appreciate them, how much we admire them, how much we love them. And I want to talk about what more we have to do to provide full opportunity and equality for our Black women and girls in America today. <p>Because all of us are beneficiaries of a long line of strong Black women who helped carry this country forward. Their work to expand civil rights opened the doors of opportunity, not just for African Americans, but for all women, for all of us: Black and White, Latino and Asian, LGBT and straight, for our First Americans and our newest Americans. And their contributions in every field&mdash;as scientists and entrepreneurs, educators, explorers&mdash;all made us stronger. Of course, they're also a majority of my household. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I care deeply about how they're doing. <p>Now, the good news is, despite structural barriers of race and gender, women and girls of color have made real progress in recent years. The number of Black women-owned businesses has skyrocketed. Black women have ascended the ranks of every industry. Teen pregnancy rates among girls of color are down, while high school and 4-year college graduation rates are up. That's good news. <p>But there's no denying that Black women and girls still face real and persistent challenges. The unemployment rate is over 8 percent for Black women. And they're overrepresented in low-paying jobs, underrepresented in management. They often lack access to economic necessities like paid leave and quality, affordable childcare. They often don't get the same quality health care that they need and have higher rates of certain chronic diseases, although that's starting to change with Obamacare. It's working, by the way, people. Just in case&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;just in case you needed to know. <p>And then, there are some of the challenges that are harder to see and harder to talk about, although Michelle, our outstanding, beautiful First Lady, talks about these struggles. Michelle will tell stories about when she was younger, people telling her she shouldn't aspire to go to the very best universities. And she found herself thinking sometimes, \\"Well, maybe they're right.\\" Even after she earned two degrees from some of the best universities in America, she still faced the doubts that were rooted in deep social prejudice and stereotypes, worrying whether she was being too assertive or too angry&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;or too tall. I like tall women, but&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>And those stereotypes and social pressures, they still affect our girls. So we all have to be louder than the voices that are telling our girls they're not good enough, that they've got to look a certain way or they've got to act a certain way or set their goals at a certain level. We've got to affirm their sense of self-worth and make them feel visible and beautiful and understood and loved. And I say this as a father who strives to do this at home, but I also say this as a citizen. This is not just about my family or yours, it's about who we are as a people, who we want to be, and how we can make sure that America is fulfilling its promise because everybody is getting a chance and everybody is told they're important and everybody is given opportunity. And we've got to do more than just say we care or say we'd put our&mdash;a woman on $10 bill, although that's a good idea. We've got to make sure they're getting some $10 bills, that they're getting paid properly. We've got to let our actions do the talking. <p>It is an affront to the very idea of America when certain segments of our population don't have access to the same opportunities as everybody else. It makes a mockery of our economy when Black women make 30 fewer cents for every dollar a White man earns. That adds up to thousands of dollars in missed income that determines whether a family can pay for a home or pay for college for their kids or save for retirement or give their kids a better life. And that's not just a woman's issue, that's everybody's issue. I want Michelle getting paid at some point. [<i>Laughter</i>] We've got a&mdash;an outstanding former Secretary of State here who is also former First Lady, and I know she can relate to Michelle when she says, how come I'm&mdash;how come you get paid and I don't? [<i>Laughter</i>] How did that work? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>When women of color aren't given the opportunity to live up to their God-given potential, we all lose out on their talents, we're not as good a country as we can be. We might miss out on the next Mae Jemison or Ursula Burns or Serena Williams or Michelle Obama. We want everybody to be on the field. We can't afford to leave some folks off the field. <p>So we're going to have to close those economic gaps so that hard-working women of all races, and Black women in particular, can support families and strengthen communities and contribute to our country's success. So that's why my administration is investing in job training and apprenticeships, to help everybody, but particularly help more women earn better paying jobs, and particularly in nontraditional careers. It's why we're investing in getting more girls, and particularly girls of color, interested in STEM fields&mdash;math and science and engineering&mdash;and help more of them stay on track in school. <p>It's why we're going to continue to fight to eliminate the pay gap. Equal pay for equal work. It's an all-American idea. It's very simple. And that's why we're going to keep working to raise the minimum wage, because women disproportionately are the ones who are not getting paid what they're worth. That's why we're fighting to expand tax credits that help working parents make ends meet, closing tax loopholes for folks who don't need tax loopholes to pay for it. It's why we're expanding paid leave to employees of Federal contractors. And that's why Congress needs to expand paid leave for more hard-working Americans. It's good for our economy. It's the right thing to do. Nobody&mdash;no family should have to choose between taking care of a sick child or losing their job. <p>And just as an aside, what's not the right thing to do, what makes no sense at all, is Congress threatening to shut down the entire Federal Government if they can't shut down women's access to Planned Parenthood. That's not a good idea. Congress should be working on investing things that grow our economy and expand opportunity, and not get distracted and inflict the kind of self-inflicted wounds that we've seen before on our economy. So that's some of the things we need to do to help improve the economic standing of all women, to help all families feel more secure in a changing economy. <p>And before I go tonight, I also want to say something about a topic that's been on my mind for a while, another profound barrier to opportunity in too many communities, and that is our criminal justice system. <p>I spoke about this at length earlier this year at the NAACP, and I explained the long history of inequity in our criminal justice system. We all know the statistics. And this summer, because I wanted to highlight that there were human beings behind these statistics, I visited a prison in Oklahoma, the first President to ever visit a Federal prison. And I sat down with inmates, and I listened to their stories. And one of the things that struck me was the crushing burden their incarceration has placed not just on their prospects for the future, but also for their families, the women in their lives, children being raised without a father in the home; the crushing regret these men felt over the children that they had left behind. <p>Mass incarceration rips apart families. It hollows out neighborhoods. It perpetuates poverty. We understand that in many of our communities, they're underpoliced. The problem is not that we don't want active, effective police work. We want and admire and appreciate law enforcement. We want them in our communities. Crime hurts the African American community more than anybody. But we want to make sure that it's done well and it's done right and it's done fairly and it's done smart. And that's why, in the coming months, I'm going to be working with many in Congress and many in the CBC to try to make progress on reform legislation that addresses unjust sentencing laws and encourages diversion and prevention programs, catches our young people early and tries to put them on a better path, and then helps ex-offenders, after they've done their time, get on the right track. It's the right thing to do for America. <p>And although in these discussions a lot of my focus has been on African American men and the work we're doing with \\"My Brother's Keeper,\\" we can't forget the impact that the system has on women as well. The incarceration rate for Black women is twice as high as the rate for White women. Many women in prison, you come to discover, have been victims of homelessness and domestic violence and, in some cases, human trafficking. They've got high rates of mental illness and substance abuse. And many have been sexually assaulted, both before they got to prison and then after they go to prison. And we don't often talk about how society treats Black women and girls before they end up in prison. They're suspended at higher rates than White boys and all other girls. And while boys face the school-to-prison pipeline, a lot of girls are facing a more sinister sexual-abuse-to-prison pipeline. Victims of early sexual abuse are more likely to fail in school, which can lead to sexual exploitation, which can lead to prison. So we're focusing on boys, but we're also investing in ways to change the odds for at-risk girls, to make sure that they are loved and valued, to give them a chance. <p>And that's why we have to make a collective effort to address violence and abuse against women in all of our communities. In every community, on every campus, we've got to be very clear: Women who have been victims of rape or domestic abuse, who need help, should know that they can count on society and on law enforcement to treat them with love and care and sensitivity and not skepticism. I want to repeat, because somehow, this never shows up on FOX News&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I want to repeat, because I've said it a lot, unwaveringly, all the time: Our law enforcement officers do outstanding work in an incredibly difficult and dangerous job. They put their lives on the line for our safety. We appreciate them, and we love them. That's why my Task Force on 21st-Century Policing made a set of recommendations that I want to see implemented to improve their safety, as well as to make sure that our criminal justice system is being applied fairly. Officers show uncommon bravery in our communities every single day. They deserve our respect. That includes women in law enforcement. We need more of you, by the way. We've got an outstanding chief law enforcement officer in our Attorney General, Loretta Lynch. We want all our young ladies to see what a great role model she is. <p>So I just want to repeat, because somehow, this never gets on the TV&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;there is no contradiction between us caring about our law enforcement officers and also making sure that our laws are applied fairly. Do not make this as an either-or proposition, this is a both-and proposition. We want to protect our police officers. We'll do a better job doing it if our communities can feel confident that they are being treated fairly. Hope I'm making that clear. [<i>Applause</i>] Hope I'm making that clear. <p>We need to make sure the laws are applied evenly. This is not a new problem. It's just that in recent months, in recent years, suddenly folks have videos and body cameras and social media, and so it's opened our eyes to these incidents. And many of these incidents are subject to ongoing investigation, so I can't comment on every specific one. But we can't avoid these tough conversations altogether. That's not going to help our police officers, the vast majority who do the right thing every day, by just pretending that these things aren't happening. That's not going to help build trust between them and the communities in which they serve. <p>So these are hard issues, but I'm confident we're going to move forward together for a system that is fairer and more just. We've got good people on both sides of the aisle that are working with law enforcement and local communities to find a better way forward. And as always, change will not happen overnight. It won't be easy. But if our history has taught us anything, it's taught us that when we come together, when we're working with a sense of purpose, when we are listening to one another, when we assume the best in each other rather than the worst, then change happens. <p>Like every parent, I can't help to see the world increasingly through my daughters' eyes. And on that day when we were celebrating that incredible march in Selma, I had Ms. Amelia's hand in one of my hands, but Michelle had Sasha's hand, and my mother-in-law had Malia's hand, and it was a chain across generations. And I thought about all those women who came before us, who risked everything for life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness, so often without notice, so often without fanfare. Their names never made the history books. All those women who cleaned somebody else's house or looked after somebody else's children, did somebody else's laundry, and then got home and did it again, and then went to church and cooked, and then they were marching and&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>And because of them, Michelle could cross that bridge. And because of them, they brought them along, and Malia and Sasha can cross that bridge. And that tells me that if we follow their example, we're going to cross more bridges in the future. If we keep moving forward, hand in hand, God willing, my daughters' children will be able to cross that bridge in an America that's more free and more just and more prosperous than the one that we inherited. Your children will too. <p>Thank you, CBC. God bless you. God bless this country we love. Thank you.\" "
"212" "\"Last year, as Ebola spread in West Africa, I said that fighting this disease was more than a national security priority, it was a critical example of American leadership. These professionals from the U.S. Public Health Service were some of the Americans on the frontlines of that effort. And before you came in, I had the opportunity to award them with the Presidential Unit Citation. <p>Now, understand that this corps of public health professionals are on the front lines all the time. And when you think of some of the most difficult, challenging tragedies or public health challenges that we've experienced over the last several decades, these are the folks who've been there from the start. After 9/11, after hurricanes, after Sandy Hook, after Deepwater Horizon or the Boston Marathon bombing, they come in to help support, advise, and oftentimes provide direct treatment in some of the most difficult situations imaginable. <p>But this was a unique deployment by this unit. Like so many others, they signed up to leave their loved ones and head straight into the heart of the Ebola epidemic, understanding that there were significant risks that they themselves would be confronting as a consequence of helping others. Thanks to their skill, thanks to their courage and their dedication, they not only helped to keep the American people safe, they led a global response. It was not until they arrived that other countries were confident that they could send their own health workers in, because they knew that this outstanding group of individuals and health professionals were there on the job and would provide them the kind of support that could make their own efforts safe. <p>We're not yet at absolute zero when it comes to this Ebola epidemic that took place in West Africa, but we have turned the tide on the epidemic. The cases we now see are much more sporadic, and we have, as a consequence of the work that these individuals started&mdash;started to build the kind of public health infrastructure in many of these countries&mdash;they can prevent an outbreak in the future. <p>I want to thank Secretary Sylvia Burwell, Surgeon General Murthy, because they were critical in helping to move us to the next phase of the fight: transitioning from a military response to a civilian response. We're also now better prepared for disease outbreaks like Ebola here at home. Our health care professionals are better trained. Our screening processes have improved. Our hospitals are more capable with new protocols and new protective gear. None of this progress could have been made without America's public servants like these. <p>The troops who supported the global response, the CDC experts tracking cases, the HHS scientists testing vaccines, the USAID workers and PHS doctors and nurses who served directly in the field&mdash;all of these Americans, not just the ones in this room, but thousands of the Public Health Service individuals, the thousands more who helped support them, they made this progress possible. <p>His Holiness Pope Francis spoke today in Congress about the need for us to apply the Golden Rule and to have a sense of morality and common humanity at the center of our Government. Well, these are individuals who represent that spirit of that kind of selflessness that ends up helping the most vulnerable, the poorest, the people who are least capable of fending for themselves against invisible killers like Ebola. So I'm extraordinarily grateful to all of them. <p>It is a useful occasion for me to note that organizations like the Public Health Service's Commissioned Corps need support from Congress in order to continue to excel at their mission. And so I hope that Congress chooses to keep our Government open and operating so that heroes like this can keep working to extinguish disease and ignite hope wherever it is needed most. That's what America does. That's what these individuals represent. That's why I could not be more incredibly proud of them, but of the American people who support them. <p>Thank you. Good job. All right.\" "
"213" "\"Forty-five years ago, in June of 1970, a telegram arrived in Upstate New York at the home of 18-year-old Marty Dempsey. \\"Congratulations,\\" it read, \\"You are appointed to the West Point Class of 1974. . . .\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Marty was honored. But he had just finished high school, and he wasn't entirely sure he wanted to head off to the Academy. His mother, I'm told, thought different. She urged him to \\"give it a try for the summer\\"&mdash;which sounds like Beast Barracks meets sleep-away camp. [<i>Laughter</i>] Sound advice, with a little Irish charm, runs in the Dempsey family. <p>Over the decades that followed, he patrolled the Iron Curtain, commanded divisions on desert battlefields, and led America's soldiers. And more than a few times, he burst into song. And over these last 4 years, Marty's wisdom, his vision, and his character have helped lead the greatest fighting force the world has ever known. <p>Secretary Carter, Deputy Secretary Work, Members of Congress, and the Joint Chiefs, Service Secretaries, men and women of the Defense Department, our Armed Forces, and our military families: It is a deep honor to join you as we pay tribute to a singular leader for our military and our Nation and one of the finest men that I know, General Martin Dempsey. <p>A little over 4 years ago, I tapped Marty to serve as Chief of Staff of the Army. We let him enjoy it&mdash;for 1 day. Then, I asked him to be Chairman. So let me say, Marty, and more importantly, Deanie, this time I promise, no surprises tomorrow. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I chose Marty for these leadership roles because of his moral fiber and his deep commitment to American strength and American values. I chose him because of his vision for our military as a more versatile and responsive force. I chose him because he had the steady hand we needed in this moment of transition, as we tackle emerging threats and support so many of our troops as they transition to civilian life. And I've watched Marty manage each of these challenges with integrity and foresight and care. But perhaps most of all, I chose Marty because he's a leader you can trust. <p>Marty, you've always given it to me straight. I can't tell you how much I have appreciated your candor and your counsel. And I've seen you build that trust not just with me, but across our military, with our troops and their families, with Congress and our allies abroad, and with the American people. <p>Today, thanks in no small measure to Marty's leadership, America has reassured allies from Europe to the Asia-Pacific. We ended our combat mission in Afghanistan and brought America's longest war to a responsible end. We've forged new partnerships from South Asia to the Sahel to meet terrorist threats. We've built a coalition that is combatting ISIL in Iraq and Syria. We have bolstered our cyberdefenses. We helped halt the spread of Ebola in West Africa. <p>None of this would have been possible without Marty's guidance and leadership. And what makes it more remarkable is that he's guided our forces through a time of reckless budget cuts. With less than a week before Congress needs to pass a budget to keep the Government open, let me just say, now is not the time for games that lock in sequester. It's not good for our military readiness, it's not good for our troops, it's not good for our families, and it's not good for our country. As Commander in Chief, I believe we should invest in America and in our national security, and not shortchange it. <p>And yet, even in these tough fiscal times, Marty has made sure we maintain our military superiority. And no one can match our services because no one can match our servicemembers, our sons and daughters who he's cared for like his own. In them, he sees the West Point classmates of his youth. He sees those he commanded. He sees their families, and in them, he sees his own. <p>There's Deanie, of course, Marty's high school sweetheart, lifelong better half, whose grace and resilience and good cheer embodies the military spouses she fights so fiercely for; Chris, Megan, and Caitlin, who followed in their father's footsteps to wear our Nation's cloth; Marty's mother Sarah, who we thank for making him give the military a try \\"for the summer.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] And there are his nine grandchildren, who we can be confident will mark this Nation in so many positive ways in the future. On behalf of the American people, I want to thank the entire Dempsey family for their service to our Nation. <p>Marty will be the first to tell you that he couldn't have done his job without his outstanding Vice Chair. And I, too, have depended on the advice and experience of Admiral Sandy Winnefeld. Thank you, Sandy, for your outstanding service. <p>In General Joe Dunford and General Paul Selva, two of the most respected officers in our military, we have tested leaders ready to carry on Marty and Sandy's work. I could not be prouder of them and the service they've already rendered this great Nation. And I could not be more confident in the advice and counsel that they'll provide me. Thank you to them. Thank you, Ellyn. Thank you so much for everything that you've done. <p>Now, we're going to have a lot of work to do long after not just Marty is gone, but I'm gone from the stage. There are always new threats, there are always new challenges in this ever-changing world. We have to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, the remnants of Al Qaida, terror networks around the world. We have to adapt our defenses for the 21st century. We have to give our troops the support they need to meet their missions. We have to make sure that our forces and our families receive the pay and the benefits and the quality of life that they have earned. That is how we maintain a military that is second to none. And I am confident that we are up to the task. <p>I'm told that on Marty's desk there's a box. It's a cigar box with 132 cards, each one with the name, picture, and story of every one of the 132 soldiers who gave their lives under his command in Iraq. And on top of the box are three words: \\"Make It Matter.\\" Make it matter. And every morning, Marty places three of those cards in his pocket so that every moment as Chairman&mdash;every meeting, every trip, every decision, every troop review&mdash;every moment of every day some of those fallen heroes are with him. <p>Those cards were with him a few years back when, for the first time as Chairman, Marty spoke to a group of military children who had lost a parent. And that day, as he walked through the crowd&mdash;with some 600 Gold Star kids, young, so full of hope&mdash;he began to think about their lives and how each of them would have to make their way without a father or a mother. And Marty had planned to speak, but he couldn't. So he did one of those things that he does best. He began to sing. <p>And in that moment, the highest ranking military leader in our Nation forged a bond with those children&mdash;boys and girls who, at such a tender age, had given up so much&mdash;in a way that perhaps nobody else could. And year after year, they've invited him back, because they know Marty Dempsey will always give them everything he has: his voice, but even more, his full heart and soul. <p>This is the man we honor today. A friend to so many troops and families across our military. A patriot with a profound love for our country and those who sacrifice for it. A trusted leader who in a time of great change \\"made it matter\\" all the time. <p>I am extraordinarily grateful to have had him by my side through the bulk of my Presidency, and I am extraordinarily proud to call him my friend. <p>Marty, for your lifetime of extraordinary service, you have the deepest thanks of a grateful nation. God bless you, and God bless our men and women in uniform.\" "
"214" "\"<i>President Obama.</i> Well, good evening, everyone. On behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the White House. President Xi, Madame Peng, members of the Chinese delegation: Once again, I want to welcome you as we honor the ties between our nations and our peoples. <p>In our visits to China, Michelle and I have experienced the traditions, the culture, the cuisine of a civilization that spans thousands of years. And I understand that in China there's a saying, \\"Food is heaven.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] I dare not stand in the way of the divine, so I will be brief. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Today President Xi and I agreed to expand our cooperation between our two nations. I know that some&mdash;in both countries and around the world&mdash;question whether we can sustain the cooperation that we need and the world needs. I think we can draw encouragement from the ties that have long connected our peoples. <p>I think of the American airmen during the Second World War who went down over China. Chinese villagers sheltered them, fed them, clothed them, and treated their wounds. And decades later, one Chinese man said of the American he saved: \\"He is like the thumb on the hand . . . and I am like the finger. . . . We are brothers together.\\" <p>I think of the ties that are forged every single day and that we've worked to expand in our work today: American tourists in China visiting the Forbidden City and the Great Wall, Chinese tourists visiting our Statue of Liberty and Independence Hall, our students who cross the Pacific to learn from each other, our scientists who discover new treatments together, our health workers who fought Ebola together. <p>There will be times where there are differences between our two countries. That's inevitable. There will be times where our interests entirely overlap. But what I think will be sustaining is the friendship between our peoples, the foundation of the ties between our nations. And just as you say in China that a \\"sea accepts a hundred rivers,\\" our countries together are stronger as&mdash;when we accept the diversity and the views and contributions and uphold the rights of all of our peoples. <p>And so I propose a toast: To the people of China and the people of the United States, may they work together, like fingers on the same hand, in friendship and in peace. <i>Ganbei!</i> <p>[<i>At this point, President Obama offered a toast.</i>] <p><i>President Xi.</i> Mr. President and Mrs. Obama, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends: Good evening. It gives me great pleasure to attend this grand dinner. On behalf of the Chinese delegation and in the name of my wife and myself, I wish to extend heartfelt thanks to you, Mr. President, and to Mrs. Obama. <p>I also extend my cordial greetings to all the friends present and, through you, to all those across American society who take a strong interest in China-U.S. relationship and support its growth. My state visit to the United States is an unforgettable journey. From the West Coast to the East Coast, what strikes me most is that the American people have a lot of good will toward the Chinese people. And they hope much more can be accomplished through enhanced China-U.S. cooperation. I want to assure you that such good will is fully reciprocated by the Chinese people. <p>Since yesterday evening, I have had three meetings with President Obama. We had candid and in-depth exchange of views on China-U.S. relations and the major issues that are vital to world peace and development. And we reached broad and important agreement. Our discussion has yielded many positive outcomes. <p>Thirty-six years ago, during his visit to the United States, Mr. Deng Xiaoping predicted that China-U.S. relations would make major progress under new, historical conditions. Bracing against wind and rain, our relations have forged ahead and have made extraordinary achievements in the past 30 years and more. I am convinced that the future of U.S.-China relations will be even more bright. <p>This morning my wife and Mrs. Obama visited the panda house at the National Zoo. [<i>Laughter</i>] She later told me that she was deeply touched by the American kids' love of panda and their curiosity about and a fondness for China, the home of panda. My wife said at the event, the seeds of China-U.S. friendship have already taken root in the hearts of the kids. I cannot agree more with her. <p>Mr. President and Mrs. Obama, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, as an ancient Chinese saying goes: \\"Only those who take actions can achieve their goal. Only those who stride forward can reach their destination.\\" President Abraham Lincoln once said, \\"The best way to predict the future is to create it.\\" Let us continue to respect and learn from each other, turn our blueprint into reality, and write in a creative way a new, historic chapter in China-U.S. relations. <p>In closing, let me propose a toast: To the friendship between Chinese and American peoples, to the prosperity of China and the United States and the happiness of our two peoples, and to the health of President and Mrs. Obama and all the friends present. Cheers! <p>[<i>President Xi offered a toast.</i>]\" "
"215" "\"Hi, everybody. Today, September 26, is National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day. It's a day where you can safely, conveniently, and responsibly dispose of expired and unwanted prescription drugs at collection sites in your community. <p>Here's why this matters. More Americans now die every year from drug overdoses than they do in car crashes. And most of those deaths aren't due to drugs like cocaine or heroin, but rather prescription drugs. In 2013 alone, overdoses from prescription pain medications killed more than 16,000 Americans. And most young people who begin misusing prescription drugs don't buy them in some dark alley; they get them from the medicine cabinet. <p>If that's not a good enough reason to participate in National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day, here's another. Many prescription pain medications belong to the same class of drugs as heroin. In fact, four in five heroin users started out by misusing prescription drugs. And over the course of just 1 year, between 2013 and 2014, we saw a 33 percent increase in the number of heroin users. <p>All of this takes a terrible toll on too many families, in too many communities, all across the country, big and small, urban and rural. It strains law enforcement and treatment programs. It costs all of us in so many different ways. <p>That's why, 4 years ago, my administration unveiled a Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention Plan. We've been partnering with communities to combat overdoses, and we're seeing some promising results. That's why the budget I put forward this year would build on those efforts. It would make critical investments in things like drug monitoring programs, equipping more first responders to save more lives, and expanding medication-assisted treatment programs, including in our prisons. <p>In fact, getting smarter about how we address substance use disorders is a vital part of reforming our criminal justice system. Rather than keep spending billions of taxpayer dollars on needlessly long prison sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, we could save money and get better outcomes by getting treatment to those who need it. And we could use some of the savings to make sure the brave men and women of law enforcement have the resources they need to go after drug kingpins and violent gangs, disrupt the flow of drugs into our country, and address the real threats to our communities. <p>With no other disease do we expect people to wait until they're a danger to themselves or others to self-diagnose and seek treatment. So we should approach abuse as an opportunity to intervene, not incarcerate. And we all have a role to play here. Parents, we have to understand how important it is to talk to our kids and to safely store medications in the house. The medical community has to be engaged too, because better prescribing practices will make a difference. <p>And as a country, we have to keep working to reduce drug use through evidence-based treatment, prevention, and recovery. Because research shows it works. Courageous Americans show it works also, every single day. That's why the man I named to head the Office of National Drug Control Policy&mdash;Michael Botticelli&mdash;is a man in long-term recovery himself. He talks about it openly and honestly, precisely to strike down the shame and stigma that too often keep people from seeking care before it's too late. This is something I'll be talking about more in the weeks to come in communities across the country. Because it's a challenge we can solve if we work together. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"216" "\"Good afternoon. Mr. Secretary-General, fellow delegates, ladies and gentlemen: It is a great honor to be here to address the topic of sustainable development. <p>In many of our nations, especially developed countries, there is among our general population a genuine compassion towards those in need. There is a recognition of the grinding poverty that so many experience every day around the world. And yet sometimes, it's said that our efforts to combat poverty and disease do not and cannot work, that there are some places beyond hope, that certain people and regions are condemned to an endless cycle of suffering. Here today we put those myths to rest. Today we set aside the skepticism, and we lift up the hope that is available to us through collective action. <p>Because the world came together in an unprecedented effort, the global hunger rate has already been slashed. Tens of millions of more boys and girls are today in school. Prevention and treatment of measles and malaria and tuberculosis have saved nearly 60 million lives. HIV/AIDS infections and deaths have plummeted. And more than 1 billion people have lifted themselves up from extreme poverty&mdash;1 billion. <p>The entire world can take enormous pride in these historic achievements. And so let the skeptics and cynics know: development works. Investing in public health works. We can break the cycle of poverty. People and nations can rise into prosperity. Despite the cruelties of our world and the ravages of disease, millions of lives can be saved if we are focused and if we work together. Cynicism is our enemy. A belief, a capacity in the dignity of every individual, and a recognition that we, each of us, can play a small part to play in lifting up people all around the world&mdash;that is the message that we are sending here today. And because of the work of so many who are assembled here today, we can point to past success. And yet we are also here today because we understand that our work is nowhere near done. We can take pride in what we've accomplished, but we cannot be complacent. <p>When 11 boys and girls die every single minute from preventable causes, we know we have more work to do. When hundreds of women die every single day just from having a baby, we know we have more work to do. When tens of millions of children are still not in school, when hundreds of millions of people have no clean water, no toilets, we have so much more to do. <p>Right now some 800 million men, women and children are scraping by on less than $1.25 a day. Imagine that. Gripped by the ache of an empty stomach. Billions of our fellow human beings are at risk of dying from diseases that we know how to prevent. Many children are just one mosquito bite away from death. And that is a moral outrage. It is a profound injustice. It is literally a matter of life and death, and now the world must act. We cannot leave people behind. <p>And so today we commit ourselves to new sustainable development goals, including our goal of ending extreme poverty in our world. We do so understanding how difficult the task may be. We suffer no illusions of the challenges ahead. But we understand this is something that we must commit ourselves to. Because in doing so, we recognize that our most basic bond&mdash;our common humanity&mdash;compels us to act. An impoverished child in a distant slum or a neighborhood not that far from here is just as equal, just as worthy, as any of our children, as any of us, as any head of government or leader in this great hall. <p>We reaffirm that supporting development is not charity, but is instead one of the smartest investments we can make in our own future. After all, it is a lack of development&mdash;when people have no education and no jobs and no hope, a feeling that their basic human dignity is being violated&mdash;that helps fuel so much of the tensions and conflict and instability in our world. <p>And I profoundly believe that many of the conflicts, the refugee crises, the military interventions over the years might have been avoided if nations had truly invested in the lives of their people and if the wealthiest nations on Earth were better partners in working with those that are trying to lift themselves up. As one of the founders of the United Nations, Ralph Bunche once said, \\"Peace is no mere matter of men fighting or not fighting. Peace, to have meaning . . . must be translated into bread or rice, shelter, health, and education.\\" <p>I'm here to say that in this work, the United States will continue to be your partner. Five years ago, I pledged here that America would remain the global leader in development, and the United States Government, in fact, remains the single largest donor of development assistance, including in global health. In times of crisis&mdash;from Ebola to Syria&mdash;we are the largest provider of humanitarian aid. In times of disaster and crisis, the world can count on the friendship and generosity of the American people. <p>The question before us, though, as an international community, is how do we meet these new goals that we've set today? How can we do our work better? How can we stretch our resources and our funding more effectively? How can donor countries be smarter? And how can recipient countries do more with what they receive? We have to learn from the past to see where we succeeded so that we can duplicate that success and to understand where we've fallen short and correct those shortcomings. <p>And we start by understanding that this next chapter of development cannot fall victim to the old divides between developed nations and developing ones. Poverty, growing inequality, exists in all of our nations, and all of our nations have work to do. And that includes here in the United States. <p>That's why, after a terrible recession, my administration has worked to keep millions of families from falling into poverty. That's why we've brought quality, affordable health care to more than 17 million Americans. Here in this country, the wealthiest nation on Earth, we're still working every day to perfect our Union and to be more equal and more just and to treat the most vulnerable members of our society with value and concern. <p>And that's why today I am committing the United States to achieving the sustainable development goals. And as long as I am President, and well after I'm done being President, I will keep fighting for the education and housing and health care and jobs that reduce inequality and create opportunity here in the United States and around the world. Because this is not just the job of politicians, this is work for all of us. <p>Now, this next chapter of development cannot just be about what governments spend, it has to harness the unprecedented resources of our interconnected world. In just a few short years&mdash;in the areas of health and food security and energy&mdash;my administration has committed and helped mobilize more than a hundred billion dollars to promote development and save lives. More than $100 billion. And guided by the new consensus we reached in Addis, I'm calling on others to join us. More governments, more institutions, more businesses, more philanthropies, more NGOs, more faith communities, more citizens&mdash;we all need to step up with the will and the resources and the coordination to achieve our goals. This must be the work of the world. <p>At the same time, this next chapter of development must focus not simply on the dollars we spend, but on the results that we achieve. And this demands new technologies and approaches, accountability, data, behavioral science&mdash;understanding that there are&mdash;there's lessons that we have learned, best practices on how people actually live so that we can dramatically improve outcomes. It means breaking cycles of dependence by helping people become more self-sufficient, not just giving people fish, but teaching them how to fish. That's the purpose of development. <p>Rather than just sending food during famine&mdash;although we have to do that to avert starvation&mdash;we also have to bring new techniques and new seeds and new technologies to more farmers so they can boost their yields and increase their incomes, feed more people and lift countless millions out of poverty. Rather than just respond to outbreaks like Ebola&mdash;although we have to do that, and we have&mdash;let's also strengthen public health systems and advance global health security to prevent epidemics in the first place. <p>As more countries take ownership of their HIV/AIDS programs, the United States is setting two new bold goals. Over the next 2 years, we'll increase the number of people that our funding reaches&mdash;so that nearly 13 million people with HIV/AIDS get lifesaving treatment&mdash;and we'll invest $300 million to help achieve a 40 percent reduction in new HIV infections among young women and girls in the hardest hit areas of sub-Saharan Africa. And I believe we can do that&mdash;the first AIDS-free generation. <p>This next chapter of development must also unleash economic growth, not just for a few at the top, but inclusive, sustainable growth that lifts up the fortunes of the many. We know the ingredients for creating jobs and opportunity; they are not a secret. So let's embrace reforms that attract trade and investment to areas that are in need of investment and in need of trade. Let's trade and build more together, make it easier for developing countries to sell more of their goods around the world. And let's invest in our greatest resource&mdash;our people&mdash;their education, their skills. Let's invest in innovative entrepreneurs, the striving young people who embrace new technology and are starting businesses and can ignite new industries that change the world. I have met young people in&mdash;on every continent, and they can lead the way if we give them the tools they need. <p>Now, our new development goals are ambitious. But thanks to the good work of many of you, they are achievable if we work together, if we meet our responsibilities to each other. I believe that. The progress of recent years gives us hope. We know what works, and we know how to do this. But perhaps because this is now my seventh year of addressing the General Assembly, I tend to be more blunt. [<i>Laughter</i>] Along with the gray hair, I'm becoming more likely to speak my mind. [<i>Laughter</i>] So indulge me when I say that we will never achieve our goals if we do not squarely confront several insidious threats to the dignity and well-being of people around the world. No matter how much hard work is done by development agencies, no matter how large the donations and commitments that are made by donor countries, if we don't take care of some other elements of development, we will not meet our&mdash;the goals that we've set. <p>Number one, development is threatened by bad governance. Today we affirm what we know to be true from decades of experience&mdash;development and economic growth that is truly sustainable and inclusive depends on governments and institutions that care about their people, that are accountable, that respect human rights and deliver justice for everybody and not just some. <p>So, in the face of corruption that siphons billions away from schools and hospitals and infrastructure into foreign bank accounts, governments have to embrace transparency and open government and rule of law. And combating illicit finance must be a global effort because it is part of our development effort. And citizens and civil society groups must be free to organize and speak their mind and work for progress, because that's how countries develop; that's how countries succeed. <p>Development is also threatened by inequality. And this is a political debate that we have in this country, so I just want to be clear: This is not something from which the United States is immune to. Every country has to grapple with this issue. The wealthiest and most powerful in our societies oftentimes like to keep things as they are, and they often have disproportionate political influence. When poor children are more likely to get sick and die than children in wealthier neighborhoods just across town; when rural families are more likely to go without clean water; when ethnic and religious minorities or people with disabilities or people of different sexual orientations are discriminated against or can't access education and opportunity&mdash;that holds all of us back. And so, in all of our countries, we have to invest in the interventions that allow us to reach more people, because no one should be left behind just because of where they live or what they look like. <p>Development is threatened by old attitudes, especially those that deny rights and opportunity to women. In too many places, girls are less likely to be in school than boys. Globally, women are less likely to have a job than men and are more likely to live in poverty. And I've said this before, and I will keep repeating it: One of the best indicators of whether a country will succeed is how it treats its women. When women have an education, when women have a job, their children are more likely to get an education, their families are healthier and more prosperous. Their communities and countries do better as well. So every nation&mdash;all of our nations&mdash;must invest in the education and health and skills of our women and girls. <p>And I have to say I do not have patience for the excuse of, well, we have our own ways of doing things. I understand&mdash;we understand that there is a long tradition in every society of discriminating against women. [<i>Laughter</i>] But that's not an excuse for taking a new path in order to make sure that everyone in a society has opportunity. <p>Development is threatened if we do not recognize the incredible dynamism and opportunity of today's Africa. Hundreds of millions of Africans still struggle in the face of grinding poverty and deadly diseases, daily assaults on their lives and dignity. But I visited Africa recently, and what I saw gave me hope and I know should give you hope, because that continent has made impressive gains in health and education. It is one of the fastest growing regions of the world, with a rising middle class. <p>And during my travels, Africans&mdash;especially young Africans&mdash;tell me they don't just want aid, they want trade. They want businesses. They want investment. So I call on the world to join us as we mobilize billions of dollars in new trade and investment and development in Africa, and that includes Power Africa, our initiative to bring electricity and greater opportunity to more than 60 million African homes and businesses. If we get Africa fulfilling its full potential, that will help the entire global economy. Everyone here will be helped. It's not a zero-sum game. We are invested in their success. Development is threatened by war. This should be a simple proposition, but it bears repeating. It is no coincidence that half of the people living in extreme poverty around the world live in places afflicted by chronic violence and conflict. Today, some 60 million men, women, and children have been forced from their homes, many by conflicts in the Middle East and in Africa. Now, these are humanitarian crises and refugees that we cannot ignore, and we have to deliver the urgent aid that is needed right now. And those countries that can must do more to accommodate refugees, recognizing that those children are just like ours. But our efforts must be matched by the hard work of diplomacy and reconciliation to end conflicts that so often tear societies apart. <p>And as I said earlier, war and conflict is more likely to arise where we have bad governance and we have high inequality and we have discrimination against minority groups and ethnic groups and we have low educational levels. So these things are all related. <p>And finally, development is threatened by climate change. And I want to thank the Secretary-General for the extraordinary leadership and work that he's done on this issue. <p>All of our countries will be affected by a changing climate. But the world's poorest people will bear the heaviest burden, from rising seas and more intense droughts, shortages of water and food. We will be seeing climate change refugees. As His Holiness Pope Francis has rightly implored the world, this is a moral calling. <p>In just 2 months, the world has an opportunity to unite around a strong global agreement. I saw President Hollande walk in a few moments ago; we are going to be converging in Paris. With his leadership, and the leadership of every world leader, we need to establish the tools and financing to help developing nations embrace clean energy, adapt to climate change, and ensure that there's not a false choice between economic development and the best practices that can save our planet. We can do the same at the same time. And the communities and lives of billions of people depend on the work that we do. <p>Future generations of young people watching today and tomorrow will judge us by the choices we make in the months and years ahead. And one of those young people is Eva Tolage. Now, Eva lives in a village in Tanzania. She's 15 years old, and she wrote me a letter. Some of you know I get 10 letters a day, mostly from inside the United States, but sometimes international letters. I get 40,000 a day, but I read 10. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And so Eva told me about her parents, farmers who struggle to provide for their seven children. And this young 15-year-old girl&mdash;a girl the age of my daughters&mdash;she dreams of going to college, but with little food to eat, she explained how it's hard for her sometimes to concentrate in school. She explained that her house doesn't have electricity, so it's hard for her to study at night. <p>It's not because her parents don't love her and don't have ambitions for her. Her father works incredibly hard in the fields to pay for her education. But they just need a little help. \\"I won't let him down,\\" Eva said. \\"I'll do whatever it takes,\\" she said in her letter. And then, knowing that we would be gathered at this summit to help lift up families like hers, she asked me a question that could be asked of all of our nations: \\"What will you commit to doing . . . ?\\" What will you do? <p>And there are billions of boys and girls just like Eva. They're just like our children. They have as much talent and as much hope for the future. And they're willing to work hard, and their parents love them just as much as we love ours. And just by the accident of birth, it's so much more difficult for them to achieve their dreams as it is for our children. But in the eyes of God, they are the same children. They're just as important. <p>And for Eva and all those just trying to survive another day in conditions that many of us can barely imagine, it can sometimes seem as if the world is blind to their struggles and their dreams. And so today I say to Eva and hundreds of millions&mdash;billions&mdash;like her: We see you. We hear you. I've read your letter. And we commit ourselves&mdash;as nations, as one world&mdash;to the urgent work that must be done: to standing with families like Eva's as they work and strive for a better life; to ending the injustice of extreme poverty; to upholding the inherent dignity of every human being, whatever it takes. We cannot let them down. And with your help, we won't. <p>Thank you very much.\" "
"217" "\"Hello, New York! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Democrats! Thank you, New York! Thank you. Everybody, sit down. Obergefell. Just to be clear. It is good to be in New York. Although, I do apologize. This week is rough for you guys. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, traffic is bad enough during UNGA, but you add the Pope to it&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and that's serious traffic. <p>Give it up for Betty Who! And give it up for Jim for not just the terrific introduction, but Jim represents all the trailblazers and pioneers and activists whose courage and persistence have made America a better place. Please give him a big round of applause. We're very proud of him. <p>We've got some outstanding Members of Congress and elected officials who are here tonight, including the chair of the DNC, Debbie Wasserman Schultz. It is Debbie's birthday today. You threw her quite a party. We've also got DNC treasurer, Andy Tobias. Senator Tammy Baldwin. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is here. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey is here. And of course, all of you are here. <p>Seven years ago we came together not just to elect a President, but to reaffirm our faith in that most American of ideals: the notion that people, no matter where they come from, what they look like, what their last name is, or who they love can change this country. And from the beginning, that faith was tested, by a great recession, by political obstruction, by established barriers and everyday indignities, all of which reminded us that our march toward equality was unfinished. <p>And time after time, the cynics told us that we were foolish to keep believing, that we were naive to hope, that change was too messy or not possible at all. And if you admit it, there were some in this room here who were skeptical that everything that needed to happen would happen. The cynics were wrong. Tonight we live in an America where \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" is something that \\"don't exist.\\" <p>We live in an America where all of us&mdash;LGBT or not&mdash;are protected by a hate crimes law that bears Matthew Shepard's name. We live in an America where a growing share of older generations recognize that love is love and younger generations don't even know what all the fuss was about. And tonight, thanks to the unbending sense of justice passed down through generations of citizens who never gave up hope that we could bring this country closer to our founding ideals&mdash;that all of us are created equal&mdash;we now live in America where our marriages are equal as well. <p>It's getting better for all of us. Our businesses have created 13 million new jobs in the past 5&frac12; years. In 2012, the Republican nominee for this office promised to get the unemployment rate down to 6 percent by the end of next year. [<i>Laughter</i>] We moved that up a little bit and got it down to 5 percent right now. We were told that Obamacare would kill jobs, explode the deficits, destroy freedom. Today, we've seen 66 consecutive months of private sector job growth, a streak that just happened to begin the month I signed Obamacare into law. Meanwhile, we've cut our deficit by two-thirds, and over 17 million Americans have health insurance because of Obamacare. And along with the 17 million who've got health insurance through Obamacare, there are tens of millions more&mdash;all of you if you've got health insurance&mdash;who now know that in this country, you can't be discriminated against just because you get sick. Those days are in the past. <p>Reading scores are up. College attendance is up. High school graduations are up. We've doubled the production of clean energy. We are making incredible progress when it comes to climate change. On every metric, by every standard, we've made progress. <p>Now, you would not know this&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;if you were listening to the busload of Republicans fighting each other for this job. [<i>Laughter</i>] It somehow doesn't come up in debate. [<i>Laughter</i>] In their world, everything was terrific back in 2008&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;when we were in the midst of a spiral into the worst financial crisis and economic crisis since the Great Depression, when unemployment and uninsured rates were rising and when our economy was shedding jobs each month, and we were mired in two wars, hopelessly addicted to foreign oil, and bin Laden was still at large. Those were the golden years, apparently. [<i>Laughter</i>] And then, I came in and messed it all up. <p>I have to say, I don't pay attention to much of this stuff. [<i>Laughter</i>] But you got to give these folks credit for chutzpah. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, they maintain a straight face when they're saying this. And then, in interviews, the reporters are, like, just kind of letting them talk as if what they were saying was true. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And so since everything was doing so well back in 2007-2008, now if we can just repeal Obamacare and gut Wall Street reform and shut down our Government over women's access to health care and deny that the planet is getting warmer, they've got a plan to get us back on track. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, the good news is, they probably won't use marriage equality as a wedge issue like they did in 2004 because the country has come too far. In fact, America has left the leaders of the Republican Party behind. One of their leading candidates argued that going to prison turns you gay. [<i>Laughter</i>] Well, you think I'm&mdash;I shouldn't go into this? [<i>Laughter</i>] No, I mean, I'm just stating the facts. Another candidate boasts that he introduced an amendment to end nationwide marriage equality, which isn't even an accomplishment at all. [<i>Laughter</i>] A third says Americans should just disobey the Supreme Court's ruling entirely. I'm sure he loves the Constitution, except for Article III. [<i>Laughter</i>] And maybe the Equal Protection Amendment. And 14th Amendment, generally. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, look, for some Americans, there's no doubt that this change has been a whirlwind. And we believe that these changes have been for the better. But we have to recognize&mdash;and in fact, I know the people in this room do because they felt it in their own family sometimes or in the workplace&mdash;that with change, with any progress, comes some unease. And as Americans, I think we have to acknowledge that. I think that it's important for us to recognize that there are still parts of the country that are getting there, but it's going to take some time. <p>We affirm that we cherish our religious freedom and are profoundly respectful of religious traditions. But we also have to say clearly that our religious freedom doesn't grant us the freedom to deny our fellow Americans their constitutional rights. And that even as we are respectful and accommodating genuine concerns and interests of religious institutions, we need to reject politicians who are supporting new forms of discrimination as a way to scare up votes. That's not how we move America forward. <p>So to secure the gains this country has made requires continued vigilance, not complacency. This country has come too far, and people of good will in both political parties are too plentiful to turn back now. We've made sure that Federal contractors can't fire a worker just for being gay. We should make sure that no American lives in fear of being fired just because of who they love. We've come a long way in changing hearts and minds so that trans men and women can be who they are, not just on magazine covers, but in workplaces and schools and communities. And to build on that progress, we should support efforts to ban so-called conversion therapy for minors. <p>So we've got to keep striving every day to treat each other the way I believe God sees us, as equal in His eyes. Harvey Milk once said, \\"If a gay person makes it, the doors are open to everyone.\\" But to those of us who've made it through those doors, we've got a unique obligation to reach back and make sure other people can make it through those doors too. We have a responsibility to stand up to bigotry, not just against us, but against anybody, anywhere. We have a responsibility to stand up for freedom, not just our own freedom, but for everybody's freedom. We speak up to condemn hatred against anybody&mdash;gay or straight, black or white, Christian, Muslim, Jew, nonbeliever, immigrant&mdash;because we remember what silence felt like when hatred was directed at us, and we've got to be champions on behalf of justice for everybody, not just our own. <p>That's what makes us human. And that's America at its best: our ability to connect, our ability to see ourselves in somebody else. To be an ally to the marginalized, to the dispossessed, to the discriminated against. To recognize our joy and our struggles and our fears and our hope and our love in somebody else. <p>Maybe it's the trans activist demanding dignity. Maybe it's the immigrant hoping to contribute, or the middle class kid struggling to pay for college. Maybe it's the woman denied equal pay, the African-American denied the right to vote, the worker denied a living wage. Their stories may not be ours, but surely we can see our stories in theirs. We can make their fight our own. <p>And in the end, that's what makes me proudest to be a Democrat. I think we're right on most policy issues. I think that we have the better argument in economics and foreign affairs. But at the core of this party today as it's currently constituted&mdash;and we have to remind ourselves that it hasn't always been that way. There have been times where the Democratic Party stood in the way of progress. And there have been times where Republicans, like Abraham Lincoln and Everett Dirksen, stood on the right side of change. <p>Right now what makes me proudest about being a Democrat is, is that at our core, we really do believe in everybody having a shot. At our core, we really do believe that that's not just a theoretical assertion, but it's an obligation. It compels us. It's part of one American family: to fight on behalf of those who haven't had the same kind of chances that we do; to make sure that everybody has dignity and respect and that every kid out there is able to live out their dreams. <p>We mean it when we say that all are created equal. And we understand that that has to be operative in our own individual lives, but we also have to express it through the common enterprise called government. We mean it when we say that in this country, of all countries, everyone deserves an equal shot. <p>And so, Democrats, over the next 14 months, we have to work even harder than we did when I was first on the ballot. We're going to have to work harder to protect the gains that we've made. We're going to have to work harder to widen the circle of opportunity for all who strive for it. It will not be easy. There's always a contest in this country since its founding between hope and fear. What makes America special is, is that though sometimes we zig and zag, eventually, hope wins out. But it only wins out because folks like you put your shoulder behind the wheel and push it in that direction. <p>That was true in the past. That will be true in the future. I look forward to working with you to make sure it happens in this election cycle. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America. Thank you.\" "
"218" "\"Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, fellow delegates, ladies and gentlemen: Seventy years after the founding of the United Nations, it is worth reflecting on what, together, the members of this body have helped to achieve. <p>Out of the ashes of the Second World War, having witnessed the unthinkable power of the atomic age, the United States has worked with many nations in this Assembly to prevent a third world war: by forging alliances with old adversaries, by supporting the steady emergence of strong democracies accountable to their people instead of any foreign power, and by building an international system that imposes a cost on those who choose conflict over cooperation, an order that recognizes the dignity and equal worth of all people. <p>That is the work of seven decades. That is the ideal that this body, at its best, has pursued. Of course, there have been too many times when, collectively, we have fallen short of these ideals. Over seven decades, terrible conflicts have claimed untold victims. But we have pressed forward, slowly, steadily, to make a system of international rules and norms that are better and stronger and more consistent. <p>It is this international order that has unwritten&mdash;underwritten unparalleled advances in human liberty and prosperity. It is this collective endeavor that's brought about diplomatic cooperation between the world's major powers and buttressed a global economy that has lifted more than a billion people from poverty. It is these international principles that have helped constrain bigger countries from imposing our will on smaller ones and advanced the emergence of democracy and development and individual liberty on every continent. <p>This progress is real. It can be documented in lives saved and agreements forged and diseases conquered and in mouths fed. And yet we come together today knowing that the march of human progress never travels in a straight line, that our work is far from complete; that dangerous currents risk pulling us back into a darker, more disordered world. <p>Today, we see the collapse of strongmen and fragile states breeding conflict and driving innocent men, women, and children across borders on an epic scale. Brutal networks of terror have stepped into the vacuum. Technologies that empower individuals are now also exploited by those who spread disinformation or suppress dissent or radicalize our youth. Global capital flows have powered growth and investment, but also increased risk of contagion, weakened the bargaining power of workers, and accelerated inequality. <p>How should we respond to these trends? There are those who argue that the ideals enshrined in the U.N. Charter are unachievable or out of date, a legacy of a postwar era not suited to our own. Effectively, they argue for a return to the rules that applied for most of human history and that predate this institution: the belief that power is a zero-sum game, that might makes right, that strong states must impose their will on weaker ones, that the rights of individuals don't matter, and that in a time of rapid change, order must be imposed by force. <p>On this basis, we see some major powers assert themselves in ways that contravene international law. We see an erosion of the democratic principles and human rights that are fundamental to this institution's mission; information is strictly controlled, the space for civil society restricted. We're told that such retrenchment is required to beat back disorder, that it's the only way to stamp out terrorism or prevent foreign meddling. In accordance with this logic, we should support tyrants like Bashar al-Asad, who drops barrel bombs to massacre innocent children, because the alternative is surely worse. <p>The increasing skepticism of our international order can also be found in the most advanced democracies. We see greater polarization; more frequent gridlock; movements on the far right, and sometimes the left, that insist on stopping the trade that binds our fates to other nations, calling for the building of walls to keep out immigrants. And most ominously, we see the fears of ordinary people being exploited through appeals to sectarianism or tribalism or racism or anti-Semitism; appeals to a glorious past before the body politic was infected by those who look different or worship God differently; a politics of \\"us\\" versus \\"them\\". <p>The United States is not immune from this. Even as our economy is growing and our troops have largely returned from Iraq and Afghanistan, we see in our debates about America's role in the world a notion of strength that is defined by opposition to old enemies, perceived adversaries: a rising China or a resurgent Russia, a revolutionary Iran or an Islam that is incompatible with peace. We see an argument made that the only strength that matters for the United States is bellicose words and shows of military force, that cooperation and diplomacy will not work. <p>As President of the United States, I am mindful of the dangers that we face; they cross my desk every morning. I lead the strongest military that the world has ever known, and I will never hesitate to protect my country or our allies, unilaterally and by force where necessary. <p>But I stand before you today believing in my core that we, the nations of the world, cannot return to the old ways of conflict and coercion. We cannot look backwards. We live in an integrated world, one in which we all have a stake in each other's success. We cannot turn back those forces of integration. No nation in this Assembly can insulate itself from the threat of terrorism or the risk of financial contagion, the flow of migrants or the danger of a warming planet. The disorder we see is not driven solely by competition between nations or any single ideology. And if we cannot work together more effectively, we will all suffer the consequences. That is true for the United States as well. <p>No matter how powerful our military, how strong our economy, we understand the United States cannot solve the world's problems alone. In Iraq, the United States learned the hard lesson that even hundreds of thousands of brave, effective troops, trillions of dollars from our Treasury, cannot by itself impose stability on a foreign land. Unless we work with other nations under the mantle of international norms and principles and law that offer legitimacy to our efforts, we will not succeed. And unless we work together to defeat the ideas that drive different communities in a country like Iraq into conflict, any order that our militaries can impose will be temporary. <p>And just as force alone cannot impose order internationally, I believe in my core that repression cannot forge the social cohesion for nations to succeed. The history of the last two decades proves that in today's world, dictatorships are unstable. The strongmen of today become the spark of revolution tomorrow. You can jail your opponents, but you can't imprison ideas. You can try to control access to information, but you cannot turn a lie into truth. It is not a conspiracy of U.S.-backed NGOs that expose corruption and raise the expectations of people around the globe; it's technology, social media, and the irreducible desire of people everywhere to make their own choices about how they are governed. Indeed, I believe that in today's world, the measure of strength is no longer defined by the control of territory. Lasting prosperity does not come solely from the ability to access and extract raw materials. The strength of nations depends on the success of their people&mdash;their knowledge, their innovation, their imagination, their creativity, their drive, their opportunity&mdash;and that, in turn, depends upon individual rights and good governance and personal security. Internal repression and foreign aggression are both symptoms of the failure to provide this foundation. <p>A politics of&mdash;and solidarity that depend on demonizing others, that draws on religious sectarianism or narrow tribalism or jingoism, may at times look like strength in the moment, but over time its weakness will be exposed. And history tells us that the dark forces unleashed by this type of politics surely makes all of us less secure. Our world has been there before. We gain nothing from going back. <p>Instead, I believe that we must go forward in pursuit of our ideals, not abandon them at this critical time. We must give expression to our best hopes, not our deepest fears. This institution was founded because men and women who came before us had the foresight to know that our nations are more secure when we uphold basic laws and basic norms and pursue a path of cooperation over conflict. And strong nations, above all, have a responsibility to uphold this international order. <p>Let me give you a concrete example. After I took office, I made clear that one of the principal achievements of this body&mdash;the nuclear nonproliferation regime&mdash;was endangered by Iran's violation of the NPT. On that basis, the Security Council tightened sanctions on the Iranian Government, and many nations joined us to enforce them. Together, we showed that laws and agreements mean something. <p>But we also understood that the goal of sanctions was not simply to punish Iran. Our objective was to test whether Iran could change course, accept constraints, and allow the world to verify that its nuclear program will be peaceful. For 2 years, the United States and our partners&mdash;including Russia, including China&mdash;stuck together in complex negotiations. The result is a lasting, comprehensive deal that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, while allowing it to access peaceful energy. And if this deal is fully implemented, the prohibition on nuclear weapons is strengthened, a potential war is averted, our world is safer. That is the strength of the international system when it works the way it should. <p>That same fidelity to international order guides our responses to other challenges around the world. Consider Russia's annexation of Crimea and further aggression in eastern Ukraine. America has few economic interests in Ukraine. We recognize the deep and complex history between Russia and Ukraine. But we cannot stand by when the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a nation is flagrantly violated. If that happens without consequence in Ukraine, it could happen to any nation gathered here today. That's the basis of the sanctions that the United States and our partners impose on Russia. It's not a desire to return to a cold war. <p>Now, within Russia, state-controlled media may describe these events as an example of a resurgent Russia&mdash;a view shared, by the way, by a number of U.S. politicians and commentators who have always been deeply skeptical of Russia and seem to be convinced a new cold war is, in fact, upon us. And yet look at the results. The Ukrainian people are more interested than ever in aligning with Europe instead of Russia. Sanctions have led to capital flight, a contracting economy, a fallen ruble, and the emigration of more educated Russians. Imagine if, instead, Russia had engaged in true diplomacy and worked with Ukraine and the international community to ensure its interests were protected. That would be better for Ukraine, but also better for Russia and better for the world, which is why we continue to press for this crisis to be resolved in a way that allows a sovereign and democratic Ukraine to determine its future and control its territory. Not because we want to isolate Russia&mdash;we don't&mdash;but because we want a strong Russia that's invested in working with us to strengthen the international system as a whole. <p>Similarly, in the South China Sea, the United States makes no claim on territory there. We don't adjudicate claims. But like every nation gathered here, we have an interest in upholding the basic principles of freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce and in resolving disputes through international law, not the law of force. So we will defend these principles, while encouraging China and other claimants to resolve their differences peacefully. <p>I say this recognizing that diplomacy is hard, that the outcomes are sometimes unsatisfying, that it's rarely politically popular. But I believe that leaders of large nations, in particular, have an obligation to take these risks, precisely because we are strong enough to protect our interests if and when diplomacy fails. <p>I also believe that to move forward in this new era, we have to be strong enough to acknowledge when what you're doing is not working. For 50 years, the United States pursued a Cuba policy that failed to improve the lives of the Cuban people. We changed that. We continue to have differences with the Cuban Government. We will continue to stand up for human rights. But we address these issues through diplomatic relations and increased commerce and people-to-people ties. As these contacts yield progress, I'm confident that our Congress will inevitably lift an embargo that should not be in place anymore. Change won't come overnight to Cuba, but I'm confident that openness, not coercion, will support the reforms and better the life the Cuban people deserve, just as I believe that Cuba will find its success if it pursues cooperation with other nations. <p>Now, if it's in the interest of major powers to uphold international standards, it is even more true for the rest of the community of nations. Look around the world. From Singapore to Colombia to Senegal, the facts show that nations succeed when they pursue an inclusive peace and prosperity within their borders and work cooperatively with countries beyond their borders. <p>That path is now available to a nation like Iran, which, as of this moment, continues to deploy violent proxies to advance its interests. These efforts may appear to give Iran leverage in disputes with neighbors, but they fuel sectarian conflict that endangers the entire region and isolates Iran from the promise of trade and commerce. The Iranian people have a proud history and are filled with extraordinary potential. But chanting \\"Death to America\\" does not create jobs or make Iran more secure. If Iran chose a different path, that would be good for the security of the region, good for the Iranian people, and good for the world. <p>Of course, around the globe, we will continue to be confronted with nations who reject these lessons of history, places where civil strife and border disputes and sectarian wars bring about terrorist enclaves and humanitarian disasters. Where order has completely broken down, we must act, but we will be stronger when we act together. <p>In such efforts, the United States will always do our part. We will do so mindful of the lessons of the past, not just the lessons of Iraq, but also the example of Libya, where we joined an international coalition under a U.N. mandate to prevent a slaughter. Even as we helped the Libyan people bring an end to the reign of a tyrant, our coalition could have and should have done more to fill a vacuum left behind. We're grateful to the United Nations for its efforts to forge a unity Government. We will help any legitimate Libyan Government as it works to bring the country together. But we also have to recognize that we must work more effectively in the future, as an international community, to build capacity for states that are in distress, before they collapse. <p>And that's why we should celebrate the fact that later today the United States will join with more than 50 countries to enlist new capabilities&mdash;infantry, intelligence, helicopters, hospitals, and tens of thousands of troops&mdash;to strengthen United Nations peacekeeping. These new capabilities can prevent mass killing and ensure that peace agreements are more than words on paper. But we have to do it together. Together, we must strengthen our collective capacity to establish security where order has broken down and to support those who seek a just and lasting peace. <p>Nowhere is our commitment to international order more tested than in Syria. When a dictator slaughters tens of thousands of his own people, that is not just a matter of one nation's internal affairs, it breeds human suffering on an order of magnitude that affects us all. Likewise, when a terrorist group beheads captives, slaughters the innocent and enslaves women, that's not a single nation's national security problem, that is an assault on all our humanity. <p>I've said before, and I will repeat: There is no room for accommodating an apocalyptic cult like ISIL, and the United States makes no apology for using our military, as part of a broad coalition, to go after them. We do so with a determination to ensure that there will never be a safe haven for terrorists who carry out these crimes. And we have demonstrated over more than a decade of relentless pursuit of Al Qaida, we will not be outlasted by extremists. <p>But while military power is necessary, it is not sufficient to resolve the situation in Syria. Lasting stability can only take hold when the people of Syria forge an agreement to live together peacefully. The United States is prepared to work with any nation, including Russia and Iran, to resolve the conflict. But we must recognize that there cannot be, after so much bloodshed, so much carnage, a return to the prewar status quo. <p>Let's remember how this started. Asad reacted to peaceful protests by escalating repression and killing that, in turn, created the environment for the current strife. And so Asad and his allies cannot simply pacify the broad majority of a population who have been brutalized by chemical weapons and indiscriminate bombing. Yes, realism dictates that compromise will be required to end the fighting and ultimately stamp out ISIL. But realism also requires a managed transition away from Asad and to a new leader and an inclusive Government that recognizes there must be an end to this chaos so that the Syrian people can begin to rebuild. <p>We know that ISIL, which emerged out of the chaos of Iraq and Syria, depends on perpetual war to survive. But we also know that they gain adherents because of a poisonous ideology. So part of our job, together, is to work to reject such extremism that infects too many of our young people. Part of that effort must be a continued rejection by Muslims of those who distort Islam to preach intolerance and promote violence, and it must also be a rejection by non-Muslims of the ignorance that equates Islam with terror. <p>This work will take time. There are no easy answers to Syria. And there are no simple answers to the changes that are taking place in much of the Middle East and North Africa. But so many families need help right now; they don't have time. And that's why the United States is increasing the number of refugees who we welcome within our borders. That's why we will continue to be the largest donor of assistance to support those refugees. And today we are launching new efforts to ensure that our people and our businesses, our universities, and our NGOs can help as well, because in the faces of suffering families, our Nation of immigrants sees ourselves. <p>Of course, in the old ways of thinking, the plight of the powerless, the plight of refugees, the plight of the marginalized did not matter. They were on the periphery of the world's concerns. Today, our concern for them is driven not just by conscience, but should also be driven by self-interest. For helping people who have been pushed to the margins of our world is not mere charity, it is a matter of collective security. And the purpose of this institution is not merely to avoid conflict, it is to galvanize the collective action that makes life better on this planet. <p>The commitments we've made to the sustainable development goals speak to this truth. I believe that capitalism has been the greater creator of wealth and opportunity that the world has ever known. But from big cities to rural villages around the world, we also know that prosperity is still cruelly out of reach for too many. As His Holiness Pope Francis reminds us, we are stronger when we value the least among these and see them as equal in dignity to ourselves and our sons and our daughters. <p>We can roll back preventable disease and end the scourge of HIV/AIDS. We can stamp out pandemics that recognize no borders. That work may not be on television right now, but as we demonstrated in reversing the spread of Ebola, it can save more lives than anything else we can do. <p>Together, we can eradicate extreme poverty and erase barriers to opportunity. But this requires a sustained commitment to our people so farmers can feed more people, so entrepreneurs can start a business without paying a bribe, so young people have the skills they need to succeed in this modern, knowledge-based economy. <p>We can promote growth through trade that meets a higher standard. And that's what we're doing through the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement that encompasses nearly 40 percent of the global economy, an agreement that will open markets, while protecting the rights of workers and protecting the environment that enables development to be sustained. <p>We can roll back the pollution that we put in our skies and help economies lift people out of poverty without condemning our children to the ravages of an ever-warming climate. The same ingenuity that produced the Industrial Age and the Computer Age allows us to harness the potential of clean energy. No country can escape the ravages of climate change. And there is no stronger sign of leadership than putting future generations first. The United States will work with every nation that is willing to do its part so that we can come together in Paris to decisively confront this challenge. <p>And finally, our vision for the future of this Assembly, my belief in moving forward rather than backwards, requires us to defend the democratic principles that allow societies to succeed. Let me start from a simple premise: Catastrophes, like what we are seeing in Syria, do not take place in countries where there is genuine democracy and respect for the universal values this institution is supposed to defend. <p>I recognize that democracy is going to take different forms in different parts of the world. The very idea of a people governing themselves depends upon governing&mdash;government giving expression to their unique culture, their unique history, their unique experiences. But some universal truths are self-evident: No person wants to be imprisoned for peaceful worship; no woman should ever be abused with impunity or a girl barred from going to school; the freedom to peacefully petition those in power without fear of arbitrary laws. These are not ideas of one country or one culture. They are fundamental to human progress. They are a cornerstone of this institution. <p>I realize that in many parts of the world there is a different view: a belief that strong leadership must tolerate no dissent. I hear it not only from America's adversaries, but privately, at least, I also hear it from some of our friends. I disagree. I believe a government that suppresses peaceful dissent is not showing strength; it is showing weakness, and it is showing fear. History shows that regimes who fear their own people will eventually crumble, but strong institutions built on the consent of the governed endure long after any one individual is gone. <p>That's why our strongest leaders, from George Washington to Nelson Mandela, have elevated the importance of building strong, democratic institutions over a thirst for perpetual power. Leaders who amend constitutions to stay in office only acknowledge that they failed to build a successful country for their people. Because none of us lasts forever. It tells us that power is something they cling to for its own sake, rather than for the betterment of those they purport to serve. <p>I understand democracy is frustrating. Democracy in the United States is certainly imperfect. At times, it can be dysfunctional. But democracy&mdash;the constant struggle to extend rights to more of our people, to give more people a voice&mdash;is what allowed us to become the most powerful nation in the world. <p>It's not simply a matter of principle; it's not an abstraction. Democracy&mdash;inclusive democracy&mdash;makes countries stronger. When opposition parties can seek power peacefully through the ballot, a country draws upon new ideas. When a free media can inform the public, corruption and abuse are exposed and can be rooted out. When civil society thrives, communities can solve problems that governments cannot necessarily solve alone. When immigrants are welcomed, countries are more productive and more vibrant. When girls can go to school and get a job and pursue unlimited opportunity, that's when a country realizes its full potential. <p>That is what I believe is America's greatest strength. Not everybody in America agrees with me, but that's part of democracy. I believe that the fact that you can walk the streets of this city right now and pass churches and synagogues and temples and mosques, where people worship freely; the fact that our Nation of immigrants mirrors the diversity of the world&mdash;you can find everybody from everywhere here in New York City&mdash;the fact that, in this country, everybody can contribute, everybody can participate, no matter who they are or what they look like or who they love, that's what makes us strong. <p>And I believe that what is true for America is true for virtually all mature democracies. And that is no accident. We can be proud of our nations without defining ourselves in opposition to some other group. We can be patriotic without demonizing someone else. We can cherish our own identities&mdash;our religion, our ethnicity, our traditions&mdash;without putting others down. Our systems are premised on the notion that absolute power will corrupt, but that people&mdash;ordinary people&mdash;are fundamentally good; that they value family and friendship, faith and the dignity of hard work; and that with appropriate checks and balances, governments can reflect this goodness. I believe that's the future we must seek together. To believe in the dignity of every individual, to believe we can bridge our differences and choose cooperation over conflict&mdash;that is not weakness, that is strength. It is a practical necessity in this interconnected world. <p>And our people understand this. Think of the Liberian doctor who went door to door to search for Ebola cases and to tell families what to do if they show symptoms. Think of the Iranian shopkeeper who said, after the nuclear deal, \\"God willing, now we'll be able to offer many more goods at better prices.\\" Think of the Americans who lowered the flag over our Embassy in Havana in 1961&mdash;the year I was born&mdash;and returned this summer to raise that flag back up. One of these men said of the Cuban people: \\"We could do things for them, and they could do things for us. We loved them.\\" For 50 years, we ignored that fact. <p>Think of the families leaving everything they've known behind, risking barren deserts and stormy waters just to find shelter, just to save their children. One Syrian refugee who was greeted in Hamburg with warm greetings and shelter said, \\"We feel there are still some people who love other people.\\" <p>The people of our United Nations are not as different as they are told. They can be made to fear, they can be taught to hate, but they can also respond to hope. History is littered with the failure of false prophets and fallen empires who believed that might always makes right, and that will continue to be the case. You can count on that. But we are called upon to offer a different type of leadership, leadership strong enough to recognize that nations share common interests and people share a common humanity and, yes, there are certain ideas and principles that are universal. <p>That's what those who shaped the United Nations 70 years ago understood. Let us carry forward that faith into the future, for it is the only way we can assure that future will be brighter for my children and for yours. <p>Thank you very much.\" "
"219" "\"Good afternoon. As always, this lunch comes right after I have spoken. And I think the Secretary-General designs it that way to keep me brief. <p>You've heard enough from me already today. I do want to take this opportunity to welcome all of you once again to the United States and New York City, as we mark the 70th anniversary of this institution. And I want to thank all of you for the work that we have done together. <p>In particular, I want to thank our Secretary-General for his outstanding work. Mr. Secretary-General, you have helped to mobilize the world around a host of urgent challenges: humanitarian disasters, our new sustainable development goals, and climate change. I value your friendship. I value your counsel. I'm glad you think that we're all lucky to have this many challenges. [<i>Laughter</i>] I don't know if you personally always feel that way. But because of your tireless work, the world is a better place. We very much appreciate you. <p>One of the Secretary-General's predecessors, Dag Hammarskjold, once said, \\"The pursuit of peace and progress, with its trials and its errors, its successes and its setbacks, can never be relaxed and can never be abandoned.\\" Over the past seven decades, we've witnessed this institution's enormous power to resolve conflicts and protect the world's vulnerable people, to strengthen international cooperation, including between former adversaries. But we are facing extraordinary challenges today, ones that test our capacity to work together: humanitarian crises, challenges to the international order, threats to human rights. And so our ability to come together as the United Nations is being tested once again. <p>When I think about the true measure of our success going forward, the opportunities that we create for our people, the security that we provide them, our ability to address terrorism or the ravages of climate change, I feel optimistic that we can tackle these problems if we all work together. And this institution will be critical in order for us to achieve those goals. <p>There is no problem that man has caused that man cannot solve if we are bold enough, deploy our imagination, have the political will, and recognize our common humanity. That's what the United Nations is about. That's what our Secretary-General has been about. <p>And I want to propose a toast: To all of our nations, to the United Nations, to the people that we represent and to whom we have responsibilities towards. Amid the inevitable trials and setbacks, may we never relax in our pursuit of progress, and may we never abandon the pursuit of peace. <p>Cheers. <p>[<i>At this point, the President offered a toast.</i>]\" "
"220" "\"Good afternoon. Mr. Secretary-General, heads of state and government, distinguished representatives: The word \\"peacekeeping\\" does not appear in the Charter of the United Nations. But for the past seven decades, our collective ability to \\"maintain international peace and security\\" has often depended on the willingness of courageous U.N. peacekeepers to put their lives on the line in war-torn corners of the world. <p>Over the years&mdash;from El Salvador to Namibia, from Liberia to Timor-Leste&mdash;more than 1 million men and women in blue helmets have prevented violence and preserved peace. They have saved lives. They've given societies a chance to rebuild. Through bitter experience, in places like Bosnia and Rwanda, we've learned painful lessons, and we've worked to do better. Right now, as we speak, more than 100,000 troops and police are deployed around the world: training police in Haiti, promoting stability in Lebanon, protecting civilians in South Sudan. And down the decades, more than 3,300 peacekeepers, as well as many police and civilian staff, have made the ultimate sacrifice. The United Nations and the United States salutes them all. <p>We know that peace operations are not the solution to every problem, but they do remain one of the world's most important tools to address armed conflict. And I called for this summit because U.N. peacekeeping operations are experiencing unprecedented strains. Old challenges persist: Too few nations bear a disproportionate burden of providing troops, which is unsustainable. Atop this, we've seen new challenges: more armed conflicts, more instability driven by terrorism and violent extremism, and more refugees. <p>As a consequence, peacekeepers head into more difficult and deadlier conflicts. They're given ambitious mandates and charged with increasingly dangerous and complex missions. Just yesterday, a U.N. peacekeeper was killed in Darfur, and we've seen reports today of a tragic incident in the Central African Republic. Put simply, the supply of well-trained, well-equipped peacekeepers can't keep up with the growing demand. <p>So we are here today, together, to strengthen and reform U.N. peacekeeping because our common security demands it. This is not something that we do for others, this is something that we do collectively because our collective security depends on it. <p>As the largest financial contributor to the U.N. peacekeeping operations, the United States intends to continue to do its part. And today I'm issuing new Presidential guidance&mdash;the first in more than 20 years&mdash;to expand our support for U.N. peace operations. Like the nations participating today, we'll pledge additional resources. We'll work to double the number of U.S. military officers serving in peacekeeping operations. We will offer logistical support, including our unrivaled network of air- and sealift. When there's an urgent need and we're uniquely positioned to help, we'll undertake engineering projects like building airfields and base camps for new missions. And we'll step up our efforts to help build the U.N.'s capacity, from identifying state-of-the-art technology to offering training to protection against IEDs. <p>And together, there's much more we need to do together. So let me briefly suggest several key areas where we can focus. First, more nations need to contribute more forces. We are joined today by countries from every region of the world. And I want to thank those who already do so much, and commend those who have come here prepared to do more. At this summit, more than 50 countries&mdash;from Bangladesh to Colombia, from Finland to China&mdash;are making commitments totaling more than 30,000 new troops and police. And they're stepping up with critical contributions like medical units, helicopters, and capabilities to counter IEDs, which will help peacekeepers be able to stay safe and succeed in their missions. This all represents significant progress, and over the coming years, I believe more nations can make even more contributions. <p>Second, we need to improve the protection of civilians. Unlike 20 years ago, today's U.N. peacekeepers have the clear authority to safeguard the innocent, but it is still applied unevenly. That's why the principles and best practices for civilian protection laid out in Kigali are so important. Because for innocent people caught in the crossfire in places like South Sudan, the actions of U.N. peacekeepers can mean the difference between life and death. <p>At the same time, we have to candidly acknowledge that abuse by peacekeepers has to end. I want to be very clear: The overwhelming number of peacekeepers serve with honor and decency in extraordinarily difficult situations. But we have seen some appalling cases of peacekeepers abusing civilians&mdash;including rape and sexual assault&mdash;and that is totally unacceptable. It's an affront to human decency. It undermines the core mission because it erodes trust with communities. It has a corrosive effect on global confidence in peacekeeping itself. <p>So, Mr. Secretary-General, we commend you for leading on this issue and insisting on accountability, and we know you cannot solve this problem alone. As leaders and as an international community, we have to insist on zero tolerance for abuse&mdash;zero. <p>Third, we need to reform and modernize peace operations because today's complex conflicts demand it. And that means putting in place the highest caliber, merit-based leadership teams for every single mission. It means making sure we get more women leaders into critical roles. It means planning the rules for operations in the field and not in conference rooms. <p>Our goal should be to make every new peace operation more efficient and more effective than the last. Beyond strengthening U.N. peacekeeping, the United States also supports developing new and deeper partnerships between the U.N. and the African Union to provide reliable support for AU peace operations. And we look forward to hearing concrete proposals from our African partners to advance this work. <p>Finally, we need to increase our support of the full range of U.N. diplomatic tools&mdash;including mediation, Envoys, and special political missions&mdash;which help us to prevent conflicts in the first place. We cannot expect peacekeeping operations to succeed unless the parties involved are willing and committed to making peace. <p>Now, if we do all these things, if we provide the support and embrace the reforms that I've described today, I believe we can strengthen peace operations for decades to come. Because we know&mdash;we can be certain&mdash;that in the years ahead, as conflicts arise, the call will go out to those men and women in blue helmets to restore calm and to keep the peace and to save lives. And when they go, their success and their lives will depend on whether they have the training and the forces and the capabilities and the global support they need to succeed in their mission. The decisions and the commitments we make today can help ensure that they do. I want to thank all of you for your partnership and the commitments that your nations are making here. We will hear some extraordinary commitments from a number of nations. And we are very proud that the international community has responded to this call in such a significant way. Rest assured that, in this critical work, the United States will be a strong partner to all of you. <p>Thank you very much.\" "
"221" "\"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, heads of state and government. Last year, here at the United Nations, I called on the world to unite against the evil that is ISIL, or Daesh, and to eradicate the scourge of violent extremism. And I challenged countries to return to the General Assembly this year with concrete steps that we can take together. <p>I want to thank everyone who is here today, including my fellow leaders, for answering this call. We are joined by representatives from more than 100 nations, more than 20 multilateral institutions, some 120 civil society groups from around the world, and partners from the private sector. I believe what we have here today is the emergence of a global movement that is united by the mission of degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL. <p>Together, we're pursuing a comprehensive strategy that is informed by our success over many years in crippling the Al Qaida core in the tribal regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan. And we are harnessing all of our tools: military, intelligence, economic, development, and the strength of our communities. <p>Now, I have repeatedly said that our approach will take time. This is not an easy task. We have ISIL taking root in areas that already are suffering from failed governance, in some cases; in some cases, civil war or sectarian strife. And as a consequence of the vacuum that exists in many of these areas, ISIL has been able to dig in. They have shown themselves to be resilient, and they are very effective through social media and have been able to attract adherents not just from the areas in which they operate, but in many of our own countries. <p>There are going to be successes and there are going to be setbacks. This is not a conventional battle. This is a long-term campaign, not only against this particular network, but against its ideology. And so, with the few minutes I have, I want to provide a brief overview of where we stand currently. <p>Our coalition has grown to some 60 nations, including our Arab partners. Together, we welcome three new countries to our coalition: Nigeria, Tunisia, and Malaysia. Nearly two dozen nations are in some way contributing to the military campaign, and we salute and are grateful for all the servicemembers from our respective nations who are performing with skill and determination. <p>In Iraq, ISIL continues to hold Mosul, Fallujah, and Ramadi. But Iraqi forces, backed by coalition air power, have liberated towns across Kirkuk province and Tikrit. ISIL has now lost nearly a third of the populated areas in Iraq that it had controlled. Eighteen countries are now helping to train and support Iraqi forces, including Sunni volunteers who want to push ISIL out of their communities. And, Prime Minister Abadi, I want to note the enormous sacrifices being made by Iraqi forces and the Iraqi people in this fight every day. <p>In Syria, which has obviously been a topic of significant discussion during the course of this General Assembly, we have seen support from Turkey that has allowed us to intensify our air campaign there. ISIL has been pushed back from large sections of northeastern Syria, including the key city of Tal Abyad, putting new pressure on its stronghold of Raqqa. And ISIL has been cut off from almost the entire region bordering Turkey, which is a critical step toward stemming the flow of foreign terrorist fighters. <p>Following the special Security Council meeting I chaired last year, more than 20 additional countries have passed or strengthened laws to disrupt the flow of foreign terrorist fighters. We share more information, and we are strengthening border controls. We've prevented would-be fighters from reaching the battlefield and returning to threaten our countries. But this remains a very difficult challenge, and today we're going to focus on how we can do more together. In conjunction with this summit, the United States and our partners are also taking new steps to crack down on the illicit finance that ISIL uses to pay its fighters, fund its operations, and launch attacks. <p>Our military and intelligence efforts are not going to succeed alone; they have to be matched by political and economic progress to address the conditions that ISIL has exploited in order to take root. Prime Minister Abadi is taking important steps to build a more inclusive and accountable Government, while working to stabilize areas taken back from ISIL. And our nations need to help Prime Minister Abadi in these efforts. <p>In Syria, as I said yesterday, defeating ISIL requires, I believe, a new leader and an inclusive Government that unites the Syrian people in the fight against terrorist groups. This is going to be a complex process. And as I've said before, we are prepared to work with all countries, including Russia and Iran, to find a political mechanism in which it is possible to begin a transition process. <p>As ISIL's tentacles reach into other regions, United States is increasing our counterterrorism cooperation with partners like Tunisia. We're boosting our support to Nigeria and its neighbors as they push back against Boko Haram, which has pledged allegiance to ISIL. And we're creating a new clearinghouse to better coordinate the world's support for countries' counterterrorism programs so that our efforts are as effective as possible. <p>Ultimately, however, it is not going to be enough to defeat ISIL in the battlefield. We have to prevent it from radicalizing, recruiting, and inspiring others to violence in the first place. And this means defeating their ideology. Ideologies are not defeated with guns, they're defeated by better ideas, a more attractive and compelling vision. Building on our White House summit earlier this year and summits around the world since then, we're moving ahead, together, in several areas. <p>We're stepping up our efforts to discredit ISIL's propaganda, especially online. The UAE's new messaging hub&mdash;the Sawab Center&mdash;is exposing ISIL for what it is, which is a band of terrorists that kills innocent Muslim men, women, and children. We're working to lift up the voices of Muslim scholars, clerics, and others&mdash;including ISIL defectors&mdash;who courageously stand up to ISIL and its warped interpretations of Islam. <p>We recognize that we have to confront the economic grievances that exist in some of the areas that ISIL seeks to exploit. Poverty does not cause terrorism. But as we've seen across the Middle East and North Africa, when people, especially young people, are impoverished and hopeless and feel humiliated by injustice and corruption, that can fuel resentments that terrorists exploit, which is why sustainable development&mdash;creating opportunity and dignity, particularly for youth&mdash;is part of countering violent extremism. <p>We recognize we also have to address the political grievances that ISIL exploits. I've said this before: When human rights are denied and citizens have no opportunity to redress their grievances peacefully, it feeds terrorist propaganda that justifies violence. Likewise, when political opponents are treated like terrorists and thrown in jail, it can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. So the real path to lasting stability and progress is not less democracy, I believe it is more democracy, in terms of free speech and freedom of religion, rule of law, strong civil societies. All that has to play a part in countering violent extremism. <p>And finally, we recognize that our best partners in protecting vulnerable people from succumbing to violent extremist ideologies are the communities themselves: families, friends, neighbors, clerics, faith leaders who love and care for these young people. <p>Remember that violent extremism is not unique to any one faith, so no one should be profiled or targeted simply because of their faith. Yet we have to recognize that ISIL is targeting Muslim communities around the world, especially individuals who may be disillusioned or confused or wrestling with their identities. <p>And in all our countries, we have to continue to build true partnerships with Muslim communities, based on trust and cooperation, so that they can help protect their loved ones from becoming radicalized. And this cannot just be the work of government. It is up to all of us. We have to commit ourselves to build diverse, tolerant, inclusive societies that reject anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant bigotry that creates the divisions, the fear, and the resentments upon which extremists can prey. <p>I'm pleased that here at this summit, businesses&mdash;including high-tech companies&mdash;are investing funds, training and technological expertise to support innovative programs that push back on violent extremism. Cities around the world are joining together to build more resilient communities. Researchers are partnering to share best practices, knowing what works and what we can do better. <p>And as we saw yesterday, young people from around the world are participating in their own summit. And these young people, many of them Muslim, are coming together and using their talents and technology to push back on ISIL's propaganda, especially online, and to protect their brothers and sisters from recruitment. And these young people are an inspiration and give us hope, and I'd ask everyone to join me in thanking all the young people who are here today. <p>So, to conclude, we face a grave challenge. We have to be clear eyed about the fact that this is very hard work. We have individuals here like Prime Minister Abadi and President Buhari, who are on the front lines. And this is not going to be turned around overnight, because it is not just a military campaign that we are involved in. There are profound changes taking place in the Middle East and North Africa. They're problems that have built over decades that are expressing themselves and manifesting themselves in organizations like ISIL. Even if we were to wipe out the entire cadre of ISIL leadership, we would still have some of these forces at work. <p>But ultimately, I am optimistic. In Iraq and in Syria, ISIL is surrounded by communities, countries, and a broad international coalition committed to its destruction. We've seen that ISIL can be defeated on the battlefield, where there is sound organization and a government and military that is coordinating with this coalition and with our diplomatic efforts. And here at this summit, we're seeing a new global movement to counter the violent extremism that ISIL needs to survive. <p>Like terrorists and tyrants throughout history, ISIL will eventually lose because it has nothing to offer but suffering and death. And when you look at the reports of those who are laboring under their control, it is a stark and brutal life that does not appeal to people over the long term. So we will ultimately prevail because we are guided by a stronger, better vision: a commitment to the security, opportunity, and dignity of every human being. But it will require diligence, focus, and sustained effort by all of us. And I am grateful that all of you who are already participating are committed to this work. <p>With that, I want to give the floor to our Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon.\" "
"222" "\"Thank you so much. Everybody, have a seat. Well, welcome to the White House. I invited all of you here because if there's one thing I've learned, it's that you've got to be nice to state legislators. [<i>Laughter</i>] You never know when one of them might end up being President. And&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;so you want to treat them with respect. <p>It is great to see all of you. I hope that Jerry has been treating you and our team have been treating you reasonably well. The&mdash;I am partial to State legislatures, particularly, by the way, senators. I'm sorry, House members. But I'm just&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. I'm just saying, we tend to be a little more sensible, in the&mdash;at least at the State levels&mdash;I don't know about the federal. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But I see my friend Jim from Illinois back here&mdash;Jim Clayborne. And he and I served together, and he is still doing a great job. My first campaign for the State Senate was nearly 20 years ago. I had to print my own flyers at Kinko's. [<i>Laughter</i>] Hardly anybody could pronounce my name. We had to go door to door&mdash;Michelle and me and a handful of volunteers&mdash;just to get enough petitions to get on the ballot. And just about everybody who I talked to&mdash;when I&mdash;when they did bother talking to me, because there were a number of times where people didn't answer the door or figured I was selling something or preaching something. If they did answer the door and heard me speak for a while, they'd say, well, you seem like a nice young man, why would you want to go into something dirty and nasty like politics? [<i>Laughter</i>] And I'm sure some of you have heard that not just from strangers, but from your family members. <p>But what drove me to run for office, what I'm sure drove many of you, is the conviction that politics can in fact be a noble profession; that you can in fact help to shape and create more opportunity in communities and districts and States and in our Nation. And the more time I spent in my community, the more convinced I was that although change happens from the bottom up&mdash;and it is critical for communities to embrace nongovernmental organizations and community organizations and philanthropies and faith communities in trying to make sure that our schools are working and that our streets are safe and that people have jobs and opportunity&mdash;ultimately, we also need to have a government that is an effective partner, that is not there just to try to stay in power or score cheap political points or get on the nightly news, but elected representatives that are genuinely trying to move the ball forward and try to bring our country together rather than divide it. <p>And that ideal&mdash;the belief that people who love this country can change it&mdash;is why I ran for this office 8 years ago. The financial crisis hadn't happened yet, and it turned out that that would make our job a lot harder. But when you look back on these last 7 years, we've made enormous progress. <p>Now, let's face it. You're not going to hear that progress acknowledged from the folks on the other side who are running for this office at the moment, and I understand that. That's the nature of politics. But somehow, they've invented a reality that everything was terrific back in 2007, 2008, when the unemployment rate and the uninsured rate were skyrocketing, and when our economy was shedding hundreds of thousands of jobs every month, and we were mired in two wars and hopelessly addicted to foreign oil, and bin Laden was still plotting. Apparently, those were the good old days before I came in and messed things up. [<i>Laughter</i>]<p>But there is this pesky thing called facts. And here are the facts. When I took office, the unemployment rate was on its way to 10 percent. Today, it is at 5.1 percent. When I took office, we were losing up to 800,000 jobs a month. Today, our businesses have created jobs for a record 66 months in a row&mdash;more than 3 million [13 million; White House correction.]. There are more job openings right now in fact, than any time in our history.<p>When I took office, more than 15,000 Americans [15 percent of Americans;White House correction.] were uninsured. Today, only 9.2 percent are uninsured. And if we can get a few more states to expand Medicaid then even fewer will be uninsured. <p>So for the first time in&mdash;on record, more than 90 percent of Americans have health insurance. And for the first time, insurance companies can't discriminate against you because of a preexisting condition, which is helping all of us. And by the way, despite the predictions, we've done all this and cut the deficit by two-thirds since I took office. <p>When I took office, we were hopelessly addicted to foreign oil. Today, we've cut our oil imports by more than half. We've tripled the power that we generate from wind, generate 20 times more solar energy than we did when I came into office. And that has proven to be a steady source of good jobs that can't be outsourced. <p>Our reading scores are up. Our high school graduation rates are up. Our college attendance is up. There are almost no economic indicators that don't show we have made enormous progress during the course of these last 7 years, and we've done it in partnership with so many of you and so many State governments around the country. <p>I'm going to hold up my record up against anybody. Our policy prescriptions have been the right ones. We are on the right side of these debates that are taking place right now. And those things that are not yet done, aren't done because we've got folks on the other side that are intent on saying no, even when they know it's the right thing to do, even when it's&mdash;originally was their idea. <p>On issue after issue, the American people agree. The majority of Americans agree we should raise the minimum wage. A majority of Americans agree we should institute paid family leave and sick days for our workers. One recent poll, run by a Republican pollster, showed that a majority of Republican voters think that climate change is caused by human activity and that their elected officials should do something about it. The only thing that makes climate change political is that not one&mdash;not a single one&mdash;of the top 10 candidates for President on the other side agree with these Republican voters, unique among conservative parties worldwide. <p>The point is, Americans are not actually as divided as our politics or sometimes our media would suggest on particular issues. We sort ourselves out partly because we're watching different things and reading different things. But when you actually ask people their opinions on issues, there is a convergence there. There's a path for us to act in a unified way. But it requires elected officials to be serious about getting the job done, as opposed to winning the next election. And we are ready to build on that progress. We're ready to build on what works. And our policies are the ones that work. <p>So part of our task is to make sure that both sides of the aisle at every level of government get the message that people are looking for us to actually do what makes sense and what the evidence and facts show are going to help working families. And the good news is that it looks like the Republicans will just barely avoid shutting down the Government for the second time in 2 years. That's a somewhat low bar, but we should celebrate where we can. [<i>Laughter</i>] The bad news is that it looks like Republicans will just barely avoid shutting down the government again for the second time in 2 years. Instead of manufacturing new crises, Congress should be investing in the things that help our economy grow. <p>Now, given that, at least for the next year, year and a half, there's not going to be the kind of action on a wide range of issues that we'd like to see coming out of Capitol Hill, that puts more of a burden&mdash;but also a greater opportunity&mdash;on State legislatures all across the country. Because you can act when Washington won't. <p>The Republican-led Congress hasn't raised America's minimum wage, but 17 States did it on their own, and that boosted wages for 7 million workers. So you are to be congratulated for that. That's your work. Congress hasn't answered my call to provide our workers with paid sick days and paid family leave, but four States have now taken action on their own, including Oregon this year. So congratulations, Oregon. We're proud of you. Congress has not yet taken up my plan to bring down the cost of community college to zero for responsible students, but this year, two of your States took action to make sure that every hard-working young person can afford the new skills that they need to get a good job. <p>So over the last few years, States likes yours have gotten a lot done. And I hope you're going to head back home ready to get even more done, whether it's some of the issues I already mentioned or expanding pre-K or modernizing licensing laws to help workers and our veterans fill those jobs or putting into place the&mdash;some limits on the amount of carbon pollution that power plants can generate and dump into our air. We've got to keep moving forward. And we've got to keep measuring success not just by winning elections&mdash;although I do want us to do a little more work and pay a little more attention to State and legislative elections and gubernatorial elections and not just focused on national politics, because that's where a lot of decisions get made&mdash;but I want us most importantly, to be focusing on how we're helping people in their own lives every single day. <p>At its worst, politics can be a dirty business. It can be a tool for those with wealth and power to rig the system so that they can keep that wealth and power. It can be a place where elected officials shy away from tough issues because they're not interested in stirring up controversy that might cost them an election. But that makes it all the more important that we've got folks like you who believe in practicing politics at its best. <p>So when you talk to principled, passionate people who want to run for office for the right reasons, but wonder if it's really worth it, you can tell them that the President of the United States says absolutely. It is absolutely worth it. We haven't won every fight. We've got a lot more work to do. But all across America, there are people who have jobs today that didn't have them because of the work that we did. There are people who have health insurance today who didn't have it before because of the work that we did. There are students who are going to college for the first time because we've made that possible. There are veterans who served tour after tour who are now home with their families and are getting help that they have not only earned, but that will help make our country stronger. <p>So that's what change looks like. And that's why the right policies are important. And that's what public service is about. So I want to thank all of you for the outstanding work that you are doing to keep your communities, your States on the right track. When you get frustrated, don't lose heart, because we're counting on you and, more importantly, the families in your districts and in your States are counting on you. And I think their faith is well placed. Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
