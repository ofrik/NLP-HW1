"1" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Iowa! How are you guys? I miss you all. And I understand that it's actually warmer tonight than it was 4 years ago, which means, I'm sure, great turnout at the caucuses. <p>On the ride over here, I was reminiscing with David Plouffe. He was showing me, actually, an old advertisement from Iowa, in fact, the last advertisement we did in the Iowa campaign. And other than pointing out how much more gray I am and how much older I look now than I did then, we actually were just remembering the incredible energy and excitement and the spirit of common purpose that those Iowa caucuses represent. It was an example of how the campaign was not about one person, but it was about all of us coming together to try to deliver the kind of change that had been talked about a long time in Washington, but all too often hadn't been delivered on. <p>And it's because of you that I've had this extraordinary honor over the last 3 years of working to try to deliver on that change. And obviously, we didn't know at the time how severe the economic crisis was going to be. We didn't fully appreciate at the time the worldwide magnitude of the financial crisis. But we knew even then that the middle class had been taking it for a long time. Folks who had been trying to get into the middle class had found that the ladders that allowed for upward mobility had started to disintegrate for a lot of people. <p>And so we understood that what we were fighting for was an America where everybody had a fair shot, everybody did their fair share, that responsibility was rewarded and that the game wasn't fixed, that it wasn't rigged, and that if people did the right thing and worked hard, as so many families who in Iowa and throughout the country, that they were going to be able to live out their piece of the American Dream. <p>Now we've still got a lot of work to do. But think about the change that was accomplished because of those caucuses 4 years ago. Because of those caucuses 4 years ago, we ended the war in Iraq, as promised; our troops are now coming home. <p>Because of the work that so many of you did, even before the caucuses 4 years ago, health care is a reality for millions of Americans and seniors have seen the price of prescription drugs lowered and there are 2 million young Americans who are able to keep their insurance, even if they're not getting it through a job. And we're going to be able to say to every American out there who's got a preexisting condition or has gotten a raw deal from an insurance company that they're going to have some meaningful security. They're not going to be bankrupt if they get sick. <p>Because of you and the work that you did 4 years ago, there are millions of young people all across the country who are able to get more affordable student loans and Pell grants. They're able to afford college and apply themselves so that they can achieve a meaningful career that pays a good wage and provides good benefits. Because of you we've been able to end the policy of \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" so that every American who wants to serve this country that they love had that opportunity, regardless of who they love. <p>So across the board, whether it's doubling fuel efficiency standards on cars or making sure that we've got a more effective system to provide job training for people who've lost their jobs, across the board, you have made a difference. But we all know we've got a lot more work that we have to do. <p>Although we've passed health care reform, we've passed Wall Street reform, there are a lot of forces that want to push back against it and want to undo some of those changes. And we're battling millions of dollars of negative advertising and lobbyists and special interests who don't want to see the change that you worked so hard&mdash;to fully take root. And that's why this time out is going to be in some ways more important than the first time out. Mitch is right: Change is never easy. The problems that we've been dealing with over the last 3 years, they didn't happen overnight, and we're not going to fix them overnight. But we've been making steady progress, as long as we can sustain it. And that's what this is going to be all about. <p>So the only way we're going to be able to do that is if all of you maintain the same determination, the same energy, the same drive, the same hopefulness, the same optimism about this wonderful country of ours, as was on display 4 years ago. And I want you to know that because of you, because of all the memories I have of being in your living rooms or meeting you in a diner or seeing you over at a campaign office, I have never lost that same source of inspiration that drove me to embark on this journey in the first place. You guys inspire me every single day. <p>And I want us to remind each other that, as much work as there may be out there before us, there's nothing we can't accomplish when determined citizens come together to make a difference. So thank you, everybody. I could not be prouder. And, Mitch, I think we've got a couple of&mdash;time for a couple questions. <p><i>Obama for America, Battleground States Director Mitchell Stewart.</i> Yes, we do, sir. And the first question comes out of Coralville. Coralville, can you hear us? <p><i>2012 Presidential Campaign </i><p><i>Q.</i> Good evening, Mr. President. I'm Roseann, and I'm here, as you can see, at a full house in the beautiful Performing Arts Center in Coralville, Iowa. How are you tonight? <p><i>The President.</i> I'm doing well. How are you? <p><i>Q.</i> Well, Mr. President, I think we're having a little difficulty with audio, but I'm going to go ahead with my question. <p>Thinking about the caucuses 4 years ago, and as you reflected, you delivered your message of hope and change, but we didn't know in 2008 the extent of the problems we were facing, and certainly progress has been a challenge. So I'm wondering now, in 2012, if you still believe in hope and change for America. And I'm also wondering how your reelection campaign is going to help us better understand what we need to do, both as individual citizens and as a country, to achieve the fair society that you spoke about recently in Osawatomie, Kansas. <p><i>The President.</i> Well, first of all, I want to make sure you can hear my answer. How's the sound coming through now? <p>[<i>At this point, the audience in Coralville applauded, indicating that they could hear the President. There was no audio.</i>] <p>Well, in some ways, I'm actually more optimistic now than I was when I first ran, because we've already seen change take place. And part of what 2012 is about is both reminding the American people of how far we've traveled and the concrete effects that some of our work has had in terms of making sure that people have health insurance or making sure that our troops are coming home or making sure that young people are able to go to college. But part of it is also framing this larger debate about what kind of country are we going to leave for our children and our grandchildren. <p>There is no problem that we face that we cannot solve. But in order to solve it, we've got to make sure that everybody gets a fair shot, and that means that we're investing in things like education, that we're investing in basic science and technology, so we're making things again here in America and we're revitalizing manufacturing and we're not just buying from other countries, but we're selling to other countries, and we're inventing things and encouraging entrepreneurship. It means that we're rebuilding our infrastructure, our roads and our bridges, but also our high-speed rail lines and high-speed Internet access in places like rural Iowa, making sure that everybody who wants to reach a worldwide market is able to do so because they've got the connection to do it. <p>It also means that those things are going to have to be paid for in a fair way. And obviously, a lot of the debate in Washington over the last several months and over the last year has revolved around how do we create a government that is lean and efficient and effective. And I'm proud of some of the tough decisions that we've been willing to make in terms of pruning back programs that don't work. But if we're going to make the investments that we need for our kids at the same time as we're controlling our deficit, then there's nothing wrong with saying to millionaires and billionaires that we're going to let your tax cuts expire. You can afford it. You've done very well in this society. And I know that&mdash;[<i>inaudible</i>]&mdash;in America, but they have to be asked. And the other party has a fundamentally different philosophy. <p>The same is true when it comes to the issue of fair play. We, through Wall Street reform, have rolled back policies that allowed credit card companies to jack up your interest rates without alerting you to it or other financial practices that disadvantage consumers. <p>And so we've said, you know what, we're going to have a consumer watchdog in place to look after you, to make sure that you're not being cheated on credit cards or mortgages. Because if you want to compete in a free market, then you should compete on the basis of price and service and quality, not on the basis of somebody not being able to understand what they're buying. <p>These basic principles are what's going to be at stake in order for us to succeed. And I think that they're principles that most Americans believe in, that everybody should act responsibly, everybody should do their part, and everybody should be able to travel as far as their work ethic and their dreams will carry them. <p>And right now all we're getting from the other side&mdash;you guys have been hearing it a lot more than I have&mdash;I know it's&mdash;you've been bombarded, I don't know how you watch TV in Iowa these days&mdash;with a different theory that says, we're going to cut taxes for the wealthiest among us and roll back regulations on things like clean air and health care reform and Wall Street reform, and that somehow, automatically, that assures that everybody is able to succeed. I don't believe that. And I don't think any of the people in that auditorium do either. <p>So it's going to be a big battle, though. I hope you guys are geared up. I'm excited. <p><i>Mr. Stewart.</i> Great. Thank you very much, Coralville. Next, we have Cedar Rapids. Cedar Rapids, are you with us? Can you hear us, Cedar Rapids? Hello, Cedar Rapids. Can you hear us? <p><i>The President.</i> Hold on one second. <p><i>Mr. Stewart.</i> Yes, hold on one second. <p><i>The President.</i> I can't hear you yet. <p><i>Mr. Stewart.</i> We'll give it 5 more seconds. Folks in Cedar Rapids, can you hear us? <p><i>Q.</i> Yes, we can. Yes. <p><i>Health Care Reform/2012 Presidential Campaign </i><p><i>Q.</i> Good evening, Mr. President. This is Carol from Cedar Rapids, and I'm honored to be among your volunteers. On the cable talk shows, there is talk about your administration not accomplishing anything. However, I am a breast cancer survivor and was a social worker for 33 years before retiring and know firsthand what a great accomplishment the Affordable Care Act is, among your other achievements. How do you respond to people who say, you have not done enough? <p><i>The President.</i> I think the main message that we're going to have in 2012 is that we've done a lot, but we've got a lot more to do, and that's why we need another 4 years to get it all done. But you just mentioned the Affordable Care Act. We know that somebody who's had an illness like cancer, who's a survivor, has trouble getting insurance. Because of the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies are not going to be able to ban people with preexisting conditions. That makes a direct impact on your life and your family's life. <p>We know that there are 2 million young people who have insurance, because of the Affordable Care Act, who didn't have it before. We know that seniors have seen discounts in their prescription drugs. They're saving billions of dollars all across the country. We know that preventive care, like mammograms, are now available through your insurance, and they can't arbitrarily deny you coverage right when you need care. <p>So that's just on health care. And it's making an impact on people's lives day to day. But here's the thing. Frankly, not that many people watch cable TV. What they do is they listen to their friends, their neighbors, their coworkers. And that's why what you guys are doing today at the caucus and what you will be doing every day from now until November makes such a difference. Because nobody is a better messenger for the kind of change we're talking about than you. You can tell a story about the difference these policies make in your life in a way that any politician in Washington, including me, can't do. <p>And one of the things that we learned 4 years ago was that when people at grassroots level are getting involved and they're getting engaged and they're feeling empowered and they're joining hands with each other, that's a powerful force. It can't be stopped. But unfortunately, over the&mdash;[<i>inaudible</i>]&mdash;it's not as focused and concentrated as an election campaign. And so the forces of big money and special interests and lobbyists, they all come to the fore and the pundits and the cable TV dominates the political conversation. <p>Well, you know what, fortunately in 2012 we've got a chance to respond. And I will put my money on you. I find you a lot more persuasive than anybody on cable TV, and that's why I know we're going to win. <p>Thank you. <p><i>Mr. Stewart.</i> Great. Thank you very much, sir. We appreciate your time. We appreciate Cedar Rapids. We're going to let you get back to the remainder of your caucuses.\" "
"2" "\"<i>The President.</i> Well, I just want to thank the Easons and Ms. Kirkpatrick for welcoming us. As some of you may be aware, just in terms of background, the Easons, who have been married for 42 years now&mdash;Mr. Eason is a former marine, and so served our country in the Korean war&mdash;were living in their home, were taken advantage by a mortgage broker, and as a consequence, ended up being $80,000 in debt. The repairs that had originally been promised to be made for a few thousands dollars were never completed, and they almost lost their home. <p>And thanks to Ms. Kirkpatrick's organization and some timely intervention, they were able to stay in their home and prevent foreclosure. But it's a good example of the kinds of trickery and abuse in the nonbank financial sector that we're going to have to do something about. And we're so glad that we've got somebody like Rich Cordray who's willing to take this on and make sure that families like the Easons, who've done the right thing, who've been responsible, who've served their country, that they're not taken advantage of and they're able to live in security and dignity in their golden years. <p>So thank you so much for letting us be in your home, Mr. Eason and Mrs. Eason. Thank you. <p><i>William Eason.</i> It's an honor you being here. <p><i>The President.</i> Well, we appreciate your service all the way around. <p>Now, he's not mentioning he also used to be a boxer, so if you guys break anything in here you could be in trouble. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Thanks, guys.\" "
"3" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Ohio! Ah, it is good to be back in Ohio. It is good to be back in Shaker Heights, home of the Red Raiders. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Mr. President, I love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. And I'm glad to be back. I'm glad to be here. <p>I want to thank your mayor, Earl Leiken, for hosting us today; your superintendent, Mark Freeman; the principal here, Mike Griffith. Well, and I know&mdash;I'm pretty sure we've got a couple of Congresspeople here, but I don't see them. Where are they? The&mdash;okay, we got Marcia Fudge. Marcy Kaptur is here. Dennis Kucinich, Betty Sutton in the house. Outstanding Members of Congress, doing the right thing every day, so we thank them all for being here. <p>Now, I understand the folks here at this school have a pretty good basketball team&mdash;boys and girls. Unfortunately, I have no eligibility left. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I can't play with you. <p>I want to wish everybody a happy New Year; 2012 is going to be a good year. It's going to be a good year. And one of my New Year's resolutions is to make sure that I get out of Washington and spend time with folks like you. Because folks here in Ohio and all across the country, I want you to know you're the reason why I ran for this office in the first place. You remind me what we are still fighting for. You inspire me. <p><i>Audience member. </i>[<i>Inaudible</i>] [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Okay. You do? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>No, you remind me that this country is all about folks who work hard and where responsibility pays off, an America where anybody who puts in the effort and plays by the rules can get ahead. <p>That's the America you deserve. That's the America we're working to build. That's why I told Congress before the new year they couldn't leave for vacation until we made sure 160 million working Americans wouldn't get hit with a tax hike on January 1. <p>Now, this wasn't easy. It should have been easy, but it wasn't. But in the end, we got members of both parties to come together and make sure that you could keep more money in your paychecks each month. And you're keeping that extra $40 in every paycheck because we made sure that we didn't stunt the recovery. We made sure that families got the break that they need. And that means more security for your families. It also means a boost for our economy at a time when we've got to do everything we can to keep it growing. Because more money spent by more Americans means more businesses hiring more workers. <p>And so when I&mdash;when Congress returns, I'm going to urge them to extend this tax cut all the way through 2012, with no drama, no delay. Do the right thing. It is a no-brainer. Let's get it done. Let's pass these tax cuts. <p>Now, we still have more to do. So today we're taking another important step, one that will bring us closer to the economy that we need, an economy where everybody plays by the same rules. <p>And to help us do that, I'm joined by somebody you might recognize, Richard Cordray. Son of Ohio; a good, good man. Today I'm appointing Richard as America's consumer watchdog. And that means he is going to be in charge of one thing: looking out for the best interests of American consumers. Looking out for you. <p>His job will be to protect families like yours from the abuses of the financial industry. His job will be to make sure that you've got all the information you need to make important financial decisions. Right away, he'll start working to make sure millions of Americans are treated fairly by mortgage brokers and payday lenders and debt collectors. In fact, just this week, his agency is opening up a simple 1-800 number that you can call to make sure you're getting a fair deal on your mortgage and hold banks and brokers accountable if you're not. <p>Now, I nominated Richard for this job last summer, so you may be wondering why am I appointing him today. It would be a good question. [<i>Laughter</i>] For almost half a year, Republicans in the Senate have blocked Richard's confirmation. <p>They refused to even give Richard an up-or-down vote. Now, this is not because Richard is not qualified. There's no question that Richard is the right person for the job. He's got the support of Democrats and Republicans around the country. A majority of attorney generals&mdash;Richard's a former attorney general&mdash;a majority of attorney generals from both parties across the country have called for Richard to be confirmed. Your local Members of Congress who are here today, they support him. He has the support of a majority in the Senate. Everyone agrees Richard is more than qualified. <p>So what's the problem, you might ask. The only reason Republicans in the Senate have blocked Richard is because they don't agree with the law that set up a consumer watchdog in the first place. They want to weaken the law. They want to water it down. And by the way, a lot of folks in the financial industry have poured millions of dollars to try to water it down. <p>That makes no sense. Does anybody think that the reason that we got in such a financial mess&mdash;the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, the worst economic crisis in a generation&mdash;that the reason was because of too much oversight of the financial industry? <p><i>Audience members.</i> No! <p><i>The President.</i> Of course not. We shouldn't be weakening oversight. We shouldn't be weakening accountability. We should be strengthening it, especially when it comes to looking out for families like yours. <p>The financial firms have armies of lobbyists in Washington looking out for their interests. You need somebody looking out for your interests and fighting for you, and that's Richard Cordray. <p>Now, I have to say, Richard's a really nice guy. [<i>Laughter</i>] You know, you look at him and you think, this guy is not somebody who's going around picking fights. And yet this fight on behalf of consumers is something that Richard has been waging here in Ohio for the better part of two decades, so&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>As your attorney general, he helped recover billions of dollars in things like pension funds on behalf of retirees. He protected consumers from dishonest lending practices. Before that, Richard was the State treasurer, where he earned a reputation for working with folks from across the spectrum&mdash;Democrats, Republicans, bankers, consumer advocates&mdash;had a great reputation across the board&mdash;doing the right thing. <p>And, Cleveland, you've seen the difference that Richard can make for consumers, and I have too. And that's why I want Richard to keep standing up for you, not just here in Ohio, but for consumers all across the country. <p>Now, every day that Richard waited to be confirmed&mdash;and we were pretty patient. I mean, we kept on saying to Mitch McConnell and the other folks, let's go ahead and confirm him. Why isn't he being called up? Let's go. Every day that we waited was another day when millions of Americans were left unprotected. Because without a director in place, the consumer watchdog agency that we've set up doesn't have all the tools it needs to protect consumers against dishonest mortgage brokers or payday lenders and debt collectors who are taking advantage of consumers. And that's inexcusable. It's wrong. And I refuse to take no for an answer. <p>So I've said before that I want to look for every possible opportunity to work with Congress to move this country forward and create jobs. I'm going to look for every opportunity to try to bridge the partisan divide and get things done, because that's what the American people need right now. And that means putting construction workers back on the jobs repairing our roads and our bridges. That means keeping our teachers in the classrooms. That means keeping our cops and firefighters doing what they do, protecting us every day. That means helping small businesses get ahead. That means serving our veterans as well as they've served us, like this young man right in the front. We are grateful for him, for his service. <p>These are ideas that have support from Democrats; they have support from Republicans around the country, Independents around the country. I want to work with Congress to get them done. <p>But when Congress refuses to act, and as a result, hurts our economy and puts our people at risk, then I have an obligation as President to do what I can without them. I've got an obligation to act on behalf of the American people. And I'm not going to stand by while a minority in the Senate puts party ideology ahead of the people that we were elected to serve. Not with so much at stake, not at this make-or-break moment for middle class Americans. We're not going to let that happen. <p>For way too long, we've had a financial system that was stacked against ordinary Americans. Banks on Wall Street played by different rules than businesses on Main Street. They played by different rules than a lot of community banks who were doing the right thing across the country: hidden fees, fine print that led consumers to make financial decisions that they didn't always understand. <p>Richard and I, before we came here, had an opportunity to visit with a wonderful elderly couple, the Easons. And Mr. Eason is a former marine, served in the Korean war. Mrs. Eason makes a really good sweet potato pie. She gave me one. I'm going to eat it later, after. [<i>Laughter</i>] I didn't want to eat it before because I didn't want to get sleepy having a big piece of pie right before. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But their story was the story of a lot of folks in this region, where a mortgage broker came to them, said that they could do some home repair for a few thousand dollars, and they ended up getting scammed; the loans got flipped. They ended up owing $80,000, almost losing their home, and the repairs were never made. <p>Those kinds of practices, that's not who we are. We cannot allow people to be taken advantage of. And it's not just because it's bad for those individuals. All that risky behavior led&mdash;helped to contribute to the economic crisis that we're all still digging ourselves out of. All those subprime loans, all those foreclosures, all the problems in the housing market, that's all contributing to an economy that's not moving as fast as we want it. <p>And that's why, last year, we put in place new rules, new rules of the road to make sure that a few bad apples in the financial sector can't break the law, they can't cheat consumers, they can't put our entire economy in danger. And many of these provisions are already starting to make a difference. For the first time in history, we put in place a consumer watchdog, someone whose only job is to look out for the interests of everyday Americans. <p>And we are so fortunate to have somebody like Richard who's willing to do it, despite great sacrifice to his family. He's the right man for the job. <p>So if you're a student&mdash;I see some young people out here&mdash;his job will be to protect you from dishonest lending practices and to make sure that you've got the information you need on student loans. He's already started up an initiative called Know Before You Owe. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's a good slogan: Know Before You Owe. You don't want to owe and then know. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>If you're a veteran, he'll help make sure that you aren't taken advantage of when you're coming home from serving your country. And it turns out that military families are some of the folks who are most vulnerable to some of these financial abuses. <p>If you're a senior, Richard's going to help make sure you don't lose your home or your retirement because somebody saw you as an easier target. And that's what happened to the Easons. Endia, who I think is here&mdash;Mrs. Eason, are you here? You're somewhere here. There's&mdash;Mrs. Eason's down there. Ninety-one years old. And as I mentioned, Mrs. Eason's husband William is a former marine, also a former boxer. So don't mess with him. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And I just want to repeat, 10 years ago they were approached by a broker who offered them a loan to make needed repairs on their home; made everything sound easy. Easons agreed. Broker ended up disappearing. They get left with $80,000 in debt, almost lose their home. They didn't lose it because of the intervention of some terrific non-for-profits that Richard, when he was treasurer here in Ohio, helped to support. Now&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>]. <p><i>The President.</i> East Side&mdash;that's right. <p>Now, the Easons are good people. They're what America is all about. They worked hard. They served their country. They saved their money. They didn't live high on the hog. It's a modest house. They earned the right to retire with dignity and with respect, and they shouldn't have to worry about being tricked by somebody who's out to make a quick buck. And they need somebody who is going to stand up for them, and millions of Americans need somebody who is going to look out for their interests. And that person is Richard Cordray. <p>And we know what would happen if Republicans in Congress were allowed to keep holding Richard's nomination hostage. More of our loved ones would be tricked into making bad financial decisions. More dishonest lenders could take advantage of some of the most vulnerable families. And the vast majority of financial firms who do the right thing would be undercut by those who don't. <p>See, most people in the financial services industry do the right thing, but they're at a disadvantage if nobody is enforcing the rules. We can't let that happen. Now is not the time to play politics while people's livelihoods are at stake. Now's the time to do everything we can to protect consumers, prevent financial crises like the one that we've been through from ever happening again. That starts with letting Richard do his job. <p>So I know&mdash;let me just close by saying this. I know that you're hearing a lot of promises from a lot of politicians lately. Today you're only going to hear one from me. As long as I have the privilege of serving as your President, I promise to do everything I can every day, every minute, every second, to make sure this is a country where hard work and responsibility mean something and everybody can get ahead. Not just those at the very top, not just those who know how to work the system, but everybody. <p>That's what America's always been about. That's what America is going to be about today and tomorrow and 10 years from now and 20 years from now. And with the help of people like Richard Cordray, that's the country that we will always be. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"4" "\"Good morning, everybody. The United States of America is the greatest force for freedom and security that the world has ever known. And in no small measure, that's because we've built the best trained, best led, best equipped military in history, and as Commander in Chief, I'm going to keep it that way. <p>Indeed, all of us on this stage&mdash;every single one of us&mdash;have a profound responsibility to every soldier, sailor, airman, marine, and coast guardsman who puts their life on the line for America. We owe them a strategy with well-defined goals, to only send them into harm's way when it's absolutely necessary, to give them the equipment and the support that they need to get the job done, and to care for them and their families when they come home. That is our solemn obligation. <p>And over the past 3 years, that's what we've done. We've continued to make historic investments in our military&mdash;our troops and their capabilities, our military families, and our veterans. And thanks to their extraordinary service, we've ended our war in Iraq. We've decimated Al Qaida's leadership. We've delivered justice to Usama bin Laden, and we've put that terrorist network on the path to defeat. We've made important progress in Afghanistan, and we've begun to transition so Afghans can assume more responsibility for their own security. We joined allies and partners to protect the Libyan people as they ended the regime of Muammar Qadhafi. <p>Now we're turning the page on a decade of war. Three years ago, we had some 180,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, we've cut that number in half. And as the transition in Afghanistan continues, more of our troops will continue to come home. More broadly, around the globe we've strengthened alliances, forged new partnerships, and served as a force for universal rights and human dignity. <p>In short, we've succeeded in defending our Nation, taking the fight to our enemies, reducing the number of Americans in harm's way, and we've restored America's global leadership. That makes us safer, and it makes us stronger. And that's an achievement that every American, especially those Americans who are proud to wear the uniform of the United States Armed Forces, should take great pride in. <p>This success has brought our Nation once more to a moment of transition. Even as our troops continue fight&mdash;to fight in Afghanistan, the tide of war is receding. Even as our forces prevail in today's missions, we have the opportunity and the responsibility to look ahead to the force that we are going to need in the future. <p>At the same time, we have to renew our economic strength here at home, which is the foundation of our strength around the world. And that includes putting our fiscal house in order. To that end, the Budget Control Act passed by Congress last year, with the support of Republicans and Democrats alike, mandates reductions in Federal spending, including defense spending. I've insisted that we do that responsibly. The security of our Nation and the lives of our men and women in uniform depend on it. <p>And that's why I called for this comprehensive defense review to clarify our strategic interests in a fast-changing world and to guide our defense priorities and spending over the coming decade, because the size and the structure of our military and defense budgets have to be driven by a strategy, not the other way around. Moreover, we have to remember the lessons of history. We can't afford to repeat the mistakes that have been made in the past, after World War II, after Vietnam, when our military was left ill prepared for the future. As Commander in Chief, I will not let that happen again. Not on my watch. <p>We need a start&mdash;we need a smart, strategic set of priorities. The new guidance that the Defense Department is releasing today does just that. I want to thank Secretary Panetta and General Dempsey for their extraordinary leadership during this process. I want to thank the service secretaries and chiefs, the combatant commanders, and so many defense leaders&mdash;military and civilian, active, Guard, and Reserve&mdash;for their contributions. Many of us met repeatedly, asking tough questions, challenging our own assumptions, and making hard choices. And we've come together today around an approach that will keep our Nation safe and our military the finest that the world has ever known. <p>This review also benefits from the contributions of leaders from across my national security team, from the Departments of State, Homeland Security, and Veterans Affairs, as well as the intelligence community. And this is critical, because meeting the challenges of our time cannot be the work of our military alone or the United States alone. It requires all elements of our national power, working together in concert with our allies and our partners. <p>So I'm going to let Leon and Marty go into the details. But I just want to say that this effort reflects the guidance that I personally gave throughout this process. Yes, the tide of war is receding. But the question that this strategy answers is what kind of military will we need long after the wars of the last decade are over. And today, we're fortunate to be moving forward from a position of strength. <p>As I made clear in Australia, we will be strengthening our presence in the Asia-Pacific, and budget reductions will not come at the expense of that critical region. We're going to continue investing in our critical partnerships and alliances, including NATO, which has demonstrated time and again&mdash;most recently in Libya&mdash;that it's a force multiplier. We will stay vigilant, especially in the Middle East. <p>As we look beyond the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the end of long-term nation-building with large military footprints, we'll be able to ensure our security with smaller conventional ground forces. We'll continue to get rid of outdated cold war-era systems so that we can invest in the capabilities that we need for the future, including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, counterterrorism, countering weapons of mass destruction, and the ability to operate in environments where adversaries try to deny us access. <p>So yes, our military will be leaner, but the world must know the United States is going to maintain our military superiority with Armed Forces that are agile, flexible, and ready for the full range of contingencies and threats. <p>We're also going to keep faith with those who serve by making sure our troops have the equipment and capabilities they need to succeed and by prioritizing efforts that focus on wounded warriors, mental health, and the well-being of our military families. And as our newest veterans rejoin civilian life, we'll keep working to give our veterans the care, the benefit&mdash;the benefits, and job opportunities that they deserve and that they have earned. <p>Finally, although today is about our defense strategy, I want to close with a word about the defense budget that will flow from this strategy. The details will be announced in the coming weeks. Some will no doubt say that the spending reductions are too big; others will say that they're too small. It will be easy to take issue with a particular change in a particular program. But I'd encourage all of us to remember what President Eisenhower once said, that \\"each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration: the need to maintain balance in and among national programs.\\" After a decade of war, and as we rebuild the source of our strength at home and abroad, it's time to restore that balance. <p>I think it's important for all Americans to remember, over the past 10 years, since 9/11, our defense budget grew at an extraordinary pace. Over the next 10 years, the growth in the defense budget will slow, but the fact of the matter is this: It will still grow, because we have global responsibilities that demand our leadership. In fact, the defense budget will still be larger than it was toward the end of the Bush administration. And I firmly believe, and I think the American people understand, that we can keep our military strong and our Nation secure with a defense budget that continues to be larger than roughly the next 10 countries combined. <p>So again, I want to thank Secretary Panetta, Chairman Dempsey, all the defense leaders who are on this stage, and some who are absent, for their leadership and their partnership throughout this process. Our men and women in uniform give their very best to America every single day, and in return they deserve the very best from America. And I thank all of you for the commitment to the goal that we all share: keeping America strong and secure in the 21st century and keeping our Armed Forces the very best in the world. <p>And with that, I will turn this discussion over to Leon and to Marty, who can explain more and take your questions. <p>So thank you very much. I understand this is the first time a President's done this. It's a pretty nice room. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Thank you guys.\" "
"5" "\"Thank you. Well, it is wonderful to see all of you. I thought I would just drop by to help your new Director move in. [<i>Laughter</i>] He's been a little busy. So I thought maybe some boxes, a little plant. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I also just wanted to say hello to all of you who have just been doing extraordinary work in standing up what I think is going to be one of the most important agencies for people that there is. And I know that all of you have devoted enormous amounts of time and energy, and many of you are here making significant sacrifices with your families to make sure that this agency gets up and running really well. And so I just wanted to say thank you to all of you. <p>Let me begin by saying a few words about the latest economic news. This morning we learned that American businesses added another 212,000 jobs last month. Altogether, more private sector jobs were created in 2011 than any year since 2005. And there are a lot of people that are still&mdash;{<i>applause</i>]&mdash;there are a lot of people that are still hurting out there. After losing more than 8 million jobs in the recession, obviously, we have a lot more work to do. But it is important for the American people to recognize that we've now added 3.2 million new private sector jobs over the last 22 months, nearly 2 million new jobs last year alone. So after shedding jobs for more than a decade, our manufacturing sector is also adding jobs 2 years in a row now. So we're making progress. We're moving in the right direction. <p>And one of the reasons for this is the tax cut for working Americans that we put in place last year. And when Congress returns, they should extend the middle class tax cut for all of this year to make sure that we keep this recovery going. It's the right thing to do. There should not be delay. There should not be a lot of drama. We should get it done. <p>And the American people, I think, rightly understand that there are still a lot of struggles that people are going through out there. A lot of families are still having a tough time. A lot of small businesses are still having a tough time. But we're starting to rebound. We're moving in the right direction. We have made real progress. Now is not the time to stop. So I would urge Congress to make sure that they stay on top of their jobs, to make sure that everybody else is able to enjoy, hopefully, an even more robust recovery in 2012. <p>So the economy is moving in the right direction. We're creating jobs on a consistent basis. We're not going to let up, not until everybody who wants to find a good job can find one. But we have a responsibility to do even more than just try to recover from this devastating recession and financial crisis. We have a responsibility to make sure that the economy that we're rebuilding is one where middle class families feel like they can get ahead again. A lot of the problems that we're dealing with are problems that existed even before the recession, even before the financial crisis. For a decade or more, middle class families felt like they were treading water, that they were losing ground. <p>And what we want to do is make sure not just that we're getting back to the status quo, we want to make sure that we're dealing with those underlining problems. Getting to a point where middle class families feel like they can get ahead again, where hard work pays off again, where everybody gets a fair shot and everybody does their fair share and everybody is playing by the same set of rules. <p>And that's where all of you come in. Every one of you here has a critical role to play in making sure that everybody plays by the same rules. To make sure that the big banks on Wall Street play by the same rules as community banks on Main Street. To make sure that the rules of the road are enforced and that a few bad actors in the financial sector can't break the law, can't cheat working families, can't threaten our entire economy all over again. <p>That's your mission: to make sure that the American people have somebody in their corner, that American consumers have somebody who's got their back. And you finally got a great Director who is tailormade to lead this agency in Richard Cordray. <p>You've also got an extraordinary team that is lined up behind me here, who did a great job in getting this agency up and running and are going to continue to show extraordinary leadership in all the various issues that you're going to be addressing. And I also want to give a special shout-out to the woman who dreamt up this agency and spent so much time turning it into a reality, our friend Elizabeth Warren. <p>Just to be a little more specific, millions of working Americans use financial products like credit cards and student loans and mortgages. And that's a good thing. These products have a tremendous potential to make people's lives better&mdash;to buy products, to earn an education, to afford a home, to raise a family. And we all use them. But when they're sold in an irresponsible fashion they can also make life brutally hard on people. They can turn the dreams of a family into a nightmare. Things like hidden fees and traps on credit cards and student loans cost working American billions of dollars. Things like subprime loans and skyrocketing interest that you can't escape can not only bring families to their knees, but the entire economy to its knees. <p>And Richard just mentioned the example of this elderly couple that we met when we were in Ohio yesterday. These are folks&mdash;the gentleman was a marine who served in Korea. They had been married for 42 years. He had worked all his life; they had poured their savings into this home. <p>Because of a code violation&mdash;obviously, they're on a fixed income, they don't have a lot of money&mdash;they thought, well, maybe we can get a loan to make some modest repairs. And what initially was promised as an $8,000 line of credit to make these repairs, ended up being an $80,000 debt with no repairs that threatened them going into foreclosure. <p>And those kinds of stories are replicated all across the country. And it not only hurts those individuals, it hurts the entire economy. That shouldn't happen, not in America. And that's why we're here. We're here to put an end to stories like these. <p>And already, your work is making a difference. The \\"Know Before You Owe\\" campaign you've been working on for months is doing three big things. It's making home loan applications more transparent, so that families will know what they owe on their mortgages. It's making it easier for students to compare financial aid packages and know what they owe each month when they graduate. I could have used that. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's making&mdash;in fact, I've got a law school classmate here who, she probably went through the same thing I did. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's making credit card agreements shorter and simpler, so that credit card holders will know what they owe and what they're getting into. And I know that folks all across America have been sending in their stories to help shape these new initiatives. <p>This is not something where it's just a Washington top-down process. You are gathering the experiences of individual families, seeing how they got hurt, how they might have gotten cheated. And that's helping to define how you enforce these rules. And that's vitally important. <p>And now that Richard is your Director, you can finally exercise the full power that this agency has been given to protect consumers under the law. Now that he's here, irresponsible debt collectors and payday lenders and independent mortgage servicers and loan providers, they're all bound by the same rules as everybody else. No longer are consumers left alone to face the risk of unfair or deceptive or abusive practices&mdash;not anymore. <p>So we can make sure that folks don't lose their homes or their life savings just because somebody saw them as an easy target. We can make sure that students don't start out in life saddled with debt that they can never pay back just because of a lousy deal. We can safeguard families and seniors and veterans from toxic financial products. We can help give everybody the clear and transparent information that they need to make informed financial decisions and have companies compete for their business in an open and honest way. <p>That's Richard's commitment. That's my commitment. That's the commitment of everybody standing on this stage. And that's your commitment. That's why this agency is so important. <p>So I want to thank all of you for choosing to serve your country in these challenging times. Your mission is extraordinarily important. It's vital to the strength of our economy. It's really important to the security of working families. And I know that it might be personal for some of you. You may know a friend or a family member whose life was turned upside down because of some of these unsavory practices that this agency is designed to root out, and maybe you were then determined to prevent that from happening to somebody else. Now you can. And we're not going to let those folks down all across the country. <p>When I meet Americans all across the country or I read letters that I get every night, they really don't ask for much. They're not looking for a handout; they're not looking for special treatment. They just want a fair shake; they just want a fair deal. And we have a chance to give it to them. <p>So let's do everything that we can to make sure that middle class families can regain some of the security that they've lost over the last decade. Let's help to protect what they've worked so hard for and give them the chance to hand it down to their kids. I know you guys are ready to go to work. I am too. I couldn't be prouder of you. <p>So congratulations.\" "
"6" "\"Happy New Year, everybody. <p>This week, I traveled to Cleveland, Ohio, to talk with folks about the biggest challenge we face as a country: rebuilding our economy so that, once again, hard work pays off, responsibility is rewarded, and anyone, regardless of who they are or where they come from, can make it if they try. That's the economy America deserves. That's the economy I'm fighting every day to build. <p>Now, to get there, the most important thing we need to do is to get more Americans back to work. And over the past 3 years, we've made steady progress. We just learned that our economy added 212,000 private sector jobs in December. After losing more than 8 million jobs in the recession, we've added more than 3 million private sector jobs over the past 22 months. And we're starting 2012 with manufacturing on the rise and the American auto industry on the mend. <p>We're heading in the right direction. And we're not going to let up. On Wednesday, the White House will host a forum called \\"Insourcing American Jobs.\\" We'll hear from business leaders who are bringing jobs back home and see how we can help other businesses follow their lead. <p>Because this is a make-or-break moment for the middle class and all those working to get there. We've got to keep at it. We've got to keep creating jobs. And we've got to keep rebuilding our economy so that everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same rules. We can't go back to the days when the financial system was stacking the deck against ordinary Americans. To me, that's not an option, not after all we've been through. <p>That's why I appointed Richard Cordray as our Nation's new consumer watchdog this week. Richard's job is simple: to look out for you. Every day, his sole mission is to protect consumers from potential abuses by the financial industry and to make sure that you've got all the transparent information you need to make the important financial decisions in your lives. <p>I nominated Richard for this job last summer. And yet, Republicans in the Senate kept blocking his confirmation, not because they objected to him, but because they wanted to weaken his agency. That made no sense. Every day we waited was a day you and consumers all across the country were at greater financial risk. <p>So this year, I'm going to keep doing whatever it takes to move this economy forward and to make sure that middle class families regain the security they've lost over the past decade. That's my New Year's resolution to all of you. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"7" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! Everybody please have a seat, have a seat. Welcome to the White House and congratulations to the world champion Dallas Mavericks. Obviously, we got some Texas people here. <p>This was the Mavericks' first title, so I want to start by recognizing everybody who stuck with the team through good times and through bad, from Don Carter, the original owner, to the arena staff, to all the fans back home. <p>We've got some Members of Congress who've waited a long time for this&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;as well as my Trade Representative, Ron Kirk, who happens to be a former mayor of Dallas. <p>Of course, none of this would be possible if it hadn't been for the shy and retiring owner&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. So not only did Mark help put together an outstanding group of players and coaches, he was also responsible for making this event happen today. And so we are thrilled to have you guys here. <p>It turns out that because of the lockout, Dallas wasn't scheduled to play in Washington this season. That did not sit well with Mark. [<i>Laughter</i>] He knew this team had worked hard. He wanted them to get all the perks of a world championship, including a visit to the White House. It is tough to say no to Mark Cuban. And so they made a separate trip and here we are. <p>And I'm glad it worked out, because this is a special group. Last season, they called themselves the \\"Bad News Bears\\" because from the very beginning nobody gave them much of a chance. People said that Jason Kidd was too old. And I will say that this is the first time I've been with some world champions who are my contemporaries. [<i>Laughter</i>] They said J.J. Barea was too small, that Dirk Nowitzki was too slow. They did say that, Dirk, I'm sorry. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's what they said. They said you had a great jump shot, but&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. They said DeShawn Stevenson was too crazy. [<i>Laughter</i>] They said \\"The JET\\" was terrific but they weren't sure whether that tattoo was such a good idea. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But these players got it done because they know how good teams win, not just by jumping higher or running faster, but by finding the open man, working together, staying mentally tough, being supportive of each other, playing smarter. <p>And that's how the Mavericks took down some of the league's best teams, including the Miami Heat, who got a little bit of attention last year. This was especially sweet for Dirk and Jason who were around the first time that the Mavericks and the Heat met in the finals and lost 5 years ago. <p>In fact, the Mavericks played&mdash;before the Mavericks played a single game last season, when Jason got his tattoo, he said, \\"When you do something as crazy as I did, you've got to back it up.\\" And he did, by the way, score 27 points to help win the deciding game six. <p>Dirk joined the Mavericks 13 years ago as a skinny kid from Germany with what he describes as a goofy haircut. [<i>Laughter</i>] Last year he became the second European player ever to be named Finals MVP. And it wasn't easy. He bent a finger so badly in game two that he had to shoot left-handed. In game four, he played through a hundred and one degree fever. But every time, he came through when it counted. And I think it's fair to say that we have very rarely seen a better playoff run than Dirk Nowitzki had last year. It was remarkable. <p>So clearly Dirk is a tough guy. Although the most painful thing may have been his rendition of \\"We Are the Champions\\"&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;during the victory celebration. That was&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]--did you&mdash;you said you worked on that? [<i>Laughter</i>] Seriously? Okay. <p>Now, none of these players would have gotten so far without the rest of the folks on this stage. Obviously, Jason Kidd now has the second most assists and third most steals in NBA history. It wouldn't have worked without an outstanding coach. And Coach Rick Carlisle has now won a player as&mdash;or won a title as a player, with Larry Bird in the eighties, has a title as a coach, and then he just informed me that he had also won&mdash;what was it? The Pantoons? What were they called? <p><i>Rick Carlisle.</i> The Patroons, the Albany Patroons. <p><i>The President.</i> The Albany Patroons. Many of you did not know that Rick Carlisle had also won one of those. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Mr. Carlisle.</i> It's minor league. <p><i>The President.</i> It's a minor league team. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So these players and coaches will always share a bond that comes with being the best. And it's a bond they share with the Dallas community, where they do everything from setting up scholarships to helping military families get back on their feet. Today, in fact, they met with some wounded warriors here at the White House. I want to really thank them for taking the time to do that. That means so much to people. <p>So this team really does have a heart that's the size of Texas. This was a remarkable run, a great victory, a great vindication for all the effort Mark Cuban put into building this team, and for long-time players like Dirk Nowitzki and long-suffering fans like all of you. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And so I just want to give a heartfelt congratulations to all of you. I told them that it's too bad that next year it will be the Chicago Bulls here&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but they said I shouldn't be so confident. So congratulations, everybody. Give it up for the Dallas Mavericks. <p>Dirk, you got something for me? <p><i>Dirk Nowitzki.</i> Yes. <p>[<i>At this point, the President was presented with a team jersey.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> That's it. That's what I'm talking about. <p><i>Mr. Nowitzki.</i> That's it. I heard you're a big, big fan of Michael Jordan. <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you so&mdash;well, you know, I was actually&mdash;I was 23 before Jordan. <p><i>Mr. Nowitzki.</i> Oh, you were? <p><i>The President.</i> I was. [<i>Laughter</i>] So he got the number from me, I think. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Mr. Nowitzki. </i>He stole it. <p><i>The President. </i>He stole it. <p><i>Mr. Nowitzki.</i> Yes. I got you. <p><i>The President.</i> That's what happened. That's beautiful.\" "
"8" "\"Thank you, EPA! Thank you, everybody. Thank you so much. It is wonderful to see you. It is great to see you. Thank you, thank you. <p>Now, everybody can have a seat. I know Lisa is making you guys all stand up. [<i>Laughter</i>] But you can all relax. <p>It is wonderful to be here with all of you. Thank you so much for all the great work you do. I want to first acknowledge your outstanding Administrator, Lisa Jackson. She has done an extraordinary job leading this agency. But here's what I want all of you to know: Not only is she good on policy, not only is she tough and able to present the EPA's mission so effectively to the public, but she also has your back. She is an advocate on behalf of all the people who work so hard here at the EPA. And so you should know that your boss loves you, even if she doesn't always show it, I don't know. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>The main reason I'm here is simple: I just want to say thank you. I want to say thank you to each and every one of you, because the EPA touches on the lives of every single American every single day. You help make sure that the air we breathe, the water we drink, the foods we eat are safe. You protect the environment not just for our children, but their children. And you keep us moving towards energy independence. <p>And it is a vital mission. Over the past 3 years, because of your hard work, we've made historic progress on all these fronts. Just a few weeks ago, thanks to the hard work of so many of you, Lisa and I were able to announce new commonsense standards to better protect the air we breathe from mercury and other harmful air pollution. And that was a big deal. And part of the reason it was a big deal was because, for over 20 years, special interest groups had successfully delayed implementing these standards when it came to our Nation's power plants. And what we said was: Enough; it's time to get this done. <p>And because we acted, we're going to prevent thousands of premature deaths, thousands of heart attacks and cases of childhood asthma. There are families that are going to be directly impacted in a positive way because of the work that you do. Because you kept fighting&mdash;and some of you have been fighting this fight for a long time, long before I was here, and long before Lisa was here. And so your tenacity and stick-to-itness is making a difference. <p>Because of you, across the board, we're cutting down on acid rain and air pollution. We're making our drinking water cleaner and safer. We're creating healthier communities. But that's not all. Safeguarding our environment is also about strengthening our economy. I do not buy the notion that we have to make a choice between having clean air and clean water and growing this economy in a robust way. I think that is a false debate. <p>Think about it. We established new fuel economy standards, a historic accomplishment that is going to slash oil consumption by about 12 billion barrels, dramatically reduces pollution that contributes to climate change, and saves consumers thousands of dollars at the pump, which they can then go spend on something else. <p>As part of the Recovery Act, you cleaned up contaminated sites across the country, which helped to rid neighborhoods of environmental blight while putting Americans back to work. <p>We don't have to choose between dirty air and dirty water or a growing economy. We can make sure that we are doing right by our environment and, in fact, putting people back to work all across America. That's part of our mission. <p>When we put in place new commonsense rules to reduce air pollution, we create new jobs building and installing all sorts of pollution-control technology. When we put in place new emissions standards for our vehicles, we make sure that the cars of tomorrow are going to be built right here in the United States of America, that we're going to win that race. When we clean up our Nation's waterways, we generate more tourists for our local communities. So what's good for the environment can also be good for our economy. <p>Now, that doesn't mean that there aren't going to be some tensions. That doesn't mean that there aren't going to be legitimate debates that take place. That doesn't mean that it's not important for every single one of us to think about how can we make sure that we are achieving our goals in the smartest way possible, in the most efficient ways possible, in the least bureaucratic ways possible, in the clearest ways possible. That's also part of our mission. <p>There's not a Federal agency that can't get better and be smarter in accomplishing our mission, and we have an obligation every single day to think about how can we do our business a little bit better. How can we make sure the taxpayers are getting every dime's worth that they're paying in order to achieve these important common goals that we have? <p>But I believe we can do it, and you've shown me that we can do it over these last 3 years. So I could not be prouder of the work that you all do every single day as Federal employees. I know the hours can be long. I know that sometimes spending time getting these policies right means less time at home than you'd like, and you're missing birthday parties, or you're missing a soccer game, and the spouse is not happy with you. I know a little bit about that sometimes. [<i>Laughter</i>] I know these jobs are demanding. <p>But I also know what compelled you to enter public service in the first place, and that's the idea that you could make a difference, that you could leave behind a planet that is a little cleaner, a little safer than the one we inherited. <p>And I have to tell you that part of why I get excited when I see some of the work that you're doing is because our next generation is so much more attuned to these issues than I was when I was growing up. I can tell you when I sit down and I talk to my kids, probably the area where they have the most sophisticated understanding of policy is when it comes to the environment. They understand that the decisions we make now are going to have an impact on their lives for many years to come. And their instincts are right. So your mission is vital. <p>And just think of what this agency has been able to do over the last four decades. There's so many things we now take for granted. When I hear folks grumbling about environmental policy, you almost want to do a \\"Back to the Future\\"&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;kind of reminder of folks of what happens when we didn't have a strong EPA. The year before President Nixon created the EPA, the Cuyahoga River was so dirty from industrial pollution and oil slicks that it literally caught on fire. In my hometown, the Chicago River could&mdash;you probably could not find anything alive in there&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;four decades ago. Now it's thriving, to the benefit of the city. Today, because of your work, 92 percent of Americans have access to clean water that meets our national health standards. <p>Before the EPA was created, our cars were spewing harmful lead pollution into the air, with all sorts of impacts, especially on children. Today, because of your work, air pollution is down by more than half and lead pollution is down more than 90 percent from a generation ago. <p>So all of you, and all of those who served before you, have made a difference. Our environment is safer because of you. Our country is stronger because of you. Our future is brighter because of you. And I want you to know that you've got a President who is grateful for your work and will stand with you every inch of the way as you carry out your mission to make sure that we've got a cleaner world. <p>So thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you.\" "
"9" "\"Thank you, everybody. Please, please have a seat. Thank you. Well, welcome to the White House, everybody. And, Tim, thank you for that introduction. <p>I could not have enjoyed more the meeting that I had this morning, because what these companies represent is a source of optimism and enormous potential for the future of America. What they have in common is that they're part of a hopeful trend: They are bringing jobs back to America. <p>You've heard of outsourcing. Well, these companies are insourcing. These companies are choosing to invest in the one country with the most productive workers, the best universities, and the most creative and innovative entrepreneurs in the world, and that is the United States of America. [<i>Applause</i>] That's worth applauding. <p>That's exactly the kind of commitment to country that we need, especially right now, when we're in a make-or-break moment for the middle class and those aspiring to get in the middle class here in the United States. <p>All across this country, I meet folks who grew up with a faith that in America hard work paid off and responsibility was rewarded and anybody could make it if they tried, no matter where you came from, no matter what you looked like, no matter how you started out. Those are the values that my grandparents and my mother taught me. Those are the values that built the best products and the strongest economy and the largest middle class that the world has ever known. <p>I think we understand that over the last few decades, that bargain has eroded for too many Americans. The economy has changed rapidly. And for many, that change has been painful. Factories where people thought they would retire packed up and went overseas, where labor costs were cheaper. <p>At the same time, we live in a global economy, and as other countries grow and develop middle classes of their own, of course global companies are going to pursue those markets and employ workers and make investments all over the world. <p>But right now we're at a unique moment, a inflection point, a period where we've got the opportunity for those jobs to come back. And the business leaders in this room, they're ahead of the curve, they recognize it. I'll give you just a few examples. After shedding jobs for more than a decade, American manufacturers have now added jobs for 2 years in a row. That's good news. But when a lot of folks are still looking for work, now is the time for us to step on the gas. <p>So that's why I pushed Congress to extend the payroll tax cut this year, so that 160 million working Americans weren't hit with a tax hike. Now is the time to extend that middle class tax hike for&mdash;tax cut for all of this year. It's the right thing to do, and we need to get that done. <p>But we're going to have to do more. And that's why, in the next few weeks, we're also going to put forward new tax proposals that reward companies that choose to bring jobs home and invest in America. And we're going to eliminate tax breaks for companies that are moving jobs overseas. <p>Because there is an opportunity to be had right here and right now. There are workers ready to work right now. That's why I set a goal of doubling our exports of goods and services by 2014, and it's a goal, by the way, that we're on track to meet; in fact, we're a little ahead of schedule in meeting that goal. <p>That's why, with the help of our outstanding USTR, I was able to sign trade agreements with Korea and Colombia and Panama so our businesses can sell more goods to those markets. That's why I've fought for investments in schools and community colleges, so that our workers remain the best you'll find anywhere, and investments in our transportation and communication networks, so that your businesses have more opportunities to take root and grow. <p>I don't want America to be a nation that's primarily known for financial speculation and racking up debt buying stuff from other nations. I want us to be known for making and selling products all over the world stamped with three proud words: Made in America. And we can make that happen. <p>I don't want the next generation of manufacturing jobs taking root in countries like China or Germany. I want them taking root in places like Michigan and Ohio and Virginia and North Carolina. And that's a race that America can win. That's the race businesses like these will help us win. <p>These are CEOs who take pride in hiring people here in America, not just because it's increasingly the right thing to do for their bottom line, but also because it's the right thing to do for their workers and for our communities and for our country. And they're leading by example. I'm proud of that, as an American. But as President, I also want to make sure they get some credit for it. <p>Just 3 years ago, for example, we almost lost the American auto industry. Today, the Big Three automakers are turning a profit and manufacturing the next generation of fuel efficient cars that the rest of the world wants to buy. Ford Motor Company&mdash;that's represented by workers and management on this stage&mdash;has committed to investing $16 billion in the United States by 2015&mdash;$16 billion. And that includes bringing back about 2,000 jobs and shifting production from countries like Japan, Mexico, and China to States like Michigan and Ohio and Missouri. <p>Master Lock, iconic company. When Master Lock looked at their numbers, they saw that union workers in America could do the same job at competitive costs as nonunion workers in China. In fact, Master Lock is now exporting their products from the United States to China and Europe. And today, for the first time in 15 years&mdash;[<i>applause</i>}&mdash;today for the first time in 15 years Master Lock's Milwaukee complex is running at full capacity. <p>But you don't have be a big manufacturer to insource jobs. Bruce Cochrane's family had manufactured furniture in North Carolina for five generations. But in 1966&mdash;1996, rather, as jobs began shifting to Asia, the family sold their business and Bruce spent time in China and Vietnam as a consultant for American furniture makers who had shifted their production. While he was there, though, he noticed something he didn't expect: Their customers actually wanted to buy things made in America. So he came home and started a new company, Lincolnton Furniture, which operates out of the old family factories that had been shut down. He's even rehired many of the former workers from his family business. <p>You also don't have to be a manufacturer to insource jobs. You just heard Tim, CEO of a health care IT company in New Jersey called GalaxE.Solutions. They've already hired 150 workers with their \\"Outsource to Detroit\\" program, and they plan on hiring up to 500. And Tim was quoted as saying, \\"There are some really talented people in Detroit, and we're putting them back to work.\\" <p>Whether you're a small business that are&mdash;some of which are represented here&mdash;or a large manufacturing corporation or a technology company, whether you're a historic brand or a brand-new startup, insourcing jobs is a smart strategy right now. We live in a global economy with opportunities for global investment. But we heard from several experts this morning and business leaders that we're at this point in time where factors like incredibly rising American productivity and increasingly competitive costs mean the economic case to invest in America and bring jobs back home is strong, and it's getting stronger. <p>Labor costs are going up in places like China. We have become much more productive. We continue to be the largest market in the world. And so we have this outstanding opportunity if everybody is partnering and getting together. That's the economic case. <p>I believe there's also a moral case. Andy Grove, the former CEO of Intel, said it well. He said: \\"Those of us in business have two obligations. One that's undebatable is that we have a fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders who put us in our place.\\" But he also said, \\"There's another obligation that I feel personally, given that everything I've achieved in my career and a lot of what Intel has achieved in its career were made possible by a climate of democracy, an economic climate and investment climate provided by our domicile&mdash;the United States.\\" <p>All these folks onstage, they are businesspeople first, and they're looking at the bottom line. But they also feel good about the fact that they're restoring hope and creating jobs here in the United States. And that's part of the responsibility that comes with being a leader in America, a responsibility not just to the shareholders or the stakeholders, but to the country that made all this incredible wealth and opportunity possible. That's a responsibility that we all have to live up to, whether we're in the private sector or the public sector, whether we're in Washington or we're on Wall Street. Because the more Americans who succeed, the more America succeeds. <p>So my message to business leaders today is simple: Ask yourselves what you can do to bring jobs back to the country that made our success possible. And I'm going to do everything in my power to help you do it. We're going to have to seize this moment. American workers are the most productive and competitive in the world right now. When you factor in all the costs, we have a outstanding market, we have the most innovative entrepreneurs, the best research universities. And part of what our session this morning was all about was just helping people to take a look at what this moment is and where we're going to be 5 years from now. Because when people take a second look, it turns out that the potential for job growth and American manufacturing and the service industry is incredible. <p>I said in a speech a while back, this moment is perfectly suited for our advantages. It's perfectly suited for who we are. The global marketplace is becoming more innovative, more creative, more transparent, faster, more adaptable. That's who we are. That's our strength. We've got to take advantage of it. <p>And if we've got leadership of the sort that we're seeing on this stage, I'm absolutely confident that not only can it make a difference for our middle class and folks who are working their way into the middle class, it also gives us an incredible opportunity to assure the future for our children and our grandchildren. And that's my central goal and focus as President. That should be our central goal as a country&mdash;how we rebuild an economy where hard work pays off, responsibility is rewarded&mdash;a nation where those values continue for generations to come. <p>So thanks to all the people on this stage for being such a great example. For all the press who are here, I hope you get a chance to hear their stories, because it's exciting, and it gives you a sense of why I'm incredibly optimistic about our prospects. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"10" "\"Good morning, everybody. Please have a seat. <p>Welcome to the White House. I see all sorts of small-business people here, and I am thrilled to have you here. As small business owners, you know as well as anybody that if we're going to rebuild an economy that lasts&mdash;an economy that creates good, middle class jobs&mdash;then we're all going to have to up our game. <p>The other day, I met with business leaders who are doing their part by insourcing, by bringing jobs back to the United States. And I told them that if you are willing to keep asking yourselves what you can do to bring jobs back, then I'll make sure that you've got a Government that helps you succeed. <p>And that's why we're here today. I ran for office pledging to make our Government leaner and smarter and more consumer friendly. And from the moment I got here, I saw up close what many of you know to be true: The Government we have is not the Government that we need. <p>We live in a 21st century economy, but we've still got a Government organized for the 20th century. Our economy has fundamentally changed, as has the world, but our Government, our agencies, have not. The needs of our citizens have fundamentally changed, but their Government has not. Instead, it's often grown more complicated and sometimes more confusing. <p>Give you a few examples. There are five different entities dealing with housing. There are more than a dozen agencies dealing with food safety. My favorite example, which I mentioned in last year's State of the Union address&mdash;as it turns out, the Interior Department is in charge of salmon in freshwater, but the Commerce Department handles them in saltwater. [<i>Laughter</i>] If you're wondering what the genesis of this was, apparently, it had something to do with President Nixon being unhappy with his Interior Secretary for criticizing him about the Vietnam War, and so he decided not to put NOAA in what would have been a more sensible place. <p>No business or nonprofit leader would allow this kind of duplication or unnecessary complexity in their operations. You wouldn't do it when you're thinking about your businesses. So why is it okay for our Government? It's not. It has to change. <p>Now, what we've tried to do over the first three years of my administration is to do a whole range of steps administratively to start making processes, procedures, agencies more consumer friendly. But we need to do more, and we need authority to do more. <p>So today I'm calling on Congress to reinstate the authority that past Presidents have had to streamline and reform the Executive Branch. This is the same sort of authority that every business owner has to make sure that his or her company keeps pace with the times. And let me be clear: I will only use this authority for reforms that result in more efficiency, better service, and a leaner Government. <p>Now, a little bit of history here. Congress first granted this authority to Presidents in the midst of the Great Depression, so that they could swiftly reorganize the Executive Branch to respond to the changing needs of the American people and the immediate challenges of the Depression. For the next 52 years, Presidents were able to streamline or consolidate the Executive Branch by submitting a proposal to Congress that was guaranteed a simple up or down vote. <p>In 1984, while Ronald Reagan was President, Congress stopped granting that authority. And when this process was left to follow the usual congressional pace and procedures, not surprisingly, it bogged down. So congressional committees fought to protect their turf and lobbyists fought to keep things the way they were because they were the only ones who could navigate the confusion. And because it's always easier to add than to subtract in Washington, inertia prevented any real reform from happening. Layers kept getting added on and added on and added on. The Department of Homeland Security was created to consolidate intelligence and security agencies, but Congress didn't consolidate on its side. So now the Department of Homeland Security reports to over 100 different congressional panels. That's a lot of paperwork. That's a lot of reports to prepare. That's not adding value. It's not making us safer to file a whole bunch of reports all the time. <p>It has been a generation since a President had the authority to propose streamlining the Government in a way that allowed for real change to take place. Imagine all the things that have happened since 1984. Nineteen-eighty-four didn't have&mdash;we didn't have the Internet, just to take one example. A generation of Americans has come of age. Landlines have turned to smartphones. The cold war has given way to globalization. So much has happened, and yet the Government we have today is largely the Government we had back then. And we deserve better. <p>Go talk to the skilled professionals in Government who are serving their country&mdash;and by the way, you won't meet harder working folks than some of the folks in these Federal agencies&mdash;devote countless hours to trying to make sure that they're serving the American people. But they will tell you their efforts are constantly undermined by an outdated bureaucratic maze. And of course, if you go talk to ordinary Americans, including some of the small-business leaders here today, they'll tell you that to deal with Government on a regular basis is not always the highlight of their day. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Over the past three years, as I said, we've tried to take some steps to fix the problem, to bring our Government into this century and, in doing so, to root out waste. So just to take some examples: We made sure that Government sends checks to the right people in the right amount, which should be obvious, but we've been able to prevent $20 billion in waste over the last two years, just by making sure that checks are sent properly and we're reducing error. <p>We cut Government contracting for the first time in more than a decade. We cut a whole range of overlapping programs. We have tried to yank the Federal Government into the 21st century when it comes to technology and making everything we do a little more Web friendly. And by the way, that also helps in terms of accountability and transparency, because the public can get on whitehouse.gov or the various other Web sites and they can see what's happening and track where money goes. <p>So we've done a lot, but we've got to do more. We need to think bigger. So today I'm outlining changes we could make if Congress gives the green light to allow us to modernize and streamline. These changes would help small-business owners like you. It would also help medium and large businesses. And as a consequence, they would help create more jobs, sell more products overseas, grow our economy faster, improve our quality of life. <p>Right now there are six departments and agencies focused primarily on business and trade in the Federal Government, six: Commerce Department, Small Business Administration, the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. In this case, six is not better than one. Sometimes more is better; this is not one of those cases, because it produces redundancy and inefficiency. With the authority that I'm requesting today, we could consolidate them all into one department, with one Web site, one phone number, one mission: helping American businesses succeed. That's a big idea. <p>Now, we've put a lot of thought into this. Over the past year, we spoke with folks across the Government and across the country. And most importantly, we spoke with businesses, including hundreds of small businesses, to hear what works and what doesn't when you deal with the Government; what's frustrating, what's actually value added. And frankly, in those conversations, we found some unsatisfied customers. A lot of times what we heard was, \\"You know what, the individual who I'm working with was really helpful to me, but the process itself is too confusing.\\" Most of the complaints weren't about an unresponsive Federal worker, they were about a system that was too much of a maze. <p>So take a look at this slide. I don't usually use props in my speeches&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but I thought this was useful. This is the system that small-business owners face. This is what they have to deal with if they want even the most basic answers to the most basic questions like how to export to a new country or whether they qualify for a loan. And by the way, this is actually simplified because there are some color codes. [<i>Laughter</i>] The business owners don't get the blue and the purple&mdash;and it's all just&mdash;there's a whole host of Web sites, all kinds of toll-free numbers, all sorts of customer service centers, but each are offering different assistance. It's a mess. This should be easy for small-business owners. They want to concentrate on making products, creating services, selling to customers. We're supposed to make it easier for them. And we can. There are some tools that we can put in place that every day are helping small-business owners all across the country, but we're wasting too much time getting that help out. And if Congress would reinstate the authority that previous Presidents have had, we would be able to fix this. <p>We'd have one department where entrepreneurs can go from the day they come up with an idea and need a patent to the day they start building a product and need financing for a warehouse to the day they're ready to export and need help breaking into new markets overseas. One Web site, easy to use, clear. One department where all our trade agencies would work together to ensure businesses and workers can better export by better enforcing our trade agreements. One department dedicated to helping our businesses sell their products to the 95 percent of global consumers who live beyond our shores. So with this authority, we could help businesses grow, save businesses time, save taxpayer dollars. <p>And this is just one example of what we could do. The contrast between this and this sums up what we could do on the business side, but these kinds of inefficiencies exist across Government. And there's a real opportunity right now for us to fundamentally rethink, reform, and remake our government so that it can meet the demands of our time, so that it's worthy of the American people, and so that it works. <p>This should not be a partisan issue. Congress needs to reinstate this authority that has in the past been given to Democratic and Republican presidents for decades. In the meantime, as long as folks are looking for work and small businesses are looking for customers, I'm going to keep doing everything I can with my current authority to help. <p>So, to take one example, as of today, I am elevating the Small Business Administration to a Cabinet-level agency. Karen Mills, who's here today and who's been doing an outstanding job leading that agency, is going to make sure that small-business owners have their own seat at the table in our Cabinet meetings. <p>In the coming weeks, we're also going to unveil a new Web site: Business USA. And this site will be a one-stop shop for small businesses and exporters, and it will consolidate information that right now is spread across all these various sites so that it's all in one place, and it's easy to search. <p>So with or without Congress, I'm going to keep at it. But it would be a lot easier if Congress helped. [<i>Laughter</i>] This is an area that should receive bipartisan support, because making our Government more responsive and strategic and leaner, it shouldn't be a partisan issue. <p>We can do this better. We can provide taxpayers better value. So much of the argument out there all the time is up in 40,000 feet, these abstract arguments about who's conservative or who's liberal. Most Americans, and certainly most small-business owners, you guys are just trying to figure out, how do we make things work? How do we apply common sense? And that's what this is about. <p>So I'm going to keep fighting every day to rebuild this economy so that hard work pays off, responsibility is rewarded, and we've got a government that is helping to create the foundation for the incredible energy and entrepreneurship that all of you represent. And I'm going to keep fighting to make sure that middle class families regain the security that they've lost over the last decade. I've said before, this&mdash;I believe this is a make-or-break moment for families who are trying to get in the middle class, folks who are trying to maintain their security, folks who are trying to start businesses. There's enormous potential out there. The trend lines in our global economy are moving in our direction, towards innovation and openness and transparency. <p>But we've got to take advantage of it. And you need a strong ally in an effective, lean Government. That's what this authority can do. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.\" "
"11" "\"Hi there. As you can see, I brought a few things with me for this week's video: a padlock, a pair of boots, a candle, and a pair of socks. <p>We are not having a yard sale, and these products may not appear to have much in common. But they're united by three proud words: Made in America. They're manufactured by American workers, in American factories, and shipped to customers here and around the world. <p>The companies that make these products are part of a hopeful trend: They're bringing jobs back from overseas. You've heard of outsourcing; well, this is insourcing. And in this make-or-break moment for the middle class and those working to get into the middle class, that's exactly the kind of commitment to country that we need. <p>This week, I invited executives from businesses that are insourcing jobs to a forum here at the White House. These are CEOs who take pride in hiring people here in America, not just because it's increasingly the right thing to do for their bottom line, but also because it's the right thing to do for their workers and for our communities and for our country. <p>I told those CEOs what I'll tell any business leader: Ask yourself what you can do to bring more jobs back to the country that made your success possible. And I'll make sure that you've got a Government that does everything in its power to help you succeed. <p>That's why, in the next few weeks, I'll put forward new tax proposals that reward companies that choose to do the right thing by bringing jobs home and investing in America, and we'll eliminate tax breaks for companies that move jobs overseas. <p>It's also why, on Friday, I called on Congress to help me make Government work better for you. Right now we have a 21st-century economy, but we've still got a Government organized for the 20th century. Over the years, the needs of Americans have changed, but our Government has not. In fact, it's gotten even more complex, and that has to change. <p>That's why I asked Congress to reinstate the authority that past Presidents have had to streamline and reform the executive branch. This is the same sort of authority that every business owner has to make sure that his or her company keeps pace with the times. It's the same authority that Presidents had for over 50 years, until Ronald Reagan. And let me be clear: I will only use this authority for reforms that result in more efficiency, better service, and a leaner Government. <p>These changes will make it easier for small-business owners to get the loans and support they need to sell their products around the world. For example, instead of forcing small-business owners to navigate the six departments and agencies in the Federal Government that focus on business and trade, we'll have one department, one place where entrepreneurs can go from the day they come up with an idea and need a patent, to the day they start building a warehouse, to the day they're ready to ship their products overseas. <p>And in the meantime, we're creating a new Web site, BusinessUSA, that will serve as a one-stop shop with information for businesses small and large that want to start selling their stuff around the world. <p>This means that more small-business owners will see their hard work pay off. More companies will be able to hire new workers. And we'll be able to rebuild an economy that's not known for paper profits or financial speculation, but for making and selling products like these, products made in America. <p>Thank you, and have a great weekend.\" "
"12" "\"<i>The President.</i> Well, good morning, everybody! <p><i>Audience members.</i> Good morning! <p><i>The President.</i> Oh, this looks like an outstanding group. I can already tell. I'm not going to make a long speech because we're here to do some work. But mainly what I want to do is just to say thank you to all of you for participating. I know there are a lot of organizations that are represented here today. We are so glad to be at this outstanding school where we're going to be doing a whole bunch of stuff to make it&mdash;make the facilities even better than they already are. <p>But this is the third year now that Michelle and Malia and usually Sasha is here&mdash;she couldn't make it today&mdash;that we provide or engage in some sort of service on Dr. King's birthday. And there's no better way to celebrate Dr. King than to do something on behalf of others. <p>I know there's been a lot of controversy lately about the quote on the memorial, and they're changing it and making some modifications, but if you look at that speech talking about Dr. King as a drum major, what he really said was that all of us can be a drum major for service, all of us can be a drum major for justice. There's nobody who can't serve, nobody who can't help somebody else. And whether you're 7 or 6 or whether you're 76, then you can find opportunities to make an enormous difference in your community. And at a time when the country has been going through some difficult economic times, for us to be able to come together as a community, people from all different walks of life, and make sure that we're giving back, that's ultimately what makes us the strongest, most extraordinary country on Earth, is because we pull together when times are good, but also when times are hard. And you guys all represent that. <p>So on behalf of our family, we want to say thank you. I'm sure Dr. King, were he here, he'd want to say thank you. And I look forward to spending some time next to you guys. Hopefully, I have some good instructors here so that I don't mess anything up. So if you're putting a paintbrush in my hands, make sure that I've got some very clear lines, and I'll try to stay within them. <p>All right? Thank you, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.\" "
"13" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. It is wonderful to be here. It is wonderful to be joined by my wife. It is her birthday today. When we first married, it was a little controversial that she was 20 years younger than me, but&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;now it seems to have worked out okay. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The First Lady.</i> I'm 48. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> And I want to join her in congratulating the world champion St. Louis Cardinals. I won't lie, I'm a little disappointed I had to leave my White Sox jacket in the closet for another year. [<i>Laughter</i>] But this is a special team, both because of what they do for our military and their families, but also what they did on the field last season. And I know we've got Mayor Slay from St. Louis and some Members of Congress who agree with me. I see the delegation here; they're beaming. [<i>Laughter</i>] They are quite pleased. <p>Now, when we talk about baseball, we're talking about a sport, obviously, with a long history. Over 200,000 games have been played since Major League Baseball began. Seventeen thousand players have gone through the league. So this is a sport that has seen it all. <p>But every once in a while, something happens that we have never seen before, something unique. And that's why it is my pleasure to stand here with the greatest comeback team in the history of baseball. <p>Last August, with just 31 games to play in the regular season, the Cardinals were 10&frac12; games out of the playoff race. At one point, they had a less than 4 percent mathematical chance of making the playoffs. In Las Vegas, they were 500-to-1 longshots to win the World Series. And when Chris Carpenter pulled the team together for a meeting, his message was simple: Let's not embarrass ourselves. [<i>Laughter</i>] But through skills and guts and, I think the team would agree, just a little bit of luck&mdash;just a touch&mdash;this team made the playoffs. And even though they trailed in each of the series that followed, they somehow had the spirit and the determination and the resolve to survive. <p>Of course, the most memorable moment was game six of the World Series. I've got to say, that has to be one of the best baseball games of all time&mdash;unbelievable game. I will tell you guys, I had a bunch of early morning stuff the next day, and you kept me up. [<i>Laughter</i>] It was painful waking up the next morning, but what an incredible game. Five times, the Cardinals found themselves trailing; twice, they were down to the last strike. Then Mr. Freese here hits the first walk-off homer of his entire career to send it into game seven. Then the Cardinals put the Rangers away for good. <p>This team essentially played 2 months of elimination games, both to get into the playoffs, and then to win it all. But in Tony La Russa's words, \\"Sometimes you can't be afraid to make a mistake. Sometimes you just roll the dice and you let it go.\\" That's what the former teammate of these folks, Albert Pujols, did when he joined Babe Ruth and Reggie Jackson as the only player to hit three home runs in a World Series game. That's what the outstanding ace, Chris Carpenter, did when he pitched the lights out against the Phillies and then came back to put the nail in the coffin against the Rangers. That's what David Freese did in game six&mdash;not bad for a kid who grew up dreaming of playing for the Cardinals. And even though he can't be here today, that's what Tony La Russa did, winning his third title and then stepping down with the third most wins of any manager in history. <p>I will point out that he began as a White Sox, so&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Let it go, honey. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Everyone on this team follows the Cardinals way: They play all 27 outs, they never quit, they carry on the legacy of so many great Cardinals that have come before them. <p>Last year, I was honored to present Stan \\"The Man\\" Musial with one of the highest honors a President can bestow, the Medal of Freedom. And you could see Stan coming from about a mile away, because he was wearing that bright red blazer. There's no question he will always be a Cardinal at heart. And now this team is part of that long line of heroes. <p>So I want to congratulate not only the players, the owners, all the managers, and team officials, but also the fans, for a historic year. And I also want to thank them for visiting Walter Reed this morning, spending some time with our wounded warriors over there. That's what this organization's all about; it represents baseball at its best. And I wish them all the best this season. <p>Congratulations. Fantastic. Come on up. <p><i>St. Louis Cardinals President William O. DeWitt III.</i> We've got a gift for you. <p><i>The President.</i> Yeah, tell me what I got here. Tell me what I got. <p><i>St. Louis Cardinals Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William O. DeWitt, Jr.</i> Thank you for those warm remarks and nice hospitality here. We've got a couple of gifts for you and Mrs. Obama. <p><i>The President.</i> There you go. <p><i>William O. DeWitt, Jr.</i> A World Series jersey with your name on the back, number 44. <p><i>The President.</i> That's nice right there. [<i>Laughter</i>] There we go. <p><i>William O. DeWitt III.</i> One for each. <p><i>William O. DeWitt, Jr.</i> One for each. That one's yours. <p><i>The President</i>. Yes. <p><i>William O. DeWitt, Jr.</i> You can have that. <p><i>The President</i>. Okay. <p><i>William O. DeWitt, Jr.</i> And a World Series bat, for your&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The President.</i> I'm a little bit worried about giving my wife a bat, though, if I&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;if I mess up. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> I'll take my bat. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>William O. DeWitt, Jr.</i> It's great to be here. Thank you. <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you so much.\" "
"14" "\"<i>The President.</i> Please, have a seat, everybody. For those of you who I have not seen since before the break, happy New Year. <p>I am extraordinarily grateful for all the work that you have done. I want to start off by thanking Jeff for his continued outstanding leadership of this Jobs Council. I think that the plan is for me to maybe just open up with a few remarks and then we've got a whole bunch of presentations, so I don't want to take too much time. <p><i>General Electric Co. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey R. Immelt. </i>Great. <p><i>The President.</i> Is that all right with you, Mr. Chairman? <p><i>Mr. Immelt.</i> That's great. <p><i>The President.</i> One of the things that's been striking about this Jobs Council is how focused and how hard-working everybody has been around this table. This has not been a show council, this has been a work council. And because of the extraordinary commitments that each and every one of you have made, we have generated, I think, as good a set of proposals as we have seen coming out of the private sector to help to guide and steer our economic agenda and our approach to jobs and growth over the next couple of years. <p>In each of the earlier meetings, we discussed the key role that we all play in accelerating growth and improving America's competitiveness and that the economic recovery has to be driven by the private sector. We have moved aggressively to implement your recommendations. As I think you've heard, of your 35 executive action recommendations, we've taken action on 33 of them; we've completed the implementation of 16 of them. And I'll highlight a couple of examples. <p>Building on some of the Job Council's National Investment Initiative recommendations, last week the Vice President and I hosted a forum on the increasing trend of insourcing&mdash;companies choosing to invest in the United States. And Intel and DuPont participated, along with several dozen other companies. We discussed tangible ways that we can encourage domestic investment, and I announced a number of new initiatives and new tax proposals to provide further incentives for companies to increase investment in the United States, including expanding on SelectUSA, one of the recommendations in your last report. And we actually had a company there that had benefited from the services of SelectUSA, and it confirmed the power and capacity of one-stop shops and a coordinated approach from the Federal Government for somebody who is interested in investment here in the United States. <p>I've personally emphasized to the White House team and to the Cabinet the importance of aggressively implementing the recommendations of this Job Council. I have been tracking implementation of your recommendations, and we've seen substantial progress across the board. <p>Let me highlight a couple other areas where your ideas and focus have had significant impact. First, on permitting: This is something that I know that Matt and others really emphasized. As we all agreed, we needed to make a big investment in this country in infrastructure to assure our competitiveness. We also agreed that we can't be bogged down by redtape and bureaucracy if we're actually going to get every bang for the buck. Building on administration efforts to streamline permitting, I issued an Executive order to expedite review of job-creating infrastructure projects and to track their progress on a new public dashboard. All 14 projects are on track. Most importantly, we're using these projects to learn lessons that we can scale across a whole range of projects throughout the Federal Government moving forward. And I want you to know that as a result of your input, we're going to establish a permitting project manager effort, overseen by OMB, to establish performance metrics, track progress against goals, and adapt best practices across agencies. So, see? Mark can cross this off&mdash;check this off his list. [<i>Laughter</i>] I know he was coming here, and he was going to make sure that happened; it's happening. <p>A second example: On regulatory review&mdash;and we're going to have an opportunity for Jeff and Cass to expand on what we've been doing in this area&mdash;but I tasked Federal agencies to cut inefficient or excessively burdensome regulations and issued an Executive order to independent agencies to look back at their regulations for inefficiencies and excessive burdens. Currently, we're estimating savings of $10 billion over 10 years by implementing just a fraction of the reforms that have already been proposed and identified. Cass is going to provide you with a fuller update in a moment, but the preliminary results are exciting. And this includes, by the way, the independent agencies. So, for example, the FCC, prompted by our request, but also due to some excellent work by Julius Genachowski, they've already eliminated a hundred and ninety rules&mdash;a hundred and ninety. And that gives you some sense of the scale of the work that can be done as a consequence of some of your recommendations. <p>I announced last Friday that I'm going to ask Congress to give me authority to reorganize the Government to make it work better for the American people, while eliminating duplication and waste and inefficiencies. Much of this was embodied in some of the recommendations that you had in particular areas. <p>My legislative proposal would create a consolidation authority that would for the first time require that any reorganization proposal reduce the size of Government and cut costs. So this is not just a matter of moving boxes around. The question is, can you actually achieve better integration, better streamlining, better efficiency, and ultimately better consumer service and better payoff for taxpayers. <p>The first proposal we identified was to consolidate the six agencies focusing primarily on business and trade into a new department with a single mission: to spur job creation and expand the U.S. economy. And this new department would consolidate the core business and trade functions of six agencies. It would be focused solely on helping entrepreneurs and businesses of all size to grow and to compete and to hire, while also cutting costs and provide better customer service. <p>So I make these points just to say that not only have you guys exceeded all expectations in providing specific, thoughtful recommendations. Hopefully, we've at least met your expectations in followthrough and implementation; what we haven't seen is a bunch of white papers sitting on a shelf somewhere collecting dust. We have tried to take very seriously everything that you proposed and to try to integrate it into not only legislative proposals, but also the executive proposals out there. <p>So I read your first-year report. I was pleased to see that there's consistency and shared urgency about America playing to win. Education, innovation, streamlining regulations, energy, manufacturing, all these are critical issues, and they're all interwoven, and they impact each other. <p>I recognize a lot of these issues are difficult. They've proven challenging for decades. The good news is on each of these fronts we've made progress this year. I feel confident in being able to say that every one of the agencies in this Government has been focused on how do they improve, get smarter, get better, get faster, become more focused on delivering good value to the end user. And I believe that we've made genuine progress on all these fronts. We would not have made this progress without this Jobs Council. And I think it will pay off in terms of solidifying this recovery and allowing us to move forward in a way where it actually translates into jobs, which has obviously been our principal and primary focus: making sure that we're creating a fair shot for every American who wants to work hard and get out there and succeed in this economy. <p>So with that, Jeff, I just want to say thank you for your being able to provide such outstanding leadership for this effort. And with that, I'm looking forward to hearing&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Mr. Immelt.</i> Great. <p><i>The President.</i> &mdash;&mdash;all the good work that's already been done. <p><i>Mr. Immelt.</i> Thanks, Mr. President. <p>[<i>At this point, the meeting continued and no transcript was provided. The meeting concluded as follows.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Well, I just, again, want to thank all of you for the seriousness and effort that you've put into this Jobs Council. We're going to continue to gather recommendations from you and are going to continue to try to implement them as quickly as we can. <p>Those where we think there's an issue, we'll get back to you, and there will be an iterative process where we'll be in discussions in terms of how we can achieve some of the goals that have been set. <p>I want you to know that obviously this year is an election year, and so getting Congress focused on some of these issues may be difficult. But we have been struck by the degree of capacity we have administratively to at least chip away at some of these problems. Oftentimes, it's hard to get the kind of comprehensive solutions that you want without legislative involvement. But those small, incremental steps, they add up, and we're going to continue to make sure that we push that as hard as possible. <p>I did notice that we didn't have time to talk about manufacturing, although Jeff, I know that you and Rich Trumka and others have spent a good deal of time on it. In some ways that's all right because essentially that whole insourcing conversation was really a manufacturing conversation. And I was incredibly impressed with the potential at least for us to start getting manufacturing back in the United States in selective industries&mdash;understanding that if you've got&mdash;if you've got products that involve high volume, lots of labor, unskilled labor, that it's going to be difficult to move those back. <p>On the other hand, where you have skilled labor, our competitive advantages are accelerating. And we're going to really be pushing hard on that front along with issues like basic research, et cetera, partly because my understanding&mdash;and John and others, I think you guys helped&mdash;Steve Jobs and others&mdash;helped educate me on the fact that if all our manufacturing facilities move offshore that it's actually hard over time to keep our R&D here because so much of this ends up being a matter of seeing how something works in an applied fashion and tinkering with it and going back at it. <p><i>Mr. Immelt.</i> We've set a goal here, Mr. President, to try to get back four points of global market share and value added in manufacturing. We think we can do that. People like Paul and I that travel the world, I think we see the U.S. more competitive today than we have in the last 20 or 25 years, so that's&mdash;I think that's another great initiative here. <p><i>The President.</i> It's a good news story. It merges directly with our export initiative and the great work that people like Fred and Ron and others are doing. So we're going to keep on pushing that. You'll see that is a significant focus in our State of the Union as well. <p>So thank you, everybody. Great work. Appreciate it. <p><i>Mr. Immelt.</i> Thanks, Mr. President.\" "
"15" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! I am glad to be at Disney World, the Magic Kingdom. This is outstanding. <p>Well, let me begin by thanking Ruben for that extraordinary introduction. And he was too bashful; maybe he's not supposed to do this. I will do it. His restaurant is called Zaza [Yaya's; White House correction]&mdash;new Cuban diners. So everybody check it out. And I told him, he was&mdash;on the way out, he was wondering, I don't know, I don't do this a lot. He's a natural. [<i>Laughter</i>] We're going to have to run him for something. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But thank you so much for taking the time. It is great to be here. It is rare that I get to do something that Sasha and Malia envy me for. [<i>Laughter</i>] That doesn't happen very often. Maybe for once they'll actually ask me at dinner how my day went. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And I confess, I am excited to see Mickey. It's always nice to meet a world leader who has bigger ears than me. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to acknowledge the presence of one of Florida's outstanding mayors, the mayor of Orlando, Buddy Dyer is in the house. We've got two outstanding members of my Cabinet, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Commerce Secretary John Bryson. Because they're focused on what brings us here today, and that's creating jobs and boosting tourism. <p>You just heard what a huge difference tourism makes for small businesses like Ruben's. Every year, tens of millions of tourists all over the world come to visit America. Makes sense. You got the greatest country on Earth, people want to come. As folks in Orlando know, that's good for our economy. It means people are renting cars and they're staying in hotels and they're eating at restaurants and they're checking out the sights. It means people are doing business here in the United States. In 2010, nearly 60 million international visitors helped the tourism industry generate over $134 billion. Tourism is the number-one service that we export&mdash;number one. And that means jobs. <p>More money spent by more tourists means more businesses can hire more workers. This is a pretty simple formula. And that's why we're all here today, to tell the world that America is open for business. We want to welcome you and to take concrete steps to boost America's tourism industry so that we can keep growing our economy and creating more jobs here in Florida and all across the country. <p>Now, here's the good news: We've got the best product to sell. I mean, look at where we are. We've got the most entertaining destinations in the world. This is the land of extraordinary natural wonders, from the Rocky Mountains to the Grand Canyon, from Yellowstone to Yosemite. <p>This is the land where we do big things, and so have incredible landmarks, like the Golden Gate Bridge and the Empire State Building, the Hoover Dam, the Gateway Arch. This is the land of iconic cities and all their sights, from Independence Hall in Philadelphia to Faneuil Hall in Boston, from the Space Needle in Seattle to the skyline of my hometown in Chicago. It's a nice skyline, for those of you who have never been there. [<i>Laughter</i>] All right, a couple of Chicagoans back there. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But I'm here today because I want more tourists here tomorrow. I want America to be the top tourist destination in the world&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;the top tourist destination in the world. And this is something that we've been focused on for some time. <p>Two years ago, I signed a bill into law called the Travel Promotion Act. It had broad support of both Democrats and Republicans. And as you know, that doesn't always happen. [<i>Laughter</i>] And it set up a new nonprofit organization called Brand USA. Its job is to pitch America as a travel destination for the rest of the world to come to visit. <p>You guys see advertising for other countries, other destinations, here in the United States, right? Well, we've got to do the same thing so that when people are thinking about where they want to travel, where they want to spend their vacation, we want them to come here. And so that's already in place, but we've got to do more. <p>So today I directed my administration to send me a new national tourism strategy focused on creating jobs. And some of America's most successful business leaders&mdash;some who are here today&mdash;have signed up to help. We're going to see how we can make it easier for foreign tourists to find basic information about visiting America. And we're going to see how we can attract more tourists to our national parks. We want people visiting not just Epcot Center, but the Everglades too. The more folks who visit America, the more Americans we get back to work. It's that simple. <p>Now, just as we do a better job of marketing our tourist destinations, we've also got to make it easier for tourists to make the visit. There's a good reason why it's not easy for anybody to get a visa to come to America. Obviously, our national security is a top priority. We will always protect our borders and our shores and our tourist destinations from people who want to do us harm. And unfortunately, such people exist, and that's not going to change. <p>But we also want to get more international tourists coming to America. And there's no reason why we can't do both. We can make sure that we're doing a good job keeping America secure while at the same time maintaining the openness that's always been the hallmark of America and making sure that we're welcoming travelers from all around the world. <p>So one step we're taking is the expansion of something called the Global Entry Program. It's a program that protects our borders and makes life easier for frequent travelers to and from the United States. Now, getting into the program requires an extensive background check. But once you're in, once you've proven yourself to be a solid individual who is coming here for business or recreation purposes, instead of going through long lines at immigration, we can scan your passport, your fingerprints, and you're on your way. <p>So it's a great example of how we're using new technology to maintain national security and boost tourism at the same time. And we're now going to make it available to almost all international travelers coming to the United States. If they're willing to submit themselves to the background checks necessary, we can make sure that we're facilitating their easy travel into the United States. <p>There are some additional steps, though, that we can take. Right now, there are 36 countries around the world whose citizens can visit America without getting a tourist visa. After they go online they get precleared by Homeland Security, and there's only one thing they have to do and that's book a flight. And that's been a great boost for tourism. Over 60 percent of our visitors don't require a visa, and in most cases, that's because of this program. <p>Today I'm directing my administration to see if we can add more countries to it. We want more folks to have an easier time coming to the United States. <p>And let's also realize that in the years ahead, more and more tourists are going to come from countries not currently in this program, countries with rapidly growing economies, huge populations, and emerging middle classes, countries like China and India, and especially important here in Florida, Brazil, a huge population that loves to come to Florida. But we make it too hard for them. More and more of their people can now afford to visit America who couldn't come before, and in fact, over the next 4 years, the tourists traveling from those countries we expect to more than double. <p>But we want them coming right here. We want them spending money here, in Orlando, in Florida, in the United States of America, which will boost our businesses and our economy. <p>So today I'm directing the State Department to accelerate our ability to process visas by 40 percent in China and in Brazil this year. We're not talking about 5 years from now or 10 years from now&mdash;this year. <p>We've already made incredible progress in this area. We've better staffed our Embassies and our consulates. We've streamlined services with better technology. Waiting times for a visa are down. But applications keep on going up; they are skyrocketing. People want to come here. And China and Brazil are the two countries which have some of the biggest backlogs. And these are two of the countries with some of the fastest growing middle classes that want to visit and have disposable income, money that they want to spend at our parks and our monuments and at businesses like Ruben's. <p>So that's what this is all about: telling the world that America is open for business, making it as safe and as simple as possible to visit, helping our businesses all across the country grow and create jobs, helping those businesses compete and win. <p>Ultimately, that's how we're going to rebuild an economy where hard work pays off, where responsibility is rewarded, and where anybody can make it if they try. That's what America is all about. That's part of the reason why people want to come here, because they know our history. They know what the American Dream has been all about. And a place like Disneyland represents that quintessentially American spirit. This image is something that's recognized all around the world, and this weather is something that people appreciate all around the world, including the northern parts of this country. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So we want everybody to come. All who are watching, Disney World and Florida are open for business, but we want people all around the world to know the same. And we are going to do everything we can to make sure that we're continuing to boost tourism for decades to come. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"16" "\"Hello, everybody. On Thursday, I went down to Florida to visit Disney World, and to Sasha and Malia's great disappointment, I was not there to hang out with Mickey or ride Space Mountain. Instead, I was there to talk about steps we're taking to boost tourism and create jobs. <p>Tourism is the number one service we export. Every year, tens of millions of tourists come from all over the world to visit America. They stay in our hotels, eat at our restaurants, and see all the sights America has to offer. <p>That's good for local businesses. That's good for local economies. And the more folks who visit America, the more Americans we get back to work. It's that simple. <p>We can't wait to seize this opportunity. As I've said before, I will continue to work with Congress, States, and leaders in the private sector to find ways to move this country forward. But where they can't act or won't act, I will. Because we want the world to know that America is open for business. And that's why I announced steps we're taking to promote America and make it easier for tourists to come and visit. <p>Frequent travelers who pass an extensive background check will be able to scan their passports and fingerprints and skip long lines at immigration at more airports. We're going to expand the number of countries where visitors can get precleared by Homeland Security so they don't need a tourist visa. And we're going to speed up visa processing for countries with growing middle classes that can afford to visit America, countries like China and Brazil. <p>We want more visitors coming here. We want them spending money here. It's good for our economy, and it will help provide the boost more businesses need to grow and hire. And we can't wait to make it happen. <p>Too often over the last few months, we've seen Congress drag its feet and refuse to take steps we know will help strengthen our economy. That's why this is the latest in a series of actions I've taken on my own to help our economy keep growing, creating jobs, and restoring security for middle class families. <p>In September, we decided to stop waiting for Congress to fix No Child Left Behind and give States the flexibility they need to help our kids meet higher standards. We made sure that small businesses that have contracts with the Federal Government can get paid faster so they can start hiring more people. We made it easier for veterans to get jobs and put their skills to work. We took steps to help families whose home values have fallen refinance their mortgages and save up to thousands of dollars a year. We sped up the loan process for companies that want to rebuild our roads and bridges, putting construction workers back on the job. And I appointed Richard Cordray to be America's consumer watchdog and protect working Americans from the worst abuses of the financial industry. <p>These are all good steps. Now we need to do more. <p>On Tuesday evening, I'll deliver my State of the Union Address, where I'll lay out my blueprint for actions we need to take together&mdash;not just me, or Congress, but every American&mdash;to rebuild an economy where hard work and responsibility are rewarded, an economy that's built to last. I hope you'll tune in. <p>In the meantime, I'm going to keep doing everything I can to make this country not only the best place to visit and do business, but the best place to live and work and build a better life. <p>Thanks for watching, have a great weekend, and I'll see you on Tuesday.\" "
"17" "\"Hello, everybody! Thank you so much. Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat. <p>Well, I am happy to welcome the Stanley Cup champion Boston Bruins to the White House. I know you are all wicked happy to be here. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I know there are some Members of Congress, members of my Cabinet who are joining us today who are also pretty excited to see you. I understand we got Mayor Menino here. Where is he? There he is right in front of me. Great to see you. <p>The Bruins, the Sox, the Celtics, now the Patriots. [<i>Laughter</i>] Enough already, Boston. [<i>Laughter</i>] What's going on, huh? <p>Last year, this team endured a long season and even longer playoffs. They are the first team in NHL history to win three full seven-game series. They had some pretty long playoff beards to show it&mdash;to show for it. And I appreciate them looking a little more clean cut as they come here today. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>These Bruins finally brought the Stanley Cup back to Causeway Street for the first time since 1972, when Bobby Orr was leading the team. And obviously, that was before most of the guys on this stage were born. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, Bobby Orr is obviously a hockey legend. He took the ice without a helmet, and kids, don't try that at home. He attacked every puck, and he lived by the motto, \\"Forget about style; worry about results.\\" <p>Well, that's what this year's offense delivered: big-time results. <p>Brad Marchand went into the season playing on the fourth line, but \\"The Little Ball of Hate\\" shrugged off the rookie jitters and&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;what's up with that nickname, man?&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;scored five goals in the last five games of the finals series. <p>After two series-winning goals to lead the Bruins to the championships, Nathan Horton went down hard in game three of the finals. But that didn't stop him from doing everything he could to help his team win. He even brought some Boston water all the way to Vancouver and poured it in the ice before decisive game seven. So Beantown delivered. <p>And there is no better image of the Bruins dominance than the tallest player in NHL history&mdash;I'll let you guess which one that is&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;Zdeno Chara, hoisting the cup above the ice in Vancouver, which is I'm sure the highest that the Stanley Cup had ever been. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>This Stanley Cup was won by defense as much as by offense. Tim Thomas posted two shutouts in the Stanley Cup's finals, set an all-time record for saves in the postseason. He also earned the honor of being only the second American ever to be recognized as the Stanley Cup's Playoffs MVP. <p>And together, these players proved that teamwork is everything. It can overcome injuries, it can overcome long odds. The wise old man of the team, Mark Recchi, summed up the season by saying, \\"We played together, we drank together\\"&mdash;how much did you drink?&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;\\"we lost together, and we never wavered.\\" <p>I know that loyalty is important in Boston, which is why the Boston Bruins Foundation has raised and donated more than $7 million in charitable contributions for organizations all across New England. <p>I want to thank them for bringing their spirit of service to Washington. They led a hockey clinic at the Boys and Girls Club&mdash;or they're going to do that later this afternoon. <p>These Bruins understand that winning the Stanley Cup is more than just men on ice. It's about the people that stand behind them. And that's why, since the last buzzer sounded in June, the Bruins have been taking their Cup all over the world to share it with their fans. <p>Zdeno invited his mailman to check it out, wheeled it around town in a baby carriage. [<i>Laughter</i>] Coach Julien's daughter ate her morning Cheerios out of it. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's pretty cool. The Cup has traveled from the back of a duck boat in the streets of Boston to the greens of Pebble Beach and from a sauna in Finland to a Slovakian castle. Dennis Seidenberg even brought it to his son's [daughters'; White House correction] christening. <p>Under the leadership of owner Jeremy Jacobs and Coach Julien, this team has shown a commitment to the game and to each other that is a testament to them, but obviously also a testament to fans who cheer for the black and gold all around the world. They know that being a champion doesn't end when you hang up your skates at the end of practice or at the end of the season. And the new banner that hangs from the rafters of the Garden commemorates the place that they have earned in history. <p>And I know that the season is heating up again, so I don't want to be too long. I just want to make sure that I wish everybody good luck on the ice tomorrow night and during the rest of the season as well. <p>Congratulations, gentlemen. Great job. All right.\" "
"18" "\"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans: Last month, I went to Andrews Air Force Base and welcomed home some of our last troops to serve in Iraq. Together, we offered a final, proud salute to the colors under which more than a million of our fellow citizens fought and several thousand gave their lives. <p>We gather tonight knowing that this generation of heroes has made the United States safer and more respected around the world. For the first time in 9 years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq. For the first time in two decades, Usama bin Laden is not a threat to this country. Most of Al Qaida's top lieutenants have been defeated. The Taliban's momentum has been broken, and some troops in Afghanistan have begun to come home. <p>These achievements are a testament to the courage, selflessness, and teamwork of America's Armed Forces. At a time when too many of our institutions have let us down, they exceed all expectations. They're not consumed with personal ambition. They don't obsess over their differences. They focus on the mission at hand. They work together. <p>Imagine what we could accomplish if we followed their example. Think about the America within our reach: a country that leads the world in educating its people; an America that attracts a new generation of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs; a future where we're in control of our own energy and our security and prosperity aren't so tied to unstable parts of the world; an economy built to last, where hard work pays off and responsibility is rewarded. <p>We can do this. I know we can, because we've done it before. At the end of World War II, when another generation of heroes returned home from combat, they built the strongest economy and middle class the world has ever known. My grandfather, a veteran of Patton's army, got the chance to go to college on the GI bill. My grandmother, who worked on a bomber assembly line, was part of a workforce that turned out the best products on Earth. <p>The two of them shared the optimism of a nation that had triumphed over a depression and fascism. They understood they were part of something larger, that they were contributing to a story of success that every American had a chance to share, the basic American promise that if you worked hard, you could do well enough to raise a family, own a home, send your kids to college, and put a little away for retirement. <p>The defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive. No challenge is more urgent. No debate is more important. We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well while a growing number of Americans barely get by. Or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot and everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same set of rules. What's at stake aren't Democratic values or Republican values, but American values. And we have to reclaim them. <p>Let's remember how we got here. Long before the recession, jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores. Technology made businesses more efficient, but also made some jobs obsolete. Folks at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hard-working Americans struggled with costs that were growing, paychecks that weren't, and personal debt that kept piling up. <p>In 2008, the house of cards collapsed. We learned that mortgages had been sold to people who couldn't afford or understand them. Banks had made huge bets and bonuses with other people's money. Regulators had looked the other way or didn't have the authority to stop the bad behavior. <p>It was wrong, it was irresponsible, and it plunged our economy into a crisis that put millions out of work, saddled us with more debt, and left innocent, hard-working Americans holding the bag. In the 6 months before I took office, we lost nearly 4 million jobs. And we lost another 4 million before our policies were in full effect. <p>Those are the facts. But so are these: In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than 3 million jobs. Last year, they created the most jobs since 2005. American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s. Together, we've agreed to cut the deficit by more than $2 trillion. And we've put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable so a crisis like this never happens again. <p>The state of our Union is getting stronger. And we've come too far to turn back now. As long as I'm President, I will work with anyone in this Chamber to build on this momentum. But I intend to fight obstruction with action, and I will oppose any effort to return to the very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place. <p>No, we will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt, and phony financial profits. Tonight I want to speak about how we move forward and lay out a blueprint for an economy that's built to last, an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American workers, and a renewal of American values. <p>Now, this blueprint begins with American manufacturing. <p>On the day I took office, our auto industry was on the verge of collapse. Some even said we should let it die. With a million jobs at stake, I refused to let that happen. In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. We got workers and automakers to settle their differences. We got the industry to retool and restructure. Today, General Motors is back on top as the world's number-one automaker. Chrysler has grown faster in the U.S. than any major car company. Ford is investing billions in U.S. plants and factories. And together, the entire industry added nearly a hundred and sixty thousand jobs. <p>We bet on American workers. We bet on American ingenuity. And tonight, the American auto industry is back. <p>What's happening in Detroit can happen in other industries. It can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh. We can't bring every job back that's left our shore. But right now it's getting more expensive to do business in places like China. Meanwhile, America is more productive. A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock told me that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home. Today, for the first time in 15 years, Master Lock's unionized plant in Milwaukee is running at full capacity. <p>So we have a huge opportunity at this moment to bring manufacturing back. But we have to seize it. Tonight my message to business leaders is simple: Ask yourselves what you can do to bring jobs back to your country, and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed. <p>We should start with our Tax Code. Right now companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas. Meanwhile, companies that choose to stay in America get hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world. It makes no sense, and everyone knows it. So let's change it. <p>First, if you're a business that wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn't get a tax deduction for doing it. That money should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like Master Lock that decide to bring jobs home. <p>Second, no American company should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas. From now on, every multinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax. And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies that choose to stay here and hire here in America. <p>Third, if you're an American manufacturer, you should get a bigger tax cut. If you're a high-tech manufacturer, we should double the tax deduction you get for making your products here. And if you want to relocate in a community that was hit hard when a factory left town, you should get help financing a new plant, equipment, or training for new workers. <p>So my message is simple: It is time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in America. Send me these tax reforms, and I will sign them right away. <p>We're also making it easier for American businesses to sell products all over the world. Two years ago, I set a goal of doubling U.S. exports over 5 years. With the bipartisan trade agreements we signed into law, we're on track to meet that goal ahead of schedule. And soon there will be millions of new customers for American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea. Soon there will be new cars on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit and Toledo and Chicago. <p>I will go anywhere in the world to open new markets for American products. And I will not stand by when our competitors don't play by the rules. We've brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration, and it's made a difference. Over a thousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires. But we need to do more. It's not right when another country lets our movies, music, and software be pirated. It's not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because they're heavily subsidized. <p>Tonight I'm announcing the creation of a trade enforcement unit that will be charged with investigating unfair trading practices in countries like China. There will be more inspections to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders. And this Congress should make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it comes to accessing financing or new markets like Russia. Our workers are the most productive on Earth, and if the playing field is level, I promise you, America will always win. <p>I also hear from many business leaders who want to hire in the United States, but can't find workers with the right skills. Growing industries in science and technology have twice as many openings as we have workers who can do the job. Think about that: openings at a time when millions of Americans are looking for work. It's inexcusable, and we know how to fix it. <p>Jackie Bray is a single mom from North Carolina who was laid off from her job as a mechanic. Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte and formed a partnership with Central Piedmont Community College. The company helped the college design courses in laser and robotics training. It paid Jackie's tuition, then hired her to help operate their plant. <p>I want every American looking for work to have the same opportunity as Jackie did. Join me in a national commitment to train 2 million Americans with skills that will lead directly to a job. My administration has already lined up more companies that want to help. Model partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community colleges in places like Charlotte and Orlando and Louisville are up and running. Now you need to give more community colleges the resources they need to become community career centers, places that teach people skills that businesses are looking for right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing. <p>And I want to cut through the maze of confusing training programs so that from now on, people like Jackie have one program, one web site, and one place to go for all the information and help that they need. It is time to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system that puts people to work. <p>These reforms will help people get jobs that are open today. But to prepare for the jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to skills and education has to start earlier. <p>For less than 1 percent of what our Nation spends on education each year, we've convinced nearly every State in the country to raise their standards for teaching and learning, the first time that's happened in a generation. But challenges remain, and we know how to solve them. <p>At a time when other countries are doubling down on education, tight budgets have forced States to lay off thousands of teachers. We know a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over $250,000. A great teacher can offer an escape from poverty to the child who dreams beyond his circumstance. Every person in this Chamber can point to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their lives. Most teachers work tirelessly, with modest pay, sometimes digging into their own pocket for school supplies, just to make a difference. <p>Teachers matter. So instead of bashing them or defending the status quo, let's offer schools a deal. Give them the resources to keep good teachers on the job and reward the best ones. And in return, grant schools flexibility to teach with creativity and passion, to stop teaching to the test, and to replace teachers who just aren't helping kids learn. That's a bargain worth making. <p>We also know that when students don't walk away from their education, more of them walk the stage to get their diploma. When students are not allowed to drop out, they do better. So tonight I am proposing that every State&mdash;every State&mdash;requires that all students stay in high school until they graduate or turn 18. <p>When kids do graduate, the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college. At a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt, this Congress needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in July. <p>Extend the tuition tax credit we started that saves millions of middle class families thousands of dollars and give more young people the chance to earn their way through college by doubling the number of work-study jobs in the next 5 years. <p>Of course, it's not enough for us to increase student aid. We can't just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we'll run out of money. States also need to do their part by making higher education a higher priority in their budgets. And colleges and universities have to do their part by working to keep costs down. <p>Recently, I spoke with a group of college presidents who have done just that. Some schools redesign courses to help students finish more quickly. Some use better technology. The point is, it's possible. So let me put colleges and universities on notice: If you can't stop tuition from going up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down. Higher education can't be a luxury. It is an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford. <p>Let's also remember that hundreds of thousands of talented, hard-working students in this country face another challenge: the fact that they aren't yet American citizens. Many were brought here as small children, are American through and through, yet they live every day with the threat of deportation. Others came more recently, to study business and science and engineering, but as soon as they get their degree, we send them home to invent new products and create new jobs somewhere else. That doesn't make sense. <p>I believe as strongly as ever that we should take on illegal immigration. That's why my administration has put more boots on the border than ever before. That's why there are fewer illegal crossings than when I took office. The opponents of action are out of excuses. We should be working on comprehensive immigration reform right now. <p>But if election-year politics keeps Congress from acting on a comprehensive plan, let's at least agree to stop expelling responsible young people who want to staff our labs, start new businesses, defend this country. Send me a law that gives them the chance to earn their citizenship. I will sign it right away. <p>You see, an economy built to last is one where we encourage the talent and ingenuity of every person in this country. That means women should earn equal pay for equal work. It means we should support everyone who's willing to work and every risk taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next Steve Jobs. <p>After all, innovation is what America has always been about. Most new jobs are created in startups and small businesses. So let's pass an agenda that helps them succeed. Tear down regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting the financing to grow. Expand tax relief to small businesses that are raising wages and creating good jobs. Both parties agree on these ideas. So put them in a bill and get it on my desk this year. <p>Innovation also demands basic research. Today, the discoveries taking place in our federally financed labs and universities could lead to new treatments that kill cancer cells, but leave healthy ones untouched, new lightweight vests for cops and soldiers that can stop any bullet. Don't gut these investments in our budget. Don't let other countries win the race for the future. Support the same kind of research and innovation that led to the computer chip and the Internet, to new American jobs and new American industries. <p>And nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American-made energy. Over the last 3 years, we've opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration, and tonight I'm directing my administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources. Right now&mdash;right now&mdash;American oil production is the highest that it's been in 8 years. That's right, 8 years. Not only that, last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past 16 years. <p>But with only 2 percent of the world's oil reserves, oil isn't enough. This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy, a strategy that's cleaner, cheaper, and full of new jobs. <p>We have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly 100 years. And my administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy. Experts believe this will support more than 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade. And I'm requiring all companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use. Because America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our citizens at risk. <p>The development of natural gas will create jobs and power trucks and factories that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we don't have to choose between our environment and our economy. And by the way, it was public research dollars, over the course of 30 years, that helped develop the technologies to extract all this natural gas out of shale rock, reminding us that Government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the ground. <p>Now, what's true for natural gas is just as true for clean energy. In 3 years, our partnership with the private sector has already positioned America to be the world's leading manufacturer of high-tech batteries. Because of Federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled, and thousands of Americans have jobs because of it. <p>When Bryan Ritterby was laid off from his job making furniture, he said he worried that at 55 no one would give him a second chance. But he found work at Energetx, a wind turbine manufacturer in Michigan. Before the recession, the factory only made luxury yachts. Today, it's hiring workers like Bryan, who said, \\"I'm proud to be working in the industry of the future.\\" <p>Our experience with shale gas, our experience with natural gas, shows us that the payoffs on these public investments don't always come right away. Some technologies don't pan out, some companies fail. But I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy. I will not walk away from workers like Bryan. I will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to China or Germany because we refuse to make the same commitment here. <p>We've subsidized oil companies for a century. That's long enough. It's time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that rarely has been more profitable and double down on a clean energy industry that never has been more promising. Pass clean energy tax credits. Create these jobs. <p>We can also spur energy innovation with new incentives. The differences in this Chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change. But there's no reason why Congress shouldn't at least set a clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation. So far, you haven't acted. Well, tonight I will. I'm directing my administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public land to power 3 million homes. And I'm proud to announce that the Department of Defense, working with us, the world's largest consumer of energy, will make one of the largest commitments to clean energy in history, with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power a quarter of a million homes a year. <p>Of course, the easiest way to save money is to waste less energy. So here's a proposal: Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their factories and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings. Their energy bills will be a hundred billion dollars lower over the next decade, and America will have less pollution, more manufacturing, more jobs for construction workers who need them. Send me a bill that creates these jobs. <p>Building this new energy future should be just one part of a broader agenda to repair America's infrastructure. So much of America needs to be rebuilt. We've got crumbling roads and bridges, a power grid that wastes too much energy, an incomplete high-speed broadband network that prevents a small-business owner in rural America from selling her products all over the world. <p>During the Great Depression, America built the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge. After World War II, we connected our States with a system of highways. Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the workers who built them to the businesses that still use them today. <p>In the next few weeks, I will sign an Executive order clearing away the redtape that slows down too many construction projects. But you need to fund these projects. Take the money we're no longer spending at war, use half of it to pay down our debt, and use the rest to do some nation-building right here at home. <p>There's never been a better time to build, especially since the construction industry was one of the hardest hit when the housing bubble burst. Of course, construction workers weren't the only ones who were hurt. So were millions of innocent Americans who've seen their home values decline. And while Government can't fix the problem on its own, responsible homeowners shouldn't have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom to get some relief. <p>And that's why I'm sending this Congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage by refinancing at historically low rates. No more redtape. No more runaround from the banks. A small fee on the largest financial institutions will ensure that it won't add to the deficit and will give those banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to repay a deficit of trust. <p>Let's never forget: Millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a Government and a financial system that do the same. It's time to apply the same rules from top to bottom. No bailouts, no handouts, and no copouts. An America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody. <p>We've all paid the price for lenders who sold mortgages to people who couldn't afford them and buyers who knew they couldn't afford them. That's why we need smart regulations to prevent irresponsible behavior. Rules to prevent financial fraud or toxic dumping or faulty medical devices, these don't destroy the free market. They make the free market work better. <p>There's no question that some regulations are outdated, unnecessary, or too costly. In fact, I've approved fewer regulations in the first 3 years of my Presidency than my Republican predecessor did in his. I've ordered every Federal agency to eliminate rules that don't make sense. We've already announced over 500 reforms, and just a fraction of them will save business and citizens more than $10 billion over the next 5 years. We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend $10,000 a year proving that they could contain a spill, because milk was somehow classified as an oil. With a rule like that, I guess it was worth crying over spilled milk. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, I'm confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a Federal agency looking over his shoulder. Absolutely. But I will not back down from making sure an oil company can contain the kind of oil spill we saw in the Gulf 2 years ago. I will not back down from protecting our kids from mercury poisoning or making sure that our food is safe and our water is clean. I will not go back to the days when health insurance companies had unchecked power to cancel your policy, deny your coverage, or charge women differently than men. <p>And I will not go back to the days when Wall Street was allowed to play by its own set of rules. The new rules we passed restore what should be any financial system's core purpose: getting funding to entrepreneurs with the best ideas and getting loans to responsible families who want to buy a home or start a business or send their kids to college. <p>So if you are a big bank or financial institution, you're no longer allowed to make risky bets with your customers' deposits. You're required to write out a \\"living will\\" that details exactly how you'll pay the bills if you fail, because the rest of us are not bailing you out ever again. And if you're a mortgage lender or a payday lender or a credit card company, the days of signing people up for products they can't afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices, those days are over. Today, American consumers finally have a watchdog in Richard Cordray, with one job: to look out for them. <p>We'll also establish a financial crimes unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on large-scale fraud and protect people's investments. Some financial firms violate major antifraud laws because there's no real penalty for being a repeat offender. That's bad for consumers, and it's bad for the vast majority of bankers and financial service professionals who do the right thing. So pass legislation that makes the penalties for fraud count. <p>And tonight I'm asking my Attorney General to create a special unit of Federal prosecutors and leading State attorney general to expand our investigations into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the housing crisis. This new unit will hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans. <p>Now, a return to the American values of fair play and shared responsibility will help protect our people and our economy. But it should also guide us as we look to pay down our debt and invest in our future. <p>Right now our most immediate priority is stopping a tax hike on a hundred and sixty million working Americans while the recovery is still fragile. People cannot afford losing $40 out of each paycheck this year. There are plenty of ways to get this done. So let's agree right here, right now. No side issues. No drama. Pass the payroll tax cut without delay. Let's get it done. <p>When it comes to the deficit, we've already agreed to more than $2 trillion in cuts and savings. But we need to do more, and that means making choices. Right now we're poised to spend nearly $1 trillion more on what was supposed to be a temporary tax break for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. Right now because of loopholes and shelters in the Tax Code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle class households. Right now Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary. <p>Do we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Or do we want to keep our investments in everything else, like education and medical research, a strong military and care for our veterans? Because if we're serious about paying down our debt, we can't do both. <p>The American people know what the right choice is. So do I. As I told the Speaker this summer, I'm prepared to make more reforms that rein in the long-term costs of Medicare and Medicaid and strengthen Social Security, so long as those programs remain a guarantee of security for seniors. But in return, we need to change our Tax Code so that people like me, and an awful lot of Members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes. <p>Tax reform should follow the Buffett rule. If you make more than a million dollars a year, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes. And my Republican friend Tom Coburn is right: Washington should stop subsidizing millionaires. In fact, if you're earning a million dollars a year, you shouldn't get special tax subsidies or deductions. On the other hand, if you make under $250,000 a year, like 98 percent of American families, your taxes shouldn't go up. You're the ones struggling with rising costs and stagnant wages. You're the ones who need relief. <p>Now, you can call this class warfare all you want. But asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes? Most Americans would call that common sense. <p>We don't begrudge financial success in this country. We admire it. When Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes, it's not because they envy the rich. It's because they understand that when I get a tax break I don't need and the country can't afford, it either adds to the deficit or somebody else has to make up the difference, like a senior on a fixed income or a student trying to get through school or a family trying to make ends meet. That's not right. Americans know that's not right. They know that this generation's success is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other and to the future of their country, and they know our way of life will only endure if we feel that same sense of shared responsibility. That's how we'll reduce our deficit. That's an America built to last. <p>Now, I recognize that people watching tonight have differing views about taxes and debt, energy and health care. But no matter what party they belong to, I bet most Americans are thinking the same thing right about now: Nothing will get done in Washington this year or next year or maybe even the year after that, because Washington is broken. <p>Can you blame them for feeling a little cynical? <p>The greatest blow to our confidence in our economy last year didn't come from events beyond our control. It came from a debate in Washington over whether the United States would pay its bills or not. Who benefited from that fiasco? <p>I've talked tonight about the deficit of trust between Main Street and Wall Street. But the divide between this city and the rest of the country is at least as bad, and it seems to get worse every year. <p>Now, some of this has to do with the corrosive influence of money in politics. So together, let's take some steps to fix that. Send me a bill that bans insider trading by Members of Congress. I will sign it tomorrow. Let's limit any elected official from owning stocks in industries they impact. Let's make sure people who bundle campaign contributions for Congress can't lobby Congress and vice versa, an idea that has bipartisan support, at least outside of Washington. <p>Some of what's broken has to do with the way Congress does its business these days. A simple majority is no longer enough to get anything&mdash;even routine business&mdash;passed through the Senate. Neither party has been blameless in these tactics. Now both parties should put an end to it. For starters, I ask the Senate to pass a simple rule that all judicial and public service nominations receive a simple up-or-down vote within 90 days. <p>The executive branch also needs to change. Too often, it's inefficient, outdated, and remote. That's why I've asked this Congress to grant me the authority to consolidate the Federal bureaucracy so that our Government is leaner, quicker, and more responsive to the needs of the American people. <p>Finally, none of this can happen unless we also lower the temperature in this town. We need to end the notion that the two parties must be locked in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction, that politics is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of building consensus around commonsense ideas. <p>I'm a Democrat, but I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed: That Government should do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves and no more. That's why my education reform offers more competition and more control for schools and States. That's why we're getting rid of regulations that don't work. That's why our health care law relies on a reformed private market, not a Government program. <p>On the other hand, even my Republican friends who complain the most about Government spending have supported federally financed roads and clean energy projects and Federal offices for the folks back home. <p>The point is, we should all want a smarter, more effective Government. And while we may not be able to bridge our biggest philosophical differences this year, we can make real progress. With or without this Congress, I will keep taking actions that help the economy grow. But I can do a whole lot more with your help. Because when we act together, there's nothing the United States of America can't achieve. <p>That's the lesson we've learned from our actions abroad over the last few years. Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to strike decisive blows against our enemies. From Pakistan to Yemen, the Al Qaida operatives who remain are scrambling, knowing that they can't escape the reach of the United States of America. <p>From this position of strength, we've begun to wind down the war in Afghanistan. Ten thousand of our troops have come home. Twenty-three thousand more will leave by the end of this summer. This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we will build an enduring partnership with Afghanistan so that it is never again a source of attacks against America. <p>As the tide of war recedes, a wave of change has washed across the Middle East and North Africa, from Tunis to Cairo, from Sana'a to Tripoli. A year ago, Qadhafi was one of the world's longest serving dictators, a murderer with American blood on his hands. Today, he is gone. And in Syria, I have no doubt that the Asad regime will soon discover that the forces of change cannot be reversed and that human dignity cannot be denied. <p>How this incredible transformation will end remains uncertain. But we have a huge stake in the outcome. And while it's ultimately up to the people of the region to decide their fate, we will advocate for those values that have served our own country so well. We will stand against violence and intimidation. We will stand for the rights and dignity of all human beings: men and women; Christians, Muslims, and Jews. We will support policies that lead to strong and stable democracies and open markets, because tyranny is no match for liberty. <p>And we will safeguard America's own security against those who threaten our citizens, our friends, and our interests. Look at Iran. Through the power of our diplomacy, a world that was once divided about how to deal with Iran's nuclear program now stands as one. The regime is more isolated than ever before. Its leaders are faced with crippling sanctions, and as long as they shirk their responsibilities, this pressure will not relent. <p>Let there be no doubt: America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal. But a peaceful resolution of this issue is still possible, and far better. And if Iran changes course and meets its obligations, it can rejoin the community of nations. <p>The renewal of American leadership can be felt across the globe. Our oldest alliances in Europe and Asia are stronger than ever. Our ties to the Americas are deeper. Our ironclad commitment&mdash;and I mean ironclad&mdash;to Israel's security has meant the closest military cooperation between our two countries in history. <p>We've made it clear that America is a Pacific power, and a new beginning in Burma has lit a new hope. From the coalitions we've built to secure nuclear materials, to the missions we've led against hunger and disease, from the blows we've dealt to our enemies, to the enduring power of our moral example, America is back. <p>Anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you that America is in decline or that our influence has waned, doesn't know what they're talking about. That's not the message we get from leaders around the world who are eager to work with us. That's not how people feel from Tokyo to Berlin, from Cape Town to Rio, where opinions of America are higher than they've been in years. Yes, the world is changing. No, we can't control every event. But America remains the one indispensable nation in world affairs, and as long as I'm President, I intend to keep it that way. <p>That's why, working with our military leaders, I've proposed a new defense strategy that ensures we maintain the finest military in the world, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our budget. To stay one step ahead of our adversaries, I've already sent this Congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing dangers of cyber threats. <p>Above all, our freedom endures because of the men and women in uniform who defend it. As they come home, we must serve them as well as they've served us. That includes giving them the care and the benefits they have earned, which is why we've increased annual VA spending every year I've been President. And it means enlisting our veterans in the work of rebuilding our Nation. <p>With the bipartisan support of this Congress, we're providing new tax credits to companies that hire vets. Michelle and Jill Biden have worked with American businesses to secure a pledge of 135,000 jobs for veterans and their families. And tonight I'm proposing a veterans jobs corps that will help our communities hire veterans as cops and firefighters, so that America is as strong as those who defend her. <p>Which brings me back to where I began. Those of us who've been sent here to serve can learn a thing or two from the service of our troops. When you put on that uniform, it doesn't matter if you're Black or White, Asian, Latino, Native American; conservative, liberal; rich, poor; gay, straight. When you're marching into battle, you look out for the person next to you or the mission fails. When you're in the thick of the fight, you rise or fall as one unit, serving one nation, leaving no one behind. <p>You know, one of my proudest possessions is the flag that the SEAL team took with them on the mission to get bin Laden. On it are each of their names. Some may be Democrats, some may be Republicans, but that doesn't matter. Just like it didn't matter that day in the Situation Room, when I sat next to Bob Gates, a man who was George Bush's Defense Secretary, and Hillary Clinton, a woman who ran against me for President. <p>All that mattered that day was the mission. No one thought about politics. No one thought about themselves. One of the young men involved in the raid later told me that he didn't deserve credit for the mission. It only succeeded, he said, because every single member of that unit did their job: the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of control, the translator who kept others from entering the compound, the troops who separated the women and children from the fight, the SEALs who charged up the stairs. More than that, the mission only succeeded because every member of that unit trusted each other, because you can't charge up those stairs into darkness and danger unless you know that there's somebody behind you, watching your back. <p>So it is with America. Each time I look at that flag, I'm reminded that our destiny is stitched together like those 50 stars and those 13 stripes. No one built this country on their own. This Nation is great because we built it together. This Nation is great because we worked as a team. This Nation is great because we get each other's backs. And if we hold fast to that truth, in this moment of trial, there is no challenge too great, no mission too hard. As long as we are joined in common purpose, as long as we maintain our common resolve, our journey moves forward, and our future is hopeful, and the state of our Union will always be strong. <p>Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\" "
"19" "\"Thank you! Hello, Iowa! Hello, Cedar Rapids! All right. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Please have a seat. <p>It is great to be back in Iowa, although it is a little colder here&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;than it was in Washington. I want to thank Jeff for the introduction. It's good to see your Governor, Governor Branstad, and Mayor Corbett, outstanding members of the congressional delegation, all kinds of good friends. In fact, this whole row here, if I start introducing them, it will make my speech twice as long, but I love these guys. And it is wonderful to be back here in Iowa. <p>I know there's been a lot of excitement here over the past couple of months. It kind of made me nostalgic. [<i>Laughter</i>] I used to have a lot of fun here in Iowa. I remember a great backyard barbecue out in Marion way back in 2007. Good burgers. I did not have as much gray hair back then. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But when I think about all the days I spent in Iowa, so much of my Presidency, so much about what I care about, so much what I think about every day, has to do with the conversations that I had with you. People's backyards, VFW halls&mdash;those conversations I carry with me. <p>All across this State, in all 99 counties&mdash;and I was in, I think, just about every county&mdash;we talked about how for years the middle class was having a tougher time. Hard work had stopped paying off for too many people. Good jobs and manufacturing were leaving our shores. <p>Folks at the very, very top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most Americans, most folks in Iowa, were just trying to stay afloat. And that was before the financial crisis hit in 2008. <p>The crisis stuck&mdash;struck right at the end of a long campaign, but we didn't even understand at that point how bad that crisis was going to be. And millions of our neighbors were put out of work. <p>But we did know then what we know today: That when we come together as a country, there's no reason why we can't restore that basic American promise, that if you work hard, you can do well. <p>America is not about handouts. America is about earning everything you've got. But if you're willing to put in the work, the idea is that you should be able to raise a family and own a home, not go bankrupt because you got sick, because you've got some health insurance that helps you deal with those difficult times; that you can send your kids to college; that you can put some money away for retirement. That's all most people want. <p>Folks don't have unrealistic ambitions. They do believe that if they work hard they should be able to achieve that small measure of an American Dream. That's what this country is about. That's what you deserve. That's what we talked about during the campaign. <p>Now today, 3 years after the worst economic storm in three generations, we are making progress. Our businesses have created more than 3 million jobs over the last 22 months. If you look at a job chart&mdash;if you look at a chart of what's happened in terms of jobs in America, we lost 4 million jobs before I took office, another 4 million in the few months right after I took office, before our economic policies had a chance to take effect, and we've been growing and increasing jobs ever since&mdash;3 million over the last 22 months. Last year, we created the most jobs since 2005. And today, American manufacturers like this one are hiring again, creating jobs for the first time since the 1990s. And that's good news. <p>Our economy is getting stronger. We've got a lot of work to do, but it's getting stronger. And we've come way too far to turn back now. After everything that's happened, there are people in Washington who seem to have collective amnesia. They seem to have forgotten how we got into this mess. They want to go back to the very same policies that got us into it, the same policies that have stacked the deck against middle class Americans for years. <p>And their philosophy, what there is of it, seems to be pretty simple: We're better off when everybody is left to fend for themselves and everybody can play by their own rules. And I'm here to say they're wrong. We're not going to go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing and bad debt and phony financial profits. That's not how America was built. We're not going to go back to that. <p>So last night in the State of the Union, I laid out my vision for how we move forward. I laid out a blueprint for an economy that is built to last. <p>It's an economy built on American manufacturing with more good jobs and more products made right here in the United States of America. It's an economy built on American energy, fueled by homegrown and alternative energy sources that make us more secure and less dependent on foreign oil. And by the way, there's a connection between those two things. This company right here, some of its key customers are folks who are active in alternative energy. There are jobs to be had&mdash;and Iowa knows all about it&mdash;when we are pursuing aggressively clean energy and alternative energy. <p>It's an economy built on the skills of American workers, getting people the education and the training they need so they're prepared for the jobs of today and they're ready to compete for the jobs of tomorrow. <p>And most importantly, it's an economy that's built on a renewal of American values, heartland values, values that Iowa knows something about: hard work, responsibility, and the same set of rules for everybody, from Main Street to Wall Street. <p>That has to be our future. That's how we restore that basic American promise. And it starts with manufacturing. <p>Look what happened in our auto industry. On the day I took office, it was on the verge of collapse. And some even said we should let it die. I've got the clips in case&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;because I remember. They were beating the heck out of me. \\"Why are you doing this? Why are you intervening?\\" <p>But we stood to lose a million jobs, not just in the auto industry, but all the suppliers, all the related businesses. So I refused to let that happen. <p>In exchange for help&mdash;see, keep in mind, that the administration before us, they had been writing some checks to the auto industry with asking nothing in return. It was just a bailout, straightforward. We said we're going to do it differently. <p>In exchange for help, we also demanded responsibility from the auto industry. We got the industry to retool and to restructure. We got workers and management to get together, figure out how to make yourselves more efficient. <p>And over the past 2 years, that entire industry has added nearly 160,000 jobs. GM is number one in the world again. Ford is investing billions in new plants. Chrysler is growing faster. So today, the American auto industry is back. <p>And I want what's happening in Detroit to happen in other industries. I want it to happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh. And I want it to happen right here in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. <p>Now, it's already happening at places like Conveyor. These folks make some big stuff. I just got a tour&mdash;a quick tour from Graig and Jeff, met some of the workers here, and they told me the story of how Conveyor started. Like so many other wonderful American companies, it started in a garage&mdash;couldn't make that up. Today, they employ 65 people, from engineers and welders to assembly-line workers and salespeople. They specialize in making augers&mdash;those giant screws&mdash;and they used to mix and move everything from cement to chocolate. They don't use the same ones for&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;just in case you were wondering. <p>So Conveyor has doubled in size twice over the last 16 years, and over the next several years, they're hoping to double again. <p>See, right now we have a huge opportunity to help companies like this hire more workers, because what's&mdash;here's what's happening globally. Obviously, the economy had shifted all around the world. And we were getting more competition from other countries like China that were catching up and had very low wage rates. We had technology that was displacing a lot of workers. But here's what's going on: It's getting more expensive to do business in China now. Their wages are going up. Transportation costs to ship a big auger over here, it starts becoming cost prohibitive. <p>Meanwhile, America is getting more productive. We've become more efficient. We are as competitive as we've ever been. So for a lot of companies, it's starting to make a lot more sense to bring jobs back home. <p>But we've got to seize that opportunity. We've got to help these companies succeed. And it starts with changing our Tax Code. [<i>Applause</i>] It starts with changing our Tax Code. <p>Now, right now companies get all kinds of tax breaks when they move jobs and profits overseas. Think about that. A company that chooses to stay in America gets hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world. That's wrong. It doesn't make sense. We've got to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, reward companies like Conveyor that are doing business right here in the United States of America. <p>Now before the other side gets all excited, let me be clear: If you're a company that wants to outsource jobs or do business around the world, that's your right. It's a free market. But you shouldn't get a tax break for it. Companies that are bringing jobs back from overseas should get tax breaks. High-tech manufacturers should get tax breaks. Manufacturers like Conveyor that stamp products with three proud words: Made in America. Those are the folks who should be rewarded through our Tax Code. <p>Jeff and Graig told me that if we passed tax reforms like these, they'd be able to buy more equipment for their facility. So let's do it. Today my administration is laying out several concrete actions we could take right now to discourage outsourcing and encourage investing in America. You need to tell Congress to send me this tax reform plan. I will sign it right away. <p>We need to make it easier for American businesses to do business here in America, and we also need to make it easier for American businesses to sell our products other places in the world. I don't want to export our jobs; I want to export our goods and our services. <p>So 2 years ago, I set a goal of doubling U.S. exports within 5 years. And by the way, Iowa, you should be interested that obviously a big chunk of those exports are also agricultural, which is doing wonders for this State's economy. The agricultural sector is doing very well. But I also want us to export manufacturing. <p>And we're on track to meet our goal of doubling exports. Actually we're ahead of schedule. Exports has been one of the strengths of this recovery. And soon, thanks to new trade agreements I've signed, not only are we going to be sending more soy beans into South Korea, but we're also going to start seeing new cars on the streets of Seoul, South Korea, imported from Detroit and Toledo and Chicago. <p>I don't mind Kias being sold here, I just want to make sure that they're also buying some Chevys and some Fords. So we're going to keep boosting American manufacturing. We're going to keep training workers with the skills they need to find these jobs. We're going to keep creating new jobs in American energy, including alternative energy that's been a source of strength for a lot of rural communities in Iowa. And an economy built to last also means making sure that there's a sense of fair play and shared responsibility. <p>Now most immediately&mdash;I was talking about taxes on business&mdash;the most immediate thing we need to do with our Tax Code is make sure that we stop a tax hike on 160 million working Americans at the end of next month. People can't afford losing $40 out of each paycheck. Not right now. Your voices convinced Congress to extend this middle class tax cut before. You remember there was a little resistance there at the end of last year? But you guys sent a message: Renew that payroll tax cut, strengthen the economy. But they only extended it for 2 months. We now have to extend it for the entire year. So I need your help to make sure they do it again. Tell Congress to pass this tax cut without drama, without delay, no soap operas. Just get it done. <p>In the longer run, if we're going to invest in our future, we've also got to get our fiscal house in order. You hear a lot of talk about deficits and debt. And those are legitimate concerns although the most important thing we can do to actually reduce the debt is to grow the economy. So we can't abandon our investments in things like manufacturing and education investment, because if we're growing faster, the debt and deficits start coming down, the numbers get easier to manage. You can't just cut your way out of it. It's just like a family. If you are struggling to get out of debt, but you decide, well, I'll just&mdash;I won't repair the roof or the boiler, and I'll stop sending my kid to college, that's not the way you're going to solve your long-term problems. <p>Now, we're going to have to make some tough choices though. And right now we are scheduled to spend nearly $1 trillion more on what was intended to be a temporary tax cut for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. A quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle class households. Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary. Warren Buffett's secretary was at the State of the Union last night, just to confirm&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that fact. <p>Now, does that make any sense to you? Do we want to keep these tax cuts for folks like me who don't need them? I'm doing okay. [<i>Laughter</i>] I really am. And look, nobody likes paying taxes. I understand that. So if we didn't need it, if the country was in a surplus like it was back in 2000, I'd understand us saying, well, let's try to let millionaires keep every last dime. I get that. But that's not the situation we're in. And so we've got to make choices. <p>Do we want to keep investing in everything that's important to our long-term growth&mdash;education, medical research, our military, caring for our veterans&mdash;all of which are expensive? Or do we keep these tax cuts for folks who don't need them and weren't even asking for them? Because we can't do both. I want to be very clear about this. We cannot do both. You've got to choose. <p>So I believe we should follow what we call the Buffett rule: If you make more than a million dollars a year&mdash;I don't mean that you've got a million dollars' worth of assets. I don't mean a family that's been saving all their lives and doing well, but&mdash;and is comfortable, and finally they've got a little nest egg. If you make more than a million dollars a year, you should pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent. If, on the other hand, you make less than $250,000 a year, which includes 98 percent of you, your taxes shouldn't go up. <p>And by the way, if we do that and we make some smart cuts in other areas, we can get this deficit and debt under control and still be making the investments we need to grow the economy. <p>A lot of&mdash;I hear folks running around calling this class warfare. This is not class warfare. Let me tell you something, asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary, that's just common sense. That's common sense. I mean, we're talking about going back to tax rates that we had under Bill Clinton&mdash;when, by the way, the economy grew faster and jobs increased much faster. And in the meantime, Warren Buffett will do fine. [<i>Laughter</i>] I will do fine. We don't need tax breaks; you do. You're the ones who've seen your wages stall, the cost of everything from groceries to college tuition going up. So I want to give you a break. I don't need a break. <p>Look, we don't begrudge success in America. This family business right here, I want them to thrive. I want these guys to keep growing and growing and growing and hire and hire and hire. When we talk&mdash;when Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share in taxes, it's not because Americans envy the rich. Most of them want to get rich. Most of them will work hard to try to do well financially. It's because if I get a tax break I don't need and the country can't afford, then either it's going to add to our deficit, and that's what happened between 2000 and 2008, basically. All these tax cuts just added to the deficit because they weren't paid for, so it takes money out of the Treasury. <p>Or alternatively, if we're going to close that deficit, somebody else is going to have to pick up the tab. It might be a senior who now suddenly has to pay more for their Medicare. It's got to be a student who's suddenly having to pay more for their student loan. It might be a family that's just trying to get by, and suddenly, their tax rates go up. That's not right. That's not who we are. <p>One of the biggest disagreements I have with some folks in Washington is the nature of America's success. Each of us is only here because somebody somewhere felt a responsibility to each other and felt a responsibility to our country's future. And that starts within our own families. It starts with us making sure our kids are responsible and we're instilling in them the values of hard work and doing your homework and treating other people with respect. But then it expands from there to our neighborhoods and our communities. And we recognize that if everybody is getting a fair shot, everybody has a chance to do better. <p>That's what built this country. Now it's our turn to be responsible. Now it's our turn to leave an America that's built to last. And I think we can do it. I'm confident we can do it. I believe it because of what I see in places like Cedar Rapids, what I hear when I meet the folks who are gathered here today. <p>I mean, think about what you've accomplished coming back from those floods. Now, that wasn't a matter of just each person being on their own. It was a matter of everybody pulling together to rebuild a city and make it stronger than it was before. That's how we work. And that FEMA assistance wasn't&mdash;it didn't come out of nowhere. It came around because, as a country, as a United States of America, we decide, you know what, when any part of the country gets in trouble, we're going to step in and help out. That's what we do. <p>This country only exists because generations of Americans worked together and looked out for each other and believed that we're stronger when we rise together. And those values are not Democratic values or Republican values. Those are American values. Those are the values we have to return to. <p>So we're going to keep on moving on American energy. We're going to keep on moving on American manufacturing. We are going to push hard to make sure that American workers have the skills they need to compete. And we're going to make sure that everything we do abides by those core American values that are so important. <p>And I know that if we work together and in common purpose, we can build an economy that gives everybody a fair shot. We can meet this challenge. And we'll remind everybody just why it is the United States of America is the greatest nation on Earth. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"20" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Arizona! Thank you. Well, thank you, everybody. It is good to be in Arizona. The weather is good. You can't have better weather than this. Can't do it. <p>I want to thank Preston for that wonderful introduction. I want to acknowledge a few folks we have with us this afternoon. Mayor Tibshraeny is here. Give him a big round of applause. Mayor Stanton is here. All the tribal leaders who are here today. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Clap your hands for Barack<i>, mi hermano</i>! [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> <i>Mi hermano. Mucho gusto</i>. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Let me say how happy I was to see one particular Arizonan last night: Gabby Giffords. I was able to give her a big hug and just tell her we could not be happy&mdash;more happy to see her. I mean, she just looked gorgeous last night. And she's been an inspiration. Her husband Mark has been just a great friend and a great public servant and a hero to so many of us. And Michelle and I are going to be thinking of her as she continues her recovery here in Arizona. And she loves this State and she loves all of you. So it was wonderful to see her. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Gabby! Gabby! <p>Now last year, I had the chance to tour one of Intel's plants in Oregon. And basically, the engineers explained what happens inside these factories, and I pretended that I understood&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;what they were talking about. No, it's true. We were on this tour, and we were looking through these microscopes, and you'd look at some little spots in the microscope, and you'd say, \\"Well, what's that?\\" And they'd say, \\"Well, that's atoms.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"Really?\\" And it was so remarkable that my Trip Director, who was with me, he said, \\"This stuff's like magic.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"How do they do this?\\" <p>And while I was there, Intel's CEO, Paul Otellini, someone whose advice I rely on as a member of my Jobs Council, announced&mdash;he announced that Intel would be building a new factory here in Arizona. A factory which will turn out some of the fastest and most powerful computer chips on Earth. A factory so big, I'm told that right there is the world's largest land-based crane&mdash;can pull up to, what is it, 4,000 tons? Is that right, Preston? <p><i>Ocotillo Campus Construction Program Manager Preston McDaniel.</i> Yes, sir. <p><i>The President.</i> Four thousand. So not only that, but Paul informs me that the microscopes that they're going to have here will be twice as good as the ones they had&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;up in Oregon. So I decided I had to check this out for myself, because, honestly, first of all, who wants to miss out a chance to see the crane? [<i>Laughter</i>] That thing is huge. <p>But there's a more important reason that I'm here. I'm here because the factory that's being built behind me is an example of an America that is within our reach, an America that attracts the next generation of good manufacturing jobs, an America where we build stuff and make stuff and sell stuff all over the world. <p>We can do that. But we've got to come together. We've got to come together and restore the basic American promise that if you work hard, you can do well enough to raise a family and own a home, send your kids to college, put a little away for retirement, maybe come down to Arizona, where the weather is like this all the time. [<i>Laughter</i>] It never gets above 70 degrees, does it? [<i>Laughter</i>] Look, that's what people are looking for. They don't expect anybody to give them anything, but they want to be able to earn and deserve security, the ability to take care of their families, dignity in their retirement. That's what Americans are looking for. That's what they deserve. <p>Now, we're still recovering from one of the worst economic crises in three generations. We lost nearly 4 million jobs in the 6 months before I took office, another 4 million before our policies had a chance to take full effect. But here's the good news. Over the last 22 months, our businesses have created more than 3 million jobs. Last year, they created the most jobs since 2005. Today, American manufacturers are hiring again and creating jobs for the first time since the 1990s. <p>So our economy is getting stronger, and we've come too far to turn back now. After all that's happened, there are folks in Washington who want to do that, who want to turn back. It's like they're suffering from a case of collective amnesia. [<i>Laughter</i>] They want to go back to the very same policies that got us into this mess, same policies that have stacked the deck against middle class Americans for too many years. A philosophy that says we're better off if everybody is just fending for themselves and everybody can play by their own rules. <p>I'm here to say they're wrong. I don't accept the notion that there's nothing we can do to accept&mdash;to meet our Nation's greatest challenges. There are all kinds of steps we can take. We can't go back to an economy that's weakened by outsourcing and bad debt and phony financial profits. <p>And last night at the State of the Union, I laid out a vision of how we move forward, laid out a blueprint for an economy built to last. It's an economy built on American manufacturing, with more good jobs and more products made in America. It's an economy built on American energy fueled by homegrown and alternative energy sources that make us more secure and less dependent on foreign oil. It's an economy built on the skills of American workers, getting people the education and the training they need so they're prepared for the jobs of today and ready to compete for the jobs of tomorrow. <p>And most importantly, it's an economy that's built on a renewal of American values: hard work, responsibility, the same set of rules for everybody, from Wall Street to Main Street. That has to be our future. That's how we restore the basic American promise. And it starts with manufacturing, both old industries, but also new industries, like Intel. <p>Look at what's happened in the auto industry. On the day I took office, it was on the verge of collapse. Some people said we should let it die. But we had a million jobs at stake, and I refused to let that happen. And so we said to the auto companies, in exchange for help, we're going to demand responsibility. We've got to make sure that the industry retools and restructures. And that's what they did. And over the past 2 years, the entire industry has added nearly 160,000 jobs. GM is number one in the world again. Ford is investing in new plants. Chrysler's on the mend. The American auto industry is back. <p>Now, what's happening in Detroit can happen in other industries. I want it to happen all across Arizona. This project&mdash;thanks to the leadership of Paul and the incredible engineering prowess of Intel&mdash;this project's going to employ thousands of construction workers who will put in more than 10 million hours on the job. When this factory is finished, Intel will employ around a thousand men and women, making the computer chips that power everything from your smart phone to your laptop to your car. <p>As an American, I'm proud of companies like Intel, who create jobs here. We all are. So let's help them grow and hire even faster. We have a huge opportunity to create more high-tech manufacturing jobs in the United States and bring some of these jobs back from overseas. But we're going to have to seize the moment. That starts with changing our tax system. <p>Right now, companies get all kinds of tax breaks when they move jobs and profits overseas. But when a company chooses to stay in America, it gets hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world. That doesn't make sense. We've been talking about changing it for years. Republicans and Democrats have said that doesn't make sense. Well, let's get it done. Let's stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas. Let's reward companies like Intel that are investing and creating jobs right here in the United States of America. <p>Now look, we live in a global economy. If a company wants to do business overseas, of course it's their right. But we shouldn't subsidize it. What we should do are subsidize and help and give tax breaks to companies that are investing here, that bring jobs back from overseas, high-tech manufacturers like Intel. <p>Today my administration is laying out several concrete actions we could take right now that would discourage companies from outsourcing jobs, encourage them to invest in the United States. Congress needs to send me this tax reform. I want to sign it right away, because I want to put more people to work right here in the United States. <p>Now while we're at it, we need to make it easier for American businesses to sell our products all over the world. Two years ago, I set a goal of doubling U.S. exports within 5 years, which will create good, new manufacturing jobs. And we are on track to meet that goal. And soon, thanks to the new trade agreements that I've signed, there are going to be new cars on the streets of other countries that are imported from Detroit and Toledo and Chicago. <p>And we need to invest in education. We want tomorrow's workers&mdash;we want Arizona's workers&mdash;to have the skills they need for the jobs like the ones that will be opening up here. And I have to tell you, I've been to these plants at Intel&mdash;young people, you'd better have done some math before you get in here. [<i>Laughter</i>] There&mdash;you know, you can't just kind of wander in and you didn't do some math in school. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And I want to thank Intel for leading the way, because they're investing in startups, they're supporting science and math education, they're helping to train new engineers. Paul is chairing a project that we initiated through the Jobs Council. We're looking to get thousands more engineers all across America. And for the young people who are out there who are thinking about a profession, think about engineering. We can use more engineers all across America. <p>We're also going to need to look at clean energy and innovation in the energy field. We have&mdash;as I said last night, oil production is higher than it's been in 8 years. We're actually importing less oil as a percentage than any time in the last 16 years. So we're opening up the oil and the gas industry here in the United States. But they don't need subsidies. We need to stop subsidizing oil companies and use that money to invest in clean energies like wind and solar and high-tech batteries. Those are industries that are already creating new jobs and making us even less dependent on foreign oil. <p>And an economy built to last also means we've got to renew American values: fair play, shared responsibility. <p>When it comes to tax policy, my first priority right now is to stop a tax hike on 160 million working Americans at the end of next month. People can't afford losing $40 out of each paycheck. Not right now. Your voices convinced Congress to extend this middle class tax cut before. I need your help again. Let Congress know: Pass this tax cut without drama, without delay. Get it done. It's good for the economy. <p>But in the longer run, we're going to have to both invest in our future&mdash;invest in education so we're producing more engineers, invest in clean energy, invest in our infrastructure&mdash;and we have to do all this at the same time as we've got to get our fiscal house in order. And that means we've got to make choices. <p>Right now, we're supposed to spend nearly a trillion dollars more on what was intended to be a temporary tax cut for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. A quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle class households. Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary. I know because his secretary was at the State of the Union yesterday. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, that just doesn't make any sense. <p>Because we've got to make choices: We could keep those tax breaks for folks like me, or we could keep investing in everything that's going to make this country strong: education and basic research and our military and caring for our veterans. <p>So I've said, let's follow the Buffett rule&mdash;named after Warren: If you make more than a million dollars a year, you should pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent. On the other hand, if you make less than $250,000 a year&mdash;which is 98 percent of you&mdash;your taxes shouldn't go up. And I just want to make clear, the reason I proposed this is not because we begrudge financial success in this country. We strive for it. We encourage it. I want everybody here to be rich. Go out there, work, create new businesses. Fulfill your dreams. But I think asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes is just common sense, especially when we're trying to figure out how to reduce our deficit. <p>And I promise you, look, Warren Buffett will do fine. [<i>Laughter</i>] I will do fine. We don't need more tax breaks. The middle class needs help. They're the ones who've seen wages stall. They're the ones who've seen the cost of everything from groceries to college tuition go up. You're the ones who need a break. <p>Again, we don't begrudge success in America. We encourage it. We aspire to it. When we talk about everybody paying their fair share, it's not because anybody envies the rich. Earlier today, Bill Gates said that he agrees that Americans who can afford it should pay their fair share. I promise you, Bill Gates doesn't envy rich people. [<i>Laughter</i>] He feels pretty comfortable that he's doing okay. It just has to do with basic math. We're going to have to reduce our deficit, and if I get tax breaks that I don't need and the country can't afford, if a Bill Gates or a Warren Buffett get tax breaks that they don't need and can't afford, then one of two things is going to happen. Either it adds to our deficit, or it's going to take away from somebody else, whether it's a senior or a student or a family who's trying to get by. And that's not right. That's not who we are. <p>Each of us is only here because somebody somewhere felt a responsibility to the country and people felt a responsibility to each other, because we understood that we're all in this together. <p>Intel's former CEO, the legendary Andy Grove, he put&mdash;he said it best. He said, look, I feel an obligation to my shareholders. I run a business; they've invested; I've got to make sure they get a good return. That's how the free market works, that's how it's supposed to work, that's what produces the extraordinary wealth of this country. But he also said&mdash;and I'm quoting here&mdash;\\"There is another obligation I feel personally, given that&mdash;given everything I've achieved in my career&mdash;and a lot of what Intel has achieved&mdash;were made possible by a climate of democracy, an economic climate and investment climate provided by the United States.\\" <p>So his argument was, his first obligation to his shareholders, but he also has an obligation to this country that provided extraordinary opportunity. And that's something that all of us feel&mdash;or something that we should all feel. <p>I think Andy Grove was right. This Nation is great because we built it together, because we overcame challenges together. I believe we can do it again. I believe it because we've done it in the past. I believe it because I see it in places like Chandler. I believe it when I talk to folks like you. I know this country exists only because generations of Americans have worked hard, have fulfilled their responsibilities, have cared for their families, but they've also cared for their communities, and they've also looked out for each other. They've lived out the idea that we're in this together. <p>These values are not Democratic values or Republican values, they're American values. We've got to return to those values. It's our turn to be responsible. It's our turn to leave an America that's built to last. <p>So we're going to keep moving on American manufacturing. We are going to keep moving on American energy. We are going to keep making sure that American workers get the skills they need. We are going to invest in American innovation and basic science and research. We are going to make sure that we are training those engineers that we need. We are going to make sure that we return to the values of fair play and responsibility. <p>And I know that if we work together with common purpose, we can build an economy that gives everybody a fair shot. We can meet this challenge, and we'll remind the world once again just why the United States of America is the greatest nation on Earth. <p>Thank you very much, Arizona. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"21" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Nevada! It is great to be back in Las Vegas. <p><i>Audience member.</i> I love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. [<i>Laughter</i>] Although I always say, when we stay here for the night, I've got to watch my staff to make sure that they get on the plane when we leave. [<i>Laughter</i>] Sometimes they conveniently miss the flight. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But everybody please have a seat, have a seat. It is great to see you. Joe, thanks for the introduction. Scott, thank you and the folks at UPS for hosting us today. I want to thank all of the elected officials and the tribal leaders who took the time to join us. <p>Before I get into the core of my remarks, I just want to mention something that I said to Scott and I said to Joe, and that is that UPS, I think, deserves just extraordinary credit for being the best in its space, one of the best businesses we have in the United States. But the reason is because it's got such outstanding workers, and the relationship between its workforce and management, cooperating, constantly figuring out how to make things better&mdash;it is just an outstanding organization. And so you guys all need to be congratulated for everything that you do. <p>Now, I'm here to talk a little more about what I talked about at the State of the Union on Tuesday night. And what I want to focus on is how we're going to restore the basic promise of America, something that folks at UPS understand, which is, if you work hard, if you do the right thing, you should be able to do well enough to raise a family and own a home and send your kids to college and put a little away for retirement. That's the American Dream. That's what most people are looking for. <p>They don't expect a handout. They don't expect anything to come easy. They do expect, if they're willing to work hard, to try to get ahead. If they're doing the right thing, then they can have a sense of security and dignity and help make sure that their family is moving forward. That's what Americans are looking for. That's what Americans deserve. <p>And today, 3 years after the worst economic storm in three generations, our economy is growing again. Our businesses have created more than 3 million jobs. Last year, businesses created the most jobs since 2005. American manufacturers are hiring again and creating jobs for the first time since the 1990s. <p>Now, we've got more work to do. But what we can't do is go back to the very same policies that got us into a mess in the first place. We can't go backwards. We have to move forward. I said on Tuesday, and I will repeat today, we will not&mdash;we cannot&mdash;go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing and bad debt and phony financial profits. So on Tuesday, at the State of the Union, I laid out my vision for how we move forward. I laid out a blueprint for an economy that's built to last, that has a firm foundation, where we're making stuff and selling stuff and moving it around and UPS drivers are dropping things off everywhere. <p>That's the economy we want, an economy built on American manufacturing with more good jobs and more products made here in the United States of America; an economy built on American energy, fueled by homegrown and alternative sources that make us more secure and less dependent on foreign oil; an economy built on the skills of American workers, getting people the education and the training they need to prepare for the jobs of today, but also to compete for the jobs of tomorrow. <p>And most importantly, I talked about an economy that's built on a renewal of American values: hard work, responsibility, and the same set of rules for everybody, from Wall Street to Main Street. That has to be our future. That's how we restore that basic American promise. <p>Now, part of my blueprint and what I want to focus on a little bit today is for an economy built to last with American energy. That's why we're here. For decades, Americans have been talking about how do we decrease our dependence on foreign oil. Well, my administration is actually begun to do something about it. <p>Over the last 3 years, we negotiated the toughest new efficiency standards for cars and trucks in history. We've opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration. Right now, American oil production is the highest that it's been in 8 years&mdash;8 years. Last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of last the 16 years. That hasn't gotten a lot of attention, but that's important. We're moving in the right direction when it comes to oil and gas production. <p>And today I'm announcing that my administration will soon open up around 38 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico for additional exploration and development, which could result in a lot more production of domestic energy. <p>But as I said on Tuesday, and as the folks here at UPS understand, even with all this oil production, we only have about 2 percent of the world's oil reserves. So we've got to have an all-out, all-in, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every source of American energy, a strategy that is cleaner and cheaper and full of new jobs. <p>Now, a great place to start is with natural gas. Some of you may not have been following this, but because of new technologies, because we can now access natural gas that we couldn't access before in a economic way, we've got a supply of natural gas under our feet that can last America nearly a hundred years&mdash;nearly a hundred years. Now, when I say under our feet, I don't know that there's actually gas right here, but&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I mean in all the United States. <p>And developing it could power our cars and our homes and our factories in a cleaner and cheaper way. The experts believe it could support more than 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade. We, it turns out, are the Saudi Arabia of natural gas. We've got a lot of it. We've got a lot of it. <p>Now, removing that natural gas obviously has to be done carefully. And I know that there are families that are worried about the impact this could have on our environment and on the health of our communities. And I share that concern. So that's why I'm requiring, for the first time ever, that all companies drilling for gas on public lands disclose the chemicals they use. We want to make sure that this is done properly and safely. America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our citizens at risk. <p>But we've got to keep at it. We've got to take advantage of this incredible natural resource. And think about what could happen if we do. Think about an America where more cars and trucks are running on domestic natural gas than on foreign oil. Think about an America where our companies are leading the world in developing natural gas technology and creating a generation of new energy jobs, where our natural gas resources are helping make our manufacturers more competitive for decades. We can do this. And by the way, natural gas burns cleaner than oil does, so it's also potentially good for our environment as we make this shift. <p>So last April, we issued a challenge to shipping companies like UPS. We said, if you upgrade your fleets to run on less oil or no oil at all, we're going to help you succeed. We want to help you with that experiment. So we started out with five companies that accepted the challenge. And of course, UPS was one of the first. That's how they roll. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So less than a year later, we've got 14 companies on board, and together, they represent 1 million vehicles on the road. That's a lot of trucks. <p>We should do more, though. And that's why we're here today. First, let's get more of these natural gas vehicles on the road. Let's get more of them on the road. The Federal fleet of cars is leading by example. Turns out the Federal Government has a lot of cars. [<i>Laughter</i>] We buy a lot of cars. So we've got to help not only the Federal Government but also local governments upgrade their fleet. If more of these brown trucks are going green, more city buses should too. There's no reason why buses can't go in the same direction. <p>Second, let's offer new tax incentives to help companies buy more clean trucks like these. <p>Third, let's make sure all these new trucks that are running on natural gas have places to refuel. That's one of the biggest impediments, is the technology. We know how to make these trucks, but if they don't have a place to pull in and fill up, they got problems. <p>So we're going to keep working with the private sector to develop up to five natural gas corridors along our highways. These are highways that have natural gas fueling stations between cities, just like the one that folks at UPS, South Coast Air, and Clean Energy Fuels are opening today between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City. That's a great start. So now one of these trucks can go from Long Beach all the way to Salt Lake City. And they're going to be able to refuel along the way. <p>And finally, to keep America on the cutting edge of clean energy technology, I want my Energy Secretary, Steven Chu, to launch a new competition that encourages our country's brightest scientists and engineers and entrepreneurs to discover new breakthroughs for natural gas vehicles. <p>So we're going to keep moving on American energy. We're going to keep boosting American manufacturing. We're going to keep training our workers for these new jobs. But an economy that's built to last also means a renewal of the values that made us who we are: hard work, fair play, and shared responsibility. <p>Now, right now that means, first of all, stopping a tax hike on a hundred and sixty million working Americans at the end of next month. People cannot afford right now losing $40 out of each paycheck. Your voices convinced Congress to extend this middle class tax cut before. I need your help to make sure they do it again. No drama, no delay. Let's just get this done for the American people and for our economy as a whole. <p>But we've got a longer run issue&mdash;Scott and I were talking about this before we came out&mdash;and that is, how do we get America's fiscal house in order? And we're going to have to make some choices. The reason that we've got these debts and deficit is because we're not making hard choices. Right now we're supposed to spend nearly $1 trillion more on what was intended to be a temporary tax cut for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans&mdash;supposed to be temporary, back in 2001. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's a long time ago. [<i>Laughter</i>] A quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle class households. Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary. I know because she was at the State of the Union. [<i>Laughter</i>] She told me. <p>Now, that's not fair. That doesn't make sense. And the reason it's important for us to recognize that is, if we're going to reduce our deficit, then we've got to have a balanced approach that has spending cuts. And we've already agreed to $2 trillion worth of spending cuts. We got to get rid of programs that don't work. We've got to make Government more efficient. I have asked Congress for authority to consolidate some of these agencies to make them run better. We're going to have to be much more effective when it comes to Government spending. We all acknowledge that, and we're making progress on that front. <p>But that alone doesn't do it. So if we want to actually deal with the deficit, we've got to look at the other side of the ledger. Do we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Or do we want to keep investing in everything else, like education, like clean energy, like a strong military, like caring for our veterans who are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan? We can't do both. We can't do both. <p>So what I've said is let's follow the Buffett rule: If you make more than a million dollars a year, you should pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent, which, by the way, is lower than you would have been paying under Ronald Reagan. Nobody's talking about anything crazy here. On the other hand, if you make less than $250,000 a year, which 98 percent of all Americans do, then your taxes shouldn't go up. That's a&mdash;I think that's a fair approach. <p>And a lot of folks have been running around saying, well, that's class warfare. Asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes, that's just common sense. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I promise you, if we make this change, Warren Buffett will be doing fine. [<i>Laughter</i>] I will be doing fine. Scott will be doing fine. We don't need more tax breaks. You're the ones who have seen your wages and your incomes stall while the cost of everything from groceries to college to health care have been going up. You're the ones who deserve a break. <p>And I want to make one last point: We do not begrudge success in America. We aspire to it. We want everybody to succeed. We want everybody to be rich. We want everybody to be working hard, making their way, creating new products, creating new services, creating jobs. That's the American way. We don't shy away from financial success. We don't apologize for it. <p>But what we do say is when this Nation has done so much for us, shouldn't we be thinking about the country as a whole? When Americans talk about folks like me paying their fair share of taxes, it's not because they envy the rich. Just yesterday Bill Gates said he agrees with me that most&mdash;that Americans who can afford it should pay their fair share. I promise you, Bill Gates does not envy the rich. [<i>Laughter</i>] He doesn't envy wealthy people. <p>This has nothing to do with envy. It has everything to do with math. It's what I talked about earlier. We've got to make choices. Americans understand, if I get a tax break I don't need and a tax break the country can't afford, then one of two things are going to happen. Either it's going to add to our deficit, right? Or somebody else is going to have to make up the difference. <p>A senior suddenly is going to have to start paying more for their Medicare, or a student is going to have to pay more for their student loan, or a family that's trying to get by, they're going to have to do with less. And that's not right. That's not who we are. Each of us is only here because somebody somewhere felt a responsibility to each other and to our country and helped to create all this incredible opportunity that we call the United States of America. <p>Now, it's our turn to be responsible. And it's our turn to leave an America that is built to last for the next generation. That's our job, and we can do it. We can do it. We can do it. And I know we can do it because I've seen in States like Nevada and with people like you that I meet all across this country, you understand the history of this country, generations of Americans working together, looking out for each other, living by the idea that we rise or fall together. Those are the values we have to return to. <p>I mentioned praise for our military at the State of the Union and the incredible work that they do. And the reason our military is so good, the reason why they're so admired is because they&mdash;it's not like everybody in the military agrees on everything. You got Democrats in the military. You got Republicans in the military. You've got folks who are conservative or liberal, different races, different religions, different backgrounds, but they figure out how to focus on the mission. They figure out how to do their job. <p>And that sense of common purpose is what we're going to need to build an economy that lasts. And if we work together in common purpose, we can build that economy and we can meet the challenges of our times. And we'll remind the entire world once again just why it is that the United States is the greatest country on Earth. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\" "
"22" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! Hello, Team Buckley! It is great to be here. Everybody please have a seat, have a seat. <p>Al, thank you for that introduction and for your years of service. I brought a few folks with me here today: the Secretary of the Air Force, Michael Donley; the Secretary of the Navy, Ray Mabus, is here; our Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy Planning, Sharon Burke, is in the house. They are all doing great work with Secretary Panetta to keep our military the strongest in the world and to make our military more energy efficient. <p>I want to thank our host, Colonel Dant, for welcoming us here today. Lieutenant Governor Joe Garcia is here as well. Give him a round of applause. And the mayor of the great city of Denver, Michael Hancock is here as well. You'll notice they have the same hairdo. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And of course, we've got some outstanding men and women in uniform from Buckley Air Force Base. And that includes the 460th Space Wing. To all of you, on behalf of a grateful nation, I want to thank you for your extraordinary service. <p>During a decade of war, these folks, so many of you, exhibited the very best of America: courage, selflessness, teamwork. As I said this past Tuesday, you've exceeded all expectations, because you focus on your mission. You work together. You get the job done. <p>And so on Tuesday, I talked about the job we've got to get done as a nation&mdash;all of us&mdash;the job of restoring the American promise, the idea that if you work hard, if you fulfill your responsibilities, then you can do well enough to raise a family and own a home, send your kids to college, put a little away for retirement, live out that American Dream. <p>That's what most people are reaching for. They don't expect a handout. They don't expect anything to come easy. But they do expect if they're applying themselves, if they're working hard, if they're able to overcome setbacks and obstacles and they can cooperate with the folks they're working with, if they're doing the right thing, then they should be able to achieve some security and some dignity in their lives. Something very basic&mdash;it's a basic promise that we've got to restore. <p>So at the State of the Union, I tried to lay out my vision for how we would do that. I laid out a blueprint for an economy that's built to last. It's an economy built on American manufacturing, more good jobs and products made here in the United States that we're selling all around the world. <p>It's an economy built on American energy, fueled on homegrown and alternative energy sources that make us more secure and less dependent on foreign oil, which obviously is not just good for our prosperity, but also for our security. We all know that. It's an economy built on the skills of American workers, getting people the education and the training that they need so that they're prepared for the jobs of today and ready to compete for the jobs of tomorrow. <p>And most importantly, it's an economy that's built on a renewal of American values: hard work, responsibility, and the sense that the same rules apply to everybody, from Wall Street to Main Street. <p>That's also part of what makes our military so strong. Doesn't matter if you're a general, you're a private. There are some rules you got to follow. That has to be our future. That's how we restore that basic American promise. <p>Now, today we've been focusing on American energy. For all our lives, America has been talking about decreasing our dependence on foreign oil. I've been hearing it&mdash;I'm older than most of you guys&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I've been hearing it all my life. Well, my administration has actually tried to do something about it. <p>Over the last 3 years, we negotiated the toughest new efficiency standards for cars and trucks in history. That will save us and consumers billions of gallons of gas and a lot of money. We've opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration here in the United States. Right now, American oil production is the highest it's been in 8 years&mdash;8 years. <p>Last year, we relied less on foreign oil than any time in the past 16 years. Hasn't gotten a lot of attention, but it's important. We're moving in the right direction when it comes to oil and gas production. <p>But we've got to do more, because even if we tapped every drop of domestic oil, we've only got 2 percent of the world's oil reserves. We've got to have an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy, develop every available source of America energy, and it's got to be a strategy that is cleaner and cheaper and will create all kinds of new jobs. <p>So this morning I was in Nevada talking about how natural gas is a enormous energy source for the United States. We are the Saudi Arabia of oil&mdash;or Saudi Arabia of natural gas. We've just got to develop it, and if we do, effectively, then we're going to create jobs and it's going to power trucks that are cleaner and cheaper and factories that are cleaner and cheaper. <p>The same promise is true for clean energy. Because of Federal investments, renewable energy use&mdash;sources like wind and solar&mdash;has nearly doubled. Thousands of Americans have jobs because of those efforts. <p>So as I said on Tuesday, I'm not going to walk away from the promise of clean energy. We're not going to cede the wind industry or the solar industry or the battery industry to China or Germany because we're too timid to make that same commitment here in the United States. We subsidized oil for a very long time, long enough. It's time to stop giving taxpayer giveaways to an industry that's never been more profitable. We've got to double down on a clean energy industry that's never been more promising. And Congress is going to need to act. <p>They need to pass clean energy tax credits. They need to set a clean energy standard so that we create a market for innovation. These are the industries of the future, and they're the jobs of the future. <p>So this is common sense. But we're not going to wait for Congress. We're also going to do some things administratively. It's why I'm directing my administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public lands to power 3 million homes. And the reason we're at Buckley is because the military is doing its part. The military is doing its part, as usual&mdash;as usual. Now, it's important for the military to do its part because we're the largest&mdash;our military is the largest energy consumer in the world. So we can set a good example and help create an additional market for clean energy. The Navy is going to purchase enough clean energy capacity to power a quarter of a million homes a year. And it won't cost taxpayers a dime. <p>What does it mean? It means that the world's largest consumer of energy&mdash;the Department of Defense&mdash;is making one of the largest commitments to clean energy in history. That will grow this market, it will strengthen our energy security. <p>And I promise you, the Department of Defense is not just embracing clean energy because it feels good. [<i>Laughter</i>] We got some tough-minded folks. Our number-one priority is always the security of this Nation. But what our military understands is that if we're smart on energy, that saves DOD budgets that allow them to do a whole bunch of other things. <p>Leading on this issue is the right thing to do. Yes, it's the right thing to do to prevent climate change. Yes, it's the right thing to do in terms of reducing pollution. But it's also important for our national security. <p>Ray Mabus has said, \\"We wouldn't allow some of the places that we buy fossil fuels from to build our ships or to build our aircrafts, to build our ground equipment. We wouldn't do that. And yet we give them say on whether those ships sail or whether those aircrafts fly or whether those vehicles run, because we buy fuel from them.\\" Why would we do that if we don't have to? The less we depend on foreign oil, the more secure we become as a nation. <p>That's why in December, the Navy made the single largest purchase of biofuel in Government history. This summer, that fuel will power ships and subs during the world's largest naval exercise. By the way, 2 years ago, I got a chance to see a Navy F-18 Green Hornet that flies on biofuel. It was a pretty impressive sight. They wouldn't let me fly it. [<i>Laughter</i>] But it was impressive to see. <p>The rest of the military, including here at Buckley, is doing its part as well. In 2010, you started installing thousands of solar panels here on the base. That same year, the Air Force flew an A-10 Thunderbolt entirely on alternative fuels, a first for the military. Overall, the Air Force is on track to save $500 million in fuel costs over the next 5 years because you guys have changed the way you operate. Think about that: half a billion dollars. [<i>Applause</i>] Yeah, that's worth clapping. <p>Reducing our dependence on oil is going to strengthen our national security. It will make our environment cleaner for our kids. It will make energy cheaper for our businesses and for our families. And doubling down on a clean energy industry will create lots of jobs in the process. <p>So we're going to keep moving on American energy. We're going to stay focused on boosting American manufacturing. We're going to keep training our workers so that they are equipped for the high-skill jobs of tomorrow, including in the clean energy space. And we're going to restore those American values of fair play and responsibility that made us who we are. <p>We've got to follow the lead of the members of our military who are here today. You rise or fall as one unit, serving one nation. You have each other's backs. That's the same spirit that you'll find in communities all over America. Each of us is here only because somebody was looking out for us. Not just our parents, but we had neighbors and communities and churches and synagogues, people who were coaching Little League. And we had a country that was investing in community colleges and universities and research and caring for our vets. Everybody was taking responsibility for each other and for our country, as well as for ourselves. <p>Somebody had our back. Otherwise we wouldn't have been successful. Certainly I wouldn't have been. This country exists because generations of Americans worked together and looked out for each other. Out of many, we came together as one. These are the values we have to return to. That's how we're going to create an economy that is built to last. That's how we're going to make sure that we have the best energy policy in the world. That's how we're going to put people back to work. That's how we're going to continue to make sure we have the finest military in the history of the world. <p>If we work together in common purpose, nobody can stop us. We will rebuild this economy. We will meet these challenges. We'll remind everybody why the United States is the greatest country on Earth. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "

[<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Oh, oh, come on. They're trying to draft you for President. [<i>Laughter</i>] He's got to graduate before he runs for President. [<i>Laughter</i>] There's an age limit. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Well, it is wonderful to be here. I want to thank all of you for coming out this morning. I know for folks in college, this is still really early. I remember those days. It is good home&mdash;good to be in the home of the Sugar Bowl champion Wolverines. And with Denard Robinson coming back, this will be a team to be reckoned with. I understand your basketball team is pretty good this year too. All right. Go Blue! It's always good to start with a easy applause line. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Look, the reason I'm here today&mdash;in addition to meeting Denard Robinson&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;is to talk with all of you about what most of you do here every day, and that is to think about how you can gain the skills and the training you need to succeed in this 21st-century economy. And this is going to be one of the most important issues that not just you face, but this entire country faces. How can we make sure that everybody is getting the kind of education they need to personally succeed, but also to build up this Nation, because in this economy, there is no greater predictor of individual success than a good education. <p>Today, the unemployment rate for Americans with a college degree or more is about half the national average. Their incomes are twice as high as those who don't have a high school diploma. College is the single most important investment you can make in your future, and I'm proud that all of you are making that investment. <p>And the degree you earn from Michigan will be the best tool you have to achieve that basic American promise, the idea that if you work hard, if you are applying yourself, if you are doing the right thing, you can do it well enough to raise a family and own a home and send your own kids to college, put away a little for retirement, create products or services, be part of something that is adding value to this country and maybe changing the world. That's what you're striving for. That's what the American Dream is all about. <p>And how we keep that promise alive is the defining issue of our time. I don't want to be in a country where we only are looking at success for a small group of people. We want a country where everybody has a chance&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;where everybody has a chance. We don't want to become a country where a shrinking number of Americans do really well while a growing number barely get by. That's not the future we want. Not the future I want for you, it's not the future I want for my daughters. I want this to be a big, bold, generous country where everybody gets a fair shot, everybody is doing their fair share, everybody is playing by the same set of rules. That's the America I know. That's the America I want to keep. That's the future within our reach. <p>Now, in the State of the Union on Tuesday, I laid out a blueprint that gets us there. Blueprint&mdash;it's blue&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that's no coincidence; I planned it that way, Michigan&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;a blueprint for an economy that's built to last. <p>It's an economy built on new American manufacturing, because Michigan is all about making stuff. If there's anybody in America who can teach us how to bring back manufacturing, it is the great State of Michigan. <p>On the day I took office, with the help of folks like Debbie Stabenow, your Senator, and Carl Levin and John Conyers&mdash;the American auto industry was on the verge of collapse. And some politicians were willing to let it just die. We said no. We believe in the workers of this State. I believe in American ingenuity. We placed our bets on the American auto industry, and today, the American auto industry is back. Jobs are coming back, 160,000 jobs. <p>And to bring back even more jobs, I want this Congress to stop rewarding companies that are shipping jobs and profits overseas, start rewarding companies who are hiring here and investing here and creating good jobs here in Michigan and here in the United States of America. <p>So our first step is rebuilding American manufacturing. And by the way, not all the jobs that have gone overseas are going to come back. We have to be realistic. And technology means that a larger and larger portion of you will work in the service sector as engineers and computer scientists. [<i>Applause</i>] There you go. We got the engineering school&mdash;there you go&mdash;and entrepreneurs. So there's going to be a lot of activity in the service sector. But part of my argument, part of the argument of Michigan's congressional delegation is that when manufacturing does well, then the entire economy does well. <p>The service sector does well if manufacturing is doing well, so we've got to make sure that America isn't just buying stuff, but we're also selling stuff, all around the world, products stamped with those three proud words: Made in America. <p>An economy built to last is also one where we control our energy needs. We don't let foreign countries control our energy supplies. Right now America is producing more of our own oil than we were 8 years ago. That's good news. As a percentage, we're actually importing less than any time in the last 16 years. <p>But&mdash;I think young people especially understand this&mdash;no matter how much oil we produce, we've only got 2 percent of the world's oil reserves. And that means we've got to focus on clean, renewable energy. We've got to have a strategy that, yes, is producing our own oil and natural gas. But we've also got to develop wind and solar and biofuels. And that is good for our economy. It creates jobs. But it's also good for our environment. It's also&mdash;makes sure that this planet is sustainable. That's part of the future that you deserve. We've subsidized oil companies for a century. That's long enough. Congress needs to stop giving taxpayer dollars to an oil industry that's never been more profitable and double down on a clean energy future that's never been more promising. <p>I don't want to cede the wind or the solar or the battery industry to China or Germany because we were too timid, we didn't have the imagination to make the same commitment here. And I want those jobs created here in the United States of America. And I also want us to think about energy efficiency, making sure&mdash;we've already doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars. Part of Detroit coming back is creating more fuel-efficient cars here in Michigan&mdash;and more fuel-efficient trucks. And we've got to revamp our buildings to make them more fuel efficient. And we&mdash;if we are focused on this, we can control our energy future. That's part of creating an America that's built to last. <p>And we've got to have an economy in which every American has access to a world-class higher education, the kind you are getting right here at the University of Michigan. My grandfather got the chance to go to college because this country decided that every returning veteran of World War II should be able to afford it. My mother was able to raise two kids by herself because she was able to get grants and work her way through school. I am only standing here today because scholarships and student loans gave me a shot at a decent education. Michelle and I can still remember how long it took us to pay back our student loans. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member.</i> Tell the First Lady we wish her happy birthday! <p><i>The President.</i> I will tell Michelle you said happy birthday. <p>But I just want all of you to understand, your President and your First Lady were in your shoes not that long ago. [<i>Laughter</i>] We didn't come from wealthy families. The only reason that we were able to achieve what we were able to achieve was because we got a great education. That's the only reason. And we could not have done that unless we lived in a country that made a commitment to opening up opportunity to all people. <p>The point is, this country has always made a commitment to put a good education within the reach of all who are willing to work for it, and that's part of what helped to create this economic miracle and build the largest middle class in history. <p>And this precedes even college. I mean, we were&mdash;we helped to begin the movement in industrialized countries to create public schools, public high schools, understanding that as people are moving from an agricultural sector to an industrial sector, they were going to need training. Now we've moved to an information age, a digitalized age, a global economy. We've got to make that same commitment today. <p>Now, we still have, by far, the best network of colleges and universities in the world. Nobody else comes close. [<i>Applause</i>] Nobody else comes close. But the challenge is, it's getting tougher and tougher to afford it. Since most of you were born, tuition and fees have more than doubled. That forces students like you to take out more loans and rack up more debt. In 2010, graduates who took out loans left college owing an average of $24,000. That's an average. Are you waving because you owe $24,000 or&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>Student loan debt has now surpassed credit card debt for the first time ever. Think about that. That's inexcusable. In the coming decade, 60 percent of new jobs will require more than a high school diploma. Higher education is not a luxury. It's an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford. And when I say higher education, I don't just mean 4-year colleges and universities, I also mean our community colleges and providing lifelong learning for workers who may need to retrain for jobs when the economy shifts. All those things cost money, and it's harder and harder to afford. So we've got to do something to help families be able to afford&mdash;and students to be able to afford&mdash;this higher education. We've all got a responsibility here. <p>Thanks to the hard work of Secretary Duncan, my administration is increasing Federal student aid so more students can afford college. And one of the things I'm proudest of, with the help of all these Members of Congress, we won a tough fight to stop handing out tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies to banks that issue student loans and shift that money to where it should go, directly to the students and to the families who need it. <p>Tens of billions of dollars that were going to subsidies for banks are now going to students in the form of more grants and lower rates on loans. We've capped student loan payments so that nearly 1.6 million students, including a bunch of you, are only going to have to pay 10 percent of your monthly income towards your loans once you graduate&mdash;10 percent of your monthly income. <p>So that's what we've been doing. Now Congress has to do more. Congress needs to do more. They need to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling this July. That's what's scheduled to happen if Congress doesn't act. That would not be good for you. [<i>Laughter</i>] So you should let your Members of Congress know: Don't do that. Don't do it. [<i>Applause</i>] Don't do it. <p>They need to extend the tuition tax credit that we've put in place that's saving some of you and millions of folks all across the country thousands of dollars. And Congress needs to give more young people the chance to earn their way through college by doubling the number of work-study jobs in the next 5 years. <p>So the administration has a job to do. Congress has a job to do. But it's not just enough to increase student aid, and you can imagine why. Look, we can't just keep on subsidizing skyrocketing tuition. If tuition is going up faster than inflation, faster than even health care is going up, no matter how much we subsidize it, sooner or later, we're going to run out of money. And that means that others have to do their part. Colleges and universities need to do their part to keep costs down as well. <p>Recently, I spoke with a group of college presidents who've done just that. Here at Michigan, you've done a lot to find savings in your budget. We know this is possible. So from now on, I'm telling Congress we should steer Federal campus-based aid to those colleges that keep tuition affordable, provide good value, serve their students well. We are putting colleges on notice. You can't keep&mdash;you can't assume that you'll just jack up tuition every single year. If you can't stop tuition from going up, then the funding you get from taxpayers each year will go down. We should push colleges to do better. We should hold them accountable if they don't. <p>Now, States also have to do their part. I was talking to your president&mdash;and this is true all across the country&mdash;States have to do their part by making higher education a higher priority in their budgets. Last year, over 40 States cut their higher education spending&mdash;40 States cut their higher education budget. And we know that these State budget cuts have been the largest factor in tuition increases at public colleges over the past decade. <p>So we're challenging States: Take responsibility as well on this issue. What we're doing is, today we're going to launch a Race to the Top for college affordability. We're telling the States, if you can find new ways to bring down the cost of college and make it easier for more students to graduate, we'll help you do it. We will give you additional Federal support if you are doing a good job of making sure that all of you aren't loaded up with debt when you graduate from college. <p>And finally, today I'm also calling for a new report card for colleges. Parents like getting report cards. I know you guys may not always look forward to it. [<i>Laughter</i>] But we parents, we like to know what you're doing. From now on, parents and students deserve to know how a college is doing, how affordable is it, how well are its students doing. We want you to know how well a car stacks up before you buy it. You should know how well a college stacks up. <p>We call this&mdash;one of the things that we're doing at the Consumer Finance Protection board that I just set up with Richard Cordray is to make sure that young people understand the financing of colleges. He calls it \\"Know Before You Owe\\"&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;\\"Know Before You Owe.\\" So we want to push more information out so consumers can make good choices, so you as consumers of higher education understand what it is that you're getting. <p>The bottom line is that an economy built to last demands we keep doing everything we can to bring down the cost of college. That goes along with strengthening American manufacturing. It means we keep on investing in American energy. It means we double down on the clean energy that's creating jobs across this state and guaranteeing your generation a better future. <p>And you know what else it means? It means that we renew the American values of fair play and shared responsibility&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;shared responsibility. <p>I talked about this at the State of the Union. We've got to make sure that as we're paying for the investments of the future that everybody is doing their part, that we're looking out for middle class families and not just those at the top. Right&mdash;the first thing that means is making sure taxes don't go up on 160 million working Americans at the end of next month. People can't afford to lose $40 out of every paycheck. Not right now. Students who are working certainly can't afford it. <p>Your voices encouraged and ultimately convinced Congress to extend the payroll tax cut for two months. Now we've got to extend it for the whole year. I need your help to get it done again. Tell them to pass this tax cut, without drama, without delay. Get it done. It's good for the economy. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Four more years! Yes we can! <p><i>The President.</i> Okay. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, in the longer run, we're also going to have to reduce our deficit. We've got to invest in our future and we've got to reduce our deficit. And to do both, we've got to make some choices. Let me give you some examples. <p>Right now we're scheduled to spend nearly one trillion more dollars on what was intended to be a temporary tax cut for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. <p><i>Audience member.</i> That's not fair. <p><i>The President.</i> That's not fair. A quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle class households. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> Not fair. Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary. I know because she was at the State of the Union. She told me. [<i>Laughter</i>] Is that fair? <p><i>Audience members.</i> No! <p><i>The President.</i> Does it make sense to you? <p><i>Audience members.</i> No! <p><i>The President.</i> Do we want to keep these tax cuts for folks like me who don't need them? Or do we want to invest in the things that will help us in the long term, like student loans and grants and a strong military and care for our veterans and basic research? <p>Those are the choices we've got to make. We can't do everything. We can't reduce our deficit and make the investments we need at the same time and keep tax breaks for folks who don't need them and weren't even asking for them. Well, some of them were asking for them. I wasn't asking for them. [<i>Laughter</i>] We've got to choose. <p>When it comes to paying our fair share, I believe we should follow the Buffett rule: If you make more than $1 million a year&mdash;and I hope a lot of you do after you graduate&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;then you should pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent. On the other hand, if you decide to go into a less lucrative profession, if you decide to become a teacher&mdash;and we need teachers&mdash;if you decide to go into public service, if you decide to go into a helping profession, if you make less than $250,000 a year, which 98 percent of Americans do, then your taxes shouldn't go up. <p>This is part of the idea of shared responsibility. I know a lot of folks have been running around calling this class warfare. I think asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes is just common sense. Yesterday Bill Gates said he doesn't think people like him are paying enough in taxes. I promise you, Warren Buffett is doing fine, Bill Gates is doing fine, I'm doing fine. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Koch brothers. <p><i>The President.</i> They're definitely doing fine. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We don't need more tax breaks. There are a lot of families out there who are struggling, who have seen their wages stall, and the cost of everything from a college education to groceries and food have gone up. You're the ones who need that. You're the ones who need help. And we can't do both. <p>There have been some who have been saying, well, the only reason you're saying that is because you're trying to stir people up, make them envious of the rich. People don't envy the rich. When people talk about me paying my fair share of taxes or Bill Gates or Warren Buffett paying their fair share, the reason that they're talking about it is because they understand that when I get a tax break that I don't need, that the country can't afford, then one of two things are going to happen. Either the deficit will go up, and ultimately, you guys are going to have to pay for it. Or alternatively, somebody else is going to foot the bill, some senior who suddenly has to pay more for their Medicare, or some veteran who's not getting the help that they need readjusting after they have defended this country, or some student who's suddenly having to pay higher interest rates on their student loans. <p>We do not begrudge wealth in this country. I want everybody here to do well. We aspire to financial success. But we also understand that we're not successful just by ourselves. We're successful because somebody started the University of Michigan. We're successful because somebody made an investment in all the Federal research labs that created the Internet. We're successful because we have an outstanding military; that costs money. We're successful because somebody built roads and bridges and laid broadband lines. And these things didn't just happen on their own. <p>And if we all understand that we've got to pay for this stuff, it makes sense for those of us who've done best to do our fair share. And to try to pass off that bill onto somebody else, that's not right. That's not who we are. That's not what my grandparents' generation worked hard to pass down. That's not what your grandparents and your great-grandparents worked hard to pass down. We've got a different idea of America, a more generous America. <p>Everybody here is only here because somebody somewhere down the road decided we're going to think not just about ourselves, but about the future. We've got responsibilities, yes, to ourselves, but also to each other. And now it's our turn to be responsible. Now it's our turn to leave an America that's built to last. And I know we can do it. We've done it before and I know we can do it again because of you. <p>When I meet young people all across this country, with energy and drive and vision, despite the fact that you've come of age during a difficult, tumultuous time in this world, it gives me hope. You inspire me. You're here at Michigan because you believe in your future. You're working hard. You're putting in long hours, hopefully, some at the library. [<i>Laughter</i>] Some of you are balancing a job at the same time. You know that doing big things isn't always easy, but you're not giving up. <p>You've got the whole world before you. And you embody that sense of possibility that is quintessentially American. We do not shrink from challenges. We stand up to them. And we don't leave people behind; we make sure everybody comes along with us on this journey that we're on. <p>That's the spirit right now that we need, Michigan. Here in America, we don't give up. We look out for each other. We make sure everybody has a chance to get ahead. And if we work in common purpose, with common resolve, we can build an economy that gives everybody a fair shot. And we will remind the world just why it is that the United States of America is the greatest nation on Earth. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you.\" "
"24" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. All right, everybody have a seat. Now, let me begin by saying I was told that on a CD that I've just received&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that all of you participated in a rendition of Al Green. [<i>Laughter</i>] What I did not realize was that you also had a reverend who can preach as good as Al Green in John Larson. So I kept on looking for the collection plate getting passed. [<i>Laughter</i>] But, John, thank you for that rousing introduction. <p>To the leader of this august body and soon to be, once again, Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi; to the rest of the leadership team: Steny Hoyer, Jim Clyburn, Xavier Becerra, and the best possible chair we could have for the DNC, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, we've got an all-star team assembled and ready to get to work. <p>I know that you guys have been here quite a bit. You already had to suffer through a relatively long speech from me this week, so I'm not going to speak too long. What I wanted to do, first of all, was just say thank you. <p>So many of you have served this country, your districts, for years, through good times and through bad times. And let's face it, public service doesn't always get the credit that it deserves. But knowing each and every one of you personally, understanding the sacrifices that you and your family members&mdash;some who are here today&mdash;make each and every day, understanding how much your heart bleeds when you see constituents are going through a tough time and how much you want to make sure that Government serves as a force for good in their lives, I just want to say thank you for everything that you do. <p>You guys are putting it all on the line because you believe in an America in which everybody gets a fair shot and everybody does their fair share and everybody plays by the same set of rules. That's what you have been about, that's what this caucus is about, and that's the vision that we're fighting for&mdash;this year and in years to come. <p>Now, as I said at the State of the Union, the critical debate in this country right now, the defining question that faces all of us, is whether we are going to restore that sense of an American promise&mdash;where if you work hard, if you're carrying out your responsibilities, if you're looking out for your family, if you're participating in your community, if you're doing what you're supposed to be doing&mdash;you have the chance to get a job that allows you to support your family, you won't be bankrupt when you get sick, you can send your children to college, you can retire with some dignity and some respect, you can expect that the next generation&mdash;your children and grandchildren&mdash;will do better than you did. That American promise, that central driving force in what has created the greatest country, the largest economy, and the broadest middle class on Earth, that promise has been eroding for too many people. And all of you know it. <p>And this is not a new trend. This is something that's been going on for years now. Wages and incomes stagnant at the same time that costs keep going up and up and up, outsourcing and jobs moving elsewhere, young people wondering, even if they invest in a college degree, are they going to be able to find a job that supports an ever-increasing load of debt, and all of that was before the economic crisis hit in 2008-2009 that put millions of people out of work. <p>Now, here's the good news: The good news is that we are moving in the right direction. Thanks to your efforts, thanks to some tough votes that all of you took, thanks to the leadership that Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the leadership team showed, we righted the ship. We did not tip into a great depression. The auto industry was saved. Credit started flowing to small businesses again. And over the last 22 months, we have seen 3 million jobs created, the most jobs last year since 2005, more jobs in manufacturing than we've seen since the nineties. A lot of that has to do with tough decisions that you took. <p>I just came from Michigan. And there are very few States that have been harder hit by these long-term trends than Michigan. But you can feel this sense of renewed purpose and renewed hope in that State. They understand that had we not acted, a million jobs might have been lost. They understand that had we not acted, the Big Three automakers&mdash;but then, all the suppliers, the entire ecosystem of the economy in that State would have been decimated. And now, they're thinking, GM is number one again and Chrysler is on the move again and Ford is investing in plants and equipment again. And you get a sense of movement, a restoration of hope and possibility. <p>But people understand that the job is not done, not even close to being done yet. And they understand that if we're going to finish the job, then we've got to, first of all, make sure that American manufacturing is strong. And that means that we're out there creating a Tax Code that doesn't provide tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. We are focusing on companies that are investing right here in the United States, because we believe that when you make it in America everybody benefits, everybody does well. <p>They understand that we need American energy. And part of my goal on Tuesday was to dispel this notion that somehow we haven't been on top of developing American energy&mdash;oil and gas production up higher than they've been in 8 years, percentage of imports lower than in the last 16. We've been developing and opening up millions of acres to develop. <p>But what we've also said is oil is not enough. We've got to think about the future, not just look backwards at the past. We've got to invest in solar and wind and biofuels. We've already doubled our fuel efficiency standards on cars and trucks. We've got to make sure that we build on these successes, which are good for our economy and create jobs and, by the way, are also good for our environment. And that's important to the American people as well. <p>I know the other side doesn't always believe in this agenda. They think that the only subsidy that's worth providing is subsidies to oil companies. Well, as I said, we've been subsidizing oil companies for close to a century now. Rarely have they been more profitable. Let's take some of that money, let's take some of those tax breaks and make sure that we're investing in a clean energy future that's just as promising. <p>Skills for American workers, making sure that every young person in this country has the skills to succeed&mdash;I told the story at the State of the Union, but I want to make sure everybody hears this, because we're going to have to work hard on this. Companies are starting to say it makes economic sense for us to move back here into the United States. Wages in places like China are going up faster than productivity. American workers have never been more productive. Energy costs increasingly are competitive here in the United States, partly because of all of the development that's taking place around natural gas. Transportation costs are higher from other places. <p>When you look at the whole package, a lot of companies are saying, we want to be here, close to our market. But one of the biggest impediments is we've got to be able to find the skilled workers that are going to be managing million-dollar pieces of equipment. <p>They don't all have to go to 4-year colleges and universities although we need more engineers and we need more scientists and we've got to make sure that college is affordable and accessible. But we also need skilled workers who are going to community colleges or middle-aged workers who are allowed to retrain, have a commitment to work, have that work ethic, but want to make sure that technology is not passing them by&mdash;and so focusing on our community colleges and making sure that they're matched up with businesses that are hiring right now and making sure that they help to design the programs that are going to put them&mdash;put people in place to get those jobs right away. <p>Making college more affordable, which I just spoke about at Michigan&mdash;we've got an average of $24,000 worth of debt for every young person that's graduating right now. They're starting off in a hole that most of us didn't have to start off with, and it's brutal. And there are ways we can solve it. This caucus helped to make sure that we increased Pell grants, and we increased student aid, but now&mdash;there's some concrete things we've got to do right now, like making sure that the interest rates don't double on student loans this year in July. We're going to require Congress to act. <p>We're going to also put pressure on States to make sure they're prioritizing higher education. We're going to make sure that colleges and universities are held accountable and that they do what they need to do to hold down costs, but most of all, we've got to restore a commitment to the American values of hard work and responsibility and shared responsibility. <p>Over the last 3 days, I've traveled around the country amplifying what we said on Tuesday. One of the points I make&mdash;and everybody understands this&mdash;I say, if we're going to make the investments we need, if we're going to invest in basic science and research that leads to inventions like the Internet that create entire industries, entire platforms for long-term economic growth, if we're going to invest in the skills of our workers, if we're going to make sure we've got the best infrastructure in the world, if we're going to pay for this incredible military that just saved this young woman out of Somalia, if we're going to take care of the veterans once they're finished serving so that we serve them as well as they serve us, all those things cost money. We've got to pay for it. <p>And if we're serious about paying for it, then yes, we've got to cut out programs that don't work. This caucus has gone ahead and been willing to make some of the toughest cuts we've ever made&mdash;$2 trillion&mdash;over $2 trillion in deficit reduction. But we've also said, at a certain point, you know what, everybody has got to participate in this. <p>And when we've got a trillion&mdash;more than a trillion dollars worth of tax breaks that were supposed to be temporary for the top 2 percent slated to continue, we've got a Tax Code full of loopholes for folks who don't need them and weren't even asking for them, we've got to ask ourselves, what's more important to us? Is it more important for me to get a tax break, or is it more important for that senior to know that they've got Medicare and Social Security that's stable? Is it more important for me to get a tax break, or is it better for that young person to get a break on their college education? Is it more important for me to get a tax break, or is it more important that we care for our veterans? <p>This is&mdash;one of the biggest things I'm going to be pushing back against this year is this notion that somehow this is class warfare, that we're trying to stir up envy. Nobody envies rich people. [<i>Laughter</i>] Everybody wants to be rich. [<i>Laughter</i>] Everybody aspires to be rich, and everybody understands you got to work hard if you're going to be financially successful. That's the American way. The question is, are we creating opportunity for everybody, which requires some investments. And the question is, how do we pay for that, because when you give me a tax break that I don't need and the country can't afford, two things happen: Either the deficit increases, or alternatively, somebody else has to pay the tab&mdash;that senior or that student or that family who's struggling to make ends meet. <p>So we're going to push hard for the Buffett rule. We're going to push hard to make sure that millionaires, somebody making over a million dollars a year isn't getting tax breaks and subsidies that they don't need. Not out of envy, but out of a sense of fairness and a sense of mutual responsibility and a sense of commitment to this country's future. <p>That's what we're fighting for. And the American people understand that. <p>The same way that they understand we're going to have to keep in place smart regulations that assure that a health care company can't drop you right when you get sick or charge women differently than men. These other folks want to roll back financial regulatory reform. After all that we've been through, you want to water down and weaken rules that make sure that big banks and financial institutions have to play by the same rules as everybody else? That makes no sense. <p>The American people understand that. You understand that. That's what you've been fighting for. <p>So obviously, we're in an election season, and when the other side decides who it is that they want to be their standard bearer, then, we're going to have a robust debate about whose vision is more promising when it comes to moving this country forward. And it's going to be a tough election, because a lot of people are still hurting out there and a lot of people have lost faith, generally, about the capacity of Washington to get anything done. <p>The main thing I want to urge all of you is that even as we are out there making our case, even as we push hard to persuade not just the American people, but hopefully, some folks on the other side about the brightness of our future if we work together, I think it's important during the course of this year not to forget that there's still work that we can do right now. <p>We can extend the payroll tax cut right now without drama and without delay. We can work together right now to help startups and entrepreneurs get easier financing and use R&D more effectively. There are things we can do right now. <p>And so even as we engage in a robust debate with the other side, I want us all to remember that there are folks out there that are still counting on us. There are people out there who are still hurting, and wherever we have an opportunity, wherever there is the possibility that the other side is putting some politics aside for just a nanosecond in order to get something done for the American people, we've got to be right there ready to meet them. We've got to be right there ready to meet them. <p>On the other hand, where they obstruct, where they're unwilling to act, where they're more interested in party than they are in country, more interested in the next election than the next generation, then we've got to call them out on it. We've got to call them out on it. We've got to push them. We can't wait. We can't be held back. <p>At the State of the Union, obviously, I talked about our military. I had a chance to see some folks out at Buckley in Colorado as well. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Yay, Colorado! <p><i>The President.</i> There you go. [<i>Laughter</i>] Obviously, the work that our military has done this last decade has filled us with awe. I think, as you saw during the State of the Union, everybody stands up when you mention the military and appropriately so. That's something that should not be partisan. But the point that I tried to make on Tuesday, and I hope we all keep in mind, is there's a reason we admire them, and it's not just because they do their job so well. It's not just because of their incredible capacity and training and skill. It's also because of an ethic that says, you know what, we're all in this together. I can only succeed if the guy next to me and the gal next to me are successful as well. I can only succeed if somebody has got my back. <p>We do not succeed on our own. We all have to pull our weight. We all have to do our work. America is not about handouts or bailouts or copouts. We all have to focus on what our responsibilities are. We have to do our jobs, but we also understand that we are always more successful when we do it together. <p>Black, White, Hispanic, Asian, Latino, Native American, gay, straight&mdash;it doesn't matter. What matters is that we have this sense of common purpose and common resolve. That's what is going to help ensure that this recovery continues. That's what is going to make sure that this country's future is bright. That is at the core, I believe, not only of what it means to be a Democrat, but I also think that's at the core of what it means to be an American. <p>I believe in you guys. You guys have had my back through some very tough times. I'm going to have your back, as well. And together we're going to move this country forward. <p>God bless you. God bless the United States of America. And thank you, Democratic caucus, for all the great work that you do. Let's go out there and change the country. Thank you.\" "
"25" "\"On Tuesday, in my State of the Union Address, I laid out a blueprint for an economy built to last, an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American workers, and a renewal of American values. <p>This week, I took that blueprint across the country, and what I saw was people who work hard and believe in each other. They believe in the America that's within our reach. But they're not sure that the right thing will get done in Washington this year or next year or the year after that. And frankly, when you look at some of the things that go on in this town, who could blame them for being a little cynical? <p>Just 2 days ago, a Senator promised to obstruct every single American I appoint to a judgeship or a public service position unless I fire the consumer watchdog I put in place to protect the American people from financial schemes or malpractice. <p>For the most part, it's not that this Senator thinks these nominees are unqualified. In fact, all of the judicial nominees being blocked have bipartisan support. And almost 90 percent have unanimous support from the Judiciary Committee. <p>Instead, one of the Senator's aides told reporters that the Senator plans to, and I'm quoting here, \\"Delay and slow the process in order to get the President's attention.\\" <p>Well, this isn't about me. We weren't sent here to wage perpetual political campaigns against each other. We were sent here to serve the American people. And they deserve better than gridlock and games. One Senator gumming up the whole works for the entire country is certainly not what our Founding Fathers envisioned. <p>The truth is, neither party has been blameless in tactics like these. But it's time for both parties to put an end to them. I'm asking Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, to stop this kind of behavior by passing a rule that allows all judicial and public service nominations a simple up-or-down vote within 90 days. <p>We should also stem the corrosive influence of money in politics. The House and Senate should send me a bill that bans insider trading by Members of Congress, and I will sign it immediately. They should limit any elected official from owning stocks in industries they impact. And they should make sure people who bundle campaign contributions for Congress can't lobby Congress, and vice versa. <p>During my Address on Tuesday night, I spoke about the incredible example set by the men and women of our Armed Forces. At a time when too many of our institutions have let us down, they exceed all expectations. They're not consumed with personal ambition. They don't obsess over their differences. They focus on the mission at hand. They work together. <p>If you agree with me that leaders in Washington should follow their example, then make your voice heard. Tell your Member of Congress that it's time to end the gridlock and start tackling the issues that really matter: an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, American skills and education, and a return to American values&mdash;an economy built to last. <p>Thanks. God bless you, and have a great weekend.\" "
"26" "\"...It is great to be here tonight, because I have about 45 more minutes on the State of the Union that I'd like to deliver tonight.<p>...<p>You've heard it from the pundits: \\"Obama is cloistered in the White House.\\" \\"He's aloof.\\" \\"He's in the bubble.\\" \\"He's not connecting.\\" And that's why one of my big goals this year was to get out and be among everyday, ordinary Americans -- like the men and women of the Alfalfa Club.<p>...<p>At least my harshest critics can agree I have a promising future -- as a Al Green impersonator.<p>...<p>It is great to see Jeb Bush, who is accepting a nomination for President tonight. I have to say, though, it's not fair to tease your friends like that.<p>...<p>And Speaker Boehner, it is good to see you at the head table. I know how badly Eric Cantor wanted your seat. But, John, I want you to know: I am eager to work with members of Congress to be entertaining tonight. But if Congress is unwilling to cooperate, I will be funny without them.<p>...<p>I'd like to acknowledge a very good friend of mine -- Warren Buffet's secretary's boss is in the house.<p>...<p>We are reminded on evenings like this that for all our differences, we are bound by something greater. Sometimes we're going to disagree. We're going to do battle, politically, from time to time. That's the nature of our democracy. But let us never forget the extraordinary privilege that we share as Americans, and the responsibility that we all have, as leaders, to the continued success of this country that's made so many of our stories possible.\" "
"27" "\"Let me just say, when you look at all these cars, it is testimony to the outstanding work that's been done by workers: American workers, American designers. The U.S. auto industry is back. The fact that GM is back, number one, I think shows the kind of turnaround that's possible when it comes to American manufacturing. <p>And it's good to remember that&mdash;the fact that there were some folks who were willing to let this industry die, because of folks coming together, we are now back in a place where we can compete with any car company in the world. And these are not only selling here in the United States, they also serve as a platform for us to sell product all around the world. <p>So I'm just very proud of what we're seeing here. That Camaro with the American eagle and the American flag, that helps tell the story. <p>So thank you very much.\" "
"28" "\"Thank you so much. Everybody, please have a seat. Have a seat. It is great to be back in Falls Church. Thank you for having me. <p>Last week, in my State of the Union, I laid out my blueprint for an economy that's built to last. And I want to assure you I am not going to go over the whole thing again this morning. [<i>Laughter</i>] That was a long speech. I'm not going to repeat the whole thing. But I do want to talk about some of the issues that I discussed last week, because the blueprint we put forward was one that focuses on restoring what have always been this country's greatest strengths: American manufacturing, American energy, skills and education for American workers so that we can compete with anybody around the world in this 21st century economy, and most importantly, the American values of fairness and responsibility&mdash;fairness and responsibility. <p>Now, we know what happens, because we've just seen it&mdash;what happened when we stray from those values. We saw what happened over the past decade when we strayed from those values, especially when it comes to the massive housing bubble that burst and hurt so many people. Millions of families who did the right and the responsible thing, folks who shopped for a home that they could afford, secured a mortgage, made their payments each month, they were hurt badly by the irresponsible actions of other people who weren't playing by the same rules, weren't taking the same care, weren't acting as responsibly: by lenders who sold loans to people who they knew couldn't afford the mortgages and buyers who bought homes they knew they couldn't afford and banks that packaged those mortgages up and traded them to reap phantom profits, knowing that they were building a house of cards. <p>It was wrong. It was wrong. It triggered the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes. And it has been the single biggest drag on our recovery from a terrible recession. Crushing debt has kept millions of consumers from spending. A lack of building demand has kept hundreds of thousands of construction workers idle. Everybody involved in the home-building business&mdash;folks who make windows, folks who make carpets&mdash;they've all been impacted. The challenge is massive in size and in scope because we've got a multitrillion-dollar housing industry. And economists can tell you how it's affected all sorts of statistics, from GDP to consumer confidence. <p>But what's at stake is more than just statistics. It's personal. I've been saying that this is a make-or-break moment for the middle class. And this housing crisis struck right at the heart of what it means to be middle class in America: our homes, the place where we invest our nest egg, place where we raise our family, the place where we plant roots in a community, the place where we build memories. <p>It's personal. It affects so much of how people feel about their lives, about their communities, about the country, about the economy. We need to do everything in our power to repair the damage and make responsible families whole again&mdash;everything we can. <p>Now, the truth is, it's going to take more time than any of us would like for the housing market to fully recover from this crisis. This was a big bubble, and when it burst, it had a big effect. Home prices started a pretty steady decline about 5 years ago. And Government certainly can't fix the entire problem on its own. But it is wrong for anybody to suggest that the only option for struggling, responsible homeowners is to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom. I refuse to accept that, and so do the American people. <p>There are more than 10 million homeowners across the country right now who, because of an unprecedented decline in home prices that is no fault of their own, owe more on their mortgage than their homes are worth. It means your mortgage, your house is underwater. <p>Here in Falls Church, home values have fallen by about a quarter from their peak. In places like Las Vegas, more than half of all homeowners are underwater&mdash;more than half. So it's going to take a while for those prices to rise again. But there are actions we can take right now to provide some relief to folks who've been responsible, have done the right thing, and are making their payments on time. <p>Already, thanks to the outstanding work, in part, of my Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Shaun Donovan, who's here today&mdash;yeah, there he is, the good-looking guy in the front here&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;the housing plan we launched a couple years ago has helped nearly 1 million responsible homeowners refinance their mortgages, and they're saving an average of $300 on their payments each month&mdash;$300, which is great. <p>But I'll be honest, the programs that we put forward haven't worked at the scale that we hoped. Not as many people have taken advantage of it as we wanted. Mortgage rates are as low as they've been in half a century, and when that happens, usually homeowners flock to refinance their mortgages. So a lot of people take advantage of it and save a lot of money. But this time too many families haven't been able to take advantage of the low rates, because falling prices lock them out of the market. They were underwater; made it more difficult for them to refinance. <p>Then you've got all the fees involved in refinancing. And a lot of people just said, you know what, even though I'd like to be, obviously, cutting down my monthly payment, the banks just aren't being real encouraging. <p>So last year, we took aggressive action that allowed more families to participate. And today we're doing even more. This is the main reason I'm here today. <p>As I indicated at the State of the Union last week, I am sending Congress a plan that will give every responsible homeowner in America the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage by refinancing at historically low rates. No more redtape. No more runaround from the banks. And a small fee on the largest financial institutions will make sure it doesn't add to our deficit. <p>Now, I want to be clear: This plan, like the other actions we've taken, will not help the neighbors down the street who bought a house they couldn't afford and then walked away and left a foreclosed home behind. It's not designed for those who've acted irresponsibly, but it can help those who've acted responsibly. It's not going to help those who bought multiple homes just to speculate and flip the house and make a quick buck, but it can help those who've acted responsibly. <p>What this plan will do is help millions of responsible homeowners who make their payments on time but find themselves trapped under falling home values or wrapped up in redtape. <p>If you're ineligible for refinancing just because you're underwater on your mortgage, through no fault of your own, this plan changes that. You'll be able to refinance at a lower rate. You'll be able to save hundreds of dollars a month that you can put back in your pocket. Or you can choose those savings to rebuild equity in your homes, which will help most underwater homeowners come back up for air more quickly. <p>Now, to move this part of my plan, we're going to need Congress to act. We're going to need Congress to act. I hear some&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;murmuring in the audience here. We need them to act. But we're not just going to wait for Congress. We're going to keep building a firewall to prevent the same kinds of abuses that led this crisis&mdash;that led to this crisis in the first place. So there are things we can do administratively that are also going to help responsible homeowners. <p>Already, we've set up a special task force I asked my Attorney General to establish to investigate the kind of activity banks took when they packaged and sold risky mortgages. And that task force is ramping up its work as we speak. We're going to keep at it and hold people who broke the law accountable and help restore confidence in the market. We're going to speed assistance to homeowners. And we're going to turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many hardworking Americans. <p>Today I'm also proposing a homeowner's bill of rights, one straightforward set of commonsense rules of the road that every family knows they can count on when they're shopping for a mortgage. No more hidden fees or conflicts of interest, no more getting the runaround when you call about your loan, no more fine print that you use to get families to take a deal that is not as good as the one they should have gotten, new safeguards against inappropriate foreclosures, new options to avoid foreclosure if you've fallen on hardship or a run of bad luck, and a new, simple, clear form for buying&mdash;for new buyers of a home. <p>Now, think about it. This is the most important purchase a family makes. But how many of you have had to deal with overly complicated mortgage forms and hidden clauses and complex terms? I remember when Michelle and I bought our first condo. And we're both lawyers. [<i>Laughter</i>] And we're looking through the forms and kind of holding it up&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;reading it again&mdash;\\"What does this phrase mean?\\" And that's for two trained lawyers. The forms, the confusion, the potential for abuse is too great just because the forms were too complicated. <p>So this is what a mortgage form should look like. <p>[<i>At this point, the President held up a mortgage disclosure form.</i>] <p>This is it. Now that our new consumer watchdog agency is finally running at full steam, now that Richard Cordray is in as the Director of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, they're moving forward on important protections like this new, shorter mortgage form: simple, not complicated; informative, not confusing; terms are clear, fees are transparent. <p>This is, by the way, is what some of the folks in Congress are trying to roll back and prevent from happening. <p>I guess they like complicated things that confuse consumers and allow them to be cheated. I prefer actions that are taken to make things simpler and easier to understand for consumers so that they can get the best deal possible, especially on the biggest single investment that most people will ever make. <p>Americans making a downpayment on their dreams shouldn't be terrified by pages and pages of fine print. They should be confident they're making the right decision for their future. <p>Now, there's more that we're announcing today. We're working to turn more foreclosed homes into rental housing, because as we know and a lot of families know, that empty house or for sale sign down the block can bring down the price of homes across the neighborhood. We're working to make sure people don't lose their homes just because they lose their jobs. These are steps that can make a concrete difference in people's lives right now. <p>As I said earlier, no program or policy will solve all the problems in a multitrillion-dollar housing market. The heights of the housing bubble reached before it burst, those were unsustainable, and it's going to take time to fully recover. That requires everybody to do their part. <p>As much as our economic challenges were born of eroding home values and portfolio values, they were also born of an erosion of some old-fashioned American values. An economy that's built to last, that's on a firm foundation, so that middle class families have a sense of security and those who want to get in the middle class can make it if they're working hard, that demands responsibility from everyone. <p>Government must take responsibility for rules that are fair and fairly enforced. Banks and lenders must be held accountable for ending the practices that helped cause this crisis in the first place. And all of us have to take responsibility for our own actions or lack of action. <p>So I urge Congress to act. Pass this plan. Help more families keep their homes. Help more neighborhoods remain vibrant. Help keep more dreams defended and alive. And I promise you that I'll keep doing everything I can to make the future brighter for this community, for this Commonwealth, for this country. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you.\" "
"29" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you so much. Everybody, please have a seat. Well, good morning, everybody. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Good morning! <p><i>The President.</i> Jacob, thank you for that introduction. More importantly, thank you for your extraordinary service to our country. <p>I want to acknowledge two outstanding members of my Cabinet who are here today. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Ric Shinseki is in the house, also one of our finest&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;himself one of our finest veterans and obviously an extraordinary leader when he was in our Army. And I also want to acknowledge Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, who's in the house. <p>And we're joined by another president, the International Association of Fire Fighters president, Harold Schaitberger, is here. <p>Now, this is a fire station that holds some special significance for our country. On September 11th, the firefighters of this house were among the first to respond to the attack on the Pentagon. You guys answered this Nation's call during its hour of need. And in the years that followed, as Americans went to war, some of you answered that call as well. <p>Today's 9/11 generation of veterans has already earned a special place in our history. Our veterans and all the brave men and women who serve our country are the reason why America's military is the greatest in the history of the world. In the face of great odds and grave danger, they get the job done. They work as a team. They personify the very best that America has to offer. <p>That's true on the battlefront. But we're here today because it's also true on the home front. After a decade of war, our Nation needs to do some building right here in the United States of America. <p>Now, this morning we received more good news about our economy. In January, American businesses added another 257,000 jobs. The unemployment rate came down because more people found work. And all together, we've added 3.7 million new jobs over the last 23 months. <p>Now, these numbers will go up and down in the coming months, and there's still far too many Americans who need a job or need a job that pays better than the one they have now. But the economy is growing stronger. The recovery is speeding up. And we've got to do everything in our power to keep it going. <p>We can't go back to the policies that led to the recession. And we can't let Washington stand in the way of our recovery. We want Washington to be helping with the recovery, not making it tougher. <p>The most important thing Congress needs to do right now is to stop taxes from going up on 160 million Americans at the end of this month. They've got to renew the payroll tax cut that they extended only for a couple of months. They need to pass an extension of the payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance and do it without drama, without delay, without linking it to some ideological side issues. They just need to get it done. It shouldn't be that complicated. Now is not the time for self-inflicted wounds to our economy. Now is the time for action. <p>So I want to send a clear message to Congress: Do not slow down the recovery that we're on. Don't muck it up. Keep it moving in the right direction. <p>Beyond preventing a tax hike, we need to do a lot more to create an economy that's built to last. To restore American manufacturing, we need to stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas. Give those tax breaks to companies that are investing in plants and equipment and hiring workers right here in the United States of America. That makes a lot of sense. <p>To reduce our dependency on foreign oil, we need to stop subsidizing oil companies that are already making record profits and double down on clean energy that creates jobs and creates opportunities in new industries, but also improves our security because we're not as dependent on foreign oil. <p>To make sure our businesses don't have to move overseas to find skilled workers, we've got to invest in education and make sure college is affordable for every hard-working American. <p>And&mdash;this is the reason we're here today&mdash;we need to make sure that as our troops return from battle, they can find a job when they get home. That's what I want to talk about today. <p>The war in Iraq is over. The war in Afghanistan is moving to a new phase; we're transitioning to Afghan lead. Over the past decade, nearly 3 million servicemembers have transitioned back to civilian life, and more are joining them every day. <p>And when these men and women come home, they bring unparalleled skills and experience. Folks like Jacob, they've saved lives in some of the toughest conditions imaginable. They've managed convoys and moved tons of equipment over dangerous terrain. They've tracked millions of dollars of military assets. They've handled pieces of equipment that are worth tens of millions of dollars. They do incredible work. Nobody is more skilled, more precise, more diligent, more disciplined. <p>Our veterans are some of the most highly trained, highly educated, highly skilled workers that we've got. These are Americans that every business should be competing to attract. These are the Americans we want to keep serving here at home as we rebuild this country. So we're going to do everything we can to make sure that when our troops come home, they come home to new jobs and new opportunities and new ways to serve their country. <p>Now, this has been a top priority of mine since I came into office. Already, we've helped 600,000 veterans and their family members go back to school on the post-9/11 GI bill. We've hired over 120,000 veterans to serve in the Federal Government. We've made it easier for veterans to access all sorts of employment services. We've set up online tools to connect veterans with job openings that match their skills. <p>Michelle and Jill Biden have worked with the private sector, with businesses, to secure a pledge of 135,000 jobs for veterans and their families. And with the support of Democrats and Republicans, we've put in place two new tax credits for companies that hire veterans. So these are all important steps. We've made progress. But we've got to do more. There's more we can do. <p>In my State of the Union Address, I proposed a new initiative called the Veterans Jobs Corps to put veterans back to work protecting and rebuilding America. And today we're laying out the details of this proposal. <p>First, we want to help communities hire more veterans as cops and firefighters. You guys have seen what a great job Jacob is doing. Well, there are a whole bunch of folks like that who could be doing that same outstanding work all across the country. But it's not that easy these days to get a job at a firehouse. <p>Over the past few years, tight budgets have forced a lot of States, a lot of local communities to lay off a lot of first-responders. Now, my administration&mdash;when I first came into office, one of the first things we did was, through the Recovery Act, make sure that States and local governments helped&mdash;or got the help that they needed to prevent some of these layoffs. And thousands of jobs were saved all across the country. <p>Harold and I were talking as we came over here. Thousands of firefighter jobs were saved because of the actions we took. But budgets are still tight, and that's a problem we need to fix. Jobs that protect our families and our communities shouldn't be the first on the chopping block. They should be one of our highest priorities as a nation. <p>Over the past 3 years, my administration has made it possible for States to keep thousands of first-responders on the job. But today we're announcing that communities who make it a priority to recruit veterans will be among the first in line when it comes to getting help from the Federal Government. And I know that's one of the things, Chief, that you've been doing here in Arlington. So we want to prioritize veterans, and we want to help States and local communities hire veterans to firehouses and police stations all across the country. <p>The second thing we want to do is to connect up to 20,000 veterans with jobs that involve rebuilding local communities or national parks. That's why Ken Salazar is here as the Interior Secretary. He needs some help. And our veterans are highly qualified to help him. They've already risked their lives defending America. They should have the opportunity to rebuild America. We've got roads and bridges in and around our national parks in need of repair. Let's fix them. <p>Of course, Congress needs to fund these projects. Congress should take the money that we're no longer spending on war, use half of it to pay down our debt, and use the rest to do some nation-building here at home, to improve the quality of life right here in the United States of America and put our veterans to work. <p>So let's get more cops on the beat. Let's gets more rangers in the parks. Let's get more firefighters on call. And in the process, we're going to put more veterans back to work. It's good for our communities, it's good for our economy, and it's good for our country. <p>And for veterans who want to do something else&mdash;maybe put their leadership skills to use starting a small business&mdash;we're going to start offering entrepreneurial training to our veterans. We want servicemembers prepared for battle and for professional success when they come home. So we should do all that we can to support our troops and our veterans in helping them start a business, in helping them get a foothold in a fire station like this one and start moving up the ranks, doing outstanding work the way Jacob's been doing. <p>But we also need to follow their lead. We want to help them, but we should also learn from them. We should remember from our veterans that no matter what the circumstances, those men and women in uniform&mdash;a lot like the firefighters in this fire station&mdash;work together, act as a team, finish the job. That's what we've got to do when it comes to our Nation's recovery. <p>Now, these are challenging times for America, but we've faced challenging times before. On the grounds here you've got a stone from the Pentagon and a beam from the World Trade Center. And that reminds us of our resolve as a people. They remind us that when we come together as one people and as one community and one nation, then we prevail. That's who we are. <p>This is a nation that exists because generations of Americans worked together to build it. This is a nation where, out of many, we come together as one. Those are the values that every veteran understands. Those are values that this fire station understands. We've got to make sure that we return to those values. And if we do, then I guarantee you we'll remind everybody around the world just why it is the United States is the greatest country on Earth. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"30" "\"Over the last couple of weeks, I've been traveling around the country and talking with folks about my blueprint for an economy built to last. It's a blueprint that focuses on restoring the things we've always done best, our strengths: American manufacturing, American energy, the skills and education of American workers, and most importantly, American values like fairness and responsibility. <p>We know what happened when we strayed from those values over the past decade, especially when it comes to our housing market. Lenders sold loans to families who couldn't afford them. Banks packaged those mortgages up and traded them for phony profits. It drove up prices and created an unsustainable bubble that burst and left millions of families who did everything right, in a world of hurt. <p>It was wrong. The housing crisis has been the single biggest drag on our recovery from the recession. It has kept millions of families in debt and unable to spend, and it has left hundreds of thousands of construction workers out of a job. <p>But there's something even more important at stake. I've been saying this is a make-or-break moment for the middle class. And the housing crisis struck right at the heart of what it means to be middle class in this country: owning a home, raising our kids, building our dreams. <p>Right now, there are more than 10 million homeowners in this country who, because of a decline in home prices that is no fault of their own, owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. It is wrong for anyone to suggest that the only option for struggling, responsible homeowners is to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom. I don't accept that. None of us should. <p>That's why we launched a plan a couple years ago that's helped nearly 1 million responsible homeowners refinance their mortgages and save an average of $300 on their payments each month. I'll be the first to admit it didn't help as many folks as we'd hoped. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't keep trying. <p>That's why I'm sending Congress a plan that will give every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgages by refinancing at historically low rates. No more redtape. No more endless forms. And a small fee on the largest financial institutions will make sure it doesn't add a dime to the deficit. <p>I want to be clear: this plan will not help folks who bought a house they couldn't afford and then walked away from it. It won't help folks who bought multiple houses just to turn around and sell them in speculation. <p>What this plan will do is help millions of responsible homeowners who make their payments every month, but who, until now, couldn't refinance because their home values kept dropping or they got wrapped up in too much redtape. <p>Here's the catch. In order to lower mortgage payments for millions of Americans, we need Congress to act. They're the ones who have to pass this plan. And as anyone who has followed the news in the last 6 months can tell you, getting Congress to do anything these days is not an easy job. <p>That's why I'm going to keep up the pressure on Congress to do the right thing. But I also need your help. I need your voice. I need everyone who agrees with this plan to get on the phone, send an e-mail, tweet, pay a visit, and remind your representatives in Washington who they work for. Tell them to pass this plan. Tell them to help more families keep their homes and more neighborhoods stay vibrant and whole. <p>The truth is, it will take time for our housing market to recover. It will take time for our economy to fully bounce back. But there are steps we can take, right now, to move this country forward. That's what I promise to do as your President, and I hope Members of Congress will join me. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"31" "\"Thank you, everybody. Everybody, have a seat. Well, welcome to the White House Science Fair. It is&mdash;I just spent some time checking out some of the projects that were brought here today, and I've got to say, this is fun. It's not every day that you have robots running all over your house. [<i>Laughter</i>] I am trying to figure out how you got through the metal detectors. I also shot a marshmallow through a air gun, which was very exciting. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Science is what got several of our guests where they are today, so I just want to make a couple of introductions. We've got a real-life astronaut and the head of NASA, Charles Bolden, in the house. We have the Administrator of the EPA; Lisa Jackson is here. The Director of the National Science Foundation, Subra Suresh, is here. My science&mdash;there's Subra, over here&mdash;my science adviser, John Holdren, is in the house. We've got a couple of people who've dedicated themselves to making science cool for young people. We've got Neil deGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye the Science Guy. <p>Now, it is fitting that this year's fair is happening just 2 days after the Super Bowl. I want to congratulate the New York Giants and all their fans. I just talked to Coach Coughlin; I'm looking forward to having the Giants here at the White House so we can celebrate their achievements. But what I've also said&mdash;I've said this many times&mdash;is if we are recognizing athletic achievement, then we should also be recognizing academic achievement and science achievement. If we invite the team that wins the Super Bowl to the White House, then we need to invite some science fair winners to the White House as well. <p>Now I'm going to talk about how great all of you are in a second. But before I do, I want to give the parents a big round of applause, because they work hard to help you succeed, and I know this is their day. They're really proud of you. As a parent, I know that seeing your kids do extraordinary things is&mdash;brings the greatest happiness that a parent can have. So congratulations to all the parents of all these incredible young people. <p>But parents aren't the only ones who helped you get this far. Every one of you can think of a teacher, or maybe a couple of teachers, without whom you would not be here. So I want you to promise that the next time you see those teachers, that you give them a big thank you, not just for yourselves, but also from me. Because teachers matter, they deserve our support, and I want to make sure that we are constantly lifting up how important teachers are to making sure that not only you succeed, but this country succeeds. So give teachers a big round of applause. <p>Now, as I was walking around the science fair, I was thinking back to when I was your age. And basically, you guys put me to shame. [<i>Laughter</i>] What impresses me so much is not just how smart you are, but it's the fact that you recognize you've got a responsibility to use your talents in service of something bigger than yourselves. <p>Some of you, that means developing new products that will change the way we live. So Hayley Hoverter&mdash;where's Hayley? There she is, right over here&mdash;invented a new type of sugar packet that dissolves in hot water. It's flavorless, it's colorless, and potentially could save up to 2 million pounds of trash each year&mdash;and that's just at Starbucks. [<i>Laughter</i>] So MasterCard has already awarded her $10,000 to help turn her idea into a business. <p>Some of you are here because you saw a problem in your community and you're trying to do something to solve it. Benjamin Hylak&mdash;where's Benjamin? There's Benjamin right here&mdash;was worried that folks at his grandmother's senior center were getting lonely. So he built a robot with a monitor and a video camera, so it's like a moving Skype. And it moves around the center, and it allows seniors to talk to their kids and their grandkids, even when they can't visit in person. So inventions like Benjamin's could make life better for millions of families. <p>For some of you, the journey you took to get here is just as inspiring as the work that you brought with you today. There's a rocketry team from Presidio, Texas&mdash;where's my team here? Where are you? Stand up, guys. Stand up. This is part of the fourth-poorest school district in the State of Texas. And I was told that teachers cooked food to sell after church, supporters drove 200 miles to pick up donuts for bake sales, they even raffled off a goat&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;is that right? Just so they could raise enough money for the rocketry team to compete. And the majority of the kids at the school are ESL, English as a second language. And the presentation they made could not make you prouder. So way to go. <p>There's a group of young engineers from Paul Robeson-Malcolm X Academy. And nobody needs to tell them the kinds of challenges that Detroit still faces. Where's my team from Detroit? In the house&mdash;there they are. Stand up. They believe in their city, and they're coming up with new ideas to keep Detroit's comeback going. <p>And there's Samantha Garvey&mdash;where's Samantha? Just saw Samantha. There she is. Stand up, Samantha. Samantha spent years studying mussel populations in the Long Island Sound. And when she learned that she was a semifinalist for the Intel Science Talent Search&mdash;when she found this out&mdash;her family was living in a homeless shelter, so think about what she's overcome. She wants to, by the way, work maybe for NOAA or EPA. So this is Dr. Lubchenco; she's the head of NOAA. [<i>Laughter</i>] Lisa Jackson, right there, head of EPA. [<i>Laughter</i>] You might just want to hook up with them before you leave. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>The young people I met today, the young people behind me&mdash;you guys inspire me. It's young people like you that make me so confident that America's best days are still to come. When you work and study and excel at what you're doing in math and science, when you compete in something like this, you're not just trying to win a prize today. You're getting America in shape to win the future. You're making sure we have the best, smartest, most skilled workers in the world, so that the jobs and industries of tomorrow take root right here. You're making sure we'll always be home to the most creative entrepreneurs, the most advanced science labs and universities. You're making sure America will win the race to the future. <p>So as an American, I'm proud of you. As your President, I think we need to make sure your success stories are happening all across the country. <p>And that's why when I took office, I called for an all-hands-on-deck approach to science, math, technology, and engineering. Let's train more teachers. Let's get more kids studying these subjects. Let's make sure these fields get the respect and attention that they deserve. <p>But it's not just a Government effort. I'm happy to say that the private sector has answered that call as well. They understand how important it is to their future. So today, led by the Carnegie Corporation, a group of businesses and foundations is announcing a $22 million fund to help train 100,000 new science and math teachers. A coalition of more than 100 CEOs is expanding innovative math and science programs to 130 sites across the country. And other companies are partnering from&mdash;everybody from Will.i.am to Dean Kamen&mdash;to make sure we celebrate young scientists and inventors and engineers, not just at the White House, but in every city and every town all across America. <p>And many of these leaders are here today, and I want to thank them for doing their part. We're going to do everything we can to partner to help you succeed in your projects. And I'm proud to announce that the budget I unveil next week will include programs to help prepare new math and science teachers and to meet an ambitious goal, which is 1 million more American graduates in science, technology, engineering, and math over the next 10 years. That is a goal we can achieve. That's a goal we can achieve. <p>Now, in a lot of ways, today is a celebration of the new. But the belief that we belong on the cutting edge of innovation&mdash;that's an idea as old as America itself. I mean, we're a nation of tinkerers and dreamers and believers in a better tomorrow. You think about our Founding Fathers&mdash;they were all out there doing experiments. And folks like Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, they were constantly curious about the world around them and trying to figure out how can we help shape that environment so that people's lives are better. <p>It's in our DNA. We know that innovation has helped each generation pass down that basic American promise, which is no matter who you are, no matter where you come from, you can make it if you try. So there's nothing more important than keeping that promise alive for the next generation. There's no priority I have that's higher than President&mdash;as President than this. <p>And I can't think of a better way to spend a morning than with the young people who are here doing their part and creating some unbelievable stuff in the process. So I'm proud of you. I want you to keep up your good work. <p>I'm going to make a special plea to the press&mdash;not just the folks who are here, but also your editors&mdash;give this some attention. I mean, this is the kind of stuff, what these young people are doing, that's going to make a bigger difference in the life of our country over the long term than just about anything. And it doesn't belong just on the back pages of a newspaper; we've got to lift this up. We've got to emphasize how important this is and recognize these incredible young people who are doing things that I couldn't even imagine thinking about at fifth grade or eighth grade or in high school. <p>And so pay attention to this. This is important. This is what's going to make a difference in this country over the long haul. This is what inspires me and gets me up every day. This is what we should be focusing on in our public debates. <p>And as for all the folks who are here, don't let your robots wander off anywhere. [<i>Laughter</i>] All right? <p>Thank you, everybody. Appreciate it. Congratulations.\" "
"32" "\"All right, good afternoon, everybody. Before I start, I just want to introduce the folks on stage here, because the extraordinary work that they did is the reason that a lot of families are going to be helped all across the country. First of all, our Attorney General Eric Holder; Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan; Associate Attorney General, and former classmate of mine, Tom Perrelli; we've got Attorney General George Jepsen from Connecticut; Roy Cooper, attorney general from North Carolina; Lisa Madigan from my home State of Illinois, and former seatmate of mine when we were in the State legislature together; Dustin McDaniel from Arkansas; Gregory Zoeller from Indiana; and Tom Miller from Iowa. And I also want to acknowledge Bob Ryan, who worked with Shaun Donovan extensively on this issue, as well as Tim Massad of Treasury. And I'm going to acknowledge also Gene Sperling, who doesn't always get the credit he deserves for doing outstanding work. <p>The housing bubble that burst nearly 6 years ago triggered, as we all know, the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes. It cost millions of innocent Americans their jobs and their homes, and it remains one of the biggest drags on our economy. <p>Last fall, my administration unveiled a series of steps to help responsible homeowners refinance their mortgages to take advantage of historically low rates. And last week, I urged Congress to pass a plan that would help millions more Americans refinance and stay in their homes. And I indicated that the American people need Congress to act on this piece of legislation. <p>But in the meantime, we can't wait to get things done and to provide relief to America's homeowners. We need to keep doing everything we can to help homeowners and our economy. And today, with the help of Democratic and Republican attorney generals from nearly every State in the country, we are about to take a major step on our own. <p>We have reached a landmark settlement with the Nation's largest banks that will speed relief to the hardest hit homeowners, end some of the most abusive practices of the mortgage industry, and begin to turn the page on an era of recklessness that has left so much damage in its wake. <p>By now, it's well known that millions of Americans who did the right thing and the responsible thing&mdash;shopped for a house, secured a mortgage that they could afford, made their payments on time&mdash;were nevertheless hurt badly by the irresponsible actions of others: by lenders who sold loans to people who couldn't afford them, by buyers who knew they couldn't afford them, by speculators who were looking to make a quick buck, by banks that took risky mortgages, packaged them up, and traded them off for large profits. <p>It was wrong, and it cost more than 4 million families their homes to foreclosure. Even worse, many companies that handled these foreclosures didn't give people a fighting chance to hold onto their homes. In many cases, they didn't even verify that these foreclosures were actually legitimate. Some of the people they hired to process foreclosures used fake signatures to&mdash;on fake documents to speed up the foreclosure process. Some of them didn't read what they were signing at all. <p>We've got to think about that. You work and you save your entire life to buy a home. That's where you raise your family. That's where your kids' memories are formed. That's your stake, your claim on the American Dream. And the person signing the document couldn't take enough time to even make sure that the foreclosure was legitimate. <p>These practices were plainly irresponsible. And we refused to let them go unanswered. So about a year ago, our Federal law enforcement agencies teamed up with State attorneys general to get to the bottom of these abuses. The settlement we've reached today, thanks to the work of some of the folks who are on this stage&mdash;this is the largest joint Federal-State settlement in our Nation's history&mdash;is the result of that extraordinary cooperation. <p>Under the terms of this settlement, America's biggest banks&mdash;banks that were rescued by taxpayer dollars&mdash;will be required to right these wrongs. That means more than just paying a fee. These banks will put billions of dollars towards relief for families across the Nation. They'll provide refinancing for borrowers that are stuck in high interest rate mortgages. They'll reduce loans for families who owe more on their homes than they're worth. And they will deliver some measure of justice for families that have already been victims of abusive practices. <p>All told, this isn't just good for these families; it's good for their neighborhoods, it's good for their communities, and it's good for our economy. This settlement also protects our ability to further investigate the practices that caused this mess. And this is important. The mortgage fraud task force I announced in my State of the Union Address retains its full authority to aggressively investigate the packaging and selling of risky mortgages that led to this crisis. This investigation is already well underway. And working closely with State attorneys general, we're going to keep at it until we hold those who broke the law fully accountable. <p>Now, I want to be clear. No compensation, no amount of money, no measure of justice is enough to make it right for a family who's had their piece of the American Dream wrongly taken from them. And no action, no matter how meaningful, is going to, by itself, entirely heal the housing market. But this settlement is a start. And we're going to make sure that the banks live up to their end of the bargain. If they don't, we've set up an independent inspector, a monitor, that has the power to make sure they pay exactly what they agreed to pay, plus a penalty if they fail to act in accordance with this agreement. So this will be a big help. <p>Of course, even with this settlement, there's still millions of responsible homeowners who are out there doing their best. And they need us to do more to help them get back on their feet. We've still got to stoke the fires of our economic recovery. So now is not the time to pull back. <p>To build on this settlement, Congress still needs to send me the bill I've proposed that gives every responsible homeowner in America the chance to refinance their mortgage and save about $3,000 a year. It would help millions of homeowners who make their payments on time save hundreds of dollars a month, and it can broaden the impact building off this settlement. <p>That's money that can be put back into the homes of those folks who are saving money on the refinancing, helping to build their equity back up. They may decide to spend that money on local businesses. Either way, it's good for families, and it's good for our economy. But it's only going to happen if Congress musters the will to act. And I ask every American to raise your voice and demand that they do. <p>Because there really is no excuse for inaction. There's no excuse for doing nothing to help more families avoid foreclosure. That's not who we are. We are Americans, and we look out for one another; we get each other's backs. That's not a Democratic issue, that's not a Republican issue. That's who we are as Americans. <p>And the bipartisan nature of this settlement and the outstanding work that these State attorneys general did is a testament to what happens when everybody is pulling in the same direction. And that's what today's settlement's all about: standing up for the American people, holding those who broke the law accountable, restoring confidence in our housing market and our financial sector, getting things moving. And we're going to keep on at it until everyone shares in America's comeback. <p>So, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your outstanding efforts. We are very, very proud of you. And we look forward to seeing this settlement lead to some small measure of relief to a lot of families out there that need help. And that's going to strengthen the American economy overall. <p>So thank you very much.\" "
"33" "\"Please have a seat, have a seat. Thank you so much. Well, hello, everybody, and welcome to the White House. <p>I want to start by thanking all the chief State school officers who have made the trip from all over the country. Why don't you all stand up just so we can see you all, right here. It's a great group, right here. Thank you. And I want to recognize someone who is doing a pretty good job right here in Washington, DC, and that is my Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. Love Arne. <p>We've also got some outstanding Members of Congress who are here who have always been on the frontlines when it comes to education reform. But above all, I want to thank all the teachers who are here today. Where are the teachers? Come on, stand up, teachers. There you go. We got some teachers here. <p>Earlier this week, we hosted our second White House Science Fair. Some of you may have seen this on TV. I got a chance to shoot a marshmallow out of an air cannon, which I don't usually get to do. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I met these incredibly talented young people, kids who are working on everything from portable housing for disaster victims to technology that can detect smuggled uranium before it became a threat; this young man had built a prototype. And I asked him how he came up with this idea, and he said, \\"I've always just been really interested in nuclear materials, and I collect samples.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] And I asked him, \\"How does your mom feel about this?\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] He said she wasn't that happy about it. <p>But just unbelievable young people; it was extraordinary. And before they left, I gave them some homework. I told them go find a teacher who helped them make it here and say thank you, because every single one of us can point to a teacher who in some way changed the course of our lives. I certainly can; I know Arne can. And the impact is often much bigger than we realize. <p>One study found that a single good teacher can increase the lifetime earnings of a classroom by $250,000&mdash;single teacher. A great teacher can help a young person escape poverty, allow them to dream beyond their circumstances. <p>So teachers matter. And in an economy where employers are looking for the most skilled, educated workers, few people are going to have a bigger impact on that than the men and women who are in our classrooms. And that ultimately is why we're here today. It's about our classrooms, and our children, and what's happening to them and how they can perform. <p>In September, after waiting far too long for Congress to act, I announced that my administration would take steps to reform No Child Left Behind on our own. This was one of the first and the biggest \\"We Can't Wait\\" announcements that we've made, because our kids and our schools can't be held back by inaction. <p>I want to point out, by the way, the Members of Congress who are here, they're ready to act, but we haven't been able to get the entire House and Senate to move on this. <p>I said back then the goals of No Child Left Behind were the right ones. Standards and accountability, those are the right goals. Closing the achievement gap, that's a good goal. That's the right goal. We've got to stay focused on those goals. But we've got to do it in a way that doesn't force teachers to teach to the test or encourage schools to lower their standards to avoid being labeled as failures. That doesn't help anybody. It certainly doesn't help our children in the classroom. <p>So we determined we need a different approach. And I've always believed that each of us has a role to play when it comes to our children's education. As parents, we've got a responsibility to make sure homework gets done, but also to instill a love of learning from the very start. As a nation, we've got a responsibility to give our students the resources they need, from the highest quality schools to the latest textbooks to science labs that actually work. <p>In return, we should demand better performance. We should demand reform. And that was the idea behind Race to the Top. For less than 1 percent of what our Nation spends on education each year, we've gotten almost every State in the Nation to raise their standards for teaching and learning. And that's the first time that's happened in a generation. <p>So when it comes to fixing what's wrong with No Child Left Behind, we've offered every state the same deal. We've said, if you're willing to set higher, more honest standards than the ones that were set by No Child Left Behind, then we're going to give you the flexibility to meet those standards. We want high standards, and we'll give you flexibility in return. We combine greater freedom with greater accountability. Because what might work in Minnesota may not work in Kentucky, but every student should have the same opportunity to reach their potential. <p>So over the last 5 months, 39 States have told us that they were interested. Some have already applied. And today I am pleased to announce that we are giving 10 States&mdash;the first 10 States the green light to continue making the reforms that are best for them. <p>Each of these States has set higher benchmarks for student achievement. They've come up with ways to evaluate and support teachers fairly, based on more than just a set of test scores. And along with promoting best practices for all of our children, they're also going to be focusing on low-income students and English language learners and students with disabilities, not just to make sure that those children don't fall through the cracks, but to make sure they have every opportunity to go as far as their talents will take them. <p>So Massachusetts, for example, has set a goal to cut the number of underperforming students in half over the next 6 years. I like that goal. <p>Colorado has launched a web site that will allow teachers and parents to see exactly how much progress students are making and how different schools are measuring up. So nothing creates more accountability than when parents are out there taking a look and seeing what's going on. <p>New Jersey is developing an early warning system to reduce the number of dropouts. Tennessee is creating a statewide school district to aggressively tackle its lowest performing schools. And Florida has set a goal to have their test scores rank among the top 5 States in the country, and the top 10 countries in the world. I like that ambition. <p>This is good news for our kids; it's good news for our country. And I'm confident that we're going to see even more States come forward in the months ahead. Because if we're serious about helping our children reach their full potential, the best ideas aren't going to just come from here in Washington. They're going to come from cities and towns from all across America. They're going to come from teachers and principals and parents. They're going to come from you who have a sense of what works and what doesn't. <p>And our job is to harness those ideas, to lift up best practices, to hold States and schools accountable for making them work. That's how we're going to make sure that every child in America has the skills and the education they need to compete for the jobs of the future and to be great citizens. And that's how we're going to build an economy that lasts. <p>So to all the educators who are in the room, thank you for what you do every day. We are very proud of your efforts. We know it's not easy. We're proud of you. And working together, I am absolutely confident that year after year we're going to see steady improvement. <p>I told the superintendents that I met backstage before I came out here, this is not a 1-year project. This isn't a 2-year project. This is going to take some time. But we can get it done with the kind of determination and the kind of commitment that so many of you have shown. <p>So I'm proud of you. I'm proud of Arne Duncan. Let's make this happen. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"34" "\"Hello, everybody. In recent weeks, we've seen signs that our economy is growing stronger and creating jobs at a faster clip. While numbers and figures will go up and down in the coming months, what cannot waver is our resolve to do everything in our power to keep stoking the fires of the recovery. <p>And the last thing we should do is let Washington stand in the way. You see, at the end of the month, taxes are set to go up on 160 million working Americans. If you're one of them, then you know better than anyone that the last thing you need right now is a tax hike. But if Congress refuses to act, middle class taxes will go up. It's that simple. <p>Now, if this sounds familiar, it's because we've been here before. Back in December, Congress faced this exact same predicament. Ultimately, thanks to your voices, they did the right thing, but only after a great deal of bickering and political posturing that put the strength of our economy and the security of middle class families at risk. We can't go through that again. <p>Congress needs to stop this middle class tax hike from happening&mdash;period. No drama, no delay, and no ideological side issues that have nothing to do with this tax cut. Now is not the time for self-inflicted wounds to our recovery. Now is the time for commonsense action, and this tax cut is common sense. If you're a family making about $50,000 a year, this tax cut amounts to about $1,000 a year. That's about $40 in every paycheck. I know there are some folks in this town who think $40 isn't a lot of money. But to a student or a senior who's trying to stretch the budget a little bit further, to a parent who's filling up the tank and looking at rising gas prices&mdash;to them&mdash;$40 can make all the difference in the world. <p>And so can your voice. I hope you'll pick up the phone, send a tweet, write an email, and tell your representative that they should get this done before it's too late. Tell them not to play politics again by linking this debate to unrelated issues. Tell them not to manufacture another needless standoff or crisis. Tell them not to stand in the way of the recovery. Tell them to just do their job. That's what our middle class needs. That's what our country needs. <p>In the wake of the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes, we're getting things going again. And we're going to keep at it until everyone shares in America's comeback. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"35" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you very much. Thank you, Virginia! Thank you, NOVA! Thank you so much. Thank you very much. Everybody who has a chair please have a seat. I know not everybody has a chair. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. [<i>Laughter</i>] Great to be here. <p>First of all, I want to thank Mike for the wonderful introduction. Please give Mike a big round of applause. <p>It is great to be back here at NOVA. I've been here so many times I'm about three credits short of graduation. [<i>Laughter</i>] But there are a couple of reasons that I keep on coming back. First of all, I think that Dr. Templin and the whole administration here is doing a great job, so I want to give them a big round of applause. The other reason is because Jill Biden keeps talking up how great you are. And just as I do what Michelle tells me to do, I also do what Jill Biden tells me to do. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>In addition, by the way, I just want to acknowledge that we also have our Secretary of Labor here, Hilda Solis, who's doing an outstanding job. <p>But the main reason I keep on coming back is I think this institution is an example of what's best about America. Some of you may have your eye on a 4-year college. Some of you may be trying to learn new skills that could lead to a new job, like Mike, or a job that pays more, gives you more opportunity. But all of you are here because you believe in yourselves, you believe in your ability, you believe in the future of this country. And that's something that inspires me, and you guys should take great pride in. <p>Now the truth is, the skills and training you get here will be the best tools you have to achieve the American promise, the promise that if you work hard, you can do well enough to raise a family, own a home, send your kids to college, and put a little away for retirement. <p>And the defining issue of our time is how to keep this promise alive today, for everybody. Because we've got a choice: We can settle for a country where a few people do really, really well and everybody else struggles to get by. Or we can restore an economy where everybody gets a fair shot, everybody does their fair share, everybody plays by the same set of rules, from Washington to Wall Street to Main Street. That's the America we believe in. <p>Now, we're still recovering from one of the worst economic crises in three generations. We've got a long way to go before everybody who wants a good job can find one, before middle class Americans regain that sense of security that's been slipping away for too long&mdash;long before the recession hit. <p>But over the last 23 months, we've added 3.7 million new jobs. American manufacturers are creating jobs for the first time since the 1990s. The economy is growing stronger. The recovery is speeding up. And the last thing we can afford to do right now is to go back to the very policies that got us into this mess in the first place. We can't afford it. The last thing we need is for Washington to stand in the way of America's comeback. <p>Now, what does that mean concretely? For starters, Congress needs to stop taxes from going up on 160 million Americans by the end of this month. And if they don't act, that's exactly what will happen. Congress needs to pass an extension of the payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance without drama and without delay and without linking it to some other ideological side issues. <p>We've been through this before, remember? We've seen this movie. We don't need to see it again. The time for self-inflicted wounds to our economy has to be over. Now is the time for action. Now is the time for all of us to move forward. <p>But preventing a tax hike on the middle class, that's only the beginning, that's just starters. In the State of the Union, I outlined a blueprint for an economy that is built to last, an economy built on new manufacturing and new sources of energy and new skills and education for the American people. <p>Today we're releasing the details of that blueprint in the form of next year's budget. And don't worry, I will not read it to you. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's long and a lot of numbers. But the main idea in the budget is this: At a time when our economy is growing and creating jobs at a faster clip, we've got to do everything in our power to keep this recovery on track. <p>Part of our job is to bring down our deficit. And if Congress adopts this budget, then along with the cuts that we've already made, we'll be able to reduce our deficit by $4 trillion by the year 2022&mdash;$4 trillion. I'm proposing some difficult cuts that frankly I wouldn't normally make if they weren't absolutely necessary. But they are. And the truth is we're going to have to make some tough choices in order to put this country back on a more sustainable fiscal path. <p>By reducing our deficit in the long term, what that allows us to do is to invest in the things that will help grow our economy right now. We can't cut back on those things that are important for us to grow. We can't just cut our way into growth. We can cut back on the things that we don't need, but we also have to make sure that everyone is paying their fair share for the things that we do need. <p>We need to restore American manufacturing by ending tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas, giving them to companies that are creating jobs right here in the United States of America. That's something that everybody should agree on. <p>We need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil by ending the subsidies for oil companies and doubling down on clean energy that generates jobs and strengthens our security. <p>And to make sure our businesses don't have to move overseas to find skilled workers, we've got to invest in places like NOVA and make sure higher education is affordable for every hard-working American. <p>That's what I want to focus on today, what we need to do in terms of higher education and community colleges in particular. Employers today are looking for the most skilled, educated workers. I don't want them to find them in India or China. I want businesses to find those workers right here in the United States. The skills and training that employers are looking for begins with the men and women who educate our children. <p>All of us can point to a teacher who's made a difference in our lives&mdash;and I know I can. So I want this Congress to give our schools the resources to keep good teachers on the job and reward the best teachers. And in return, they also need to give schools the flexibility to stop just teaching to the test and replace teachers who aren't helping kids learn. That's something that we can do. <p>So making sure we've got the most skilled workers starts early. It starts with K through 12&mdash;it starts before K through 12, making sure every child is prepared. And when an American of any age wants to pursue any kind of higher education, whether it's that high school grad who's just trying to get that first couple years of college education or somebody like Mike who's in the process of retraining, whether it's 2 years or 4 years or more, we've got to make sure that education is affordable and available to everybody who wants to go. <p>Now, this Congress needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling this July. That's pretty important. That's in our budget. We're saying to Congress, now is not the time to make school more expensive for young people. And they can act right now to make that change. <p>They also need to take the tuition tax credit that my administration put in the budget over these last few years&mdash;a tax credit that saves families thousands of dollars on tuition&mdash;and we need to make that permanent. It shouldn't be temporary, it should be permanent. <p>So between the increases we've provided in Pell grants, these tax credits, keeping interest rates low, all that's going to help. And millions of students across the country have benefited from that. But students and taxpayers can't just keep on subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we're going to run out of money. So that's why I've asked States and colleges to do their part to keep costs down. <p>We're putting colleges and universities on notice: You can't just keep on raising tuition and expect us to keep on coming up with more and more money. Because tuition inflation has actually gone up even faster than health care. That's hard to do. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So what we're saying to States, colleges, and universities: If you can't stop tuition from going up, then funding you get from taxpayers will go down because higher education cannot be a luxury. It is an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford. That's part of the American promise in the 21st century. <p>So that's what we need to do to get more Americans ready for the jobs of the future. But what about the jobs that are open today? I talked about this at the State of the Union. There are millions of jobs open right now, and there are millions of people who are unemployed. And the question is how do we match up those workers to those jobs? What about the companies that are looking to hire right now? <p>I hear from business leaders all the time who want to hire in the United States, but at the moment, they cannot always find workers with the right skills. Growing industries in science and technology have twice as many openings as we have workers who can do those jobs. Think about that. At a time when millions of Americans are looking for work, we shouldn't have any job openings out there. They should all be getting filled up. <p>Here in America, we've got the best workers and some of the fastest growing companies in the world. There's no reason we can't connect the two. And places like NOVA are proving that we know how to do it. This institution proves we know how to do it. <p>So let's say you are a single parent or a returning veteran or somebody who just wants a shot at a better paying job. You're a hard worker, you're a fast learner, you're motivated. You know there are companies looking to hire. You just need to figure out how to acquire some of the specific skills, the specialized skills that the companies need, and you need to figure that out as quickly as possible, hopefully without taking on tons of debt. Everybody in America should be able to get those skills at a community college like NOVA. And companies looking to hire should be able to count on these schools to provide them with a steady stream of workers qualified to fill those specific jobs. <p>That's why Mike was sharing his story. As Mike mentioned, he worked in the mortgage and real estate industry for 10 years, but when business declined after 9/11, he decided to start over. So he began selling building materials. Then the bottom fell out of the housing market, so Mike had to start all over again. He's got a knack for computers. So he figured he'd try a career in cybersecurity, where there is a lot of hiring&mdash;that is going to be a growth industry. <p>Luckily for Mike, NOVA is home to a program called CyberWatch. So he signed up; even though he's driving a limo on the side, he's still got to pay the bills. So he's working while going to school. But in December, Mike earned two certificates and, by the way, finished with a 4.0. So we're proud of that. Now he's working towards his Associate's degree. And when he graduates, Mike will have access to a network of over 40 companies and government agencies to help him find a job. <p>So we need more stories like Mike's. That's why my administration is helping community colleges redesign training programs, so students can learn the skills that are most in demand in industries like health care sciences and advanced manufacturing. And that's why we're making a national commitment to train 2 million Americans with skills they need to get a job right now or start their own business right now. <p>We've lined up more companies that want to help. We've already got model partnerships between major businesses like Siemens and community colleges in places like Charlotte and Orlando and Louisville. They're already up and running. We know how they work. And that's why I've asked Dr. Biden, Secretary Solis to take a bus tour through several States, including Ohio and Kentucky and North Carolina, to highlight businesses and community colleges that are working together to train workers for careers that are in demand right now. We've got to make these examples a model for the entire Nation. <p>And we also need to give more community colleges the resources they need to become community career centers&mdash;places where folks can learn the skills that local business are looking for right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing. This should be an engine of job growth all across the country, these community colleges, and that's why we've got to support them. That's why it's such a big priority. <p>So an economy built to last demands that we keep doing everything we can to help students learn the skills that businesses are looking for. It means we have to keep strengthening American manufacturing. It means we've got to keep investing in American energy. We've got to double down on the clean energy that's creating jobs. But it also means we've got to renew the American values of fair play and shared responsibility. <p>The budget that we're releasing today is a reflection of shared responsibility. It says that if we're serious about investing in our future and investing in community colleges and investing in new energy technology and investing in basic research, well, we've got to pay for it. And that means we've got to make some choices. <p>Right now, we're scheduled to spend nearly $1 trillion more on what was intended to be a temporary tax cut for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. We've already spent about that much. Now we're scheduled to spend another trillion. Keep in mind, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle class households. You've heard me say it: Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary. That's not fair. It doesn't make sense at a time when we've got to pull together to get the country moving. <p>I don't need a tax break. We don't need to be providing additional tax cuts for folks who are doing really, really, really well. Do we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Or do we want to keep investing in everything else: education, clean energy, a strong military, care for our veterans? We can't do both. We can't afford it. <p>Some people go around, they say, well, the President is engaging in class warfare. That's not class warfare. That's common sense. That's common sense. Asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary when it comes to his tax rate&mdash;that's just common sense. Because Warren Buffet is doing fine, I'm doing fine. We don't need the tax breaks. You need them. You're the ones who see your wages stall. You're the one whose costs of everything from college to groceries has gone up. You're the ones who deserve a break. <p>And we don't begrudge success in America; we aspire to it. Everybody here&mdash;I want everybody here to go out there and do great. I want you to make loads of money if you can. That's wonderful. And we expect people to earn it, study hard, work hard for it. So we don't envy the wealthy. But we do expect everybody to do their fair share, so that everybody has opportunity, not just some. <p>And given where our deficit is, it's just a matter of math that folks like me are going to have to do a little bit more. Because Americans understand if I get a tax break I don't need and the country can't afford, then one of two things is going to happen: Either that means we have to add to our deficit, or it means you've got to pay for it. It means a senior has got to pay for it, in terms of suddenly their Medicare benefits are costing more. It means a student suddenly sees their interest rates go up higher at a time when they can't afford it. It means a family that's struggling to get by is having to do more because I'm doing less. <p>That's not right. It's not who we are. Each of us is here only because somebody, somewhere, felt a responsibility to each other and to our country's future. That's why they made investments in places like NOVA. <p>Here in America, the story has never been about what we can do just by ourselves; it's about what we can do together. It's about believing in our future and the future of our country. You believe in that future. That's why you're working hard. That's why you're putting in the long hours. That's why Mike is doing what he's doing. Some of you are balancing a job at the same time as you're going to school. You're scrimping and scratching to make sure that you can pay tuition here. You know that doing big things isn't easy, but you haven't given up. <p>That's the spirit we've got to have right now. We don't give up in this country. We look out for each other. We pull together. We work hard. We reach for new opportunities. We pull each other up. That's who we are. And if we work together in common purpose, we will build an economy that lasts and remind people around the world why America is the greatest country on Earth. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"36" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you, everybody. Please, please have a seat. Thank you. Thank you so much for joining us in this celebration of the arts and the humanities. Two outstanding public servants and ambassadors for the arts are here: Rocco Landesman&mdash;where's Rocco? There he is, right here&mdash;Chairman of the National Endowment of the Arts; and Jim Leach&mdash;where's Jim? Good to see you, Jim&mdash;the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities. <p>We also have two good friends and Cochairs of the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities who are here: Margo Lions and George Stevens. And I also want to acknowledge one of our honorees who unfortunately could not make it. Ever the artist, Andre Watts had a concert to give in Salt Lake City. [<i>Laughter</i>] So give him a big round of applause in his absence. <p>Michelle and I love this event. This is something we look forward to every single year because it's a moment when America has a chance to pay tribute to extraordinary men and women who have excelled in the arts and the humanities and who, along the way, have left an indelible mark on American culture. That's all the honorees we see here today. We honor your talents, we honor your careers, and your remarkable contributions to this country that we love. <p>Throughout our history, America has advanced not only because of the will of our citizens, not only because of the vision of our leaders or the might of our military. America has also advanced because of paintings and poems, stories and songs, the dramas and the dances that provide us comfort and instilled in us confidence, inspired in us a sense of mutual understanding and a calling to always strive for a more perfect Union. <p>Emily Dickinson wrote, \\"I dwell in possibility.\\" I dwell in possibility. And so does the American spirit. That's who we are as a people. And that's who our honorees are. Each of you have traveled a unique path to get here, and your fields represent the full spectrum of the arts and humanities. With us are actors and poets, authors, singers, philosophers, sculptors, curators, musicians, and historians. We even have an economist, which we don't always get on stage, but&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;what connects every one of you is that you dwell in possibilities. You create new possibilities for all of us. <p>And that's a special trait. And it assigns you a special task. Because in moments of calm, as in moments of crisis, in times of triumph as in times of tragedy, you help guide our growth as a people. The true power of the arts and the humanities is that you speak to everyone. There is not one of us here who hasn't had their beliefs challenged by a writer's eloquence or their knowledge deepened by a historian's insights or their sagging spirits lifted by a singer's voice. Those are some of the most endearing and memorable moments in our lives. <p>Equal to the impact you have on each of us every day as individuals is the impact you have on us as a society. And we are told we're divided as a people, and then suddenly, the arts have this power to bring us together and speak to our common condition. <p>Recently, I've been reminded of Walt Whitman's famous poem \\"I Hear America Singing.\\" And it's a poem that with simple eloquence spotlights our diversity and our spirit of rugged individualism, the messy, energized, dynamic sense of what it is to be an American. And Whitman lifts up the voices of mechanics and carpenters, masons and boatmen, shoemakers, woodcutters, the mother and the young wife at work, \\"each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else.\\" <p>And it's true that we all have songs in our souls that are only ours. We all have a unique part in the story of America. But that story is bigger than any one of us. And it endures because we are all heirs to a fundamental truth: that out of many are one, this incredible multitude. <p>I hear America singing today. I hear America singing through the artists and the writers that we honor this afternoon, the men and women who are following in the footsteps of Whitman and Hemingway, Souza and Armstrong, and Eakins and Rockwell. But I also hear America singing through the artists and writers who will be sitting here a few decades from now with another President, the students in Denver who recently wrote a play about teenage homelessness or the kids in Grand Rapids who designed a mural to bring joy to a struggling community. They're singing what Whitman called \\"strong melodious songs.\\" <p>And somewhere in America, the next great writer is wrestling with the first draft of an English paper. [<i>Laughter</i>] Somewhere the next great actor is mustering up the courage to try out for that school play. Somewhere the next great artist is doodling on their homework. Somewhere the next great thinker is asking their teacher, \\"Why not?\\" They're out there right now, dwelling in possibility. <p>So as we honor the icons of today, we also have to champion the icons of tomorrow. They need our support; we need them to succeed. We need them to succeed as much as we need engineers and scientists. We also need artists and scholars. We need them to take the mantle from you, to do their part to disrupt our views and to challenge our presumptions and most of all to stir in us a need to be our better selves. <p>The arts and the humanities do not just reflect America, they shape America. And as long as I am President, I look forward to making sure they are a priority for this country, so&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>It is now my distinct privilege to present these medals to the award winners who we have here today. And as the citations are read, I'm sure you've gotten extensive instructions from our military aides, so&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;. <p>[<i>At this point, Maj. Gary Marlowe, USAF, Military Aide to the President. read the citations, and the President presented the medals.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Will you please stand and give a big hand to our award winners today. <p>Well, we are just blessed to have this incredible array of talent and inspiration with us here today. We are so glad we had the opportunity to make this small gesture of appreciation and thanks to all that you have contributed to us. <p>Each and every day you continue to inform who we are as a people, and we could not be prouder of everything that you've done, and we know you've got a lot more to do, so keep at it. <p>In the meantime, for everybody who is gathered here today, we have a wonderful reception. So please enjoy. The food is usually pretty good around here. [<i>Laughter</i>] The music is even better. I think the Marine Band will probably be out there playing a few tunes. And again, we are very thankful to all the honorees here today for everything that you've done for our country. Congratulations.\" "
"37" "\"Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat. Well, good morning. And let me start with a quick public service announcement for all the gentlemen out there: Today is Valentine's Day. [<i>Laughter</i>] Do not forget. I speak from experience here. [<i>Laughter</i>] It is important that you remember this. And go big; that's my advice. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Lately, I've been saying that this is a make-or-break moment for the middle class in America and for folks who want to be in the middle class. We face a choice. We can settle for a country where a few people do really, really well and everybody else struggles just to get by. Or we can restore an economy where everybody gets a fair shot, and everybody is doing their fair share, and everybody is playing by the same set of rules. And that second option is, I strongly believe, the kind of America that we want for our kids and our grandkids. That's who we are. That's the America that we believe in. That's what we have to roll up our sleeves and get back to doing, is creating an America where everybody is doing their fair share, everybody gets a fair shot, everybody is engaging in fair play. <p>We're still fighting our way back from the worst economic crisis in our lifetimes, and we've still got a lot of work to do and a long way to go. It's going to take time to recover all the jobs that were lost when the recession was at its depths. But the fight is beginning to turn our way. <p>Over the past 2 years, our businesses have added over 3.7 million new jobs. Our manufacturers are hiring more new workers to make more new things here in America than at any time since the 1990s. So our economy is growing stronger. And the last thing we need, the last thing we can afford to do, is to go back to the same policies that got us in this mess in the first place. The last thing we need is for Washington to stand in the way of America's comeback. <p>First and foremost, that means Washington shouldn't hike taxes on working Americans right now. That's the wrong thing to do. But that's exactly what's going to happen at the end of this month, in a couple of weeks, if Congress doesn't do something about it. The payroll tax cut we put in place last year will expire. The typical American family will shell out nearly a thousand dollars more in taxes this year. You'll lose about $40 out of every paycheck if Congress does not act. <p>And that can't happen. Not now. And it doesn't have to. Congress needs to extend that tax cut, along with vital insurance lifelines for folks who've lost their jobs during this recession, and they need to do it now, without drama and without delay. No ideological sideshows to gum up the works. No self-inflicted wounds. Just pass this middle class tax cut. Pass the extension of unemployment insurance. Do it before it's too late. And I will sign it right away. <p>Now, the good news is over the last couple of days, we've seen some hopeful signs in Congress that they realize that they've got to get this done, and you're starting to hear voices talk about how can we go ahead and make this happen in a timely way on behalf of the American people. That is good news. But as you guys know, you can't take anything for granted here in Washington until my signature is actually on it. <p>So we've got to keep on making sure that the American people's voices keep breaking through until this is absolutely, finally, completely done. Until you see me sign this thing, you've got to keep on speaking up. Until you see that photograph of me signing it at my desk&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;make sure it's verified, certified. If it's not on the White House web site, it hasn't happened. And I'm going to need to make sure that your voices are heard. <p>Last December, when we had this same fight, your voices made all the difference. We asked folks to tell what it was like&mdash;what it would be like if they lost $40 out of every one of their paychecks because we wanted to make sure that people understood this is not just an abstract argument; this is concrete. This makes a difference in the lives of folks all across the country in very important ways. <p>Tens of thousands of working Americans flooded us with their stories, and some of them are here with me today. And their feedback has been pretty unanimous. Allowing this tax cut to expire would make people's lives harder right now. It would make their choices more difficult. It would be $40 less for groceries to feed your kids. It would be $40 less for the medications you depend on, $40 less to cover bills and the rent, $40 less to take care of an elder parent or to donate to a church or a charity. And when gas prices are on the rise again&mdash;because as the economy strengthens, global demand for oil increases&mdash;and if we start seeing significant increases in gas prices, losing that $40 could not come at a worse time. <p>One local entrepreneur named Thierry&mdash;where's Thierry? He's right here. He told us that $40 would cover the gas that gets him to his day job or, alternatively, the Internet service that his small business depends on. So he'd have to start making a choice: Do I fill up my gas tank to get to my work, or do I give up my entrepreneurial dream? \\"Forty dollars,\\" he wrote, \\"means a heck of a lot.\\" Means a heck of a lot. <p>And that's what this debate is all about. This is what's at stake for millions of Americans. This is why it matters to people; it matters a heck of a lot. And I'm asking the American people to keep their stories coming. Tell us what $40 means to you. If you tweet it, use the hashtag \\"40dollars.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Call, tweet, write your Congressmen, write your Senators. Tell them, do not let up until this thing gets done. Don't let taxes go up on 160 million working Americans. Don't let millions of Americans who are out there looking for work right now&mdash;and the economy is starting to improve, but they don't have a job yet&mdash;don't leave them without a lifeline in terms of cutting off their unemployment insurance. <p>When a plane is finally lifting off the ground, you don't ease up on the throttle. You keep the throttle on full. You keep going. And our plane is up there, but we're not at cruising altitude yet. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>After all, extending this tax cut and the unemployment insurance is the least of what we should be doing for working Americans. It's just a start. We need to rebuild an economy where middle class folks can focus on more than just getting by and folks who want to get in the middle class have those ladders to get into the middle class. We've got to rebuild an economy where the middle class thrives and more Americans have a chance to earn their way into it: an economy built to last. <p>Yesterday I released a blueprint for how we get there. It's a blueprint for an economy built on new American manufacturing and new American energy sources and new skills and education for American workers and a new focus on the values that are the bedrock of this country, values like fairness and responsibility for all and from all. We're going to be better off if we start building that economy right now. <p>And we can do it because we've done it before. We have a common challenge; it's time for us to meet it with a common purpose and to show a sense of seriousness that's equal to the task. <p>So on behalf of all the hard-working Americans who are standing behind me, I want to thank you for helping to tell your story and tell the story of why this is so important. And I just want everybody, all across the country, to keep the pressure so that we get this done. It is going to make our economy stronger, and it's going to put us in a position where we can start really rebuilding on behalf of not just this generation, but future generations. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"38" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Milwaukee! It is good to be back in the great State of Wisconsin. This is the closest I've been to home in a while. I was thinking about getting on the 90/94 and just driving down to my house. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Thank you, DiAndre, for that outstanding introduction and for sharing your story. I can tell, though, DiAndre is a little shy. He doesn't necessarily like to get out in front of people. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Before I begin, I want to thank some additional special guests who are here. Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett is in the house. Your Congresswoman, Gwen Moore, is here. You heard from your local UAW representative, John Drew, and I got a great tour from the president of UAW Local 469, Mike Bink. And finally, I want to thank Master Lock CEO John Heppner for inviting us here today. <p>It is wonderful to be at Master Lock. I have to say, though, it brought back some memories. I was thinking about my gym locker in high school. [<i>Laughter</i>] And, you know, if you go into the boys' locker room in high school, sometimes it's a little powerful, the odor in there. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I was thinking about the fact that we weren't washing our stuff enough. [<i>Laughter</i>] And then I was thinking about, as I got older and I kept on using Master Locks, I became an even better customer because I couldn't always remember my combination. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I'd end up having to have the lock sawed off and buy a new one. So I was giving you guys a lot of business. <p>And now, as I was looking at some of the really industrial-size locks, I was thinking about the fact that I am a father of two girls who are soon going to be in high school, and that it might come in handy to have these super locks. [<i>Laughter</i>] For now, I'm just counting on the fact that when they go to school there are men with guns with them. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But I'm actually here today because this company has been making the most of a huge opportunity that exists right now to bring jobs and manufacturing back to the United States of America. <p>I talked about this during the State of the Union. Over the last few decades, revolutions in technology have made a lot of businesses more efficient and more productive. And that's a great thing. It means you generally have a better choice of products, you get better prices. But as some of you know, technology has also made a lot of jobs obsolete. And it's allowed companies to set up shop and hire workers almost anywhere in the world where there's an Internet connection; you can produce things that previously you could only produce here in the United States. <p>So the result has been a pretty painful process for a lot of families and for a lot of communities, especially here in the Midwest. Too many factories where people thought they'd retire suddenly left town. Too many jobs that provided a decent living got shipped overseas. And now the hard truth is, a lot of those jobs are not going to come back. In a global economy, some companies are always going to find it more profitable to pick up and do business in some other part of the world. That's just a fact. <p>But that doesn't mean we have to just sit by and settle for a lesser future. That doesn't mean there's nothing we can do to create new jobs and restore middle class security here in America. There is always something we can do. <p>For starters, I'm glad to see that Congress seems to be on the way of making progress on extending the payroll tax cut so taxes don't go up on all of you and a hundred and sixty million working Americans. This tax cut means that the typical American family will see an extra $40 in every paycheck this year. And that's going to help speed up this recovery. It will make a real difference in the lives of millions of people. And as soon as Congress sends me that extension of tax cuts and unemployment insurance to my desk, I will sign it right away. We're going to get that signed. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Love you, Mr. President! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But that's only a start. There's a lot more we can do&mdash;a lot more we have to do&mdash;to help create jobs and bring back manufacturing and middle class security to Milwaukee and Wisconsin and the United States of America. <p>Look, what&mdash;and we've got examples of success. When I took office&mdash;a lot of UAW workers here, you guys remember this&mdash;when I took office, the American auto industry was on the verge of collapse. And there were some folks who said we should let it die. With a million jobs at stake, I refused to let that happen. I refused to let that happen. <p>We said, in exchange for help, we're going to demand responsibility. We got workers and automakers to settle their differences. We got the industry to restructure and retool, come up with better designs. Today, the American auto industry is back. And General Motors is once again the number-one automaker in the world. Chrysler has grown faster in the U.S. than any major car company. Ford is investing billions in U.S. plants and equipment and factories. And all together, over the past 2 years, the entire industry has added nearly a hundred and sixty thousand jobs&mdash;well-paying jobs. <p>What's happening in Detroit can happen in other industries. What happens in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh and Milwaukee, that's what we've got to be shooting for, is to create opportunities for hard-working Americans to get in there and start making stuff again and sending it all over the world, products stamped with three proud words: Made in America. That's our goal. <p>And that's what's happening right here at Master Lock, because of you. Over the last few years, it's become more expensive to do business in countries like China. Meanwhile, American workers, we've become even more productive. So when John Heppner was at the White House in January, he told me how it makes more business sense for Master Lock to bring jobs back home here to Milwaukee. And today, for the first time in 15 years, this plant is running at full capacity. And that's an example of what happens when unions and employers work together to create good jobs. Today, you're selling products directly to customers in China stamped with those words: Made in America. <p>And the good news is this is starting to happen around the country. For the first time since 1990, American manufacturers are creating new jobs. That's good for the companies, but it's also good up and down the supply chain, because if you're making this stuff here, that means that there are producers and suppliers in and around the area who have a better chance of selling stuff here. It means the restaurant close by suddenly has more customers. Everybody benefits when manufacturing is going strong. <p>So you all have heard enough about outsourcing. More and more companies like Master Lock are now insourcing, deciding that if the cost of doing business here isn't too much different than the cost of doing business in places like China, then why wouldn't you rather do it right here in the United States of America? Why not? Why not put some Americans to work? <p>Companies would rather bet on the country with the best colleges and universities to train workers with new skills and produce cutting-edge research. They'd rather place their bet on the Nation with the greatest array of talent and ingenuity, the country with the greatest capacity for innovation that the world has ever known. <p>During the State of the Union, I issued a challenge to America's business leaders, folks like John. I said, ask yourself what you can do to bring jobs back to your country, and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed. And since then, a number of companies&mdash;large and small, domestic, but also even some foreign companies&mdash;have said they now plan to open new facilities and create new jobs right here in America, which is still the largest market on Earth. <p>These include Wisconsin companies like Diamond Precision, which is a machine manufacturer that's going to be adding dozens of jobs here in Milwaukee, a company that's growing because its customers are choosing to buy American-made products instead of supplies from China. There's a company called Collaborative Consulting, an information technology company that wants to open a new call center here in Wausau. And across the Nation, there are well-known companies like Caterpillar that are planning to bring jobs back home. <p>So last month, we decided to hold a summit&mdash;that's where John was at&mdash;a summit at the White House so we could hear from companies like these who've decided to insource jobs. We wanted to learn how can we accelerate this trend. And this last fall, for the first time, we'll be bringing companies from around the world together with Governors and mayors and other leaders to discuss the benefits of investing and creating more jobs here in the United States. <p>So our job as a nation is to do everything we can to make the decision to insource more attractive for more companies. That's our top priority. That's our top priority. We've got to seize this moment of opportunity. We can't let it slip away. We've got an opportunity to create new American jobs and American manufacturing, put that back where it needs to be. <p>Now, one place to start is with our Tax Code. I talked about this a little bit at the State of the Union. Right now, companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas. <p><i>Audience members. </i>Boo! <p><i>The President. </i>They're taking deductions for the expenses of moving out of the United States. Meanwhile, companies that are doing the right thing and choosing to stay here, they get hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world. That doesn't make sense. Everybody knows it doesn't make sense. Politicians of both parties have been talking about changing it for years. So my message to Congress is: Don't wait. Get it done. Do it now. Let's get it done. <p>As Congress thinks about tax reform principles, there are some basic things they can do. First, if you're a business that wants to outsource jobs, you have that right, but you shouldn't get a tax deduction for doing it. That money should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like Master Lock that decide to bring jobs home. Give them the tax break. <p>Second of all, no American company should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas. So we've said, from now on, every multinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax. And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies that choose to stay and hire here in the United States of America. Give them a bigger tax break. <p>Third, if you're an American manufacturer, you should get a bigger tax cut. If you're a high-tech manufacturer, creating new products, new services, we should double the tax deduction you get for making products here in America. If you want to relocate in a community like this one that's been hard hit when factories left town, you should get help financing a new plant, financing new equipment, training new workers. <p>It is time to stop rewarding companies that ship jobs overseas and start rewarding companies that are creating jobs right here in the United States of America. And this Congress should send me these tax reforms right now. I will sign them right away. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Right now! <p><i>The President.</i> Right now. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Right now! Right now! Right now! <p><i>The President. </i>Right now. Right now. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, another thing we're doing to support American jobs is to make it easier for businesses like Master Lock to sell their products all over the world. Everybody knows Master Lock makes the best lock. So 2 years ago, I set a goal of doubling U.S. exports over 5 years. With the bipartisan trade agreements I signed into law, we're on track to meeting that goal ahead of schedule. Pretty soon, there are going to be millions of new customers for American goods in places like Panama and Colombia and South Korea. I want new cars on the streets of Seoul, South Korea, imported from Detroit and Toledo and Milwaukee. <p>There's nothing wrong with them being able to sell cars here. I just want to be able to sell cars there. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Even playing field, Mr. President&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The President.</i> Even playing field is what we want. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Yeah! <p><i>The President. </i>I'm going anywhere in the world to open up new markets for American products. And I'm not going to stand by when our competitors don't play by the same rules. It's not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours just because they're getting heavy subsidies from their government. <p>So I directed my administration to create a trade enforcement unit, and it's only got one job: investigating unfair trade practices in countries like China, making sure we've got an even playing field. Because when we've got an even playing field, I promise you, nobody is going to outcompete America. We've got the most productive workers on Earth. We've got the most creative entrepreneurs on Earth. Give us a level playing field, we will not lose. <p>Now part of creating that level playing field is also making sure that American workers have the skills that today's jobs require. And DiAndre talked about how he's&mdash;even though he's working, he's still going back to school. I know that Master Lock's decision to create even more jobs here in Milwaukee in part is going to depend&mdash;and this is part&mdash;something that John raised when we were at our meeting&mdash;it's going to depend on finding enough workers with the right training. <p>I had a chance to meet one of your coworkers, Eric&mdash;where's&mdash;is Eric here? There he is right there. So Eric and I were talking&mdash;been a die maker for a long time. He's older than he looks&mdash;[<i>Laughter</i>]&mdash;although we were comparing the gray in his beard to the gray on my head. [<i>Laughter</i>] But he was pointing out that he's actually been able to help make the machinery that he works on more efficient, which is making the company able to do more because it's not lying idle when certain orders aren't coming in. But that's an accumulation of experience that he's had over a couple of decades. <p>Now, not everybody is going to have all that experience, but the question is, can we make sure if they're&mdash;if they haven't already been working in this job, can they get that kind of training even before they're hired here at Master Lock so that they can provide that same value-added across the board? That's what's going to separate the companies that succeed from the companies that don't, is how skilled and talented the workers are and whether management is listening to the workers. Because that's important. Part of what allowed Eric to be successful was somebody&mdash;his supervisor said, hey, this guy has got pretty good ideas. <p>So that's why it's so important for the companies investing in training programs and partnering with nearby community colleges to help design courses and curriculum, so that when workers show up they're already ready to hit the ground running. That's why I've asked Congress to join me in a national commitment to train 2 million American workers with skills that will lead directly to a job. We need to give more community colleges the resources they need to become community career centers, places that teach people the skills that businesses like Master Lock are looking for right now. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Right now! <p><i>The President.</i> Right now. <p>There are jobs from data management to high-tech manufacturing that right now are open. And we've got a lot of folks out of work, but we've got to match up the folks who are out of work with the jobs. And sometimes the businesses may not be able to afford to train that person on the job, so let's have the community college help get the training. <p>At a time when so many Americans are out of work, there should not be any job openings, because every single job opening that comes up, somebody should be able to say, I want that job and I'm prepared and skilled to get it. <p>We're still recovering from one of the worst economic crises in three generations. And I'm not going to lie to you guys. You know it&mdash;we've still got a long way to go before everyone who wants a good job can find it. I'm sure that if we traveled all around here, there are a lot of folks who want work and can't find it. And when you're out of work, that wears on you. It's not just the income. It has to do with your sense of place and your sense of dignity and your ability to support your family and the pride that you take in making a good product. That's part of what America has always been about, is what our work means to us, the values we put behind our work. We don't just do it for a paycheck. <p>And so this has been hard on folks. It's been hard on our country. And it's going to take some time before middle class Americans regain the sense of security that's been slipping away way before this recession hit. A lot of these factories were moving out before this recession hit. There was a lot of outsourcing going on over the last 20 years. So we've got a long way to go. <p>But here's what I want everybody to remember. Over the last 23 months, businesses have added nearly 3.7 million new jobs. Manufacturing is coming back. Companies are starting to bring jobs back. The economy is getting stronger. The recovery is speeding up. We're moving in the right direction. And now we have to do everything in our power to keep our foot on the gas. And the last thing we can afford to do is go back to the same policies that got us into this mess. <p>Milwaukee, we are not going back to an economy that's weakened by outsourcing and bad debt and phony financial profits. We need an economy that is built to last, that is built on American manufacturing and American know-how and American-made energy and skills for American workers and the renewal of American values of hard work and fair play and shared responsibility. That's what we're about. That's what we're about. <p>And let me say this. These are not Democratic values or Republican values. These are American values. They have seen us through the most difficult challenges, through war and depressions and civil strife. But we've always come out on the other side stronger than we were before. We don't give up. This country does not give up. <p>And we make sure that everybody is brought along. We don't leave people behind. We look out for one another. We reach out to one another. We are going for new opportunities, but we pull each other up. That's who we are. <p>If we work together with common purpose, if we pull together with common effort, I've got no doubt we will rebuild this economy so it lasts. We're going to create more success stories like Master Lock, and we will remind the world just why it is the United States is the greatest nation on Earth. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"39" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Everett! It is great to be in Washington&mdash;not Washington, DC, in Washington State. And it is great to be here at Boeing. <p>I want to begin by first of all thanking Kathleen for that wonderful introduction. We were up there talking a little bit, and she's a pretty good representative of Boeing workers. Kathleen told me, \\"I have a motto: Every day, nobody will outwork me.\\" And that's a pretty good motto for Boeing, but it's also a pretty good motto for America. So give Kathleen a big round of applause. <p>I've been told we're standing in the biggest building in the world, so big you could fit Disneyland inside. Your heating bills must be crazy. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to thank Jim McNerney and Jim Albaugh for hosting us here today. Give them a big round of applause. Your machinist's leadership, Tom Buffenbarger, Rich Michalski, Tom Wroblewski and SPEEA President Tom McCarty are here. One of the finest Governors in the country, Chris Gregoire, is in the house. And I want to thank the mayor of Everett, Ray Stephanson, for having us here today. <p>Now, I want to thank all of you for also giving me a pretty smooth ride. [<i>Laughter</i>] As some of you may know, Air Force One was built right here in Everett, 25 years ago. In fact, I met&mdash;one of my guys that I met during the tour worked on the plane. So I told him he did a pretty good job. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's flying smooth. I get to see your handiwork in action every single day. But as wonderful as it is to fly Air Force One&mdash;and it is wonderful&mdash;it's hard not to be amazed by the Dreamliner. I notice this one is going to United, one of our outstanding carriers. And I have to mention that just because I'm from Chicago, so I've got to&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;give a few extra props there. <p>But this is the first commercial airplane to be made with 50 percent composite materials. It's lighter, it's faster, it's more fuel efficient than any airplane in its class. And it looks cool. [<i>Laughter</i>] The Dreamliner is the plane of the future. And by building it here, Boeing is taking advantage of a huge opportunity that exists right now to bring more jobs and manufacturing back to the United States of America. <p>We know that the last few decades haven't been easy for manufacturing. New technology has made businesses more efficient and more productive, and that's a good thing. That's what raises our standards of living. It means we can get better products for less. But that also means that companies need fewer workers to make the same amount of product as they used to. And technology makes it easier for companies to set up shop and hire workers anywhere where there's an internet connection. And so the result has been this transition process that's been incredibly painful for a lot of families and a lot of communities. A lot of communities that used to rely on a lot of factory jobs, they saw those shrink. They saw those get shipped off overseas. Too many factories, where people thought they'd retire, left home. Too many jobs that provided a steady, stable life, a middle class life for people, got shipped overseas. <p>And look, the hard truth is, a lot of those jobs aren't going to come back because of these increased efficiencies. And in a global economy, some companies are always going to find it more profitable to pick up and do business in other parts of the world. That's just the nature of a global economy. But that does not mean that we've got to just sit there and settle for a lesser future. I don't accept that idea. You don't accept that idea. America is a place where we can always do something to create new jobs and new opportunities and new manufacturing and new security for the middle class, and that's why I'm here today. That's our job. That's what we're going to do together. <p>Now just today, we actually took an important short-term step to strengthen our economy. Just before we got here, Congress did the right thing and voted to make sure that taxes would not go up on middle class families at the end of this month. Congress also agreed to extend unemployment insurance for millions of Americans&mdash;maybe some of your family members&mdash;who are still out there looking for a job. So I'm going to sign this bill right away when I get back home. <p>You guys may remember, this middle class tax cut is something I proposed in my jobs bill back in September. And because you kept the pressure on Congress, because you reminded people what it means to have 40 bucks taken out of your paycheck every week, it got done. This is a big deal. And I want to thank Members of Congress for listening to the voices of the American people. It is amazing what happens when Congress focuses on doing the right thing instead of just playing politics. This was a good example, and Congress should take pride in it. <p>But the payroll tax cut is just a start. If we want middle class families to get ahead, we've got to deal with a set of economic challenges that existed even before this recession hit. <p>And we've got a choice right now: We can either settle for a country where a few people do really well and everybody else is struggling, or we can restore an economy where everybody gets a fair shot and everybody does their fair share and everybody plays by the same set of rules, from Washington to Wall Street to Main Street. Everybody is doing their part. <p>We're still recovering from one of the worst economic crises in three generations, the worst in our lifetimes, for most of us. And we've still got a long way to go to make sure everybody who can&mdash;everybody who wants a job can find one and every family can regain that sense of security that was slipping away even before this recession hit. <p>But the tide is turning. The tide is beginning to turn our way. Over the last 23 months, businesses have created 3.7 million new jobs and American manufacturers are hiring for the first time since 1990 and the American auto industry is back and our economy is getting stronger. And that's why we can look towards a promising future. And Boeing is an example of that. But to keep it going, the last thing we can afford to do is to go back to the very same policies that got us into this mess in the first place. We can't go backwards, we got to go forwards. We can't go back to an economy that was weakened by outsourcing and bad debt and phony financial profits. <p>I want us to make stuff. I want us to sell stuff. So, in the State of the Union, I outlined a blueprint for an economy that's built to last, that has a strong foundation, an economy based on American manufacturing and American know-how, American-made energy, skills for American workers, and the values that made America great, the values that Kathleen talked about: hard work and fair play and shared responsibility. That's what America is about. <p>And that blueprint starts with American manufacturing. It starts with companies like this one. A lot of people say, well, there are going to be fewer manufacturing jobs than there were in the past. I already said we're more efficient now. What used to take a thousand people to make, you might only need a hundred now. We understand that. We understand that there are going to be more service jobs. That's important. We want to make sure that we're promoting service industries as well. But manufacturing has a special place in America. When we make stuff and we're selling stuff, that creates jobs beyond just this plant. It raises standards of living for everybody. <p>And here at Boeing, business is booming&mdash;booming. Last year, orders for commercial aircraft rose by more than 50 percent. And to meet that demand, Boeing hired 13,000 workers all across America, including 5,000 right here in Everett. Now the biggest challenge is how to turn out planes fast enough. Jay, that's a high-class problem to have. <p>So this company is a great example of what American manufacturing can do, in a way that nobody else in the world can do it. And the impact of your success, as I said, goes beyond the walls of this plant. Every Dreamliner that rolls off the assembly line here in Everett supports thousands of jobs in different industries all across the country. Parts of the fuselage are manufactured in South Carolina and Kansas. Wing edges, they come from Oklahoma. Engines assembled in Ohio. The tail fin comes from right down the road in Frederickson. And the people in every one of these communities, some of whom&mdash;who are here today, they are benefiting from the work that you do. <p>All those workers, they spend money at the local store. They go to restaurants. So the service economy does better because you're doing well. And what's happening here in Everett can happen in other industries. It can happen not just here, but it can happen in Cleveland, in Pittsburgh, in Raleigh. We can't bring every job back. Anybody who says we can, they're not telling you the truth. But right now, it's getting more expensive to do business in places like China. Meanwhile, American workers have never been more productive. And companies like Boeing are finding out that even when we can't make things faster or cheaper than China, we can make them better. Our quality can be higher. And that's what America is about. That's how we're going to compete. <p>Now, during the State of the Union, I issued a challenge to America's business leaders. I said, ask yourselves what you can do to bring and create jobs here in this country, and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed. And I'm encouraged. We're actually seeing a number of companies&mdash;large and small, domestic, but even some foreign companies&mdash;recognizing, you know what, we're going to open new facilities and create new jobs here in America. <p>This is a good place to work. This is a good place to be. And our job as a nation is to make it easier for more of these companies to do the right thing. <p>That starts with our Tax Code. Right now, companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas. Meanwhile, companies that choose to stay in America get hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world. That doesn't make any sense. So my message to Congress is, what are we waiting for? Let's get this done right now. Let's make some changes to the Tax Code. <p>And let's follow some simple principles. First, if you're a business that wants to outsource jobs, that's your choice, but you shouldn't get a tax deduction for doing it. That money should be used to cover moving expenses for companies that are deciding to bring jobs back home. That's who should be getting tax breaks. <p>Second, no American company should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas. My attitude is every multinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax. You should not have an advantage by building a plant over there, over somebody who's investing here and hiring American workers. And every penny of that minimum tax should go towards lowering taxes for companies like Boeing that choose to stay and hire here in the United States of America. <p>Number three, if you're an American manufacturer, you should get a bigger tax cut. And if you're a high-tech manufacturer, we should double the tax deductions you get for making your products here. <p>And finally, if you want to relocate in a community that's been hard hit by factories leaving town, then you should get help financing that new plant or financing that equipment or training for new workers. <p>Everett, it is time to stop rewarding companies that ship jobs overseas. Reward companies that are creating jobs right here in the United States of America. Congress should send me these tax reforms. I'll sign them right away. <p>Now, another thing we're doing to support American jobs is making it easier for businesses like Boeing to sell their products all over the world. Two years ago, I set a goal of doubling U.S. exports in five years. We're on track to meet that goal. We're actually ahead of schedule. So last November when I was in Indonesia, Boeing announced a deal with the help of the Export-Import Bank to sell more than 200 planes to one of the fastest growing airlines in the world. Boeing is one of the largest exporters in America; this was one of the biggest deals Boeing had ever done. Over the years, it will help support thousands of American jobs, including jobs here in Everett. So I tease Jay every time I see him. I said, I deserve a gold watch because I'm selling your stuff all the time. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I will go anywhere in the world to open up new markets for American products. And by the way, I will not stand by when our competitors don't play by the rules. That's why I directed my administration to create a trade enforcement unit that just has one job: investigating unfair trade practices in countries like China or places like Europe. <p>That's why it's so important for Congress to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. This bank is led by Fred Hochberg, who is right here. He's out there working with Jay all the time, selling on behalf of Boeing. And the Export-Import Bank helps companies like this one sell its products. It also helps thousands of small businesses. <p>And today the bank will be launching a new program to help small businesses get the financing they need to sell more products overseas. I'm also instructing the bank to give American companies a fair shot by matching the unfair export financing that their competitors receive from other countries. <p>American workers&mdash;you guys, folks like Kathleen&mdash;you're the most productive on Earth. You can compete with anybody. You will outwork anybody, as long as the level&mdash;as long as the playing field is level. You can compete with any worker, anywhere, any time, in China, in Europe, it does not matter. If we have a level playing field, America will always win because we've got the best workers. <p>It's also because we've always believed in the power of innovation. Innovation requires basic research. Look at this plane. This plane was first designed virtually using the same technology that was developed by NASA. Government research helped to create this plane. We got&mdash;I was in there fooling around with those windows, where you press them and they dim on their own. [<i>Laughter</i>] I kept on pressing the button, and&mdash;dimmed and got light&mdash;one touch with a finger. And the display is in the cockpit. They're projected on the windshield so pilots don't have to look down at their instruments; they can maintain their line of sight, even as they're getting all these readings. <p>Now, some of the work&mdash;the most advanced work&mdash;was done by engineers down in Huntsville, Alabama, who used to work on the International Space Station. Their expertise, a lot of those ideas, came out of Government research. We've got to support this kind of cutting-edge research. We need to maintain our innovative edge so that jobs and industries take root right here in the United States, not someplace else. <p>So, Everett, if we want to build an economy that lasts, that is strong, that has a strong foundation, that helps families get into the middle class and stay in the middle class, we've got to do everything we can to strengthen American manufacturing. We've got to make sure we're making it easier for companies like Boeing to create jobs here at home and sell our products abroad. We've got to keep on investing in American-made energy, and we've got to keep training American workers. And above all, we've got to renew the values that have always made this country great: hard work, fair play, shared responsibility. <p>These are not Democratic values or Republican values. These are American values. They've seen us through some tough challenges, but we've always emerged stronger than before because of these values. And we're going to come out stronger than before this time as well. And I know it because of the people who are here. <p>In December of 2009, the first Dreamliner took off on its maiden flight right here in Everett. Some of you were probably out there seeing it. It was a cold and windy day. That didn't stop 13,000 employees all from coming out and seeing what they had built, seeing the product of all their hard work suddenly filling the skies. <p>And one of these people was Sharon O'Hara. Is Sharon here? Where is Sharon? There's Sharon right there. Sharon works as an executive office administrator for the leaders of the Dreamliner team. Now, executive assistant means, basically, you're doing all the work. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, some of you may know that Sharon has been undergoing some treatment for cancer recently, so she's got her own battle. But her doctors recently told her she's healthy enough to come back to work. That's worth applauding. Sharon, there are a lot of people who are happy to see you back at work. <p>And I was hearing about this, and as Sharon tells the story about watching the first plane lift gently off the runway, just the way it was designed to do, she thought about everything that had gone into making this day possible, all the challenges, all the setbacks, the thousands of hours of brainpower and manpower&mdash;and womanpower. And what Sharon says is&mdash;this is a quote&mdash;\\"I had goosebumps and tears. We said we would do it, and we did.\\" That's a pretty good motto. You said you would do it, and you did. <p>That's what we do as Americans. That's the spirit we need right now. In this country, we don't give up, even when times are tough. We look out for one another. We reach for new opportunities. We pull each other up. We stay focused on the horizon. That's who we are. That's who we've always been. And if we work together right now, with common purpose and common effort, I have no doubt we will build an economy that lasts, and we will remind the world just why it is that the United States of America is the greatest country on Earth. We said it, we will do it. <p>God bless you. God bless the United States. Thank you.\" "
"40" "\"Hello, everybody. I'm speaking to you this week from the Boeing Plant in Everett, Washington. Boeing has been in this community for half a century, but it's what they're doing here today that has folks really excited, because at this plant they're building the plane of the future, the Dreamliner. It's an impressive sight. And to be honest, part of why I came was to see it up close. But I also came because this is a great example of how we can bring jobs and manufacturing back to America. <p>You see, the last few decades haven't been easy for manufacturing in this country. New technology has made businesses more efficient and productive&mdash;and that's good&mdash;but it's also made a lot of jobs obsolete. The result has been painful for a lot of families and a lot of communities. Factories where people thought they'd retire have left town. Jobs that provided a decent living have been shipped overseas. And the hard truth is that a lot of those jobs aren't coming back. <p>But that doesn't mean we have to settle for a lesser future. I don't accept that idea. In America, there's always something we can do to create new jobs and new manufacturing and new security for the middle class. In America, we don't give up, we get up. <p>Right now, that's exactly what we're doing. Over the past 23 months, businesses have created 3.7 million new jobs. And manufacturers are hiring for the first time since the 1990s. It's now getting more expensive to do business in places like China. Meanwhile, America is more productive than ever. And companies like Boeing are realizing that even when we can't make things cheaper than China, we can make things better. That's how we're going to compete globally. <p>For Boeing, business right now is booming. Last year, orders for commercial aircraft rose by more than 50 percent. To meet that rising demand, they've put thousands of folks to work all over the country. And we want to see more of this. We need to make it as easy as we can for our companies to create more jobs in America, not overseas. And that starts with our Tax Code. <p>No company should get a tax break for outsourcing jobs. Instead, tax breaks should go to manufacturers who set up shop here at home. Bigger tax breaks should go to high-tech manufacturers who create the jobs of the future. And if you relocate your company in a struggling community, you should get help financing that new plant, that new equipment, or for training for new workers. It's time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas and start rewarding businesses that create jobs here in America. And Congress should send me that kind of tax reform right away. <p>Another thing we're doing is to make it easier for companies like Boeing to sell their products all over the world, because more exports mean more jobs. Two years ago, I set a goal of doubling U.S. exports over 5 years. And we're on track to meet that goal, ahead of schedule. <p>We have a big opportunity right now to build not only an economy that will help us succeed today, but an economy that will help our kids and their kids succeed tomorrow. We know what we need to do. We need to strengthen American manufacturing. We need to invest in American-made energy and new skills for American workers. And above all, we need to renew the values that have always made this country great: hard work, fair play, shared responsibility. <p>We can do this. Ask the folks in Everett. Right here, a few years ago, the first Dreamliner took off on its maiden trip. Thousands of employees came to watch. One was an executive office administrator named Sharon O'Hara. And as Sharon saw that first plane take flight &mdash;a result of so much hard work&mdash;she got goose bumps. In her words, she said, \\"We said we would do it and we did.\\" That's the story of America. We said we would do it, and we did. That's the can-do spirit that makes us who we are. We've seen challenging times before. But we always emerge from them stronger. And that's what we're going to do again today. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"41" "\"Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat. That sounded pretty good. [<i>Laughter</i>] I might try that instead of ruffles and flourishes. [<i>Laughter</i>]<p>Well, first of all, I want to wish everybody a happy Mardi Gras. I hear Trombone Shorty brought some beads up from New Orleans. And I see that we've got some members of our Cabinet here. We've got some Members of Congress. And we have elected officials from all across the country. <p>One of the things about being President&mdash;I've talked about this before&mdash;is that some nights when you want to go out and just take a walk, clear your head, or jump into a car just to take a drive, you can't do it. Secret Service won't let you. And that's frustrating. But then there are other nights where B.B. King and Mick Jagger come over to your house to play for a concert. So I guess things even out a little bit. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>In 1941, the folklorist Alan Lomax travelled throughout the Deep South, recording local musicians on behalf of the Library of Congress. In Stovall, Mississippi, he met McKinley Morganfield, a guitar player who went by the nickname Muddy Waters. And Lomax sent Muddy two pressings from their sessions together, along with a check for $20. <p>Later in his life, Muddy recalled what happened next. He said: \\"I carried that record up to the corner, and I put it on the jukebox. Just played it and played it and said, I can do it&mdash;I can do it.\\" In many ways, that right there is the story of the blues. <p>This is music with humble beginnings, roots in slavery and segregation, a society that rarely treated Black Americans with the dignity and respect that they deserved. The blues bore witness to these hard times. And like so many of the men and women who sang them, the blues refused to be limited by the circumstances of their birth. <p>The music migrated north&mdash;from Mississippi Delta to Memphis to my hometown in Chicago. It helped lay the foundation for rock and roll and R&B and hip-hop. It inspired artists and audiences around the world. And as tonight's performers will demonstrate, the blues continue to draw a crowd. Because this music speaks to something universal. No one goes through life without both joy and pain, triumph and sorrow. The blues gets all of that, sometimes with just one lyric or one note. <p>And as we celebrate Black History Month, the blues reminds us that we've been through tougher times before. That's why I'm proud to have these artists here, and not just as a fan, but also as the President. Because their music teaches us that when we find ourselves at a crossroads, we don't shy away from our problems. We own them. We face up to them. We deal with them. We sing about them. We turn them into art. And even as we confront the challenges of today, we imagine a brighter tomorrow, saying, I can do it, just like Muddy Waters did all those years ago. <p>With that in mind, please join me in welcoming these extraordinary artists to the White House. And now, it is my pleasure to bring out our first performer to the stage, the King of the Blues, Mr. B.B. King.\" "
"42" "\"Hello! Good to see everybody. Please, have a seat. Have a seat. Good morning. I want to thank all of you for coming. <p>I want to thank my outstanding Vice President, Joe Biden, who is here today, and members of my administration for joining us. But most of all, I want to thank the men and women who are standing with me today, as well as all the Americans who made their voices heard during the debate about extending the payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance. <p>We are here because of you. This got done because of you. Because you called, you e-mailed, you tweeted your representatives, and you demanded action. You made it clear that you wanted to see some common sense in Washington. And because you did, no working American is going to see their taxes go up this year. That's good news. Because of what you did, millions of Americans who are out there still looking for work are going to continue to get help with unemployment insurance. That's because of you. I called on&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;that's worth applauding as well. <p>You'll remember I called on Congress to pass this middle class tax cut back in September as part of my broader jobs plan. And for the typical American family, it is a big deal. It means $40 extra in their paycheck. And that $40 helps to pay the rent, the groceries, the rising cost of gas, which is on a lot of people's minds right now. LaRonda Hill&mdash;right here&mdash;told us how $40 covers the water bill for a month. So this tax cut makes a difference for a lot of families. You can get back over here, Joe. [<i>Laughter</i>] And more people spending more money means more businesses will be able to hire more workers and the entire economy gets another boost just as the recovery is starting to gain some steam. <p>So Congress did the right thing here. They listened to the voices of the American people. Each side made a few compromises. We passed some important reforms to help turn unemployment insurance into reemployment insurance so that more people get training and the skills they need to get back in a job. We passed an initiative that will create jobs by expanding wireless broadband and ensuring that first responders have access to the latest lifesaving technologies. And we've got some first responders here. We're very grateful for the work that they do. <p>So in the end, everyone acted in the interests of the middle class and people who are striving to get into the middle class through hard work. And that's how it should be. That's what Americans expect, and that's what Americans deserve. <p>Now my message to Congress is: Don't stop here. Keep going. Keep taking the action that people are calling for to keep this economy growing. This may be an election year, but the American people have no patience for gridlock and just a reflexive partisanship and just paying attention to poll numbers and the next election instead of the next generation and what we can do to strengthen opportunity for all Americans. Americans don't have the luxury to put off tough decisions, and neither should we. There's a lot more we can do&mdash;and there's plenty of time to do it&mdash;if we want to build an economy where every American has a chance to find a good job that pays well and supports a family. <p>For example, Congress needs to pass my plan to help responsible homeowners save about $3,000 a year by refinancing their homes, their mortgages, at historically low rates. We're doing what we can administratively to provide some Americans that opportunity. I want all Americans to have that opportunity, and we need Congress to act to do it. <p>Congress needs to step up and support America's small businesses and especially companies that want to export. It's time we stop rewarding businesses that send jobs overseas, start rewarding companies right here that want to create jobs in the United States and sell to other countries as opposed to exporting jobs to other countries. That's what we need to do. Congress can act on that. <p>Congress needs to make the Buffett rule a reality. This is common sense. If you make more than a million dollars a year&mdash;make more than a million dollars a year&mdash;you should pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent. And if you do that, that means that if you make less than $250,000 a year, like 98 percent of Americans do, you shouldn't see your taxes go up. And we won't be adding to the deficit. <p>These are things we can do today. It shouldn't be that difficult. Now, whenever Congress refuses to act, Joe and I, we're going to act. In the months to come, wherever we have an opportunity, we're going to take steps on our own to keep this economy moving. Because we've got a choice right now. We can either settle for a country where a few people are doing very well and everybody else is having to just struggle to get by, or we can build an economy where everybody gets a fair shot, and everybody is doing their fair share, and everybody is taking responsibility, and everybody is playing by the same set of rules. And that's the economy that I want. <p>We still have some struggles out there. We're coming out of the worst economic crisis in our lifetimes. We've got a long way to go before every single person who's looking for a job can find a job. But where we stand now looks a lot different than where we stood a few years ago. Over the last 23 months, businesses have created 3.7 million new jobs. Manufacturers are hiring for the first time since the 1990s. The auto industry is back on top. Our recovery is gaining steam. Our economy is getting stronger. So we're headed in the right direction. And the last thing we should do is turn around and go back to the policies that weren't working in the first place. <p>That's why it's so important for us to stay focused and Congress to continue to do the things that the American people want to see done in order to improve the economy. We've got to build an economy that is built on American manufacturing and American-made energy and is improving the skills and capacity of American workers. We've got to make sure that when we think about energy, that we're fueling America by homegrown and alternative energy sources that make us more secure and less dependent on foreign oil. When we think about skills for American workers, we got to make sure that everybody has the opportunity not only for 4-year colleges, but also 2-year colleges, the community colleges that Dr. Jill Biden is doing such a great job promoting all across the country. <p>We've put forward plans on each of these areas that can make a huge difference. But most of all, we've got to have a return to some homespun American values: hard work, fair play, shared responsibility. That's who we are as a people. <p>And the reason I'm so confident in our future is because the folks who are standing with me today, some of the folks who are in the audience, because of all the families and workers and small-business owners and students and seniors that I've met over the last few weeks and that I've met during the course of my political career. When times are tough, Americans don't give up. They push ahead. They do whatever it takes to make their lives better, their communities better and their countries better. <p>And with or without Congress, every day I'm going to be continuing to fight with them. I do hope Congress joins me. Instead of spending the coming months in a lot of phony political debates, focusing on the next election, I hope that we spend some time focusing on middle class Americans and those who are struggling to get into the middle class. We've got a lot more work to do. Let's do it. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. Thanks for the great job you did. Appreciate you, proud of you. Thank you.\" "
"43" "\"Thank you so much. Please, have a seat. Thank you very much. Well, good morning, everybody. <p>I want to thank France for that introduction and for her leadership at the Smithsonian. I want to thank everybody who helped to make this day happen. I want to thank Laura Bush; Secretary Salazar; Sam Brownback; my hero, Congressman John Lewis; Wayne Clough, and everybody who's worked so hard to make this possible. <p>I am so proud of Lonnie Bunch, who came here from Chicago, I want to point out. [<i>Laughter</i>] I remember having a conversation with him about this job when he was planning to embark on this extraordinary journey. And we could not be prouder of the work that he has done to help make this day possible. <p>I promise to do my part by being brief. <p>As others have mentioned, this day has been a long time coming. The idea for a museum dedicated to African Americans was first put forward by Black veterans of the Civil War. And years later, the call was picked up by members of the civil rights generation, by men and women who knew how to fight for what was right and strive for what is just. This is their day. This is your day. It's an honor to be here to see the fruit of your labor. <p>It's also fitting that this museum has found a home on the National Mall. As has been mentioned, it was on this ground long ago that lives were once traded, where hundreds of thousands once marched for jobs and for freedom. It was here that the pillars of our democracy were built, often by Black hands. And it is on this spot, alongside the monuments to those who gave birth to this Nation and those who worked so hard to perfect it, that generations will remember the sometimes difficult, often inspirational, but always central role that African Americans have played in the life of our country. <p>This museum will celebrate that history. Because just as the memories of our earliest days have been confined to dusty letters and faded pictures, the time will come when few people remember drinking from a colored water fountain or boarding a segregated bus or hearing in person Dr. King's voice boom down from the Lincoln Memorial. That's why what we build here won't just be an achievement for our time, it will be a monument for all time. It will do more than simply keep those memories alive. <p>Just like the Air and Space Museum challenges us to set our sights higher, or the Natural History Museum encourages us to look closer, or the Holocaust Museum calls us to fight persecution wherever we find it, this museum should inspire us as well. It should stand as proof that the most important things in life rarely come quickly or easily. It should remind us that although we have yet to reach the mountaintop, we cannot stop climbing. <p>And that's why, in moments like this, I think about Malia and Sasha. I think about my daughters, and I think about your children, the millions of visitors who will stand where we stand long after we're gone. And I think about what I want them to experience. I think about what I want them to take away. <p>When our children look at Harriet Tubman's shawl or Nat Turner's Bible or the plane flown by Tuskegee Airmen, I don't want them to be seen as figures somehow larger than life. I want them to see how ordinary Americans could do extraordinary things, how men and women just like them had the courage and determination to right a wrong, to make it right. <p>I want my daughters to see the shackles that bound slaves on their voyage across the ocean and the shards of glass that flew from the 16th Street Baptist church and understand that injustice and evil exist in the world. But I also want them to hear Louis Armstrong's horn and learn about the Negro League and read the poems of Phyllis Wheatley. And I want them to appreciate this museum not just as a record of tragedy, but as a celebration of life. <p>When future generations hear these songs of pain and progress and struggle and sacrifice, I hope they will not think of them as somehow separate from the larger American story. I want them to see it as central, an important part of our shared story, a call to see ourselves in one another, a call to remember that each of us is made in God's image. That's the history we will preserve within these walls, the history of a people who, in the words of Dr. King, \\"injected new meaning and dignity into the veins of civilization.\\" <p>May we remember their stories. May we live up to their example. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\" "
"44" "\"This is for background because you guys just came in. What this facility does is teach these outstanding young engineers how to do energy assessments for manufacturers&mdash;industrial buildings across the board. And so far they have, how many, 200 assessments, saving these companies up to 25 percent in their energy usage. And that's going to end up saving them millions of dollars. <p>So it's a great example of how people are being trained, right now, to make our businesses more energy efficient all across the country. <p>All right.\" "
"45" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Miami! The U! It is good to see all of you here today. <p>I want to thank Erica for that outstanding introduction. She said her parents were tweeting. [<i>Laughter</i>] We're so proud of you, Erica. <p>I also want to thank your president, this country's former Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala. Senator Bill Nelson is here. Give him a big round of applause&mdash;former astronaut&mdash;that's too cool. [<i>Laughter</i>] And my outstanding friend, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, is in the house. <p>It is good to be back in sunny Florida. I must say I don't know how you guys go to class. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm assuming you do go to class. [<i>Laughter</i>] Too&mdash;it's just too nice outside. But in another life, I would be staying for the Knicks-Heat game tonight, then go up to Orlando for a NBA All-Star Weekend. But these days, I've got a few other things on my plate. [<i>Laughter</i>] Just a few. <p>I just got a fascinating demonstration of the work that some of you are doing at the College of Engineering. And let me say at the outset, we need more engineers. So I could not be prouder of those of you who are studying engineering. <p>It was fascinating stuff. I understood about 10 percent of what they told me. [<i>Laughter</i>] But it was very impressive. [<i>Laughter</i>] And the work couldn't be more important, because what they were doing was figuring out how our buildings, our manufacturers, our businesses can waste less energy. And that's one of the fastest, easiest ways to reduce our dependence on oil and save a lot of money in the process and make our economy stronger. <p>So some cutting-edge stuff is being done right here at the U. Now, that's what I'm here to talk about today. In the State of the Union, I laid out three areas where we need to focus if we want to build an economy that lasts and is good for the next generation, all of you. We need new American manufacturing. We've got to have new skills and education for America's workers, and we need new sources of American-made energy. <p>Now, right now we are experiencing just another painful reminder of why developing new energy is so critical to our future. Just like last year, gas prices are climbing across the country. This time, it's happening even earlier. And when gas prices go up, it hurts everybody: everybody who owns a car, everybody who owns a business. It means you've got to stretch a paycheck even further. It means you've got to find even more room in a budget that was already really tight. And some folks have no choice but to drive a long way to work, and high gas prices are like a tax straight out of your paycheck. <p>I got a letter last night; I get these letters, 10 letters every night that I read out of the 40,000 that are sent to me. And at least two of them said, I'm not sure I'm going to be able to keep my job if gas prices keep on going up so high, because it's just hard to manage the budget and fill up the tank. A lot of folks are going through tough times as a consequence. <p>Now, some politicians they see this as a political opportunity. I know you're shocked by that. [<i>Laughter</i>] Last week, the lead story in one newspaper said, \\"Gasoline prices are on the rise, and Republicans are licking their chops.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] That's a quote. That was the lead. \\"Licking their chops.\\" Only in politics do people root for bad news, do they greet bad news so enthusiastically. You pay more; they're licking their chops. <p>You can bet that since it's an election year, they're already dusting off their 3-point plan for $2 gas. And I'll save you the suspense. Step one is to drill, and step two is to drill. And then step three is to keep drilling. [<i>Laughter</i>] We heard the same line in 2007 when I was running for President. We hear the same thing every year. We've heard the same thing for 30 years. <p>Well, the American people aren't stupid. They know that's not a plan, especially since we're already drilling. That's a bumper sticker. It's not a strategy to solve our energy challenge. That's a strategy to get politicians through an election. <p>You know there are no quick fixes to this problem. You know we can't just drill our way to lower gas prices. If we're going to take control of our energy future and can start avoiding these annual gas price spikes that happen every year&mdash;when the economy starts getting better, world demand starts increasing, turmoil in the Middle East or some other parts of the world&mdash;if we're going to avoid being at the mercy of these world events, we've got to have a sustained, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy. Yes, oil and gas, but also wind and solar and nuclear and biofuels and more. <p>We need to keep developing the technology that allows us to use less oil in our cars and trucks, less energy for our buildings and our plants and our factories. That's the strategy we're pursuing, and that's the only real solution to this challenge. <p>Now, it starts with the need for safe, responsible oil production here in America. We're not going to transition out of oil anytime soon. And that's why under my administration, America is producing more oil today than at any time in the last 8 years. That's why we have a record number of oil rigs operating right now, more working oil and gas rigs than the rest of the world combined. <p>Over the last 3 years my administration has approved dozens of new pipelines, including from Canada. And we've opened millions of acres for oil and gas exploration. All told we plan to make available more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources from Alaska to the Gulf of Mexico. <p>Last week, we announced the next steps towards further energy exploration in the Arctic. Earlier this week, we joined Mexico in an agreement that will make more than 1.5 million acres in the Gulf available for exploration and production, which contains an estimated 172 million barrels of oil and 304 billion cubic feet of natural gas. <p>So we're focused on production. That's not the issue. And we'll keep on producing more homegrown energy. But here's the thing: It's not enough. The amount of oil that we drill at home doesn't set the price of gas by itself. The oil market is global; oil is bought and sold in a world market. And just like last year, the single biggest thing that's causing the price of oil to spike right now is instability in the Middle East, this time around Iran. When uncertainty increases, speculative trading on Wall Street increases, and that drives prices up even more. <p>So those are the biggest short-term factors at work here. <p>Over the long term, the biggest reason oil prices will probably keep going up is growing demand in countries like China and India and Brazil. I want you to all think about this. In 5 years, the number of cars on the road in China more than tripled&mdash;just in the last 5 years. Nearly 10 million cars were added in China in 2010 alone&mdash;10 million cars in 1 year in one country. Think about how much oil that requires. And as folks in China and India and Brazil, they aspire to buy a car just like Americans do, those numbers are only going to get bigger. <p>So what does this mean for us? It means that anybody who tells you that we can drill our way out of this problem doesn't know what they're talking about or just isn't telling you the truth. <p>And young people especially understand this, because I think&mdash;it's interesting, when I talk to Malia and Sasha&mdash;you guys are so much more aware than I was of conserving our natural resources and thinking about the planet. The United States consumes more than a fifth of the world's oil&mdash;more than 20 percent of the world's oil&mdash;just us. We only have 2 percent of the world's oil reserves. We consume 20; we've got 2. <p>And that means we can't just rely on fossil fuels from the last century. We can't just allow ourselves to be held hostage to the ups and downs of the world oil market. We've got to keep developing new sources of energy. We've got to develop new technology that helps us use less energy and use energy smarter. We've got to rely on American know-how and young engineers right here at the U who are focused on energy. That is our future. And that's exactly the path that my administration has been trying to take these past 3 years. <p>And we're making progress. That's the good news. In 2010, our dependence on foreign oil was under 50 percent for the first time in over a decade. We were less reliant on foreign oil than we had been. In 2011, the United States relied less on foreign oil than in any of the last 16 years. That's the good news. And because of the investments we've made, the use of clean, renewable energy in this country has nearly doubled, and thousands of American jobs have been created as a consequence. <p>We're taking every possible action to develop, safely, a near hundred-year supply of natural gas in this country; something that experts believe will support more than 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade. We supported the first new nuclear power plant in three decades. Our cooperation with the private sector has positioned this country to be the world's leading manufacturer of high-tech batteries that will power the next generation of American cars, that use less oil, maybe don't use any oil at all. <p>And after three decades of inaction, we put in place the toughest fuel economy standards in history for our cars and pickup trucks and the first standards ever for heavy-duty trucks. And because we did this, our cars will average nearly 55 miles per gallon by the middle of the next decade. That's nearly double what they get today. <p>Now I remember what it was like being a student. You guys probably have one of those old beaters. Who knows what kind of mileage you guys get. [<i>Laughter</i>] I can tell you some stories about the cars I had. I bought one for $500. But by the middle of the next decade, you guys are going to be buying some new cars&mdash;hopefully, sooner than that. And that means you'll be able to fill up your car every 2 weeks instead of every week, something that, over time, will save the typical family more than $8,000 at the pump. <p>And it means this country will reduce our oil consumption by more than 2 million barrels a day. That's not only good for your pocketbook, that's good for the environment. <p>All right, but here's the thing: We've got to do more. We've got to act even faster. We have to keep investing in the development of every available source of American-made energy. And this is a question of where our priorities are. This is a choice that we face. <p>Now, first of all, while there are no silver bullets short term when it comes to gas prices, and anybody who says otherwise isn't telling the truth. I have directed my administration to look for every single area where we can make an impact and help consumers in the months ahead, from permitting to delivery bottlenecks to what's going on in the oil markets. We're going to look at every single aspect of gas prices, because we know the burden that it's putting on consumers. And we will keep taking as many steps as we can in the coming weeks. <p>That's short term. But over the long term, an all-of-the-above energy strategy requires us having the right priorities. We've got to have the right incentives in place. I'll give you an example. Right now 4 billion of your tax dollars subsidize the oil industry every year&mdash;$4 billion. They don't need a subsidy. They're making near-record profits. These are the same oil companies that have been making record profits off the money you spend at the pump for several years now. How do they deserve another $4 billion from taxpayers and subsidies? <p>It's outrageous. It's inexcusable. And every politician who's been fighting to keep those subsidies in place should explain to the American people why the oil industry needs more of their money, especially at a time like this. <p>I said this at the State of the Union: A century of subsidies to the oil companies is long enough. It's time to end taxpayer giveaways to an industry that has never been more profitable, double down on clean energy industries that have never been more promising. That's what we need to do. This Congress needs to renew the clean energy tax credits that will lead to more jobs and less dependence on foreign oil. <p>The potential of a sustained, all-of-the-above energy strategy is all around us. Here in Miami&mdash;2008, Miami became the first major American city to power its city hall entirely with solar and renewable energy. Right here in Miami. The modernization of your power grid so that it wastes less energy is one of the largest projects of its kind in the country. On a typical day, the wind turbine at the Miami-Dade Museum can meet about 10 percent of the energy needs in a South Florida home, and the largest wind producer in the country is over at Juno Beach. Right here at this university, your work is helping manufacturers save millions of dollars in energy bills by making their facilities more energy efficient. <p>So a lot of work is already being done right here, just in this area. And the role of the Federal Government isn't to supplant this work, take over this work, direct this research. It is to support these discoveries. Our job is to help outstanding work that's being done in universities, in labs, and to help businesses get new energy ideas off the ground, because it was public dollars, public research dollars, that over the years helped develop the technologies that companies are right now using to extract all this natural gas out of shale rock. <p>The payoff on these public investments, they don't always come right away, and some technologies don't pan out, and some companies will fail. But as long as I'm President, I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy. Your future is too important. I will not&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;I will not cede, I will not give up. I will not cede the wind or the solar or the battery industry to China or Germany because some politicians in Washington have refused to make the same commitment here in America. <p>With or without this Congress, I will continue to do whatever I can to develop every source of American energy so our future isn't controlled by events on the other side of the world. <p>Today we're taking a step that will make it easier for companies to save money by investing in energy solutions that have been proven here in the University of Miami: new lighting systems, advanced heating and cooling systems that can lower a company's energy bills and make them more competitive. <p>We're launching a program that will bring together the Nation's best scientists and engineers and entrepreneurs to figure out how more cars can be powered by natural gas, a fuel that's cleaner and cheaper and more abundant than oil. We've got more of that. We don't have to import it. We may be exporting it soon. <p>We're making new investments in the development of gasoline and diesel and jet fuel that's actually made from a plant-like substance&mdash;algae. You've got a bunch of algae out here, right? [<i>Laughter</i>] If we can figure out how to make energy out of that, we'll be doing all right. <p>Believe it or not, we could replace up to 17 percent of the oil we import for transportation with this fuel that we can grow right here in the United States. And that means greater energy security. That means lower costs. It means more jobs. It means a stronger economy. <p>Now, none of the steps that I've talked about today is going to be a silver bullet. It's not going to bring down gas prices tomorrow. Remember, if anybody says they got a plan for that&mdash;what? <p><i>Audience members.</i> They're lying. <p><i>The President.</i> I'm just saying. We're not going to, overnight, solve the problem of world oil markets. There is no silver bullet. There never has been. <p>And part of the problem is, is when politicians pretend that there is, then we put off making the tough choices to develop new energy sources and become more energy efficient. We got to stop doing that. We don't have the luxury of pretending. We got to look at the facts, look at the science, figure out what we need to do. <p>We may not have a silver bullet, but we do have in this country limitless sources of energy, a boundless supply of ingenuity, huge imagination, amazing young people like you&mdash;all of which can put&mdash;all of which we can put to work to develop this new energy source. <p>Now, it's the easiest thing in the world to make phony election-year promises about lower gas prices. What's harder is to make a serious, sustained commitment to tackle a problem. And it won't be solved in one year, it won't be solved in one term, it may not be completely solved in one decade. But that's the kind of commitment we need right now. That's what this moment requires. <p>So I need all of you to keep at it. I need you guys to work hard. I need you guys to dream big. I need those of you who are a lot smarter than me to figure out how we're going to be able to tap into new energy sources. We've got to summon the spirit of optimism and that willingness to tackle tough problems that led previous generations to meet the challenges of their times: to power a nation from coast to coast, to send a man to the moon, to connect an entire world with our own science and our own imagination. <p>That's what America is capable of. That's what this country is about. And that history teaches us that whatever our challenges&mdash;all of them&mdash;whatever, whatever we face, we always have the power to solve them. <p>This is going to be one of the major challenges for your generation. Solving it is going to take time; it's going to take effort. It's going to require our brightest scientists, our most creative companies. But it's going to also require all of us as citizens&mdash;Democrats, Republicans, everybody in between&mdash;all of us are going to have to do our part. <p>If we do, the solution is within our reach. And I know we can do it. We have done it before. And when we do, we will remind the world once again just why it is that the United States of America is the greatest country on Earth. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"46" "\"Hi, everybody. In the State of the Union, I laid out three areas we need to focus on if we're going to build an economy that lasts: new American manufacturing, new skills and education for American workers, and new sources of American-made energy. <p>These days, we're getting another painful reminder why developing new energy is so important to our future. Just like they did last year, gas prices are starting to climb. Only this time, it's happening earlier. And that hurts everyone&mdash;everybody who owns a car, everybody who owns a business. It means you have to stretch your paycheck even further. Some folks have no choice but to drive a long way to work, and high gas prices are like a tax straight out of their paychecks. <p>Now, some politicians always see this as a political opportunity. And since it's an election year, they're already dusting off their same three-point plan for two dollar gas. I'll save you the suspense: Step one, according to them, is drill; step two is drill; and step three is to keep drilling. We hear the same thing every year. We've heard the same thing for 30 years. <p>Well the American people aren't stupid. You know that's not a plan, especially since we're already drilling. It's a bumper sticker. It's not a strategy to solve our energy challenge. It's a strategy to get politicians through an election. <p>You know there are no quick fixes to this problem, and you know we can't just drill our way to lower gas prices. If we're going to take control of our energy future and avoid these gas price spikes down the line, then we need a sustained all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy: oil, gas, wind, solar, nuclear, biofuels, and more. We need to keep developing the technology that allows us to use less oil in our cars and trucks, in our buildings and plants. That's the strategy we're pursuing, and that's the only real solution to this challenge. <p>Now, we absolutely need safe, responsible oil production here in America. And that's why under my administration, America is producing more oil today than at any time in the last 8 years. In 2010, our dependence on foreign oil was under 50 percent for the first time in more than a decade. And while there are no short-term silver bullets when it comes to gas prices, I've directed my administration to look for every single area where we can make an impact and help consumers in the months ahead, from permitting, to delivery bottlenecks, to what's going on in the oil markets. <p>But over the long term, an all-of-the-above energy strategy means we have to do more. It means we have to make some choices. <p>Here's one example: Right now, 4 billion of your tax dollars subsidize the oil industry every year. Four billion dollars&mdash;imagine that. Maybe some of you are listening to this in your car right now, pulling into a gas station to fill up; and as you watch those numbers rise, know that oil company profits have never been higher. Yet somehow, Congress is still giving those same companies another $4 billion of your money. It's outrageous, and it has to stop. <p>A century of subsidies to the oil companies is long enough. It's time to end taxpayer giveaways to an industry that's never been more profitable and use that money to reduce our deficit and double down on a clean energy industry that's never been more promising. Because of the investments we've already made, the use of wind and solar energy in this country has nearly doubled and thousands of Americans have jobs because of it. And because we put in place the toughest fuel economy standards in history, our cars will average nearly 55 miles per gallon by the middle of the next decade, something that, over time, will save the typical family more than $8,000 at the pump. Now Congress needs to keep that momentum going by renewing the clean energy tax credits that will lead to more jobs and less dependence on foreign oil. <p>Look, we know there's no silver bullet that will bring down gas prices or reduce our dependence on foreign oil overnight. But what we can do is get our priorities straight and make a sustained, serious effort to tackle this problem. That's the commitment we need right now. And with your help, it's a commitment we can make. Thanks.\" "
"47" "\"Good evening, everybody. Welcome to the White House. [<i>Laughter</i>] Did I hear an \\"aloha\\" back there? Yes. [<i>Laughter</i>] All right, Neil. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Let me begin by acknowledging your outstanding chair, Dave Heineman, who's doing an outstanding job in the great State of Nebraska, as well as your vice chair, Jack Markell, of the great State of Delaware, for their hard work. <p>I have heard that you've had some very productive meetings this weekend. I'm looking forward to having you back tomorrow. We'll be able to discuss a wide range of policy. <p>But tonight it's about having some fun. We've got the help of the great Dianne Reeves, who is going to be here, and we'll be hearing from later on. So I'm going to be brief, because, although some may disagree, she has a better voice than I do. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I've always said that Governors have one of the best, but also one of the toughest jobs around. On the one hand, you guys are in charge, which means that folks know where you live and they know how to find you if something doesn't work. [<i>Laughter</i>] They expect you to deliver when times are tough. But you're also in a position to make real and lasting change every single day. You're where rubber hits the road. And as a consequence, you can see your streets safer, your schools doing better by our children, our businesses growing faster, and our communities growing stronger because of the work that you do each and every day. <p>In recent months, I've had the privilege of seeing firsthand some of the outstanding work that you're doing in your respective States. I've seen the kinds of businesses that are growing in States like Iowa and Washington. I've seen States like Florida who are really doing great work increasing tourism and developing renewable energies. I often get a chance to go to Virginia and Maryland and States in the vicinity, where community colleges are doing a wonderful job retraining our people for the jobs of the future. <p>So every time I get a sense of what's happening in your States, I'm reminded that the progress is possible. And I want you to know that you've got a partner here in the White House. We're not going to agree on every single issue, every single day. But the thing about Governors is that by nature, and if not by nature, then by virtue of the position, you end up having to be pragmatic, because you have to figure out what works. And that's why I'm confident that we're going to be able to find more and more common ground going forward. <p>So I want everybody to have a great time tonight. By the way, you all look fabulous. [<i>Laughter</i>] You clean up very well. This house has actually seen its share of good times. The story goes that after the inauguration, Andrew Jackson opened the White House to the public and was nearly crushed by the crowd. As things started getting out of hand, the staff decided to pass barrels of ice cream and whiskey out the window&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;to get people out on the lawn, so they wouldn't cause damage and break the chandeliers and the furniture. <p>So I just want you to know, in case things get rowdy, we also have barrels standing by. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But now I'd like to propose a toast to all the Governors for your outstanding work, but especially to all the spouses who put up with us. Cheers. Thank you so much. <p>Cheers, everybody. All right. I hope you guys have a wonderful time. Let's serve it up. [<i>Laughter</i>]\" "
"48" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you, everybody. Thank you so much. Please, everybody have a seat. Have a seat. <p>Thank you, Joe, for the outstanding work you're doing on behalf of the American people every day. I want to thank all the members of my Cabinet and administration who are here today. I want to thank Dave Heineman and Jack Markell for the outstanding leadership that they've shown as they've chaired and cochaired the NGA. <p>I'm glad to see that everybody has recovered from the wild time we had last night. [<i>Laughter</i>] It was wonderful to have all of you here. <p>And I always look forward to this event because Governors are at the frontline of America's recovery. You see up close what's working, what's not working, and where we can take it. And the thing that connects all of us&mdash;and no matter what part of the country we're from and certainly no matter what party we belong to&mdash;is that we know what it means to govern, what it means to make tough choices during tough times, and hopefully, to forge some common ground. We've all felt the weight of big decisions and the impact that those decisions have on the people that we represent. <p>I first addressed this group 3 years ago, and it was the moment, as Joe mentioned, when the economy was in a freefall. Some of you were just coming into office at that time as well. Hundreds of thousands of Americans were losing their jobs or their homes every month. Businesses were closing their doors at a heartbreaking pace. Our entire auto industry was on the verge of collapse, and all told, the prospects of us going into a full-blown depression were very real. <p>Today, there's no doubt that enormous challenges remain. But the fact of the matter is that over the last 2 years American businesses have created 3.7 million new jobs. Manufacturers are hiring for the first time since the 1990s. The auto industry is back. Our recovery is gaining speed, and the economy is getting strong. And we've got to do everything we can to make sure that we sustain this progress. <p>That means we've got to strengthen American manufacturing so that more and more good jobs and products are made here in America. It means that we've got to develop new sources of American energy so that we're less dependent on foreign oil and yearly spikes in gas prices. And it means that we've got to make sure that every American is equipped with the skills, with the education that they need to compete for the jobs of tomorrow as well as the jobs of today. And that's what I want to talk to these Governors a little bit about. <p>No issue will have a bigger impact on the future performance of our economy than education. In the long run it's going to depend&mdash;determine whether or not businesses stay here. It will determine whether businesses are created here, whether businesses are hiring here. And it will determine whether there's going to be an abundance of good middle class jobs in America. <p>Today, the unemployment rate for Americans with at least a college degree is about half the national average. Their incomes are about twice as high as those who only have a high school diploma. So this is what we should be focused on as a nation. This is what we should be talking about and debating. The countries who out-educate us today will out-compete us tomorrow. That's a simple fact. And if we want America to continue to be number one and stay number one, we've got some work to do. <p>Now, in the last 3 years, the good news is we've made some important progress, working together. We've broken through the traditional stalemate between left and right by launching a national competition to improve our schools. And I think Arne has done an outstanding job of saying we've got to get past the old dogmas&mdash;whether it's the dogmas on the liberal side or the conservative side&mdash;and figure out what works. We've invested, but we've invested in reform. And for less than 1 percent of what our Nation spends on education each year, almost all of you have agreed to raise standards for teaching and learning. And that's the first time that's happened in a generation. <p>We've also worked with all of you&mdash;Democrats and Republicans&mdash;to try to fix No Child Left Behind. We said that if you're willing to set higher, more honest standards then we will give you more flexibility to meet those standards. Earlier this month, I announced the first 11 States to get a waiver from No Child Left Behind, and I hope that we are going to be adding more States soon. <p>I believe education is an issue that is best addressed at the State level. And Governors are in the best position to have the biggest impact. I realize that everybody is dealing with limited resources. Trust me, I know something about trying to deal with tight budgets. We've all faced some stark choices over the past several years. But that is no excuse to lose sight of what matters most. And the fact is that too many States are making cuts to education that I believe are simply too big. <p>Nothing more clearly signals what you value as a State than the decisions you make about where to invest. Budgets are about choices. So today I'm calling on all of you: Invest more in education. Invest more in our children and in our future. That does not mean you've got to invest in things that aren't working. That doesn't mean that it doesn't make sense to break some china and move aggressively on reform. But the fact of the matter is, we don't have to choose between resources and reform; we need resources and reform. <p>Now, there are two areas in education that demand our immediate focus. First, we've just got to get more teachers into our classrooms. Over the past 4 years, school districts across America have lost over 250,000 educators&mdash;250,000 teachers, educators have been lost. Think about that. A quarter-million educators, responsible for millions of our students, all laid off when America has never needed them more. <p>Other countries are doubling down on education and their investment in teachers, and we should too. And each of us is here only because at some point in our lives a teacher changed our life trajectory. The impact is often much bigger than even we realize. One study found that a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over $250,000: one teacher, one classroom. And a great teacher offers potentially an escape for a child who is dreaming beyond his circumstances. The point is, teachers matter, and all of us have to recognize that, and we've got to put our money behind that. <p>Now, we want to help you every place that we can. At the Federal level, we've already provided billions of dollars in funding to help keep hundreds of thousands of teachers in the classroom. And a cornerstone of the jobs plan that I put forward in September&mdash;a chunk of which has gotten done, but a chunk of which remains undone&mdash;was to provide even more funding, so that you could prevent further layoffs and rehire teachers that had lost their jobs. And I'd like to thank those of you in this room who voiced support for that effort. <p>Congress still is in a position to do the right thing. They can keep more teachers in the classroom, but you've got to keep the pressure up on them to get this done. <p>The second area where we have to bring greater focus is higher education. The jobs of the future are increasingly going to those with more than a high school degree. And I have to make a point here. When I speak about higher education we're not just talking about a 4-year degree. We're talking about somebody going to a community college and getting trained for that manufacturing job that now is requiring somebody walking through the door, handling a million-dollar piece of equipment. And they can't go in there unless they've got some basic training beyond what they received in high school. <p>We all want Americans getting those jobs of the future. So we're going to have to make sure that they're getting the education that they need. It starts, by the way, with just what kinds of expectation and ground rules we're setting for kids in high school. Right now 21 States require students to stay in high school until they graduate or turn 18&mdash;21 States. That means 29 don't. I believe that's the right thing to do, for us to make sure to send a message to our young people&mdash;you graduate from high school at a minimum. And I urge others to follow suit of those 21 States. <p>Now, for students that are ready for college, we've got to make sure that college is affordable. Today, graduates who take out loans leave college owing an average of $25,000. That's a staggering amount for young people. Americans now owe more in student loan debt than they do in credit card debt. There's so many Americans out there with so much to offer who are saddled with debt before they even start out in life. And the very idea of owing that much money puts college out of reach for far too many families. <p>So this is a major problem that must be fixed. I addressed it at the State of the Union. We have a role to play here. My grandfather got a chance to go to college because Americans and Congress decided that every returning veteran from World War II should be able to afford it. My mother was able to raise two kids by herself while still going to college and getting an advanced degree because she was able to get grants and work-study while she was in school. Michelle and I are only here today because of scholarships and student loans that gave us a good shot at a great education. And it wasn't easy to pay off these loans, but it sure wasn't as hard as it is for a lot of kids today. <p>So my administration has tried to do our part by making sure that the student loans program puts students before banks, by increasing aid like the Pell grants for millions of students and their families and by allowing students to cap their monthly loan payments at 10 percent of their income, which means that their repayment schedule is manageable. <p>Congress still needs to do its part by, first of all, keeping student interest rates low. Right now they are scheduled to double at the end of July if Congress does not act. And that would be a real tragedy for an awful lot of families around the country. They also need to extend the tuition tax credit for the middle class, protect Pell grants, and expand work-study programs. <p>But it's not enough to just focus on student aid. We can't just keep on, at the Federal level, subsidizing skyrocketing tuition. If tuition is going up faster than inflation&mdash;faster, actually, than health care costs&mdash;then no matter how much we subsidize it, sooner or later we are going to run out of money. So everybody else is going to have to do their part as well. This is not just a matter of the Federal Government coming up with more and more money. <p>That means colleges and universities are going to have to help to make their tuition more affordable. And I've put them on notice: If they are not taking some concrete steps to prevent tuition from going up, then Federal funding from taxpayers is going to go down. We've got to incentivize better practices in terms of keeping costs under control. And all of you have a role to play by making higher education a higher priority in your budgets. <p>Over two-thirds of students attend public colleges and universities where, traditionally, tuition has been affordable because of State investments. And that's something that every State takes pride in. That's the crown jewel, in fact, of our economic system&mdash;is, by far, we've got the best network of colleges, universities, and community colleges in the world. <p>But more than 40 States have cut funding for higher education over the past year. And this is just the peak of what has been a long-term trend in reduced State support for higher education. And State budget cuts have been among the largest factor in tuition hikes at public colleges over the past decade. <p>So my administration can do more, Congress can do more, colleges have to do more. But unless all of you also do more, this problem will not get solved. It can be done, though. <p>Jack O'Malley&mdash;where's Jack&mdash;not&mdash;Martin. Where's Martin? Sorry. I was&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland.</i> I thought my son was right here. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Right, right, right. <p>Martin in Maryland is doing some outstanding work on this front. He worked with the legislature to keep tuition down by controlling costs and cutting spending on college campuses, and you're seeing a real impact, from the flagship University of Maryland all the way down. And a lot of you are starting to experiment with this as well. <p>We can't allow higher education to be a luxury in this country. It's an economic imperative that every family in America has to be able to afford. And frankly, I don't think any of this should be a partisan issue. All of us should be about giving every American who wants a chance to succeed that chance. <p>So let me wrap up by saying a few weeks ago I held, right here in this room and in the adjoining room, one of my favorite events and that is the White House science fair. We invited students from a lot of your States, and they showcased projects that covered the full range of scientific discovery. <p>We had a group of kids from Texas, young Latino women, who came from the poorest section of Texas and yet were winning rocket competitions. And they were so good because they could only afford one rocket, so they couldn't test them, and they had to get it just right. [<i>Laughter</i>] And their parents ran bake sales just so they could travel to these events. <p>You had a young woman who was from Long Island, had been studying mussels and wanted to be an oceanographer, and won the Intel Science Award while she was homeless. Her family had lost their home, and she was living out of a car and out of her family's&mdash;on her family's couch, and yet still was able to stay focused and achieve what was just remarkable. <p>There was a kid&mdash;the kid who actually got the most attention was a young man named Joey Hudy of Arizona. That's because Joey let me fire off a extreme marshmallow cannon. [<i>Laughter</i>] We did it right here in this room. We shot it from here. We pumped it up&mdash;it almost hit that light. [<i>Laughter</i>] I thought it was a lot of fun. [<i>Laughter</i>] And while the cannon was impressive, Joey left a bigger impression because he had already printed out his own business cards&mdash;he was 14-years-old. And he was handing them out to everybody, including me. [<i>Laughter</i>] He's on a short list for a Cabinet post. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Under his name on each card was a simple motto: \\"Don't be bored; do something.\\" Don't be bored; do something. Don't be bored; make something. <p>All across this country there are kids like Joey who are dreaming big and are doing things and making things. And we want them to reach those heights. They're willing to work hard. They are willing to dig deep to achieve. And we've got a responsibility to give them a fair shot. If we do, then I'm absolutely convinced that our future is going to be as bright as all of us want. <p>So this is going to be something that I want to collaborate with all of you on. If you've got ideas about how we can make our education system work better, I want to hear them today, and Arne Duncan is going to want to hear them for the rest of the time that he's Education Secretary and the rest of the time I'm President. <p>All right? Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"49" "\"<i>The President.</i> How's it going, UAW? It is good to be with some autoworkers today! All right. Everybody have a seat, get comfortable. Go ahead and get comfortable. I'm going to talk for a little bit. <p>First of all, I want to say thank you to one of the finest leaders that we have in labor, Bob King. Give it up for Bob. I want to thank the International Executive Board and all of you for having me here today. It is a great honor. I brought along somebody who is proving to be one of the finest Secretaries of Transportation in our history&mdash;Ray LaHood is in the house. Give Ray a big round of applause. <p>It is always an honor to spend time with folks who represent the working men and women of America. It's unions like yours that fought for jobs and opportunity for generations of American workers. It's unions like yours that helped build the arsenal of democracy that defeated fascism and won World War II. It's unions like yours that forged the American middle class, that great engine of prosperity, the greatest that the world has ever known. <p>So you guys helped to write the American story. And today, you're busy writing a proud new chapter. You are reminding us that no matter how tough times get, Americans are tougher. No matter how many punches we take, we don't give up. We get up&mdash;we fight back&mdash;we move forward. We come out on the other side stronger than before. That's what you've shown us. You're showing us what's possible in America. So I'm here to tell you one thing today: You make me proud; you make me proud. <p>Take a minute and think about what you and the workers and the families that you represent have fought through. A few years ago, nearly one in five autoworkers were handed a pink slip&mdash;one in five. Four hundred thousand jobs across this industry vanished the year before I took office. And then as the financial crisis hit with its full force, America faced a hard and once unimaginable reality that two of the Big Three automakers, GM and Chrysler, were on the brink of liquidation. <p>The heartbeat of American manufacturing was flatlining, and we had to make a choice. With the economy in complete freefall, there were no private investors or companies out there willing to take a chance on the auto industry. Nobody was lining up to give you guys loans. Anyone in the financial sector can tell you that. <p>So we could have kept giving billions of dollars of taxpayer dollars to automakers without demanding the real changes or accountability in return, that were needed. That was one option. But that wouldn't have solved anything in the long term. Sooner or later we would have run out of money. We could have just kicked the problem down the road. The other option was to do absolutely nothing and let these companies fail. And you will recall, there were some politicians who said we should do that. Some even said we should \\"let Detroit go bankrupt.\\" <p>You remember that? You know. [<i>Laughter</i>] Think about what that choice would have meant for this country, if we had turned our backs on you, if America had thrown in the towel, if GM and Chrysler had gone under. The suppliers, the distributors that get their business from these companies, they would have died off. Then even Ford could have gone down as well. Production shut down, factories shuttered, once-proud companies chopped up and sold off for scraps, and all of you&mdash;the men and women who built these companies with your own hands&mdash;would have been hung out to dry. <p>More than 1 million Americans across the country would have lost their jobs in the middle of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. In communities across the Midwest, it would have been another great depression. And then think about all the people who depend on you. Not just your families, but the schoolteachers, the small-business owners, the server in the diner who knows your order, the bartender who's waiting for you to get off. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's right. Their livelihoods were at stake as well. <p>And you know what was else at stake? How many of you who've worked the assembly line had a father or a grandfather or a mother who worked on that same line? How many of you have sons and daughters who said, \\"You know, Mom, Dad, I'd like to work at the plant too?\\" <p>These jobs are worth more than just a paycheck. They're a source of pride. They're a ticket to a middle class life that make it possible for you to own a home and raise kids and maybe send them&mdash;yes&mdash;to college. Give you a chance to retire with some dignity and some respect. These companies are worth more than just the cars they build. They're a symbol of American innovation and know-how. They're the source of our manufacturing might. If that's not worth fighting for, what's worth fighting for? <p>So no, we were not going to take a knee and do nothing. We were not going to give up on your jobs and your families and your communities. So in exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. We said to the auto industry, you're going to have to truly change, not just pretend like you're changing. And thanks to outstanding leadership like Bob King, we were able to get labor and management to settle their differences. <p>We got the industry to retool and restructure, and everybody involved made sacrifices. Everybody had some skin in the game. And it wasn't popular. And it wasn't what I ran for President to do. I&mdash;that wasn't originally what I thought I was going to be doing as President. [<i>Laughter</i>] But you know what, I did run to make the tough calls and do the right things, no matter what the politics were. <p>And I want you to know: you know why I knew, you know why I knew this rescue would succeed? <p><i>Audience member.</i> How did you do it? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> You want to know? It wasn't because of anything the Government did. It wasn't just because of anything management did. It was because I believed in you. I placed my bet on the American worker. And I'll make that bet any day of the week. <p>And now, 3 years later, that bet is paying off. Not just paying off for you, it's paying off for America. Three years later, the American auto industry is back. GM is back on top as the number-one automaker in the world, highest profits in its 100-year history. Chrysler is growing faster in America than any other car company. Ford is investing billions in American plants, American factories, plans to bring thousands of jobs back to America. <p>All told, the entire industry has added more than 200,000 new jobs over the past 2&frac12; years&mdash;200,000 new jobs. And here's the best part: you're not just building cars again, you're building better cars. <p>After three decades of inaction, we're gradually putting in place the toughest fuel economy standards in history for our cars and pickups. That means the cars you build will average nearly 55 miles per gallon by the middle of next decade, almost double what they get today. That means folks, every time they fill up, they're going to be saving money. They'll have to fill up every 2 weeks instead of every week. That saves the typical family more than $8,000 at the pump over time. That means we'll cut our oil consumption by more than 2 million barrels a day. That means we have to import less oil while we're selling more cars all around the world. <p>Thanks to the bipartisan trade agreement I signed into law, with you in mind, working with you, there will soon be new cars in the streets of South Korea imported from Detroit and from Toledo and from Chicago. <p>And today&mdash;I talked about this at the State of the Union, we are doing it today. I am creating a trade enforcement unit that will bring the full resources of the Federal Government to bear on investigations, and we're going to counter any unfair trading practices around the world, including by countries like China. America has the best workers in the world. When the playing field is level, nobody will beat us. And we're going to make sure that playing field is level. <p>Because America always wins when the playing field is level&mdash;and because everyone came together and worked together&mdash;the most high-tech, fuel-efficient, good-looking cars in the world are once again designed and engineered and forged and built, not in Europe, not in Asia, right here in the United States of America. <p>I've seen it myself. I've seen it at Chrysler's Jefferson North Plant in Detroit, where a new shift of more than 1,000 workers came on 2 years ago, another 1,000 slated to come on next year. I've seen it in my hometown at Ford's Chicago assembly, where workers are building a new Explorer and selling it to dozens of countries around the world. <p><i>Audience member.</i> I'm buying one too! <p><i>The President.</i> There you go. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I've seen it at GM's Lordstown plant in Ohio, where workers got their jobs back to build the Chevy Cobalt, and at GM's Hamtramck plant in Detroit, where I got to get inside a brandnew Chevy Volt fresh off the line, even though Secret Service wouldn't let me drive it. But I liked sitting in it. It was nice. I'll bet it drives real good. [<i>Laughter</i>] And 5 years from now, when I'm not President anymore, I'll buy one and drive it myself. Yes, that's right. <p>Look, I know our bet was a good one because I had seen it pay off firsthand. But here's the thing. You don't have to take my word for it. Ask the Chrysler workers near Kokomo, who were brought on to make sure the newest high-tech transmissions and fuel-efficient engines are made in America. Or, ask the GM workers in Spring Hill, Tennessee, whose jobs were saved from being sent abroad. Ask the Ford workers in Kansas City coming on to make the F-150, America's best-selling truck, a more fuel-efficient truck. And you ask all the suppliers who are expanding and hiring, and the communities that rely on them, if America's investment in you was a good bet. They'll tell you the right answer. <p>And who knows, maybe the naysayers would finally come around and say that standing by America's workers was the right thing to do. Because, I've got to admit, it's been funny to watch some of these folks completely try to rewrite history now that you're back on your feet. The same folks who said, if we went forward with our plan to rescue Detroit, \\"you can kiss the American automotive industry goodbye.\\" Now they're saying, we were right all along. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Or, you've got folks saying, well, the real problem is&mdash;what we really disagreed with was the workers&mdash;they all made out like bandits, that saving the auto industry was just about paying back the unions. Really? I mean, even by the standards of this town, that's a load of you know what. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>About 700,000 retirees had to make sacrifices on their health care benefits that they had earned. A lot of you saw hours reduced or pay or wages scaled back. You gave up some of your rights as workers. Promises were made to you over the years that you gave up for the sake and survival of this industry, its workers, their families. You want to talk about sacrifice? You made sacrifices. This wasn't an easy thing to do. <p>Let me tell you, I keep on hearing these same folks talk about values all the time. You want to talk about values? Hard work, that's a value. Looking out for one another, that's a value. The idea that we're all in it together and I'm my brother's keeper and sister's keeper, that's a value. <p>They're out there talking about you like you're some special interest that needs to be beaten down. Since when are hard-working men and women who are putting in a hard day's work every day, since when are they special interests? Since when is the idea that we look out for one another a bad thing? <p>I remember my old friend Ted Kennedy. he used to say, what is it about working men and women they find so offensive? [<i>Laughter</i>] This notion that we should have let the auto industry die, that we should pursue antiworker policies in the hopes that unions like yours will buckle and unravel, that's part of that same old \\"you are on your own\\" philosophy that says we should just leave everybody to fend for themselves, let the most powerful do whatever they please. <p>They think the best way to boost the economy is to roll back the reforms we put into place to prevent another crisis, to let Wall Street write the rules again. They think the best way to help families afford health care is to roll back the reforms we passed that's already lowering costs for millions of Americans. They want to go back to the days when insurance companies could deny your coverage or jack up your rates whenever and however they pleased. They think we should keep cutting taxes for those at the very top, for people like me, even though we don't need it, just so they can keep paying lower tax rates than their secretaries. <p>Well, let me tell you something. Not to put too fine a point on it&mdash;they're wrong. [<i>Laughter</i>] They are wrong. That's the philosophy that got us into this mess. We can't afford to go back to it. Not now. <p>We've got a lot of work to do. We've got a long way to go before everybody who wants a good job can get a good job. We've got a long way to go before middle class Americans fully regain that sense of security that's been slipping away since long before this recession hit. But, you know what? We've got something to show. All of you show what's possible when we pull together. <p>Over the last 2 years, our businesses have added about 3.7 million new jobs. Manufacturing is coming back for the first time since the 1990s. Companies are bringing jobs back from overseas. The economy is getting stronger. The recovery is speeding up. Now is the time to keep our foot on the gas, not put on the brakes. And I'm not going to settle for a country where just a few do really well and everybody else is struggling to get by. <p>We're fighting for an economy where everybody gets a fair shot, where everybody does their fair share, where everybody plays by the same set of rules. We're not going to go back to an economy that's all about outsourcing and bad debt and phony profits. We're fighting for an economy that's built to last, that's built on things like education and energy and manufacturing&mdash;making things, not just buying things, making things that the rest of the worlds want to buy. And restoring the values that made this country great: hard work and fair play, the chance to make it if you really try, the responsibility to reach back and help somebody else make it too, not just you. That's who we are. That's what we believe in. <p>I was telling you, I visited Chrysler's Jefferson North Plant in Detroit about a year and a half ago. Now, the day I visited, some of the employees had won the lottery. Not kidding. They had won the lottery. Now you might think that after that, they'd all be kicking back and retiring. [<i>Laughter</i>] And no one would fault them for that. Building cars is tough work. But that's not what they did. The guy who bought&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> What did they do? <p><i>The President.</i> Funny you ask. [<i>Laughter</i>] The guy who bought the winning ticket, he was a proud UAW member who worked on the line. So he used some of his winnings to buy his wife the car that he builds because he's really proud of his work. Then he bought brand new American flags for his hometown, because he's proud of his country. And he and the other winners are still clocking in at that plant today, because they're proud of the part they and their coworkers play in America's comeback. <p>See, that's what America is about. America is not just looking out for yourself. It's not just about greed. It's not just about trying to climb to the very top and keep everybody else down. When our assembly lines grind to a halt, we work together and we get them going again. When somebody else falters, we try to give them a hand up, because we know we're all in it together. <p>I got my start standing with working folks who'd lost their jobs, folks who had lost their hope, because the steel plants had closed down. I didn't like the idea that they didn't have anybody fighting for them. The same reason I got into this business is the same reason I'm here today. I'm driven by that same belief that everybody&mdash;everybody&mdash;should deserve a chance. <p>So I promise you this, as long as you've got an ounce of fight left in you, I'll have a ton of fight left in me. We're going to keep on fighting to make our economy stronger, to put our friends and neighbors back to work faster, to give our children even more opportunity, to make sure that the United States of America remains the greatest nation on Earth. <p>Thank you, UAW. I love you. God bless you. God bless the work you do. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"50" "\"Thank you so much, everyone. Please, please. Please, everyone, have a seat. <p>Thank you, Joe Biden, for not only outstanding remarks, but the extraordinary leadership you showed in helping to guide our policies. <p>To Secretary Panetta, General Dempsey, to all the commanders who are here and did so much under such extraordinary circumstances to arrive at an outcome in which the Iraqi people have an opportunity to chart their own destiny, thank you for the great work that you've done. <p>I do have to say, despite Deanie's advice, I thought Dempsey was going to burst into song. [<i>Laughter</i>] You have not lived until you hear him belt out an Irish ballad. His voice is better than mine. I think you're never a prophet in your own land, Marty, so your wives are there to cut you down a peg. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: This house has stood for more than two centuries, through war and peace, through hardship and through prosperity. These rooms have hosted Presidents and Prime Ministers and kings and queens. But in the history of this house, there's never been a night quite like this. Because this evening, we welcome, not the statesmen who decide great questions of war and peace, but citizens, men and women from every corner of our country, from every rank of our military, every branch of our service, who answer the call, who go to war, who defend the peace. <p>And in a culture that celebrates fame and fortune, yours are not necessarily household names. They're something more: the patriots who serve in our name. And after nearly 9 years of war in Iraq, tonight is an opportunity for us to express our gratitude and to say once more: Welcome home. <p>This is not the first time that we've paid tribute to those who served courageously in Iraq. This will not be the last. And history reminds us of our obligations as a nation at moments like this. This year will mark the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam war, a time when our veterans didn't always receive the respect and the thanks that they so richly deserved, and that's a mistake that we must never repeat. <p>The good news is, already, we've seen Americans come together&mdash;in small towns and big cities all across the country&mdash;to honor your service in Iraq. And tonight, on behalf of Michelle and myself, on behalf of over 300 Americans&mdash;300 million Americans, we want to express those simple words that we can never say enough, and that's thank you. <p>In your heart, each of you carries your own story: the pride of a job well done, the pain of losing a friend, a comrade. Ernie Pyle, who celebrated our GIs in World War II, said that your world can never be known to the rest of us. Tonight what we can do is convey what you've meant to the rest of us, because through the dust and the din and the fog of war, the glory of your service always shone through. In your noble example, we see the virtues and the values that sustain America, that keep this country great. <p>You taught us about duty. Blessed to live in the land of the free, you could have opted for an easier path, but you know that freedom is not free. And so you volunteered, and you stepped forward, and you raised your hand, and you took an oath to protect and defend, to serve a cause greater than yourself, knowing, in a time of war, you could be sent into harm's way. <p>You taught us about resolve. Invasion turned to insurgency and then sectarian strife. But you persevered, tour after tour, year after year. Indeed, we're mindful that even as we gather here, Iraq veterans continue to risk their lives in Afghanistan, and our prayers are with them all tonight. <p>In one of our Nation's longest wars, you wrote one of the most extraordinary chapters in American military history. Now the Iraqi people have a chance to forge their own destiny, and every one of you who served there can take pride in knowing you gave the Iraqis this opportunity, that you succeeded in your mission. <p>You taught us about devotion to country and to comrades, but most of all, to family. Because I know that some of the hardest days of war were the moments you missed back home: the birthdays, the anniversaries, when your little girl or boy took their first wobbly steps. And behind every one of you was a parent, a spouse, a son or a daughter, trying to stay strong and praying for the day that you'd come home safe. And that's why Michelle and Dr. Biden have made it their mission to make sure America takes care of your families, because they inspire us as much as you do. And they deserve that honor as much as you do. <p>That's why I'd ask all the spouses and the partners and families to stand up and accept our gratitude for your remarkable service, especially because you look so good tonight. <p>You taught us about sacrifice, a love of country so deep, so profound, you were willing to give your lives for it. And tonight we pay solemn tribute to all who did. We remember the first, on that first day of war: Major Jay Thomas Aubin, Captain Ryan Anthony Beaupre, Corporal Brian Matthew Kennedy, Staff Sergeant Kendall Damon Waters-Bey. And we remember the last, Specialist David Emanuel Hickman, November 14, 2011. <p>Separated by nearly 9 years, they are bound for all time, among the nearly 4,500 American patriots who gave all that they had to give. To their families, including the Gold Star families here tonight, know that we will never forget their sacrifice and that your loved ones live on in the soul of our Nation, now and forever. <p>You taught us about strength, the kind that comes from within, the kind that we see in our wounded warriors. For you, coming home was the start of another battle: the battle to recover, to stand, to walk, to serve again. And in your resilience we see the essence of America, because we do not give up. No matter the hardship, we push on. And just as the wounds of war can last a lifetime, so does America's commitment to you and all who serve to give you the care you earned and the opportunities you need as you begin the next proud chapter in your lives. <p>And finally, all of you taught us a lesson about the character of our country. As you look across this room tonight, you look at our military&mdash;we draw strength from every part of our American family&mdash;every color, every creed, every background, every belief, and every day, you succeed together, as one American team. <p>As your Commander in Chief, I could not be more proud of you. As an American, as a husband and father of two daughters, I could not be more grateful for your example of the kind of country we can be, of what we can achieve when we stick together. <p>So I'll leave you with a picture that captures this spirit. It's from that day in December, when the last convoy rolled out, five American soldiers standing beside their vehicle, marked with the words, \\"Last vehicle out of Iraq.\\" They're young, men and women, shoulder to shoulder, proud, heads held high, finally going home. And they were asked what it was like to be, literally, the last troops out of Iraq. And one of them gave a simple reply: \\"We completed the mission.\\" We completed the mission. We did our jobs. <p>So I propose a toast: To the country we love, to the men and women who defend her, and to that faith&mdash;that fundamental American faith&mdash;that says no mission is too hard, no challenge is too great, through tests and through trials, we don't simply endure, we emerge stronger than before, knowing that America's greatest days are still to come, and they are great because of you. <p>Cheers. <p>[<i>At this point, the President offered a toast</i>.] <p>God bless you and your families, and may God continue to bless those in uniform and the United States of America. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. May dinner be served.\" "
"51" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Nashua! It is good to be back in New Hampshire! <p>Thank you, Mike, for that wonderful introduction and for your service to our country. I want to thank the president of Nashua Community College, Lucille Jordan, for hosting us here today. Give Lucille a big round of applause. We've got Professor Paul [Karl] * Wunderlich, who gave me a great tour. Where's Paul? Where is he? He's got a beard; you can see him. [<i>Laughter</i>] There he is. And I want to thank your mayor, Donnalee Lozeau, for joining us here today. Where's Donnalee? Right over there&mdash;there. Right in there. It is&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. It is good to be back in New Hampshire. <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>]&mdash;911! 911! <p><i>The President.</i> Oh&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> Somebody's down! <p><i>The President.</i> Okay, we'll be all right. They probably were just standing too long. Just give them a little space. Do&mdash;where's our EMS folks? They'll be okay. Just give them a little space. This happens sometimes. You guys been here a while after the magging? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes. <p><i>The President.</i> Well, no, you have to eat ahead of time. [<i>Laughter</i>] Keep your blood sugar high. We got somebody over there? Jordan, right in the middle. There we go. Here's our guy. Make a little room, everybody. All right, let's make sure everybody is okay. <p>[<i>At this point, the President paused in his remarks momentarily.</i>] <p>You all right? All good? Okay. I think you're going to be all right. Okay. So remember, eat before you come to a Presidential event. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, I am from Chicago, so you know a little snow was not going to keep me away, which is why I can relate to New Hampshirites, because this is just, like, a dusting. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's like, what's the big deal? There's no big deal. When Air Force One landed, there were, like, 50 people waiting to shake my hand. They got icicles on their eyebrows. [<i>Laughter</i>] I&mdash;hey, great weather. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I want to thank all of you for making the trek out here. I really appreciate it. <p>I just had a chance to look at some of the cutting-edge work that's being done here at the auto shop. Earlier this week, I gave a speech to American autoworkers where I said that one reason this country has an auto industry today is because we're not just building cars again, we're building better cars, cars that&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;we're building cars that use less oil, cars that go further on a gallon of gas. And in part, that's because of what's happening in places like this community college. It's because of so many of you. <p>* <i>White House correction.</i> <p>I don't need to tell you why fuel efficiency is so important, especially right now. Most of you filled up your gas tanks in the last week or two, am I right? <p>It hasn't been a happy experience. You've seen the prices go up almost every day, and you've already felt the pinch, whether you own a car or maybe you own a small business that uses energy. Some of you have no choice but to drive a long way to work. And higher gas prices are like a tax straight out of your paycheck. And in the winter, the rising price of oil is also making it more expensive to heat your homes. <p>Now, I know this is hard to believe, but some politicians are seeing higher gas prices as a political opportunity. You're shocked, I know. [<i>Laughter</i>] But it's true&mdash;right in the middle of an election year. Who would have thought? [<i>Laughter</i>] So recently, the lead in one news story said, and I'm quoting here, \\"Gasoline prices are on the rise, and Republicans are licking their chops.\\" Licking their chops. Now let me tell you, only in politics do people respond to bad news with such enthusiasm. [<i>Laughter</i>] That doesn't happen anywhere else. <p>And so as a consequence, you can anticipate we're going to be hearing a lot about how people have these magic three-point plans to make sure that you're only paying two-dollar-a-gallon gas. Just like we heard about it in the last election, just like we've heard about it for the last 30 years. And you know what the essence of their plan is going to be, which is: Step one, drill; step two, drill; step three, keep drilling. And by the way, we'll drill in your backyard. We'll&mdash;wherever it is, we're just going to put up more rigs. <p>Now, if there's one thing I know about New Hampshire, it's that your political bull detector is pretty keen. It's pretty sharp. You know that we can't just drill our way to lower gas prices. There are no quick fixes or silver bullets. If somebody's&mdash;tells you there are, they're not telling you the truth. <p>If we're going to take control of our energy future, which we have to do, if we're going to avoid high gas prices every single year, with a lot of politicians talking every single year, but nothing happening, if we're going to avoid that, then we've got to have an all-of-the-above strategy that develops every single source of American energy. Not just oil and gas, but also wind and solar and biofuels. We've got to keep developing the technology that allows us to use less oil in our cars and trucks, less oil in our buildings and our factories. And that's the strategy we've been pursuing for the last 3 years, and it's the only real solution to this challenge. <p>Now, here's the good news. We're making progress. And you can see it in this chart. There's a chart behind me right here. We're using visual aids today. [<i>Laughter</i>] The bar on the left shows that 6 years ago, 60 percent of the oil we used was imported. Since I took office, America's dependence on foreign oil has gone down every single year&mdash;every single year. In fact, in 2010, it was under 50 percent for the first time in 13 years&mdash;for the first time. <p>And we gave one of these handy charts to everybody who came today, so you can impress your family and friends&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;with your knowledge. It makes a great conversation piece at parties. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, one of the reasons our oil&mdash;our dependence on foreign oil is down is because of policies put in place by our administration, but also the&mdash;our predecessor's administration. And whoever succeeds me is going to have to keep it up. This is not going to be solved by one party. It's not going to be solved by one administration. It's not going to be solved by slogans. It's not going to be solved by phony rhetoric. It's going to be solved by a sustained, all-of-the-above energy strategy. <p>And no matter what you hear from some folks in an election year, the key part of this strategy over the last 3 years has been to increase safe, responsible oil production here at home while also pursuing clean energy for the future. We don't have to choose between one or the other, we got to do both. <p>So when it comes to oil production, under my administration, America is producing more oil today than at any time in the last 8 years. That is a fact. That's a fact. Under my administrations, we have a near-record number of oil rigs operating right now, more working oil and gas rigs than the rest of the world combined. Think about that. That's a fact. <p>We've opened up millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration where appropriate and where it is done safely, and we've approved more than 400 drilling permits since we put in place new safety standards to make sure that we don't have the same kind of spill that we had down in the Gulf a couple of years ago. <p>And we've approved dozens of new pipelines to move oil around, including from Canada. Just this week, we announced that we'll do whatever we can to help speed the construction of a pipeline in Oklahoma that will relieve a bottleneck for oil that needs to get to the Gulf. And that's going to help create jobs and encourage production. <p>So we're focused on American oil production. We are doing all that we can in a safe, responsible way to make sure that American oil production and gas production is high. But here's the thing. The amount of oil that we drill at home doesn't set the price of gas on its own. And the reason is, is because oil is bought and soiled&mdash;bought and sold on the world energy market. And just like last year, the biggest thing that's causing the price of oil to rise right now is instability in the Middle East. This time it's Iran. But a lot of folks are nervous about what might happen there, and so they're anticipating there might be a big disruption in terms of flow. And when uncertainty increases, speculation on Wall Street can drive up prices even more. Those are the short-term factors at work here. <p>So when you start hearing a bunch of folks saying somehow that there's some simple solution, you can turn a nozzle and suddenly we're going to be getting a lot more oil, that's just not how it works. Over the long term, the biggest reason oil prices will rise is because of growing demand in countries like China and India and Brazil. <p>Just think about this. In 5 years, the number of cars on the road in China more than tripled. Over the last 5 years, the number of cars tripled. Nearly 10 million cars were added in China alone in 2010; 10 million cars just in one country in 1 year. So that's using up a lot of oil, and those numbers are only going to get bigger over time. As places like China and India get wealthier, they're going to want to buy cars like we do, and they're going to want to fill them up like we do, and that's going to drive up demand. <p>So what does this mean for us? What does this mean for America? It means that anybody who tells you that we can just drill our way out of this problem does not know what they're talking about or they're not telling you the truth&mdash;one or the other. <p>Here's another way to think about it. The United States consumes more than 20 percent of the world's oil, but we only have 2 percent of the world's oil reserves. Twenty percent we use; we only produce 2 percent. And no matter what we do, it's not going to get much above 3 percent. So we're still going to have this huge shortfall. That's why if we really want energy security and energy independence, we've got to start looking at how we use less oil and use other energy sources that we can renew and that we can control so we are not subject to the whims of what's happening in other countries. <p>We have to keep developing new technology that helps us use less energy. We've got to keep relying on American know-how and ingenuity that comes from places like this one, Nashua Community College. That's our future. And that, that's exactly the path that we've been taking these last 3 years. Because of the investments we've made, the use of clean, renewable energy in this country has nearly doubled, and thousands of Americans have jobs because of it. <p>We're taking every possible action to develop a near hundred-year supply of natural gas, which releases fewer carbons. Now that's something that experts believe will support more than 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade. Our cooperation with the private sector has positioned this country to be the world's leading manufacturer of high-tech batteries that will power the next generation of American cars. <p>And after three decades of doing nothing, we put in place fuel economy standards that will make sure our cars average nearly 55 miles per gallon by the middle of the next decade. That's nearly double what we have today. And that, by the way, applies not just to cars, it applies to light trucks, and now it's going to apply to heavy trucks as well. <p>So that means that every time you fill up, you can think to yourself, you know what, I won't have to fill up again for 2 weeks instead of 1 week. Yes, that's worth applauding. [<i>Applause</i>] Because what that means is that will save the typical family more than $8,000 at the pump. And it means that this country will reduce our oil consumption by more than 2 million barrels a day, which means we can continue to see a decline in how much imported oil we need. And that's good for our national security, that's good for our economy, and it's good for our environment. <p>So that's the strategy we've got to pursue. But we've got to do more, and we've got to do more even faster. We've got to keep investing in developing every available type of American-made energy. And this means that we've got to set some priorities. We've got to make some choices. <p>First, while there are no short-term silver bullets when it comes to gas prices, I've directed my administration to look for every single area where we can make an impact and help consumers, from helping to relieve bottlenecks in the places like the one we've got in Oklahoma to making sure speculators aren't taking advantage of what's going on in the oil markets. And we're just going to keep on announcing steps in the coming weeks; every time we find something that can provide a little bit of relief right now, we're going to do it. <p>But over the long term, an all-of-the-above strategy requires the right incentives. And here's one of the best examples. Right now 4 billion of your tax dollars&mdash;4 billion&mdash;subsidizes the oil industry every year. Hmm. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> Four billion dollars. Now, these companies are making record profits right now, tens of billions of dollars a year. Every time you go to the gas tank or fill up your gas tank, they're making money&mdash;every time. Now, does anyone really think that Congress should give them another $4 billion this year? <p><i>Audience members.</i> No! <p><i>The President.</i> Of course not. It's outrageous. It's inexcusable. And I am asking Congress: Eliminate this oil industry giveaway right away. I want them to vote on this in the next few weeks. Let's put every single Member of Congress on record: You can stand with the oil companies, or you can stand up for the American people. You can keep subsidizing a fossil fuel that's been getting taxpayer dollars for a century, or you can place your bets on a clean energy future. <p>So I'm asking everybody here today, anybody who is watching at home, let your Member of Congress know where you stand. Will you do that? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes! <p><i>The President.</i> Because I know, I know where I stand, New Hampshire. I know where I stand on this. We want to have successful oil companies that are able to get the oil that we have in our country, but we also understand that our future requires us to make investments in clean, renewable energies. And that has to start now. We can't wait. We can't wait until gas has skyrocketed more and people are desperate. We need to start making those investments now. <p>And most of you guys agree. That's why you're putting your time&mdash;that's why folks here at this community college are learning about building cars and repairing cars that use less oil, cars that are powered with alternative fuels, like natural gas. That's why the city of Nashua is purchasing a new fleet of trash trucks that run on natural gas. They're going to go cleaner, they're going to last longer, they're going to be cheaper to fill up. <p>I saw one of them. It was a good-looking truck. And it put a smile on the mayor's face, because she knows she's saving money. She's saving taxpayer money. Good job, Mayor. <p>So that's part of what that $4 billion that's going to the oil companies right now, that's where it could be going, to help cities like this one convert their fleets to fuel-efficient cars and trucks, to help private sector companies&mdash;big companies like UPS or Federal Express&mdash;convert their fleets. That can save us money. In fact, since we announced the National Clean Fleets Partnership last year, the companies interested in transitioning their fleets have tripled. And that's part of why this chart is going down. <p>And I'm proud to say that the Federal Government is leading by example. One thing the Federal Government has a lot of is cars. I don't know if you guys are aware of this, but&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;we have a lot of cars. And I've directed every department, every agency&mdash;every single one&mdash;to make sure that by 2015, a hundred percent of the vehicles that the Federal Government buys are fuel-efficient cars and trucks. Let's save us money. <p>So this is our future. This is the ultimate solution to our energy challenge. It's not going to be a smooth, easy ride. Some of the clean energy technologies that are discovered, they won't pan out. Some companies will fail. There's going to be experiments and research that take time. But as long as I'm President, I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy, because our future depends on it. I'm not going to cede the wind or the solar or the battery industry to China or Germany because some politicians in Washington refused to make the same commitment here in the United States of America. <p>With or without this Congress, I'm going to continue to do whatever I can to develop every source of American energy, to make sure that 3 years from now our dependence on foreign oil is even lower, to make sure that our future is not controlled by events on the other side of the world. <p>We may not have a silver bullet to bring down gas prices tomorrow or reduce our dependence on foreign oil overnight. But what we do have in this country are limitless sources of energy and a boundless supply of ingenuity and imagination and talent that we can put to work to develop the energy of the future. We've got you. We've got you. <p>The easiest thing in the world is to make phony election-year promises about lowering gas prices. But what's harder is to make a serious, sustained commitment to tackle a problem that we've been talking about for 30 years and has not been tackled, has not been solved. It's not going to be solved in 1 year or one term, maybe not completely even in one decade. But that's the kind of commitment that we need. That's what this moment requires. <p>And so when I see all the young people who are here today&mdash;or the young at heart&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;we need you guys to keep at it. This is your future at stake. We need you to work hard. We need you to dream big. We need you to summon the same spirit of unbridled optimism, that bold willingness to tackle tough problems that led previous generations to meet the challenges of their time, to power a nation from coast to coast, to touch the moon, to connect an entire world with our own science and imagination. That's what America is capable of doing. <p>And it's that history that teaches us that all of our challenges&mdash;all of them&mdash;are within our power, within our grasp to solve. This one is no different. This one's no different. It will require our brightest scientists, our most creative companies, but it's also going to require all of us&mdash;Democrats, Republicans, everybody in between&mdash;to do our part. That's what this moment requires. <p>And I know we can do it. And when we do, we'll remind the world once again just why it is that the United States of America is the greatest nation on Earth. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"52" "\"Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Everybody, have a seat. Have a seat. Well, it is good to have all of you in here. Welcome to Washington. <p>I want to thank Ken Salazar for the introduction. Did everybody know that it's his birthday today? All right, has he milked that enough? [<i>Laughter</i>] I just want to make sure everybody wished him a happy birthday. Turning 40 is tough. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We've also got our outstanding Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack, in the house. Our wonderful EPA Administrator, Lisa Jackson, is with us. And I want to thank all of you for being a part of this conference. <p>Now, I have to say that this is a pretty diverse group here today. We've got hunters and fishermen; we've got farmers and ranchers; we've got conservationists; we've got small-business owners; we've got local government leaders; we've got tribal leaders; and some of you may have just wandered in, I don't know. [<i>Laughter</i>] But you're all here for the same reason: each of you has a deep appreciation for the incredible natural resources, the incredible bounty, that we've been blessed with as a nation. And you're working hard every day to make sure those resources are around for my daughters and your children and, hopefully, their children to enjoy. <p>Doing that takes creativity. The great Aldo Leopold once said that conservation is \\"a positive exercise of skill and insight, not merely a negative exercise of abstinence and caution.\\" It's not just about doing nothing. It's about doing something affirmative to make sure that we are passing on this incredible blessing that we have. And you also know that effective conservation is about more than just protecting our environment. It's about strengthening our economy. When we put in place new commonsense rules to reduce air pollution, like we did in December, it was to prevent our kids from breathing in dangerous chemicals. That's something we should all be able to agree on. But it will also create new jobs building and installing all sorts of pollution control technology. And since it will prevent thousands of heart attacks and cases of childhood asthma, it will also take some strain off our health care system. <p>When we make a commitment to restore a million acres of grasslands and wetlands and wildlife habitat, like the Department of Agriculture and Interior did today, we're not just preserving our land and water for the next generation. We're also making more land available for hunting and fishing. And we're bolstering our&mdash;an outdoor economy that supports more than 9 million jobs and brings in more than a trillion dollars a year. <p>And when we make it easier to visit this country, like we've done recently accelerating the process for foreign travelers to get visas, we're not just boosting tourism in big cities and places like Disney World. We're helping more people discover our parks and our mountains and our beaches. And more visitors means more people renting cars and staying in hotels and eating at our restaurants and buying our equipment. <p>So the work you're doing today is important, if we're going to grow our economy and put more people back to work. But conservation is also important when it comes to another issue that I've been talking about lately, and that's developing new sources of American-made energy. <p>Obviously, gas prices are on a lot of folks' minds right now. And we're getting another painful reminder of why developing new energy is so important for our future. Of course, because it's an election year, everybody is trotting out their three-point plans for two-dollar gas. And you know what that involves, is you drill, and then you drill, and then you drill some more. We've heard this for 30 years. <p>The American people know better. They understand we can't just drill our way out of high gas prices. We're doing everything we can to boost U.S. production. But if we're going to take control of our energy future and avoid these gas price spikes in the future, then we've got to have a sustained all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy&mdash;yes, oil and gas, but also wind and solar and biofuels and more. <p>And we're making progress on this front. In 2010, our dependence on foreign oil was under 50 percent for the first time in 13 years. Because of the investments we've made&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;the use of clean, renewable energy in this country has nearly doubled. And in my State of the Union Address, I announced that we're allowing the development of clean energy on enough public land to power 3 million homes&mdash;3 million homes. That protects our environment, and it helps families and businesses save money. <p>But while it's important to use public lands to develop things like wind and solar energy and reduce our dependence on foreign oil, we've also got to focus on protecting our planet. Now, that's why Teddy Roosevelt made sure that as we build this country and harvest its bounty, we also protect its beauty. That's part of our national character. And historically, it's been bipartisan. <p>That's why, even as our country grew by leaps and bounds, we made sure to set aside places like the Grand Canyon for our children and our grandchildren. It's why my administration has stood up to protect its waters. That's why President Kennedy directed a portion of the revenues from oil and gas production to help communities build trails and ball fields, and why my administration has fought to protect the Land and Water Conservation Fund. [<i>Applause</i>] <p>That's why the hunters and anglers in this country have always been willing to pay a few extra bucks for a fishing license or a duck stamp that helps protect streams and habitats, because they want to make sure that their grandkids can enjoy these same pastimes. That's why my administration is expanding access to public lands so that more Americans can cast a rod or teach their children how to hunt. <p>We have to keep investing in the technology and manufacturing that helps us lead the world. But we've also got to protect the places that help define who we are, that help shape our character and our soul as a nation, places that help attract visitors and create jobs, but that also give something to our kids that is irreplaceable. <p>And all of us have a role to play. One of the first bills I signed after taking office was the public lands bill that protected more than a thousand miles of rivers and established new national parks and trails. [<i>Applause</i>] And 2 years ago, thanks to some great work by my Cabinet, and Ken Salazar especially, I kicked off the America's Great Outdoors Initiative to support conservation projects happening in all 50 States, including Fort Monroe in Virginia, which just became America's 396th national park. <p>Right now we're restoring the River of Grass in the Everglades, providing clean water to millions of residents, creating thousands of jobs, construction jobs, in southern Florida. We need to keep moving forward on projects like these. And I know we've got ranchers and farmers and landowners here today who represent places like the Crown of the Continent in Montana, the Dakota Grasslands, and everywhere in between. We need to keep working to protect these incredible landscapes that all of you know so well. <p>The bottom line is this: There will always be people in this country who say we've got to choose between clean air and clean water and a growing economy, between doing right by our environment and putting people back to work. And I'm here to tell you that is a false choice. [<i>Applause</i>] That is a false choice. With smart, sustainable policies, we can grow our economy today and protect our environment for ourselves and our children. <p>We know it's possible. And we know it because of what's been happening in communities like yours, where compromise isn't a dirty word, where folks can recognize a good idea no matter where it comes from. <p>A while back, I heard a story about the Rogue River in Oregon. And every year, the Rogue is filled with salmons swimming upstream to spawn. But because factories were allowed to&mdash;allowing warm water to run back into the river, the temperature was becoming too high for the salmon to survive. So to fix the problem, the town could have required the company to buy expensive cooling equipment, but that would have hurt the local economy. Instead, they decided to pay farmers and ranchers to plant trees along the banks of the river, and that helped to cool the water at a fraction of the cost. So it worked for business; it worked for farmers; it worked for salmon. <p>And those are the kinds of ideas that we need in this country. Ideas that preserve our environment, protect our bottom line, and connect more Americans to the great outdoors. <p>And this is personally important to me. Some of you know that I grew up in Hawaii mostly, and we got some pretty nice outdoors in Hawaii. [<i>Laughter</i>] And you spend a lot of time outdoors, and you learn very early on to appreciate this incredible splendor. But I remember when I was 11, I had never been to the mainland, and my grandmother and my mother and my sister, who at the time was 2, decided we were going to take a big summer trip. And we traveled across the country. And mostly we took Greyhound buses. My grandmother was getting&mdash;she had some eye problems, and so she couldn't see that well, so she was a little nervous about driving long distances. Sometimes we took the train. And we went to the usual spots, Disneyland and&mdash;yes, I was 11, right, so? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But I still remember traveling up to Yellowstone and coming over a hill and suddenly just hundreds of deer and seeing bison for the first time and seeing Old Faithful. And I remember that trip giving me a sense of just how immense and how grand this country was and how diverse it was. And watching folks digging for clams in Puget Sound and watching ranchers and seeing our first Americans guide me through a canyon in Arizona, and it gave you a sense of just what it is that makes America special. <p>And so when I went back to Yellowstone with Ken and my daughters&mdash;that was the first time they had been&mdash;and I'm standing there. I'm thinking not only about them and the first time they're seeing this, but I'm also remembering back to when my grandmother and my mother had shown me this amazing country so many years before. <p>And that is part of what we have to fight for. That's what's critical, is making sure that we're always there to bequeath that gift to the next generation. And if you'll work with me&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;if you'll work with me, I promise I'll do everything I can to help protect our economy, but also protect this amazing planet that we love and this great country that we've been blessed with. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless America!\" "
"53" "\"Hello, everybody. Earlier this week, I spent some time with the hard-working men and women of the American auto industry, who are busy writing a new chapter in America's story. <p>Just a few years ago, their industry was shedding hundreds of thousands of jobs. Two of the Big Three&mdash;GM and Chrysler&mdash;were on the brink of failure. If we had let this great American industry collapse, if we had let Detroit go bankrupt, more than 1 million Americans would have lost their jobs in the middle of the worst recession since the Great Depression. <p>I refused to let that happen. These jobs are worth more than just a paycheck. They're a source of pride and a ticket to the middle class. These companies are worth more than just the cars they build. They're a symbol of American innovation and a source of our manufacturing might. <p>So in exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. We got the companies to retool and restructure. Everyone sacrificed. And 3 years later, the American auto industry is back. <p>Today, GM is the number-one automaker in the world. Chrysler is growing faster in America than any other car company. Ford is investing billions in American plants and factories and plans to bring thousands of jobs back home. All told, the entire industry has added more than 200,000 new jobs over the past 2&frac12; years. <p>And they're not just building cars again, they're building better cars. Thanks to new fuel efficiency standards we put in place, they're building cars that will average nearly 55 miles per gallon by the middle of the next decade. That's almost double what they get today. That means folks will be able to fill up every 2 weeks instead of every week, saving the typical family more than $8,000 at the pump over time. That's a big deal, especially as families are yet again feeling the pinch from rising gas prices. <p>So what's happening in Detroit will make a difference. But it won't solve everything. There's no silver bullet for avoiding spikes in gas prices every year. There's no shortcut to taking control of our energy future. We have to pursue an all-of-the-above strategy that helps develop every source of American energy. And we have to do it now. <p>The good news is, we've been making progress. Here, take a look at this chart. Six years ago, 60 percent of the oil we used was imported. Since I took office, America's dependence on foreign oil has decreased every single year. In fact, in 2010, for the first time in 13 years, less than half the petroleum we consumed was imported. Part of that's because we're producing more oil here at home than at any time in the last 8 years. <p>But we can't just drill our way out of this problem. While we consume 20 percent of the world's oil, we only have 2 percent of the world's oil reserves. We've got to develop new technologies that will help us use new forms of energy. That's been a priority of mine as President. And because of the investments we've made, our use of clean, renewable energy has nearly doubled, and thousands of Americans have jobs because of it. <p>Now we need to keep at it. And to do that, we need to make the right choices. <p>Here's one choice we can make right now. Every year, 4 billion of your tax dollars goes to subsidizing the oil industry. These are the same companies making record profits: tens of billions of dollars a year. I don't think oil companies need more corporate welfare. Congress should end this taxpayer giveaway. If you agree with me, I'm asking you to e-mail, call, or tweet your representative. Tell them to stop fighting for oil companies. And tell them to start fighting for working families. Tell them to fight for the clean energy future that's within our reach. Because the sooner we all get started, the sooner we'll get there together. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"54" "\"Thank you. Everyone, please have a seat. Well, good morning, everyone. <p>Rosy, thank you for your kind words. I have never seen Rosy on the basketball court. I'll bet it would be a treat. [<i>Laughter</i>] Rosy, you've been a dear friend of mine for a long time and a tireless advocate for the unbreakable bonds between Israel and the United States. And as you complete your term as President, I salute your leadership and your commitment. <p>I want to thank the board of directors. As always, I'm glad to see my longtime friends in the Chicago delegation. I also want to thank the Member of Congress who are here with us today and who will be speaking to you over the next few days. You've worked hard to maintain the partnership between the United States and Israel. And I especially want to thank my close friend and leader of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz. <p>I'm glad that my outstanding young Ambassador to Israel, Dan Shapiro, is in the house. I understand that Dan is perfecting his Hebrew on his new assignment, and I appreciate his constant outreach to the Israeli people. And I'm also pleased that we're joined by so many Israeli officials, including Ambassador Michael Oren. And tomorrow I'm very much looking forward to welcoming Prime Minister Netanyahu and his delegation back to the White House. <p>Every time I come to AIPAC, I'm especially impressed to see so many young people here. You don't yet get the front seats, I understand. [<i>Laughter</i>] You have to earn that. But students from all over the country who are making their voices heard and engaging deeply in our democratic debate, you carry with you an extraordinary legacy of more than six decades of friendship between the United States and Israel. And you have the opportunity and the responsibility to make your own mark on the world. And for inspiration, you can look to the man who preceded me on this stage, who's being honored at this conference, my friend President Shimon Peres. <p>Shimon was born a world away from here, in a shtetl in what was then Poland, a few years after the end of the First World War. But his heart was always in Israel, the historic homeland of the Jewish people. And when he was just a boy, he made his journey across land and sea toward home. <p>In his life, he has fought for Israel's independence and he has fought for peace and security. As a member of the Haganah and a member of the Knesset, as a Minister of Defense and Foreign Affairs, as a Prime Minister and as President, Shimon helped build the nation that thrives today: the Jewish State of Israel. But beyond these extraordinary achievements, he has also been a powerful moral voice that reminds us that right makes might, not the other way around. <p>Shimon once described the story of the Jewish people by saying it proved that \\"slings, arrows, and gas chambers can annihilate man, but cannot destroy human values, dignity, and freedom.\\" And he has lived those values. He has taught us to ask more of ourselves and to empathize more with our fellow human beings. I am grateful for his life's work and his moral example. And I'm proud to announce that later this spring, I will invite Shimon Peres to the White House to present him with America's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. <p>In many ways, this award is a symbol of the broader ties that bind our nations. The United States and Israel share interests, but we also share those human values that Shimon spoke about: a commitment to human dignity, a belief that freedom is a right that is given to all of God's children, an experience that shows us that democracy is the one and only form of government that can truly respond to the aspirations of citizens. <p>America's Founding Fathers understood this truth, just as Israel's founding generation did. President Truman put it well, describing his decision to formally recognize Israel only minutes after it declared independence. He said: \\"I had faith in Israel before it was established. I believe it has a glorious future before it&mdash;as not just another sovereign nation, but as an embodiment of the great ideals of our civilization.\\" <p>For over six decades, the American people have kept that faith. Yes, we are bound to Israel because of the interests that we share in security for our communities, prosperity for our people, the new frontiers of science that can light the world. But ultimately is&mdash;it is our common ideals that provide the true foundation for our relationship. That is why America's commitment to Israel has endured under Democratic and Republican Presidents and congressional leaders of both parties. In the United States, our support for Israel is bipartisan, and that is how it should stay. <p>AIPAC's work continually nurtures this bond. And because of AIPAC's effectiveness in carrying out its mission, you can expect that over the next several days, you will hear many fine words from elected officials describing their commitment to the U.S.-Israel relationship. But as you examine my commitment, you don't just have to count on my words. You can look at my deeds. Because over the last 3 years, as President of the United States, I have kept my commitments to the State of Israel. At every crucial juncture, at every fork in the road, we have been there for Israel&mdash;every single time. <p>Four years ago, I stood before you and said that \\"Israel's security is sacrosanct. It is nonnegotiable.\\" That belief has guided my actions as President. The fact is, my administration's commitment to Israel's security has been unprecedented. Our military and intelligence cooperation has never been closer. Our joint exercises and training have never been more robust. Despite a tough budget environment, our security assistance has increased every single year. We are investing in new capabilities. We're providing Israel with more advanced technology, the types of products and systems that only go to our closest friends and allies. And make no mistake: We will do what it takes to preserve Israel's qualitative military edge, because Israel must always have the ability to defend itself, by itself, against any threat. <p>This isn't just about numbers on a balance sheet. As a Senator, I spoke to Israeli troops on the Lebanese border. I visited with families who've known the terror of rocket fire in Sderot. And that's why, as President, I have provided critical funding to deploy the Iron Dome system that has intercepted rockets that might have hit homes and hospitals and schools in that town and in others. Now our assistance is expanding Israel's defensive capabilities so that more Israelis can live free from the fear of rockets and ballistic missiles. Because no family, no citizen, should live in fear. <p>And just as we've been there with our security assistance, we've been there through our diplomacy. When the Goldstone report unfairly singled out Israel for criticism, we challenged it. When Israel was isolated in the aftermath of the flotilla incident, we supported them. When the Durban conference was commemorated, we boycotted it, and we will always reject the notion that Zionism is racism. <p>When one-sided resolutions are brought up at the Human Rights Council, we oppose them. When Israeli diplomats feared for their lives in Cairo, we intervened to save them. When there are efforts to boycott or divest from Israel, we will stand against them. And whenever an effort is made to delegitimize the State of Israel, my administration has opposed them. So there should not be a shred of doubt by now: When the chips are down, I have Israel's back. <p>Which is why, if during this political season&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;you hear some questions regarding my administration's support for Israel, remember that it's not backed up by the facts. And remember that the U.S.-Israel relationship is simply too important to be distorted by partisan politics. America's national security is too important. Israel's security is too important. <p>Of course, there are those who question not my security and diplomatic commitments, but rather my administration's ongoing pursuit of peace between Israelis and Palestinians. So let me say this: I make no apologies for pursuing peace. Israel's own leaders understand the necessity of peace. Prime Minister Netanyahu, Defense Minister Barak, President Peres, each of them have called for two states, a secure Israel that lives side by side with an independent Palestinian state. I believe that peace is profoundly in Israel's security interest. <p>The reality that Israel faces&mdash;from shifting demographics to emerging technologies to an extremely difficult international environment&mdash;demands a resolution of this issue. And I believe that peace with the Palestinians is consistent with Israel's founding values, because of our shared belief in self-determination and because Israel's place as a Jewish and democratic state must be protected. <p>Of course, peace is hard to achieve. There's a reason why it's remained elusive for six decades. The upheaval and uncertainty in Israel's neighborhood makes it that much harder, from the horrific violence raging in Syria to the transition in Egypt. And the division within the Palestinian leadership makes it harder still, most notably, with Hamas's continued rejection of Israel's very right to exist. <p>But as hard as it may be, we should not and cannot give in to cynicism or despair. The changes taking place in the region make peace more important, not less. And I've made it clear that there will be no lasting peace unless Israel's security concerns are met. That's why we continue to press Arab leaders to reach out to Israel, and we'll continue to support the peace treaty with Egypt. That's why, just as we encourage Israel to be resolute in the pursuit of peace, we have continued to insist that any Palestinian partner must recognize Israel's right to exist and reject violence and adhere to existing agreements. And that is why my administration has consistently rejected any efforts to shortcut negotiations or impose an agreement on the parties. <p>As Rosy noted, last year, I stood before you and pledged that \\"the United States will stand up against efforts to single Israel out at the United Nations.\\" As you know, that pledge has been kept. Last September, I stood before the United Nations General Assembly and reaffirmed that any lasting peace must acknowledge the fundamental legitimacy of Israel and its security concerns. I said that America's commitment to Israel's security is unshakeable, our friendship with Israel is enduring, and that Israel must be recognized. No American President has made such a clear statement about our support for Israel at the United Nations at such a difficult time. People usually give those speeches before audiences like this one, not before the General Assembly. <p>And I must say, there was not a lot of applause. [<i>Laughter</i>] But it was the right thing to do. And as a result, today there is no doubt anywhere in the world that the United States will insist upon Israel's security and legitimacy. That will be true as we continue our efforts to pursue&mdash;in the pursuit of peace. And that will be true when it comes to the issue that is such a focus for all of us today: Iran's nuclear program, a threat that has the potential to bring together the worst rhetoric about Israel's destruction with the world's most dangerous weapons. <p>Let's begin with a basic truth that you all understand: No Israeli Government can tolerate a nuclear weapon in the hands of a regime that denies the Holocaust, threatens to wipe Israel off the map, and sponsors terrorist groups committed to Israel's destruction. And so I understand the profound historical obligation that weighs on the shoulders of Bibi Netanyahu and Ehud Barak and all of Israel's leaders. A nuclear-armed Iran is completely counter to Israel's security interests. But it is also counter to the national security interests of the United States. <p>Indeed, the entire world has an interest in preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. A nuclear-armed Iran would thoroughly undermine the nonproliferation regime that we've done so much to build. There are risks that an Iranian nuclear weapon could fall into the hands of a terrorist organization. It is almost certain that others in the region would feel compelled to get their own nuclear weapon, triggering an arms race in one of the world's most volatile regions. It would embolden a regime that has brutalized its own people, and it would embolden Iran's proxies, who have carried out terrorist attacks from the Levant to southwest Asia. <p>And that is why, 4 years ago, I made a commitment to the American people and said that we would use all elements of American power to pressure Iran and prevent it from acquiring a nuclear weapon. And that is what we have done. <p>When I took office, the efforts to apply pressure on Iran were in tatters. Iran had gone from zero centrifuges spinning to thousands, without facing broad pushback from the world. In the region, Iran was ascendant, increasingly popular and extending its reach. In other words, the Iranian leadership was united and on the move, and the international community was divided about how to go forward. <p>And so from my very first months in office, we put forward a very clear choice to the Iranian regime: a path that would allow them to rejoin the community of nations if they meet their international obligations or a path that leads to an escalating series of consequences if they don't. In fact, our policy of engagement&mdash;quickly rebuffed by the Iranian regime&mdash;allowed us to rally the international community as never before, to expose Iran's intransigence, and to apply pressure that goes far beyond anything that the United States could do on our own. <p>Because of our efforts, Iran is under greater pressure than ever before. Some of you will recall, people predicted that Russia and China wouldn't join us to move towards pressure. They did. And in 2010, the U.N. Security Council overwhelmingly supported a comprehensive sanctions effort. Few thought that sanctions could have an immediate bite on the Iranian regime. They have, slowing the Iranian nuclear program and virtually grinding the Iranian economy to a halt in 2011. Many questioned whether we could hold our coalition together as we moved against Iran's Central Bank and oil exports. But our friends in Europe and Asia and elsewhere are joining us. And in 2012, the Iranian Government faces the prospect of even more crippling sanctions. <p>That is where we are today because of our work. Iran is isolated, its leadership divided and under pressure. And by the way, the Arab Spring has only increased these trends, as the hypocrisy of the Iranian regime is exposed and its ally, the Asad regime, is crumbling. <p>Of course, so long as Iran fails to meet its obligations, this problem remains unresolved. The effective implementation of our policy is not enough. We must accomplish our objective. And in that effort, I firmly believe that an opportunity still remains for diplomacy, backed by pressure, to succeed. <p>The United States and Israel both assess that Iran does not yet have a nuclear weapon, and we are exceedingly vigilant in monitoring their program. Now the international community has a responsibility to use the time and space that exists. Sanctions are continuing to increase, and this July, thanks to our diplomatic coordination, a European ban on Iranian oil imports will take hold. Faced with these increasingly dire consequences, Iran's leaders still have the opportunity to make the right decision. They can choose a path that brings them back into the community of nations, or they can continue down a dead end. <p>And given their history, there are, of course, no guarantees that the Iranian regime will make the right choice. But both Israel and the United States have an interest in seeing this challenge resolved diplomatically. After all, the only way to truly solve this problem is for the Iranian Government to make a decision to forsake nuclear weapons. That's what history tells us. <p>Moreover, as President and Commander in Chief, I have a deeply held preference for peace over war. I have sent men and women into harm's way. I've seen the consequences of those decisions in the eyes of those I meet who've come back gravely wounded and the absence of those who don't make it home. Long after I leave this office, I will remember those moments as the most searing of my Presidency. And for this reason, as part of my solemn obligation to the American people, I will only use force when the time and circumstances demand it. And I know that Israeli leaders also know all too well the costs and consequences of war, even as they recognize their obligation to defend their country. <p>So we all prefer to resolve this issue diplomatically. Having said that, Iran's leaders should have no doubt about the resolve of the United States, just as they should not doubt Israel's sovereign right to make its own decisions about what is required to meet its security needs. <p>I have said that when it comes to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, I will take no options off the table, and I mean what I say. That includes all elements of American power: a political effort aimed at isolating Iran, a diplomatic effort to sustain our coalition and ensure that the Iranian program is monitored, an economic effort that imposes crippling sanctions, and yes, a military effort to be prepared for any contingency. <p>Iran's leaders should understand that I do not have a policy of containment; I have a policy to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. And as I have made clear time and again during the course of my Presidency, I will not hesitate to use force when it is necessary to defend the United States and its interests. <p>Moving forward, I would ask that we all remember the weightiness of these issues, the stakes involved for Israel, for America, and for the world. Already, there is too much loose talk of war. Over the last few weeks, such talk has only benefited the Iranian Government by driving up the price of oil, which they depend on to fund their nuclear program. For the sake of Israel's security, America's security, and the peace and security of the world, now is not the time for bluster. Now's the time to let our increased pressure sink in and to sustain the broad international coalition we have built. Now's the time to heed the timeless advice from Teddy Roosevelt: Speak softly; carry a big stick. And as we do, rest assured that the Iranian Government will know our resolve and that our coordination will&mdash;with Israel will continue. <p>Now, these are challenging times. But we've been through challenging times before, and the United States and Israel have come through them together. Because of our cooperation, citizens in both our countries have benefited from the bonds that bring us together. I'm proud to be one of those people. In the past, I've shared in this forum just why those bonds are so personal for me: the stories of a great-uncle who helped liberate Buchenwald, to my memories of returning there with Elie Wiesel; from sharing books with President Peres to sharing seders with my young staff in a tradition that started on the campaign trail and continues in the White House; from the countless friends I know in this room to the concept of <i>tikkun olam</i> that has enriched and guided my life. <p>As Harry Truman understood, Israel's story is one of hope. We may not agree on every single issue; no two nations do, and our democracies contain a vibrant diversity of views. But we agree on the big things, the things that matter. And together, we are working to build a better world, one where our people can live free from fear, one where peace is founded upon justice, one where our children can know a future that is more hopeful than the present. <p>There is no shortage of speeches on the friendship between the United States and Israel. But I'm also mindful of the proverb, \\"A man is judged by his deeds, not his words.\\" So if you want to know where my heart lies, look no further than what I have done to stand up for Israel, to secure both of our countries, and to see that the rough waters of our time lead to a peaceful and prosperous shore. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless the people of Israel. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"55" "\"Thank you very much, everybody. It is good to see all of you. Jim, thank you for the introduction. It is a privilege to be with the men and women of the Business Roundtable. Over the past 3 years, we've worked together on a number of issues, and we've found common ground on an awful lot of them. <p>Some of you have dedicated your time and energy and expertise to serving on my Jobs Council or my Export Council. Others have hosted me or Cabinet members at your companies, at your plants, at your distribution centers. And this engagement has been incredibly productive for us. It's helped to shape our collective work and to get this economy growing again. So I just wanted to say thank you for that. <p>Tonight I want to keep that engagement going, so I'm going to keep my remarks at the top relatively brief. I'm looking forward to hearing about your new \\"Taking Action for America\\" report. And I'm going to, hopefully, spend as much time listening as I do talking. <p>But the last time I addressed this group was just over 2 years ago, when we were still working to clear away the wreckage from what turned out to be the worst economic crisis that we've seen since the Great Depression. And obviously, we've got a long way to go. We've still got millions of people who are out of work. We still have a lot of folks whose homes are underwater. There are enormous economic challenges that lie ahead, and we're going to have to think strategically and systematically about how we restore a sense of middle class security for Americans who are doing the right thing, working hard, looking to support their families. <p>The good news is, over the last 2 years, businesses like yours have created over 3.7 million new jobs. The American auto industry has come back. Companies are bringing jobs back to America. Manufacturers are adding new jobs for the first time since the 1990s. <p>And I've seen it firsthand in many of your companies. Most recently, I went to the Boeing plant out in Washington State. And Jim informed me that last year, orders for commercial aircraft rose by more than 50 percent, and they had to hire 13,000 workers all across America just to keep up. And I have to say that given the number of planes that I've been selling around the world, I expect a golden watch upon my retirement. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So the economy is getting stronger, and the recovery is speeding up. And the question now is, how do we make sure that it keeps going? <p>I've been talking a lot recently about how we can do that: how we can help companies like yours hire more workers, bring more jobs back to America; how we can leave an economy that's not just restored to precrisis levels, but positions ourselves to be competitive in this 21st-century economy over the long term, an economy built to last. <p>I think we have to focus on our core strengths: American manufacturing, American energy, American innovation, the best skills and education for American workers. <p>Right now, on the manufacturing front, I think we've got a huge opportunity. What's happened in the auto industry can happen in other areas, and we've got to make sure that we understand even though manufacturing will not be the same percentage of our economy as it once was, it still remains this incredible multiplier for services and consumers and prosperity all across America. That's why I want to thank Andrew Liveris. Where's Andrew? There he is. Andrew is helping us to do some terrific work as part of our Advanced Manufacturing Partnership. And obviously, part of our job as the Federal Government is to make sure that the R&D, the basic research is continuing to be done, and figuring out how we commercialize that, create products here in America, and sell them all around the world is going to be absolutely critical. <p>Thanks to new bipartisan trade agreements that I've signed with Panama, Colombia, and, most significantly, South Korea, we're on track to meet our goal of doubling American exports over the next 5 years. And I know the BRT was very helpful in making sure that that happened. <p>I think I've shown that I will go anywhere in the world to open new markets for American goods. That's why we worked so hard to secure Russia's invitation into the WTO. That's why I have asked Congress to repeal Jackson-Vanik, to make sure that all your companies and American companies all across the country can take advantage of it. And that's something that we're going to need some help on. <p>This is about creating a level, rules-based playing field in the growing Russian market. Because when it comes to competing for the jobs and the industries of tomorrow, no foreign company should have an advantage over American companies. When the playing field is level, American companies will win, American workers will win, and this country will win. <p>And one of the most important things Congress can do right now for companies like yours, to sell your ideas and your products and your services around the world, is to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank at the appropriate funding level. This is something that we're going to be focused on in the coming weeks and months. <p>During the financial crisis, trade finance dried up all around the world, and the Ex-Im Bank lived up to its mission. It stepped up to fill the void at record levels, and at no cost to taxpayers. In fact, since 2005, Ex-Im has returned billions back to the U.S. Treasury. So this is a smart thing to do for American businesses and American jobs. <p>It is an indispensable resource for our exporters, especially since many of your competitors are getting aggressive financing from their governments. So I'm asking your help in making sure Congress does the right thing on this front. <p>I've also shown that I won't stand by when our competitors don't play by the rules. A lot of you are expanding into growth markets, in emerging markets in Asia-Pacific region. But many of you, at least privately, have indicated to me that it gets harder and harder to do business there in terms of protecting your intellectual property, competing against indigenous innovation laws. And so what we are doing is setting up a trade enforcement unit to aggressively investigate and counter unfair trade practices all around the world, including countries like China. <p>And if you're a CEO that's willing to bring jobs back to America, we want to do everything we can to help you succeed. That means working together to reform our tax system so that we are rewarding companies that are investing here in the United States, making sure that we are able to cut our tax rate here but also broaden the base. That is going to be a difficult task. Anybody who has been involved in tax discussions in any legislature, but especially Congress, knows that it's like pulling teeth. But it is the right thing to do for us to become more competitive. <p>We're also going to have to make significant investments in American energy. I am very proud of the fact that American energy output is reaching record levels. We are seeing the highest oil production in the last 8 years. At the same time, because so many of your companies have become more efficient, we're actually seeing a reduction in imports&mdash;in fact, below 50 percent for the first time back in 2010, the first time in a decade. <p>But we've got more work to do, and it's going to require an all-of-the-above strategy. Obviously, folks are getting killed right now with gas prices. And that has an impact on all of your companies, because consumers are more price sensitive when it comes to filling up their gas tank than just about anything else. That means, yes, we've got to produce more oil and more natural gas, and we are game for that. It also means, though, we've got to invest in the energy sources of the future. <p>We've got to invest in clean energy. We've got to invest in efficiency. We've got to make sure that the advanced batteries for electric cars, for example, are manufactured here in the United States. <p>And then the final thing we're going to have to do is make sure that we have the skills and the training for our workers that are unmatched around the world. There has been a lot of talk about education reform; we've actually implemented education reform. And we've been able to get more than 40 States to raise standards, to start looking at best practices to figure out how we can train teachers more effectively, make sure that teachers who aren't doing a good job are getting the kind of training they need or they're not in the classroom, but also rewarding those folks who are stepping up to the plate and making sure our kids are prepared. <p>It also means matching up companies with our community colleges to train people for the jobs that actually exist. And I know that companies like Siemens and UPS are doing a great job on this front. We want to continue to push that forward. <p>Two last points: One is, I will not give up on the need for us to rebuild America's infrastructure. When you think about your own businesses, if you know that you've got to make some capital investments and interest rates are historically low and it is a buyer's market, you act, understanding that you've got to project 5 years out, 10 years out, 20 years out. Well, that's the situation our country faces. I make no apologies for being chauvinistic when it comes to wanting to have the best airports, the best roads, the fastest broadband lines, the best wireless connections here in the United States of America. And now is the time for us to do it, and we're going to need BRT's help. <p>That will be good for business. It will allow you to move goods and services more quickly around the world. It will put people back to work. It will be a boost for our economy. And it will increase our productivity and efficiency over the long term. <p>And the final thing I just want to make mention of is the issue of how we pay for all these things. There obviously, over the last couple of years, has been an enormous debate about deficits and debt, and I'm sure we'll have a chance to talk about that more during the Q&A. <p>The fact of the matter is that we have already made significant cuts when it comes to discretionary spending. We are pruning this Government to make sure the programs that don't work we eliminate, so that we can invest in the programs that are necessary for our growth. We're going to have to make some continued reforms when it comes to, particularly, our health care system, because it is still too expensive and we've got an aging population that we're going to have to take care of. <p>But we're also going to have to deal with revenue. And that's something that I think that the American people instinctually understand, that if we do this in a balanced way, we can solve our problems. This is not a situation that is analogous to Greece. We don't have to cut by 25 percent and raise taxes by 25 percent. That's not the situation we find ourselves in. These are relatively modest adjustments that can stabilize our economy, give you the kind of business confidence you need to invest, and make sure that America wins for the future. <p>I'm prepared to be a partner in that process. But we're going to have to have everybody pulling together. The business community is going to have an important voice in how that moves forward. <p>So with that, I want to thank you again, and I look forward to the questions and the comments.\" "
"56" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, North Carolina! Hello, Mount Holly! Thank you, Juan, for that introduction. I did not know he was a preacher. [<i>Laughter</i>] He must be at least a deacon. [<i>Laughter</i>] I was&mdash;\\"Well\\"&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. He was starting to get the spirit up here. I'm going to take Juan on the road to introduce me everywhere. [<i>Laughter</i>] Can I hear an \\"amen\\"? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Amen! <p><i>The President.</i> Amen. <p>I want to thank Mark Hernandez, Ricky McDowell, and Martin Daum for hosting us and being such great tour guides. Thank you so much, everybody. Give them a big round of applause. <p>We've got a few outstanding North Carolinians in the house. You've got your Governor, Bev Perdue, is here. Your mayors, Bryan Hough and Anthony Foxx are here. Two outstanding Congressmen, Mel Watt and Heath Shuler are here. Thank you all for being here. <p>It is good to be in North Carolina. Anthony Foxx pointed out that I decided to wear a tie that could be a Tar Heel, but it's got a little Duke color in there too. I didn't want to get in trouble with anybody, so I was hedging my bets. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I always tell people I am one of the best advertisers for North Carolina. I love this State. Love this State. Everybody here is so nice, so welcoming. Even the folks who don't vote for me, they're nice to me. They usually wave five fingers. [<i>Laughter</i>] So it's just a great pleasure. <p>And I just had a chance to see some of the folks who are doing the work here today. I couldn't be more impressed. Some people have been here&mdash;like Juan&mdash;32 years, 25 years. Some folks had been here for 4 months or 6 months, had just gotten hired. But everybody had such pride in their work. <p>And the Freighterline trucks that you're making here at this plant run on natural gas; and that makes them quieter, it makes them better for the environment, it makes them cheaper to fill up than they would be with diesel. I hear you sold your 1,000th natural gas truck last November&mdash;the first company to reach that milestone. And it was made right here in Mount Holly. And last year, this plant added more than 1,000 workers, hiring back a lot of folks who were laid off during the recession. That is something to be proud of. <p>Now, here at Daimler, you're not just building trucks. You're building better trucks. You're building trucks that use less oil. And you know that's especially important right now because most of you have probably filled up your gas tank a time or two in the last week, and you've seen how quickly the price of gas is going up. A lot of you may have to drive a distance to work. Higher gas prices are like a tax straight out of your paycheck. <p>And for companies that operate a whole fleet of trucks, the higher costs can make a big difference in terms of the profitability of the company. <p>Now, here's the thing, though, this is not the first time we've seen gas prices spike. It's been happening for years. Every year about this time, gas starts spiking up, and everybody starts wondering, how high is it going to go? And every year, politicians start talking when gas prices go up. They get out on the campaign trail, and you and I both know there are no quick fixes to this problem, but listening to them, you'd think there were. <p>As a country that has 2 percent of the world's oil reserves, but uses 20 percent of the world's oil&mdash;I'm going to repeat that&mdash;we've got 2 percent of the world oil reserves; we use 20 percent. What that means is, as much as we're doing to increase oil production, we're not going to be able to just drill our way out of the problem of high gas prices. Anybody who tells you otherwise, either doesn't know what they're talking about or they aren't telling you the truth. <p>Here is the truth: If we are going to control our energy future, then we've got to have an all-of-the-above strategy. We've got to develop every source of American energy, not just oil and gas, but wind power and solar power, nuclear power, biofuels. We need to invest in the technology that will help us use less oil in our cars and our trucks, in our buildings, in our factories. That's the only solution to the challenge. Because as we start using less, that lowers the demand, prices come down. It's pretty straightforward. That's the only solution to this challenge. <p>And that's the strategy that we've now been pursuing for the last 3 years. And I'm proud to say we've made progress. Since I took office, America's dependence on foreign oil has gone down every single year. In fact, in 2010, it went under 50 percent for the first time in 13 years. <p>Now, you wouldn't know it from listening to some of these folks out here&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;some of these folks&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but a key part of our energy strategy has been to increase safe, responsible oil production here at home. Under my administration, America is producing more oil today than any time in the last 8 years. Under my administration, we've quadrupled the number of operating oil rigs to a record high. We've got more oil rigs operating now than we've ever seen. We've opened up millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration. We've approved more than 400 drilling permits that follow new safety standards after we had that mess down in the Gulf. <p>We're approving dozens of new pipelines. We just announced that we'll do whatever we can to speed up construction of a pipeline in Oklahoma that's going to relieve a bottleneck and get more oil to the Gulf&mdash;to the refineries down there&mdash;and that's going to help create jobs, encourage more production. <p>So these are the facts on oil production. If somebody tells you we're not producing enough oil, they just don't know the facts. <p>But how much oil we produce here at home&mdash;because we only have 2 percent and we use 20&mdash;that's not going to set the price of gas worldwide or here in the United States. Oil is bought and sold on the world market. And the biggest thing that's causing the price of oil to rise right now is instability in the Middle East. You guys have been hearing about what's happening with Iran; there are other oil producers that are having problems. And so people have gotten uncertain. And when uncertainty increases, then sometimes you see speculation on Wall Street that drives up gas prices even more. <p>But here's the thing, over the long term, the biggest reason oil prices will go up is there's just growing demand in countries like China and India and Brazil. There are a lot of people there. In 2010 alone, China added nearly 10 million cars on its roads. Think about that&mdash;2010, 10 million new cars. People in China, folks in India, folks in Brazil; they're going to want cars too, as their standard of living goes up, and that means more demand for oil, and that's going to kick up the price of oil worldwide. Those numbers are only going to get bigger over time. <p>So what does that mean for us? It means we can't just keep on relying on the old ways of doing business. We can't just rely on fossil fuels from the last century. We've got to continually develop new sources of energy. <p>And that's why we've made investments that have nearly doubled the use of clean, renewable energies in this country. And thousands of Americans have jobs because of it. It also means we've got to develop the resources that we have that are untapped, like natural gas. We're developing a near hundred-year supply of natural gas, and that's something that we expect could support more than 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade. <p>And that's why we've worked with the private sector to develop a high-tech car battery that costs half as much as other batteries and can go up to 300 miles on a single charge. Think about that. That will save you some money at the pump. And that is why we are helping companies like this one right here and plants like this one right here, to make more cars and trucks that use less oil. <p>When I ran for office, I went to Detroit and I gave a speech to automakers where I promised that I was going to raise fuel standards on our cars, so that they'd go further on a gallon of gas. I said we should do the same thing on trucks. I have to tell you, when I said it, I didn't get a lot of applause in the room, because there was a time when automakers were resisting higher fuel standards because change isn't easy. But you know what, after three decades of not doing anything, we got together with the oil companies, we got together with the unions, we got together with folks who usually do not see eye to eye, and we negotiated new fuel economy standards that are going to make sure our cars average nearly 55 miles per gallon by the middle of the next decade. That's nearly double what they get today&mdash;nearly double. <p>Now, because of these new standards for cars and trucks, they're going to&mdash;all going to be able to go further and use less fuel every year. And that means pretty soon you'll be able to fill up your car every 2 weeks instead of every week, and over time that saves you, a typical family, about $8,000 a year. <p><i>Audience member.</i> We like that. <p><i>The President.</i> You like that, don't you? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes! <p><i>The President.</i> Eight thousand dollars&mdash;that's no joke. We can reduce our oil consumption by more than 12 billion barrels. And thanks to the SuperTruck program that we've started with companies like this one, trucks will be able to save more than $15,000 in fuel costs every year. Think about that, 15,000. <p>It looks like somebody might have fainted up here. Have we got some of the EMS&mdash;somebody. Don't worry about&mdash;folks do this all the time in my meetings. [<i>Laughter</i>] You've always got to eat before you stand for a long time. That's a little tip. But they'll be okay. Just make sure that&mdash;give them a little room. All right, everybody all right? Okay. <p>So these trucks can save $15,000 every year. I want people to think about what that means for businesses, what it means for consumers. It is real progress. And it's happening because of American workers and American know-how. It's happening because of you. It's happening because of you. <p>We're also making it easier for big companies&mdash;some of your customers, like UPS and FedEx&mdash;to make the shift to fuel-efficient cars and trucks. We call it the National Clean Fleets Partnership. And since we announced it last year, the number of companies that are taking part in it has tripled. And that means more customers for your trucks. We're creating more customers for your trucks. <p>And I am proud to say that the Federal Government is leading by example. One thing the Federal Government has a lot of is cars and trucks. We got a lot of cars and we got a lot of trucks. And so what I did was I directed every department, every agency in the Federal Government, to make sure that by 2015, 100 percent of the vehicles we buy run on alternative fuels&mdash;100 percent. <p>So we're one of the biggest customers in the world for cars and trucks, and we want to set that bar high. We want to set a standard that says by 2015, 100 percent of cars, alternative fuels. <p>So we're making progress, Mount Holly. But at the end of the day, it doesn't matter how much natural gas or flex-fuel or electric vehicles you have if there's no place to charge them up or fill them up. So that's why I'm announcing today a program that will put our communities on the cutting edge of what clean energy can do. <p>To cities and towns all across the country, what we're going to say is, if you make a commitment to buy more advanced vehicles for your community, whether they run on electricity or biofuels or natural gas, we'll help you cut through the redtape and build fueling stations nearby. And we'll offer tax breaks to families that buy these cars, companies that buy alternative fuel trucks like the ones that are made right here at Mount Holly. So we're going to give communities across the country more of an incentive to make the shift to more energy-efficient cars. <p>In fact, when I was up in New Hampshire, in Nashua, they had already converted all their dump trucks&mdash;they were in a process because of this program&mdash;they were converting it to natural gas-driven trucks. <p>This is something that we did in education&mdash;we called it Race to the Top. We said we'll put in more money, but we want you to reform. We're going to give you an incentive to do things in a different way. And if we do the same thing with clean energy, we can save consumers money and we can make sure the economy is more secure. So we've got to keep investing in American-made energy, and we've got to keep investing in the vehicles that run on it. That's where our future is. <p>And in order to continue this progress, we're going to have to make a choice. We've got to decide where our priorities are as a country. And that's up to all of you. And I'll give you an example. Right now 4 billion of your tax dollars goes straight to the oil industry every year, $4 billion in subsidies that other companies don't get. Now keep in mind, these are some of the same companies that are making record profits every time you fill up your gas tank. We're giving them extra billions of dollars on top of near-record profits that they're already making. Anybody think that's a good idea? <p><i>Audience members.</i> No! <p><i>The President.</i> Me neither. [<i>Laughter</i>] It doesn't make any sense. The American people have subsidized the oil industry long enough. They don't need the subsidies. It's time to end that taxpayer giveaway to an industry that's never been more profitable, invest in clean energy that's never been more promising. <p>So I called on Congress, eliminate these subsidies right away. There's no excuse to wait any longer. And we should put every Member of Congress on record: They can stand up for the oil companies, or they can stand up for the American people and this new energy future. We can place our bets on the fuel of the past, or we can place our bets on American know-how and American ingenuity and American workers like the ones here at Daimler. That's the choice we face. That's what's at stake right now. <p>So in between shifts, get on the phone or e-mail or send a letter or tweet&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;your Member of Congress, ask them where they stand on this, because it will make a difference. And you'll know where I stand on this. Let's make sure our voices are heard. The next time you hear some politician trotting out some three-point plan for two-dollar gas&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;you let them know, we know better. <p>Tell them we're tired of hearing phony election-year promises that never come about. What we need is a serious, sustained, all-of-the-above strategy for American-made energy, American-made efficiency, American innovation, American fuel-efficient trucks, American fuel-efficient cars. We may not get there in one term. It's going to take us a while to wean ourselves off of the old and grab the new. But we're going to meet this challenge because we are Americans. Our destiny is not written for us; it is written by us. We decide what that next chapter is going to be. <p>And I'm confident, working with folks like you, the outstanding working people of Mount Holly, of this plant, of North Carolina, of States all across the country, we can pull together and remind everybody around the world just why it is that the United States of America is the greatest nation on Earth. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"57" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Virginia! Thank you so much. Thank you, everybody. Wow, what a unbelievable crowd. Everybody, please have a seat&mdash;if you have one. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Well, thank you, James, for that rousing introduction and letting me hang out a little bit with your workers. We've got a few other folks I want to acknowledge: The Governor of the great Commonwealth of Virginia, Bob McDonnell, is here. Outstanding Congressman Bobby Scott is in the house. We've got your mayor, Brian Moore. And I want to very much say thank you to our outstanding Secretary of Commerce, Secretary Bryson, who was here, and he is doing great work trying to create jobs and investment and opportunity all across the country. <p>It is great to be back in Petersburg. Last time I was here was during the campaign. I had my bus pull over so I could get a cheeseburger&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;at Longstreet's Deli. You guys have eaten there. [<i>Laughter</i>] Some of you may think this violates Michelle's \\"Let's Move!\\" program&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but she gives me a pass when it comes to a good burger&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and fries. <p>Now back then, in 2008, we were talking about how working Americans were already having a tough go of it. Folks were working harder and longer for less. It was getting tougher to afford health care or to send your kids to college. The economy was already shedding jobs, and in less than a decade, nearly one in three manufacturing jobs had vanished. Then the bottom fell out of the economy, and things got that much tougher. We were losing seven to eight hundred thousand jobs a month. The economy was hemorrhaging. <p>And 3&frac12; years later, we're still recovering from the worst economic crisis in our lifetimes. And we've got a lot of work to do before everybody who wants a good job can find one, before middle class folks regain that sense of security that had been slipping away even before the recession hit and before towns like Petersburg get fully back on their feet. <p>But here's the good news: Over the past 2 years, our businesses have added nearly 4 million new jobs. We just found out that last month in February we added 233,000 private-sector jobs. More companies are bringing jobs back and investing in America. And manufacturing is adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s. We just had another good month last month in terms of adding manufacturing jobs. And this facility is part of the evidence of what's going on all across the country. This company is about to hire more than 200 new workers, 140 of them right here in Petersburg, Virginia. <p>So the economy is getting stronger. And when I come to places like this, and I see the work that's being done, it gives me confidence there are better days ahead. I know it because I would bet on American workers and American know-how any day of the week. <p>The key now&mdash;our job now is to keep this economic engine churning. We can't go back to the same policies that got us into this mess. We can't go back to an economy that was weakened by outsourcing and bad debt and phony financial profits. We've got to have an economy that's built to last. And that starts with American manufacturing. It starts with you. <p>For generations of Americans, manufacturing has been the ticket into the middle class. Every day, millions clocked in at foundries and on assembly lines, making things. And the stuff we made&mdash;steel and cars and jet engines&mdash;that was the stuff that made America what it is. It was understood around the world. <p>The work was hard, but the jobs were good. They paid enough to own a home and raise kids and send them to college, gave you enough to retire on with dignity and respect. They were jobs that told us something more important than how much we were worth; they told us what we were worth. They told us that we were building more than just products. They told us we were building communities and neighborhoods, we were building a country. It gave people pride about what America was about. <p>And that's why one of the first decisions I made as President was to stand by manufacturing, to stand by the American auto industry when it was on the brink of collapse. The heartbeat of American manufacturing was at stake&mdash;and so were more than a million jobs. And today, the American auto industry is coming back, and GM is number one in the world again, and Ford is investing billions in American plants and factories. And together, over the past 2&frac12; years, the entire auto industry has added more than 200,000 jobs. <p>And here's the thing. They're not just building cars again, they're building better cars. For the first time in three decades, we raised fuel standards in this country so that by the middle of the next decade the cars that are built in America will average nearly 55 miles to the gallon. That will save the typical family about $8,000 at the pump over time. That's real savings. That's real money. <p>And it shows that depending on foreign oil doesn't have to be our future. It shows that when we harness our own ingenuity, our technology, then we can control our future. See, America thrives when we build things better than the rest of the world. I want us to make stuff here and sell it over there. I don't want stuff made over there and selling it over here. And that's exactly what you're doing here at the largest Rolls-Royce facility in the world. That's what you're doing by building the key components of newer, faster, more fuel-efficient jet engines. <p>I just took a tour, and I learned a bit about how a jet engine comes together. Don't quiz me on it. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm a little fuzzy on some of the details. [<i>Laughter</i>] I did press some buttons back there. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But a few weeks ago, I actually got to see the finished product. I went to Boeing, in Washington State, and I checked out a new Dreamliner. I even got to sit in the cockpit, which was pretty sweet. I didn't press any buttons there, though&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;because if it had started going, it would have been a problem. <p>So this plane, the Dreamliner, is going to keep America at the cutting edge of aerospace technology. American workers are manufacturing various components for it in Ohio and Oklahoma and South Carolina and Kansas and right here in Petersburg. In fact, the demand for their planes was so high last year that Boeing had to hire 13,000 workers all across America just to keep up. And Boeing is gaining more and more share all the time. <p>So think about that. Rolls-Royce is choosing to invest in America. You're creating jobs here, manufacturing components for jet engines, for planes that we're going to send all around the world. And that's the kind of business cycle we want to see. Not buying stuff that's made someplace else and racking up debt, but by inventing things and building things and selling them all around the world stamped with three proud words: Made in America&mdash;Made in America. <p>Think about how important this is. I mean, imagine if the plane of the future was being built someplace else. Imagine if we had given up on the auto industry. Imagine if we had settled for a lesser future. <p>But we didn't. We're Americans. We are inventors. We are builders. We're Thomas Edison and we're the Wright Brothers and we are Steven Jobs. That's who we are. That's what we do. We invent stuff, we build it. And pretty soon, the entire world adapts it. That's who we are. And as long as I'm President, we're going to keep on doing it. We're going to make sure the next generation of life-changing products are invented and manufactured here in the United States of America. <p>So that's why we launched an all-hands-on-deck effort. We brought together the brightest academic minds, the boldest business leaders, the most dedicated public servants from our science and our technology agencies all with one big goal: a renaissance in American manufacturing. We called it the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership&mdash;the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership. And today, we're building on it. <p>I'm laying out my plans for a new national network of manufacturing innovation, and these are going to be institutes of manufacturing excellence where some of our most advanced engineering schools and our most innovative manufacturers collaborate on new ideas, new technology, new methods, new processes. <p>And if this sounds familiar, that's because what you're about to do right here at Crosspointe. Later this summer, the Commonwealth Center for Advanced Manufacturing will open its doors. And it's a partnership between manufacturers, including this one, UVA, Virginia Tech, Virginia State University&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;VSU is a little overrepresented here, obviously&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;the Commonwealth, and the Federal Government. So think of this as a place where companies can share access to cutting-edge capabilities. At the same time, students and workers are picking up new skills, they're training on state-of-the-art equipment, they're solving some of the most important challenges facing our manufacturers. <p>You just got all this brain power and skill and experience coming together in this hub, and that makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts. It allows everybody to learn from each other and figure out how we're going to do things even better. It's going to help get that next great idea from a paper or a computer to the lab, to the factory, to the global marketplace. And that's especially important for the one in three Americans in manufacturing who work for a small business that doesn't always have access to resources like these. <p>Obviously, big companies&mdash;the Boeings, the Intels, the Rolls Royces&mdash;they've got the resources, the capital, to be able to create these platforms. But some of the small to medium-sized businesses, it's a little bit harder. So this gives them access and allows them to take part in this new renaissance of American inventiveness. And we've got to build these institutes all across the country&mdash;all across the country. I don't want it just here at Crosspointe, I want it everywhere. <p>To do that, we need Congress to act. Hmm. We&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;it's true. [<i>Laughter</i>] But that doesn't mean we have to hold our breath. We're not going to wait; we're going to go ahead on our own. Later this year, we're going to choose the winner of a competition for a pilot institute for manufacturing innovation, help them get started. With that pilot in place, we'll keep on pushing Congress to do the right thing because this is the kind of approach that can succeed, but we've got to have this all across the country. I want everybody thinking about how are we making the best products, how are we harnessing the new ideas and making sure they're located here in the United States. <p>And sparking this network of innovation across the country, it will create jobs and it will keep America in the manufacturing game. Of course, there's more we can do to seize this moment of opportunity to create new jobs and manufacturing here in America. <p>We've got to do everything we can to encourage more companies to make the decision to invest in America and bring jobs back from overseas. And we're starting to see companies do that. They're starting to realize this is the place with the best workers, the best ideas, the best universities. This is the place to be. We've got to give them a little more encouragement. <p>Right now companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas. Companies that choose to invest in America, they get hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world. Does that make any sense? <p><i>Audience members.</i> No! <p><i>The President.</i> It makes no sense. Everybody knows it. So it's time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas; reward companies that create good jobs right here in the United States of America. That's how our Tax Code can work. That's how our Tax Code should work. <p>At the same time, we've got to do everything we can to make sure our kids get an education that gives them every chance to succeed. I've been told that last year's valedictorian at Petersburg High, whose name is Kenneisha Edmonds, she had a pretty good statement. She said her cap and gown was \\"the best gown that anybody can hang in their closet.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] I like that. So let's make sure students like Kenneisha have teachers who bring out the best in them. Let's make sure if they want to go to college, their families can afford them to go to college. <p>And let's make sure all our workers have the skills that companies like this one are looking for, because we've got to have folks engaged in lifelong learning. The days when you started out at 20 at one company and you just kept on doing the same thing for 40 years, that's not going to happen anymore. <p>So even if&mdash;as I was meeting some of the folks here, they had been in the industry, they'd been machinists, they'd been in manufacturing for years. But they're constantly upgrading their skills and retraining. And some of them had been laid off and had gone back to school before they came to this company. And so we've got to make sure those opportunities for people midcareer and onward, that they can constantly go back to a community college and retool so that they can make sure they're qualified for the jobs of tomorrow. <p>At a time when so many Americans are looking for work, no job opening should go unfilled just because people didn't have an opportunity to get the training they needed. And that's why I've asked Congress, join me in a national commitment to train 2 million Americans with the skills that will lead directly to a job, right now. <p>We need to create more partnerships like the one this plant has with John Tyler Community College. We should give more community colleges the resources they need. I want them to be community career centers, places that teach people skills that companies are looking for right now, from data management to the kind of high-tech manufacturing that's being done at this facility. <p>So day by day, we're restoring this economy from crisis. But we can't stop there. We've got to make this economy ready for tomorrow. Day by day, we're creating new jobs, but we can't stop there, not until everybody who's out there pounding the pavement, sending out their resumes has a chance to land one of those jobs. <p>Every day we're producing more oil and gas than we have in years, but we can't stop there. I want our businesses to lead the world in clean energy too. We've got the best colleges and universities in the world, but we can't stop there. I want to make sure more of our students can afford to go to those colleges and universities. Everybody knows we've got the best workers on Earth, but we can't stop there. We've got to make sure the middle class doesn't just survive these times, we want them to thrive. We want them to dream big dreams and to feel confident about the future. <p>I did not run for this office just to get back to where we were. I ran for this office to get us to where we need to be. And I promise you we will get there. Some of these challenges may take a year, some may take one term, some may take a decade, but we're going to get there. Because when we work together, we know what we're capable of. We've got the tools, we've got the know-how, we've got the toughness to overcome any obstacle. And when we come together and combine our creativity and our optimism and our willingness to work hard, and if we're harnessing our brainpower and our manpower and our horsepower, I promise you we will thrive again. We will get to where we need to go. And we will leave behind an economy that is built to last. We will make this another American century. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"58" "\"Hi, everybody. I'm speaking to you this week from a factory in Petersburg, Virginia, where they're bringing on more than a hundred new workers to build parts for the next generation of jet engines. <p>It's a story that's happening more frequently across our country. Our businesses just added 233,000 jobs last month, for a total of nearly 4 million new jobs over the last 2 years. More companies are choosing to bring jobs back and invest in America. Manufacturing is adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s, and we're building more things to sell to the rest of the world, stamped with three proud words: Made in America. <p>And it's not just that we're building stuff. We're building better stuff. The engine parts manufactured here in Petersburg will go into the next-generation planes that are lighter, faster, and more fuel efficient. <p>That last part is important. Because whether you're paying for a plane ticket or filling up your gas tank, technology that helps us get more miles to the gallon is one of the easiest ways to save money and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. <p>The recent spike in gas prices has been another painful reminder of why we have to invest in this technology. As usual, politicians have been rolling out their three-point plans for two-dollar gas: drill, drill, and drill some more. Well, my response is: We have been drilling. Under my administration, oil production in America is at an 8-year high. We've quadrupled the number of operating oil rigs and opened up millions of acres for drilling. <p>But you and I both know that with only 2 percent of the world's oil reserves, we can't just drill our way to lower gas prices, not when we consume 20 percent of the world's oil. We need an all-of-the-above strategy that relies less on foreign oil and more on American-made energy: solar, wind, natural gas, biofuels, and more. <p>That's the strategy we're pursuing. It's why I went to a plant in North Carolina earlier this week, where they're making trucks that run on natural gas and hybrid trucks that go further on a single tank. <p>And it's why I've been focused on fuel-efficient cars since I took office. Over the last few years, the annual number of miles driven by Americans has stayed roughly the same, but the total amount of gas we use has been going down. In other words, we're getting more bang for our buck. <p>If we accelerate that trend, we can help drivers save a significant amount of money. That's why, after 30 years of inaction, we finally put in place new standards that will make sure our cars average nearly 55 miles per gallon by the middle of the next decade, nearly double what they get today. This wasn't easy: We had to bring together auto companies and unions and folks who don't ordinarily see eye to eye. But it was worth it. <p>Because these cars aren't some pie-in-the-sky solution that's years away. They're being built right now, by American workers, in factories right here in the U.S.A. Every year, our cars and trucks will be able to go further and use less fuel, and pretty soon, you'll be able to fill up every 2 weeks instead of every week, something that, over time, will save the typical family more than $8,000 at the pump. We'll reduce our oil consumption by more than 12 billion barrels. That is a future worth investing in. <p>So we have a choice. Right now some folks in Washington would rather spend another $4 billion on subsidies to oil companies each year. Well, you know what? We've been handing out these kinds of taxpayer giveaways for nearly a century. And outside of Congress, does anyone really think that's still a good idea? I want this Congress to stop the giveaways to an oil industry that's never been more profitable and invest it in a clean energy industry that's never been more promising. We should be investing in the technology that's building the cars and trucks and jets that will prevent us from dealing with these high gas prices year after year after year. <p>Ending this cycle of rising gas prices won't be easy, and it won't happen overnight. But that's why you sent us to Washington: to solve tough problems like this one. So I'm going to keep doing everything I can to help you save money on gas, both right now and in the future. I hope politicians from both sides of the aisle join me. Let's put aside the bumper-sticker slogans and remember why we're here and get things done for the American people. <p>Thank you, God bless you, and have a great weekend.\" "
"59" "\"Good morning, everybody. Before I make an announcement about our efforts to stand up for U.S. businesses and U.S. workers, I'd like to say a few words about the situation in Afghanistan. <p><i>Civilian Deaths in Afghanistan </i><p>Over the weekend, as many of you know, there was a tragic incident in which a number of Afghan civilians were killed. What I've made to President Karzai when I spoke to him is that the United States takes this as seriously as if it was our own citizens and our own children who were murdered. We're heartbroken over the loss of innocent life. The killing of innocent civilians is outrageous, and it's unacceptable. It's not who we are as a country, and it does not represent our military. <p>And for that reason, I've directed the Pentagon to make sure that we spare no effort in conducting a full investigation. I can assure the American people and the Afghan people that we will follow the facts wherever they lead us, and we will make sure that anybody who was involved is held fully accountable with the full force of the law. <p>Yesterday, I met with General Allen and Ambassador Crocker, who were here in Washington, and I've extraordinary confidence in them and in the many Americans who are serving in Afghanistan and who have made extraordinary sacrifices to be there. Today I'll be meeting with Prime Minister Cameron, who is part of our broad coalition serving in Afghanistan, and we'll have an opportunity to consult about the way forward as we prepare for the NATO summit in Chicago later this spring. <p>So make no mistake, we have a strategy that will allow us to responsibly wind down this war. We're steadily transitioning to the Afghans who are moving into the lead, and that's going to allow us to bring our troops home. Already we're scheduled to remove 23,000 troops by the end of this summer, followed by&mdash;following the 10,000 that we withdrew last year. And meanwhile, we will continue the work of devastating Al Qaida's leadership and denying them a safe haven. <p>There's no question that we face a difficult challenge in Afghanistan, but I am confident that we can continue the work of meeting our objectives, protecting our country, and responsibly bringing this war to a close. <p><i>Free and Fair Trade </i><p>Now, one of the things that I talked about during the State of the Union Address was making America more competitive in the global economy. The good news is that we have the best workers and the best businesses in the world. They turn out the best products. And when the playing field is level, they'll always be able to compete and succeed against every other country on Earth. <p>But the key is to make sure that the playing field is level. And frankly, sometimes it's not. I will always try to work our differences through with other countries. We prefer dialogue. That's especially true when it comes to key trading partners like China. We've got a constructive economic relationship with China, and whenever possible, we are committed to working with them to addressing our concerns. But when it is necessary, I will take action if our workers and our businesses are being subjected to unfair practices. <p>Since I took office, we've brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration, and these actions are making a difference. For example, we halted an unfair surge in Chinese tires, which has helped put over 1,000 American workers back on the job. But we haven't stopped there. <p>Two weeks ago, I created a trade enforcement unit to aggressively investigate any unfair trade practices taking place anywhere in the world. And as they ramp up their efforts, our competitors should be on notice: You will not get away with skirting the rules. When we can, we will rally support from our allies. And when it makes sense to act on our own, we will. <p>I just signed a bill to help American companies that are facing unfair foreign competition. These companies employ tens of thousands of Americans in nearly 40 States. Because of subsidies from foreign governments, some of their foreign competitors are selling products at an artificially low price. That needs to stop. <p>This morning, we're taking an additional step forward. We're bringing a new trade case against China, and we're being joined by Japan and some of our European allies. This case involves something called rare earth materials, which are used by American manufacturers to make high-tech products like advanced batteries that power everything from hybrid cars to cell phones. <p>We want our companies building those products right here in America. But to do that, American manufacturers need to have access to rare earth materials, which China supplies. Now, if China would simply let the market work on its own, we'd have no objections. But their policies currently are preventing that from happening. And they go against the very rules that China agreed to follow. <p>Being able to manufacture advanced batteries and hybrid cars in America is too important for us to stand by and do nothing. We've got to take control of our energy future, and we can't let that energy industry take root in some other country because they were allowed to break the rules. So our administration will bring this case against China today, and we will keep working every single day to give American workers and American businesses a fair shot in the global economy. <p>We're going to make sure that this isn't a country that's just known for what we consume. America needs to get back to doing what it's always done best&mdash;a country that builds and sells products all over the world that are stamped with the proud words: Made in America. That's how we create good, middle-class jobs at home, and that's how we're going to create an economy that's built to last. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"60" "\"<i>President Obama.</i> Good morning, everyone. <p>The storied relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is steeped in tradition. And last night, as President, I shared with the Prime Minister a uniquely American tradition of bracketology&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;March Madness. He's learned to appreciate one of our great national pastimes. His team has told me he has decided to install a hoop at 10 Downing Street. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Today we carry on another tradition, an official visit for one of our closest friends and our dearest allies. Prime Minister Cameron, Mrs. Cameron, members of the British delegation, on behalf of the American people, it is my great honor to welcome you to the United States. <p>David, Samantha, on behalf of Michelle and myself, we welcome you to the White House. And, Samantha, just let me say that we are delighted that you've made America your first official foreign trip. <p>It's now been 200 years since the British came here, to the White House, under somewhat different circumstances. [<i>Laughter</i>] They made quite an impression. [<i>Laughter</i>] They really lit up the place. [<i>Laughter</i>] But we moved on. [<i>Laughter</i>] And today, like so many Presidents and Prime Ministers before us, we meet to reaffirm one of the greatest alliances the world has ever known. <p>This visit is also an opportunity to reciprocate the extraordinary and gracious hospitality shown to us by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, by David and Samantha, and by the British people during our visit to London last year. And we are proud that this visit comes as Her Majesty begins her Diamond Jubilee, celebrating 60 extraordinary years on the British throne. <p>It is remarkable to consider: Down the decades, we've seen nations rise and fall; wars fought and peace defended; a city divided, a wall come down; countries imprisoned behind an Iron Curtain, then liberated. We've seen the demise of a cold war and the rise of new threats, the transition from an industrial revolution to an information age where new technologies empower our citizens and our adversaries like never before. Our world has been transformed over and over, and it will be again. Yet through the grand sweep of history, through all its twists and turns, there is one constant: the rock-solid alliance between the United States and the United Kingdom. <p>And the reason is simple. We stand together, and we work together, and we bleed together, and we build together, in good times and in bad, because when we do, our nations are more secure, our people are more prosperous, and the world is a safer and better and more just place. Our alliance is essential&mdash;it is indispensable&mdash;to the security and prosperity that we seek not only for our own citizens, but for people around the world. <p>And that is why, as President, I've made strengthening this alliance and our alliances around the world one of my highest foreign policy priorities. And because we have, I can stand here today and say with pride and with confidence&mdash;and I believe with David's agreement&mdash;that the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is the strongest that it has ever been. <p>And so in the sunlight of this beautiful morning, with children from both nations in attendance, we reaffirm the enduring values in which our alliance is forever rooted. We believe that every person, if they're willing to work hard, if they play by the rules, deserve a fair shot, deserve a chance to succeed. So in these tough economic times, we stand united in our determination to create the jobs that put our people back to work, in expanding trade that is both free and fair, and in fighting for a global economy where every nation plays by the same rules. <p>We believe that our citizens should be able to live free from fear. So, like generations before us, we stand united in the defense of our countries and against those who would terrorize our people or endanger the globe with the world's most dangerous weapons. <p>We believe in the universal rights of all people, so we stand united in our support for those who seek to choose their leaders and forge their future, including the brave citizens of the Middle East and North Africa, who deserve the same God-given rights and freedoms as people everywhere. <p>And we believe in the inherent dignity of every human being. So we will stand united in advancing the developments that lift people and nations out of poverty: the new crops that feed a village, the care that saves a mother in childbirth, the vaccine that allows a child to live a long and healthy life. <p>This is what we believe. This is who we are. This is what we do together, what we achieve together every single day. And this is the alliance that we renew today, guided by the interests we share, grounded in the values that we cherish not just for our time, but for all time. <p>And finally, I would just note that while this is not the first official visit of my Presidency, it is one of the few where I have not had to pause for translation. [<i>Laughter</i>] We Americans and Brits speak the same language, most of the time. [<i>Laughter</i>] So let me just say, David, we are chuffed to bits that you are here&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and I'm looking forward to a great natter. I'm confident that together we're going to keep the relationship between our two great nations absolutely top notch. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>David, Samantha, the warmest of welcomes from Michelle and myself, but more importantly, from the American people. We are honored to have you here. <p><i>Prime Minister Cameron.</i> President Obama, First Lady, Mr. Vice President, members of both Cabinets, guests of honor, ladies and gentlemen: Thank you for such an incredibly warm welcome. Am I&mdash;I have to say, Barack, with that spectacular command of our shared language&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;with all these Union flags and with so many friends at home, you are really making me feel very at home here in Washington. <p>So I am a little embarrassed, as I stand here, to think that 200 years ago&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;my ancestors tried to burn this place down. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, looking around me, I can see you've got the place a little better defended today. [<i>Laughter</i>] You're clearly not taking any risks with the Brits this time. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And thank you also for the lessons last night. I will leave America with some new words&mdash;alley-oops&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;brackets, fast breaks, and who knows, maybe that hoop will be installed in Downing Street after all. It was a great evening. Thank you very much indeed. <p>Now, of course, since that unfortunate episode 200 years ago, generations of British and American service men and women have fought together. Our grandparents fought in the same campaign. My grandfather, wounded a few days after D-day, the greatest ever British and American operation in history. And yours, Barack, serving under General Patton as the Allies swept through France. Whether it is defeating the Nazis, standing up to the Soviets, defending the Korean Peninsula, or hunting down Al Qaida in Afghanistan, there can be no more tangible illustration of our two nations defending our values and advancing our interests than the mutual sacrifice made by our service men and women. And let us once again pay tribute to their valor, their courage, their professionalism, and their dedication here in Washington today. <p>From the Balkans to Baghdad, across the world and across the decades, we have been proud to serve with you. When the chips are down, Britain and America know that we can always count on each other because we are allies not just prepared to say the right thing, but to do the right thing and to do it in the right way: promoting our values, standing up for our ideals. <p>The partnership between our countries, between our peoples, is the most powerful partnership for progress that the world has ever seen. That is why whenever an American President and a British Prime Minister get together, there is a serious and important agenda to work through. And today is no different. Afghanistan, Iran, the Arab Spring, the need for trade, for growth, for jobs in the world economy, the biggest issues in the world, that is our agenda today. <p>But what makes our relationship so vigorous and so lasting is that it draws its strength from roots far deeper and broader than government or the military. It is a meeting of kindred spirits. When the world's brightest minds want to generate the innovations that will make tomorrow more free and more fair, they look to our great universities, like Harvard and Stanford, Cambridge and Oxford. <p>When the most audacious and entrepreneurial philanthropists, like the Gates Foundation, want not just to give out to charity, but to eliminate polio and other avoidable diseases so that no child in our world should die unnecessarily, they find partners across the Atlantic in the British aid agencies, like Save the Children, Oxfam, and Christian Aid. <p>And when a great innovator like Sir Tim Berners-Lee wanted a partner to make the World Wide Web a reality, he turned to America. Why? Because he knew that it was in America that he would find that same spirit of creativity, innovation, and risk-taking that defines our unique approach to enterprise and to business. <p>He's not alone. In 2010, transatlantic partnerships produced eight of the nine Nobel Prizes in science. Foreign direct investment between Britain and America is the largest in the world and now stands at $900 billion. This creates and sustains around a million jobs each side of the Atlantic. And it provides a strong foundation for bilateral trade worth nearly $200 billion a year. In fact, American investment in the U.K. is eight times larger than China, and U.K. investment in America is nearly a hundred and forty times that of China. <p>So yes, the world is changing at a faster rate than ever before, and the ways we will influence events are changing with it. But one thing remains unchanged: the ceaseless back-and-forth between our two nations through ideas, friendship, business, and shared endeavor. And that's why I believe that we can be sure that in 50 years' time, an American President and a British Prime Minister will stand on this very spot, just as we do now; they will stand here, as we do, for freedom and for enterprise; our two countries, the united states of liberty and enterprise. <p>That is why I'm so pleased to be here today to celebrate an essential relationship that, as you say, has never been stronger, and to work with you to make sure we deliver that, and to make our countries closer and closer still. <p>Thank you.\" "
"61" "\"Good evening, everyone. Please have a seat. Welcome to the White House. I was just telling the Prime Minister that, so far, the evening has been successful because I have not stepped on Michelle's train&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;my main goal this evening. Michelle and I could not be more honored that you could join us as we host our great friends the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Cameron, and his remarkable wife Samantha. You can give them a round of applause. Why not? <p>As I said this morning, this visit also gives us an opportunity to return the gracious hospitality that Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth as well as David and Samantha and all the British people showed us during our visit to London last year. And I know Michelle looks forward to returning, because, as she announced yesterday, she will be leading the U.S. delegation to the opening ceremonies of the Summer Olympics in London. I am jealous. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, I'm so grateful for all the time that David and I have had together. But as we've learned, you can never tell how things will get reported as a consequence of our interactions. When we met 2 years ago, we exchanged beers from our hometowns. One newsstory said: \\"David Cameron and Barack Obama cemented their special relationship by hitting the bottle.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>When we had a barbecue at Downing Street for some of our servicemembers, David and I rolled up our sleeves, threw away the aprons, decided to flip the burgers ourselves. One reporter called it a \\"brave and foolish move.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Another expressed amazement at our \\"surprising competence.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Michelle and Samantha often remark the same way. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And finally, when David and I got beat pretty badly in table tennis by some local London kids, one newspaper asked the head coach of the British Olympic women's team to critique our performance. Obama, the coach said, \\"talked a lot.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] David \\"overhits the ball.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Both of them&mdash;I'm quoting here&mdash;\\"looked a little confused.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But in moments like that and in all of our interactions, including today, I've learned something about David. In good times and in bad, he's just the kind of partner that you want at your side. I trust him. He says what he does, and he does what he says. And I've seen his character. And I've seen his commitment to human dignity during Libya. I've seen his resolve, his determination to get the job done, whether it's righting our economies or succeeding in Afghanistan. <p>And I will say something else, David: All of us have seen how you, as a parent, along with Samantha, have shown a measure of strength that few of us will ever know. Tonight I thank you for bringing that same strength and solidarity to our partnership, even if you do overhit the ball. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We are by no means the first President and Prime Minister to celebrate the deep and abiding bonds between our people. There has been no shortage of words uttered about our special relationship. And as&mdash;and I was humbled to offer my own last year when I had the opportunity to address Parliament in Westminster Hall. <p>So rather than words, I'd like to leave you tonight with two simple images. They're from different times and places, decades apart. But they're moments, I think, that reveal the spirit of our alliance and the character of our countries. <p>The first is from the Blitz, when, month after month, the British people braved the onslaught from the sky. And one of those most enduring images from those days is of the London skyline, covered in smoke, with one thing shining through: the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral, tall and proud and strong. The other image we know from our own lives, from that awful September day, that unforgettable picture of the Manhattan skyline, covered in smoke and dust, with one thing shining through: our Statue of Liberty, tall and proud and strong. <p>In those two moments, I think you see all you need to know about who we are and what brings us together tonight. In war and in peace, in times of plenty and times of hardship, we stand tall and proud and strong together. And as free peoples committed to the dignity of all human beings, we will never apologize for our way of life, nor waver in its defense. <p>It's why David's grandfather fought alongside us Yanks after D-day, why my grandfather marched across Europe in Patton's army. It's why tonight, at dusty bases in Afghanistan, both American and British soldiers are getting ready to go on patrol, like generations before them, shoulder to shoulder. It's why our diplomats and development workers are side by side, standing with the activists who dare to demand their rights, save a child from drought or famine. <p>It's why leaders of our two countries can embrace the same shared heritage and the promise of our alliance, even if we come from different political traditions, even if the Prime Minister is younger than nearly 200 years of his predecessors, even if the President looks a little different than his predecessors. And, David, it's why tonight our young children, and children across our countries, can sleep well, knowing that we're doing everything in our power to build a future that is worthy of their dreams. <p>So in closing, let me just say that I intended to make history tonight. I thought that I could be the first American President to make it through an entire visit of our British friends without quoting Winston Churchill. [<i>Laughter</i>] But then I saw this great quote, and I thought, \\"Come on, this is Churchill!\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] So I couldn't resist. <p>It was December 1941, and the attack on Pearl Harbor had finally thrust America into war, alongside our British friends. And these were the words Sir Winston spoke to his new American partners: \\"I will say that he must indeed have a blind soul who cannot see that some great purpose and design is being worked out here below, of which we have the honor to be the faithful servants.\\" <p>And so I'd like to propose a toast: To Her Majesty the Queen, on her Diamond Jubilee, to our dear friends David and Samantha, and to the great purpose and design of our alliance. May we remain, now and always, its faithful servants. Cheers, everyone.\" "
"62" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. Well, I am so&mdash;what a wonderful reception. That is so nice. Thank you. You're all just cheering because I know Michelle. [<i>Laughter</i>] Well, the&mdash;it is wonderful to be here. Folks who have a seat, feel free to take a seat. <p>I want to thank Roy for that introduction. He talks pretty smooth, right? That whole&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. It's great to be back in Maryland. It's great to be here at Prince George's Community College. <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. Now, but before I start, I want to thank your other president, Dr. Charlene Dukes. Your Governor, Martin O'Malley, is in the house. Lieutenant Governor Brown is here. We've got one of the finest members of the United States Senate that you could hope to have in Ben Cardin. Congresswoman Donna Edwards is here. And County Executive Rushern Baker is here. And I want to thank all of you for coming out here today. <p>Now, I just finished learning about some of the work that you're doing here at this community college to make sure that homes are using less energy and helping folks save money on their heating and their air-conditioning bills. And I was very impressed. I'm even more impressed because I know this program is giving a lot of people a chance to make a decent living, everyone from veterans to folks with disabilities to folks who've just been down on their luck, but want to work. So I want you to know how proud I am of this program, of this institution, of all of you. <p>The skills that you gain here at this community college will be the surest path to success in this economy. Because if there's one thing that we're thinking about a lot these days, is, first of all, how do we make sure that American workers have the skills and education they need to be able to succeed in this competitive global economy? And community colleges all across the country and all across Maryland are doing an outstanding job providing young people that first opportunity after high school, but also helping older workers retrain for the jobs of the future, because the economy is constantly adapting. <p>So community colleges are big. Community colleges are critical to our long-term success. What's also critical to our long-term success is the question of energy: How do we use less energy? How do we produce more energy right here in the United States of America? <p>And I know this is an especially important topic for everybody right now because you guys have to fill up at the gas station. And it's rough. Gas prices and the world oil markets right now are putting a lot of pressure on families right now. And one of the things that it is important to remember is for a lot of folks, just doing what you have to do to get your kids to school, to get to the job, to do grocery shopping, you don't have an option. You've got to be able to fill up that gas tank. And when prices spike on the world market, it's like a tax; it's like somebody is going into your pocket. <p>We passed the payroll tax at the beginning of this year to make sure that everybody had an extra $40 in their paycheck, on average, in part because we anticipated that gas prices might be going up like they did last year, given tight world oil supplies. <p>But that doesn't make it easier for a lot of families out there that are just struggling to get by. This is tough. Now the question is, how do we meet this challenge? Because right now we're starting to see a lot of politicians&mdash;talking a lot, but not doing much. And we've seen this movie before. Gas prices went up around this time last year. Gas prices shot up in the spring and summer of 2008; I remember, I was running for President at the time. This has been going on for years now. <p>And every time prices start to go up, especially in an election year, politicians dust off their three-point plans for two-dollar gas. [<i>Laughter</i>] I guess this year they decided, we're going to make it 2.50. [<i>Laughter</i>] I don't know where&mdash;you know, why not 2.40? Why not 2.10? [<i>Laughter</i>] But they tell the same story. They head down to the gas station; they make sure a few cameras are following them, and then they start acting like we've got a magic wand and we will give you cheap gas forever if you just elect us. [<i>Laughter</i>] Every time&mdash;been the same script for 30 years. It's like a bad rerun. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, here's the thing: Because we've seen it all before, we know better; you know better. There is no such thing as a quick fix when it comes to high gas prices. There's no silver bullet. Anybody who tells you otherwise isn't really looking for a solution; they're trying to ride the political wave of the moment. <p>Usually, the most common thing, when you actually ask them, all right, how is it that you're going to get back to two-dollar-a-gallon gas, how are you going to do it, specifically, what is your plan&mdash;then typically what you'll hear from them is, well, if we just drilled more for oil, then gas prices would immediately come down and all our problems would go away. That's usually the response. <p>Now, Maryland, there are two problems with that answer. First of all, we are drilling. Under my administration, America is producing more oil today than at any time in the last 8 years&mdash;any time. That's a fact. [<i>Applause</i>] That's a fact. We've quadrupled the number of operating oil rigs to a record high. I want everybody to listen to that: We have more oil rigs operating now than ever. That's a fact. We've approved dozens of new pipelines to move oil across the country. We announced our support for a new one in Oklahoma that will help get more oil down to refineries on the Gulf Coast. <p>Over the last 3 years, my administration has opened millions of acres of land in 23 different States for oil and gas exploration. Offshore, I've directed my administration to open up more than 75 percent of our potential oil resources. That includes an area in the Gulf of Mexico we opened up a few months ago that could produce more than 400 million barrels of oil. <p>So do not tell me that we're not drilling. We're drilling all over this country. I mean, I guess there are a few spots where we're not drilling. We're not drilling in the National Mall. [<i>Laughter</i>] We're not drilling at your house. [<i>Laughter</i>] Right? I mean, I guess we could try to have, like, 200 oil rigs in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay. <p><i>Audience members.</i> No! <p><i>The President.</i> Well, that's the question. We are drilling at a record pace, but we're doing so in a way that protects the health and safety and the natural resources of the American people. <p>All right, so that's point number one. If you start hearing this \\"drill, baby, drill; drill, drill, drill\\"&mdash;if you start hearing that again, just remember you've got the facts&mdash;we're doing that. Tell me something new. That's problem number one. <p>Here's the second problem with what some of these politicians are talking about. There's a problem with a strategy that only relies on drilling, and that is, America uses more than 20 percent of the world's oil. If we drilled every square inch of this country&mdash;so we went to your house, and we went to the National Mall, and we put up those rigs everywhere&mdash;we'd still have only 2 percent of the world's known oil reserves. Let's say we miss something; maybe it's 3 percent instead of 2. We're using 20; we have 2. <p>Now, you don't need to be getting an excellent education at Prince George's Community College to know that we've got a math problem here. Right? [<i>Laughter</i>] I help out Sasha occasionally with her math homework, and I know that if you've got 2 and you've got 20, there's a gap. [<i>Laughter</i>] There's a gap, right? Do we have anybody who's good at math here? Am I right? Okay. <p>So if we don't develop other sources of energy, if we don't develop the technology to use less energy to make our economy more energy efficient, then we will always be dependent on foreign countries for our energy needs. <p>And that means every time there's instability in the Middle East, which is the main thing that's driving oil prices up right now&mdash;it's the same thing that was driving oil prices up last year&mdash;every time that happens, every time that there's unrest, any time that there's concern about a conflict, suddenly, oil futures shoot up, you're going to feel it at the pump. It will happen every single time. <p>We will not fully be in control of our energy future if our strategy is only to drill for the 2 percent, but we still have to buy the 20 percent. And there's another wrinkle to this. Other countries use oil too. We're not the only ones. So you've got rapidly growing nations like China and India, and they're all starting to buy cars. They're getting wealthier. They want cars too. And that means the price of gas will rise. <p>Just to give you an example: In 2010, China alone added 10 million new cars. That's just in 1 year. And there are about a billion Chinese. So they've got a lot more people who are going to want cars in the future, which means they are going to want to get some of that oil, and that will drive prices up. So we can't just drill our way out of the problem. We are drilling, but it's not going to solve our problem. <p>That's not the future I want for the United States of America. We can't allow ourselves to be held hostage to events on the other side of the globe. That's not who we are. America controls its own destiny. We're not dependent on somebody else. <p>So we can't have an energy strategy for the last century that traps us in the past. We need an energy strategy for the future, an all-of-the-above strategy for the 21st century that develops every source of American-made energy. Yes, develop as much oil and gas as we can, but also develop wind power and solar power and biofuels. Make our buildings more fuel efficient. Make our homes more fuel efficient. Make our cars and trucks more fuel efficient so they get more miles for the gallon. That's where I want to take this country. <p>And here's&mdash;the best part of it is thousands of Americans have jobs right now because we've doubled the use of clean energy in this country since I came into office. And I want to keep on making those investments. I don't want to see wind turbines and solar panels and high-tech batteries made in other countries by other workers. I want to make them here. I want to make them here in Maryland. I want to make them here in the United States of America, with American workers. That's what I want. <p>So when I came into office, we said, all right, how are we going to start moving America in that direction? It's not a thing you get done in 1 year, but how do we start moving in that direction? So after 30 years of not doing anything, we raised fuel economy standards on cars and trucks so that by the middle of the next decade, our cars will average nearly 55 miles per gallon. That's double what we get today, 55 miles per gallon&mdash;55 miles a gallon. <p>So the young people here who were driving those beaters that&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;getting 5 miles per gallon&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. We're going to get you to 55. And that will save the average family more than $8,000 over the life of a car&mdash;$8,000. That will help pay some bills. That means you'll be able to fill up every 2 weeks instead of every week. And those are the cars we need to keep building here in the United States. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Yes we can! <p><i>The President.</i> Yes, we can do that. <p>All right, so now, to fuel these cars and trucks, obviously, if they're using less gas, that's great. That saves us; we're using less oil. But we also want to invest in clean advanced biofuels that can replace some of the oil that we're currently using. That's important. <p>Already, we're using these biofuels to power everything from city buses to UPS trucks to Navy ships. I want to see more of these fuels in American cars&mdash;homegrown fuels&mdash;because that means we're buying less oil from foreign countries and we're creating jobs here in the United States, including big parts of rural America, big parts of rural Maryland, where the economy oftentimes is struggling, you have a real opportunity to create entire new industries and put people to work. And it's happening all across the country. <p>So all of these steps have put us on a path of greater energy independence. Here's a statistic I want everybody to remember next time you're talking to somebody who doesn't know what they're talking about. [<i>Laughter</i>] Since I took office, America's dependence on foreign oil has gone down every single year. All right? In 2010, our oil dependence, the amount that we're bringing in, the percentage we're bringing in, was under 50 percent for the first time in 13 years. We've got to do better than that, and we can do better than that. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Yes we can! <p><i>The President.</i> Yes we can. But in order to do better than that, we've got to tell the folks who are stuck in the past that our future depends on this all-of-the-above energy strategy. That's our job. That it can't just be&mdash;it can't just be&mdash;drilling for more oil. We're drilling for more oil, but that can't be all the solution; that's just part of the solution. <p>Now, the&mdash;here's the sad thing. Lately, we've heard a lot of professional politicians, a lot of the folks who are running for a certain office&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;who shall go unnamed&mdash;they've been talking down new sources of energy. They dismiss wind power. They dismiss solar power. They make jokes about biofuels. They were against raising fuel standards. I guess they like gas guzzlers. They think that's good for our future. We're trying to move towards the future; they want to be stuck in the past. <p>And we've heard this kind of thinking before. Let me tell you something. If some of these folks were around when Columbus set sail&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;they must have been founding members of the Flat Earth Society. [<i>Laughter</i>] They would not have believed that the world was round. We've heard these folks in the past. They probably would have agreed with one of the pioneers of the radio who said: \\"Television won't last. It's a flash in the pan.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] One of Henry Ford's advisers was quoted as saying, \\"The horse is here to stay, but the automobile is only a fad.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>There have always been folks like that. There always have been folks who are the naysayers and don't believe in the future and don't believe in trying to do things differently. One of my predecessors, Rutherford B. Hayes, reportedly said about the telephone, \\"It's a great invention, but who would ever want to use one?\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] That's why he's not on Mt. Rushmore&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;because he's looking backwards. He's not looking forwards. He's explaining why we can't do something, instead of why we can do something. <p>The point is, there will always be cynics and naysayers who just want to keep on doing things the same way that we've always done them. They want to double down on the same ideas that got us into some of the mess that we've been in. But that's not who we are as Americans. See, America has always succeeded because we refuse to stand still. We put faith in the future. We are inventors. We are builders. We are makers of things. We are Thomas Edison. We are the Wright Brothers. We are Bill Gates. We are Steve Jobs. That's who we are. <p>That's who we need to be right now. [<i>Applause</i>] That's who we need to be right now. I don't understand when I hear folks who are in elected office or aspiring to elected office, who ignore the facts and seem to just want to get a cute bumper-sticker line, instead of actually trying to solve our problems. <p>What I just said about energy, by the way, is not disputed by any energy expert. Everybody agrees with this. So why is it that somebody who wants to help lead the country would be ignoring the facts? <p>If you want an example of what I'm talking about, consider an important issue that's before Congress right now. <p>I think somebody may have fainted. All right. Remember next time, if you're going to stand for a long time, you got to eat. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm&mdash;no, no, it's true. You got to get something to eat. You got to get some juice. I'm just saying. It's true. They'll be okay; just make sure to give them space. <p>The question&mdash;there's a question before Congress I want everybody to know about. The question is whether or not we should keep giving $4 billion in taxpayer subsidies to the oil industry. <p>The oil industry has been subsidized by you, the taxpayer, for about a hundred years&mdash;100 years. One hundred years, a century. So some of the same folks who are complaining about biofuels getting subsidies or wind or solar energy getting subsidies or electric cars and advanced batteries getting subsidies to help get them off the ground, these same folks, when you say, why are we still giving subsidies to the oil industry, \\"well, no, we need those.\\" <p>Oil companies are making more money right now than they've ever made. On top of the money they're getting from you at the gas station every time you fill up, they want some of your tax dollars as well. <p>That doesn't make any sense. Does it make sense? <p><i>Audience members.</i> No! <p><i>The President.</i> It's inexcusable. It is time for this oil industry giveaway to end. So in the next few weeks, I expect Congress to vote on ending these subsidies. And when they do, they'll put every single Member of Congress on record. I guess you can stand up for the oil companies who really don't need much help, or they can stand up for the American people, because we can take that $4 billion, we could be investing it in clean energy in a good energy future, in fuel efficiency. We could actually be trying to solve a vital problem. <p>They can bet&mdash;they can place their bets on the energy of the past, or they can place their bets on America's future: on American workers, American ingenuity, American technology, American science, American-made energy, American efficiency, American productivity. We can bet on America and our own capacity to solve this problem. That's the choice we face. That's what's at stake right now. <p>Maryland, we know what direction we have to go in. And every American out there, as frustrated as they are about gas prices right now, when you actually ask people, they'll tell you, yes, we've got to find new sources of energy. We got to find new ways of doing things. People understand that. We just got to get Washington to understand it. We got to get politicians to understand it. <p>We've got to invest in a serious, sustained, all-of-the-above energy strategy that develops every resource available for the 21st century. We've got to choose between the past and the future. And that's a choice we shouldn't be afraid to make because we've always bet on the future, and we're good at it. America is good at the future. We are good at being ahead of the curve. We're good at being on the cutting edge. <p>Ending these subsidies won't bring down gas prices tomorrow. Even if we drilled every inch of America, that won't bring gas prices down tomorrow. But if we're tired of watching gas prices spike every single year, and being caught in this position, where what happens in the Middle East ends up taking money out of your pocket, if we want to stabilize energy prices for the long term and the medium term, if we want America to grow, we're going to have look past what we've been doing and put ourselves on the path to a real, sustainable energy future. <p>That's the future you deserve. So I need all of you to make your voices heard. Get on the phone, write an email, send a letter, let your Member of Congress know where you stand. Tell them to do the right thing. Tell them we can win this fight. Tell them we're going to combine our creativity and our optimism, our brainpower, our manpower, our womanpower. Tell them: Yes we can. Tell them we are going to build an economy that lasts. Tell them we're going to make this the American century just like the last century. <p>Thank you, Prince George's County. Thank you, Prince George's Community College. Thank you, Maryland. Let's get to work. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"63" "\"Hi, everybody. As I know you've noticed over the past few weeks, the price at your local pump has been going up and up. And because it's an election year, so has the temperature of our political rhetoric. <p>What matters most to me right now is the impact that rising prices have on you. When you've got to spend more on gas, you've got less to spend on everything else. It makes things harder. So I wanted to take a minute this weekend to explain what steps my administration is taking when it comes to energy&mdash;most importantly, producing more of it while using less of it. <p>The truth is, the price of gas depends on a lot of factors that are often beyond our control. Unrest in the Middle East can tighten global oil supply. Growing nations like China or India adding cars to the road increases demand. But one thing we should control is fraud and manipulation that can cause prices to spike even further. <p>For years, traders at financial firms were able to game the energy markets, distort the price of oil, and make big profits for themselves at your expense. And they were able to do all that because of major gaps and loopholes in our regulations. When I took office, we did something about it. <p>The Wall Street reforms I signed into law are helping bring energy markets out of the shadows and under real oversight. They're strengthening our ability to go after fraud and to prevent traders from manipulating the market. So it's not just wrong, but dangerous that some in Congress want to roll back those protections and return to the days when companies like Enron could avoid regulation and reap enormous profits, no matter who it hurt. <p>What's more, at a time when big oil companies are making more money than ever before, we're still giving them 4 billion of your tax dollars in subsidies every year. Your Member of Congress should be fighting for you. Not for big financial firms. Not for big oil companies. <p>In the next few weeks, I expect Congress to vote on ending these subsidies. And when they do, we're going to put every single Member of Congress on record: They can either stand up for the oil companies, or they can stand up for the American people. They can either place their bets on a fossil fuel from the last century, or they can place their bets on America's future. So make your voice heard. Send your representative an e-mail, give them a call, tell them to stand with you. <p>And tell them to be honest with you. It's easy to promise a quick fix when it comes to gas prices. There just isn't one. Anyone who tells you otherwise&mdash;any career politician who promises some three-point plan for two-dollar gas&mdash;they're not looking for a solution. They're just looking for your vote. <p>If we're truly going to make sure we're not at the mercy of spikes in gas prices every year, the answer isn't just going to be to drill more, because we're already drilling more. Under my administration, we're producing more oil here at home than at any time in the last 8 years. That's a fact. We've quadrupled the number of operating oil rigs to a record high. That's a fact. And we've opened millions of acres of land and offshore to develop more of our domestic resources. <p>Those are the facts. But we can't just rely on drilling. Not when we use more than 20 percent of the world's oil, but still only have 2 percent of the world's known oil reserves. If we don't develop other sources of energy and the technology to use less energy, we'll continue to be dependent on foreign countries for our energy needs. That's why we're pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy. As we develop more oil and gas, we're also developing wind and solar power, biofuels, and next-generation vehicles, and thousands of Americans have jobs right now because of it. We need to keep making those investments, because I don't want to see those jobs go to other countries. I want to create even more of them right here in America. <p>And after three decades of inaction, we raised fuel economy standards so that by the middle of the next decade, our cars will average nearly 55 miles per gallon. That's nearly double what they get today. That means you only have to fill up every 2 weeks instead of every week. And that will save the typical family more than $8,000 over the life of the car, just by using less gas. <p>Combined, these steps have helped put us on a path to greater energy independence. Since I took office, America's dependence on foreign oil has gone down every single year. In 2010, for the first time in 13 years, less than half the oil we used came from foreign countries. <p>But we can do even better, and we will. What we can't do is keep depending on other countries for our energy needs. In America, we control our own destiny. And that's the choice we face: the past or the future. America is what it is today because we've always placed our bets on the future. Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"64" "\"Today Michelle and I extend our best wishes to all those who are celebrating Nowruz around the world. In communities and homes from America to Southwest Asia, families and friends are coming together to celebrate the hope that comes with renewal. <p>To the people of Iran, this holiday comes at a time of continued tension between our two countries. But as people gather with their families, do good deeds, and welcome a new season, we're also reminded of the common humanity that we share. <p>There is no reason for the United States and Iran to be divided from one another. Here in the United States, Iranian Americans prosper and contribute greatly to our culture. This year, an Iranian production, \\"A Separation,\\" won America's highest honor for a foreign film. Our navies have confronted the danger of piracy, with U.S. sailors even rescuing Iranian citizens who had been taken hostage. And from Facebook to Twitter, from cell phones to the Internet, our people use the same tools to talk to one another and to enrich our lives. <p>Yet increasingly, the Iranian people are denied the basic freedom to access the information that they want. Instead, the Iranian Government jams satellite signals to shut down television and radio broadcasts. It censors the Internet to control what the Iranian people can see and say. The regime monitors computers and cell phones for the sole purpose of protecting its own power. And in recent weeks, the Internet restrictions have become so severe that Iranians can't communicate freely with their loved ones within Iran or beyond its borders. Technologies that should empower citizens are being used to repress them. <p>Because of the actions of the Iranian regime, an electronic curtain has fallen around Iran, a barrier that stops the free flow of information and ideas into the country and denies the rest of the world the benefit of interacting with the Iranian people, who have so much to offer. <p>I want the Iranian people to know that America seeks a dialogue to hear your views and understand your aspirations. That's why we set up a virtual Embassy so you can see for yourselves what the United States is saying and doing. We're using Farsi on Facebook, Twitter, and Google+. And even as we've imposed sanctions on the Iranian Government, today my administration is issuing new guidelines to make it easier for American businesses to provide software and services into Iran that will make it easier for the Iranian people to use the Internet. <p>The United States will continue to draw attention to the electronic curtain that is cutting the Iranian people off from the world. And we hope that others will join us in advancing a basic freedom for the Iranian people: the freedom to connect with one another and with their fellow human beings. <p>Over the last year, we have learned once more that suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away. The Iranian people are the heirs to a great and ancient civilization. Like people everywhere, they have the universal right to think and speak for themselves. The Iranian Government has a responsibility to respect these rights, just as it has a responsibility to meet its obligations with regard to its nuclear program. Let me say again that if the Iranian Government pursues a responsible path, it will be welcome once more among the community of nations and the Iranian people will have greater opportunities to prosper. <p>So in this season of new beginnings, the people of Iran should know that the United States of America seeks a future of deeper connections between our people, a time when the electronic curtain that divides us is lifted and your voices are heard, a season in which mistrust and fear are overcome by mutual understanding and our common hopes as human beings. <p>Thank you, and <i>Eid-eh Shoma Mobarak</i>.\" "
"65" "\"<i>President Obama.</i> Hello, everybody! <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hello! <p><i>President Obama. </i>Well, welcome to the White House. This does not sound like a shy crowd. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>As you may have noticed, today is not, in fact, St. Patrick's Day. [<i>Laughter</i>] We just wanted to prove that America considers Ireland a dear and steadfast friend every day of the year. Some of you may have noticed, we even brought the cherry blossoms out early for our Irish and Northern Irish visitors. And we will be sure to plant these beautiful shamrocks right away. <p>I want to welcome back my good friend <i>Taoiseach</i> Kenny; his extraordinary wife, Fionnuala. This has been our third working visit in just over a year, and each one has been better than the last. <p>I've had the pleasure to welcome back First Minister Peter Robinson; Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness of Northern Ireland as well. <p>And, everyone, please welcome my new friends from Moneygall. My long-lost cousin Henry; his mother Mary is here as well. And my favorite pub keeper, Ollie Hayes, is here with his beautiful wife. He was interested in hiring Michelle&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;when she was pouring a pint. I said, she's too busy, maybe at the end of our second term. <p>In return, I did take them out for a pint at the Dubliner here in Washington, DC, on Saturday. That's right, I saw some of you there. [<i>Laughter</i>] I won't&mdash;I didn't take pictures. And I've asked them to please say hello to everybody back home for me. <p>Now, while there are too many Irish Americans to acknowledge by name here tonight, I do want to thank Martin O'Malley and his band for rocking the White House for the evening. It's said that the curse of the Irish, as the Governor must know, is not that they don't know the words to a song&mdash;it's that they know them all. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>As you may know, I finally got to spend a day in Ireland with Michelle last May. I visited my ancestral village of Moneygall, saw my great-great-great-grandfather's house. I had the distinct honor of addressing the Irish people from College Green in Dublin. And when it comes to their famous reputation for hospitality and good cheer, the Irish outdid themselves. Michelle and I received absolutely the warmest of welcomes, and I've been trying to return the favor as best I can. <p>There really was something magical about the whole day, and I know that I'm not the only person who feels that way when they visit Ireland. Even my most famously Irish American predecessor was surprised about how deeply Ireland affected him when he visited in his third year as President. \\"It is strange,\\" President Kennedy said on his last day in Ireland, \\"that so many years and so many generations pass, and still some of us who come on this trip could feel ourselves among neighbors, even though we are separated by generations, by time, and by thousands of miles.\\" <p>I know most of you can relate to that. I think anyone who's had a chance to visit can relate. And that's why Jackie Kennedy later visited Ireland with her children and gave one of President Kennedy's dog tags to his cousins in Dunganstown. And that's why I felt so at home when I visited Moneygall. <p>When my great-great-great-grandfather arrived in New York City after a voyage that began there, the St. Patrick's Society in Brooklyn had just held its first annual banquet. And a toast was made to family back home enduring what were impossibly difficult years: \\"Through gloomy shadows hang over thee now, as darkness is densest, even just before day, so thy gloom, truest Erin, may soon pass away.\\" <p>Because for all the remarkable things the Irish have done in the course of human history&mdash;keeping alive the flame of knowledge in dark ages, outlasting a great hunger, forging a peace that once seemed impossible&mdash;the green strands they have woven into America's heart, from their tiniest villages through our greatest cities, is something truly unique on the world stage. And these strands of affection will never fray, nor will they come undone. <p>While those times and the troubles of later generations were far graver than anything we could fathom today, many of our people are still fighting to get back on solid ground after several challenging years. But we choose to rise to these times for the same reason we rose to those tougher times: Because we are all proud peoples who share more than sprawling family trees. We are peoples who share an unshakeable faith, an unbending commitment to our fellow man, and a resilient and audacious hope. And that's why I say of Ireland tonight what I said in Dublin last May: This little country that inspires the biggest things, its best days are still ahead. <p>So I propose a toast to the <i>Taoiseach</i> and the people of Ireland. Do I have any&mdash;where's my drink? [<i>Laughter</i>] Here it is, here it is. All right, here we go. It's only water but&mdash;obviously, somebody didn't prepare. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>To quote your first President, Douglas Hyde: \\"A word is more lasting than the riches of the world.\\" And tonight, grateful for our shared past and hopeful for our common future, I give my word to you, Mr. Prime Minister, and to the people of Ireland: As long as I am President, you will have a strong friend, a steadfast ally, and a faithful partner in the United States of America. <p>Ladies and gentlemen, <i>Taoiseach</i> Kenny. Cheers! <p>[<i>At this point, Prime Minister Enda Kenny of Ireland made brief remarks, during which he presented President Obama with a certificate of Irish heritage and a bowl of shamrocks.</i>] <p><i>President Obama.</i> Well, thank you. First of all, this will have a special place of honor alongside my birth certificate. [<i>Laughter</i>] Absolutely. Absolutely. The shamrocks have brought good luck to our garden over the past few years. And I am extraordinarily grateful to you, <i>Taoiseach</i> and Fionnuala, for just being such wonderful hosts to us when we were there. But I think that you get a sense from this crowd that you have a second home on the other side of the Atlantic and that good cheer and warmth is fully reciprocated. <p>So happy St. Patrick's week, everybody. God bless you. May God bless both our countries. Have a wonderful time while you're here. Don't break anything.\" "
"66" "\"Thank you. Please. Well, thank you, John. Thank you, everybody. I know we are all glad to welcome <i>Taoiseach</i> Kenny and his lovely wife back to Washington. Technically, you may be aware, it is not St. Patrick's Day. [<i>Laughter</i>] Of course, technically, most Americans who celebrate St. Patrick's Day are not Irish. So it's a wash. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to thank our top Irishman in the White House, Joe Biden, who is here, and Speaker Boehner for being such a gracious host. I want to welcome Ambassador Collins and Mrs. Collins, distinguished Members of the House and the Senate, leaders from Ireland, Northern Ireland, and Britain. Thank you all for coming. <p>I always think about how every <i>Taoiseach</i> must leave this luncheon marveling at how cheerful and bipartisan Washington is. It's remarkable. And that's something worth aspiring to, even during an election year. <p>As John mentioned, this wonderful tradition began with Speaker Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan. And when I was getting ready this morning, I came across some advice that Tip gave to anybody who was making a St. Patrick's Day speech. As the story goes, Tip was once asked to deliver a speech to the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick in Pennsylvania. He figured the Irishmen would arrive early, perhaps have a few drinks, relax a little bit, and by the time he stood up to speak, they would applaud anything he said as long as he kept it short. <p>Then, as Tip was getting dressed, one of the&mdash;his aides ran up to him, out of breath, and said he had just found out that no drinking was allowed before dinner, only afterwards. And Tip panicked a little bit. He realized he had to prepare. So he grabbed a few pages from \\"Famous Irishmen of America,\\" underlined some passages, acted like he had planned it all along. The speech went extraordinarily well, and afterwards, he was complimented on his thoroughness and studiousness in preparing for the speech. <p>So Tip's lesson was: Always know your audience, and don't count on drinks getting you through the evening. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But Tip also taught us something else. He taught us that even in the midst of partisanship and passion, true friendship can exist in this town. Tip and President Reagan famously had fierce battles and genuine disagreements. But after the work ended, the two men did their best to put partisanship aside. According to Tip, President Reagan used to begin calls with, \\"Hello, Tip, is it after 6 o'clock?\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] To which the Speaker would reply, \\"Absolutely, Mr. President.\\" And then they could enjoy each other's company. <p>For his part, the President said he always knew Tip was behind him, even if it was just at the State of the Union&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;whispering to the Vice President after every policy proposal, \\"Forget it.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"No way.\\" \\"Fat chance.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] I can relate. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So it is no surprise that the two proud Irishmen came together to start this luncheon, with the Speaker promising to cook some Boston corned beef and the President offering to \\"polish up some new Irish jokes.\\" Later, our friend Ted Kennedy and others persuaded <i>Taoiseach</i> to join them. And today, the only argument we have is over who has more green in their family tree. <p>For once, I have some bragging rights here. Last spring, the <i>Taoiseach</i> and Mrs. Kenny hosted Michelle and I for a wonderful visit to Ireland. And one of the highlights was a trip to the small village of Moneygall, where my great-great-great-grandfather on my mother's side lived before he set sail for America. I met my eighth cousin Henry, who has my ears, I might point out. [<i>Laughter</i>] We had a pint of Guinness at the local pub. And I got a chance to see firsthand the kind of hospitality that the big-hearted people of Ireland have always been known for. <p>So today is about celebrating those people, as well as the tens of millions of Americans who trace their heritage across the ocean to the Emerald Isle. Never has a nation so small had such an enormous impact on another. Never has anyone taught us more about the value of faith and friendship, about the capacity of the human spirit, about the simple truth that it's harder to disagree when we recognize ourselves in each other, which is easier to do when we're all wearing green. <p>So to <i>Taoiseach</i> Kenny, I want to thank you and Fionnuala for joining us here today. And I want to thank the people of Ireland for their friendship, now and always. Cheers.\" "
"67" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody. Good afternoon. Everybody, please have a seat. Have a seat. It is wonderful to be here. Thank you so much. It is great to be in Boulder City. <p>A couple people I want to thank for their outstanding work. First of all, our Interior Secretary, Ken Salazar, is in the house. He's the guy in the nice-looking hat. Not only does it look good, but it protects his head, because the hair has gotten a little thin up there. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member</i>. One is a good looking guy. <p><i>The President. </i>He is a good looking guy. <p><i>Audience member.</i> One of them. One of them. <p><i>The President.</i> One of them. [<i>Laughter</i>] There&mdash;that's right. There's the other guy. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I also want to thank your mayor&mdash;a big supporter of solar energy&mdash;and that's Roger Tobler, for being here. Where's Roger? Here he is right there. I just met his beautiful daughter. It's great to see you. <p>I want to thank Jeffrey Martin, CEO of Sempra, and John and Kevin, who helped just give me this tour. <p>And Boulder City is the first stop on a tour where I'll be talking about what we're calling an all-of-the-above energy strategy&mdash;all of the above&mdash;a strategy that relies on producing more oil and gas here in America, but also more biofuels, more fuel-efficient cars, more wind power, and as you can see, a whole lot more solar power. <p>This is the largest solar plant of its kind anywhere in the country. That's worth applauding. Every year, you produce enough clean energy to power around 17,000 homes. And that's just the beginning. Things are going so well that another plant is already under construction down the road that will eventually power another 45,000 homes. And a third plant is in development that will be one day able to power around 66,000 homes. <p>Now, this is an area that was hit hard by the recession, and that's true of the whole State. You guys have been through a lot. But you haven't given up. You looked around at this flat, beautiful land and all this sun&mdash;I just&mdash;I asked the question, how many days of sun do you get a year&mdash;320; that's pretty good&mdash;and decided that Boulder City was the perfect place to generate solar power. <p>In fact, as I was talking to the folks from Sempra, they were explaining that this location is almost optimal for solar power generation, not only because it's flat. Transmission lines were already here, the sun is traveling, and there's no haze, and it's absolutely clear. And so this is an extraordinary opportunity for the community. And when a business showed up with plans to build a new solar plant, hundreds of local workers got jobs because of it. Thousands of families are now powering their homes with a cleaner, renewable source of energy. <p>And this is not just happening here in Boulder City, it's happening in cities and towns all across America. According to experts, we've now got more than 5,600 solar companies nationwide, and many of them are small businesses. There are solar companies in every single State in the Union. And today, we're producing enough solar energy to power 730,000 American homes. And because of the investments we've made as a nation, the use of renewable energies has actually doubled. <p>So this is an industry on the rise. It's a source of energy that's becoming cheaper; we all know it's cleaner. And more and more businesses are starting to take notice. They're starting to look around for more places like Boulder City to set up shop. <p>And when I took office I said, why not give these businesses some access to public lands that aren't otherwise being utilized? At the time, there wasn't a single solar project in place on public lands&mdash;not one. Today, thanks to some great work by Ken Salazar, we've got 16 solar projects approved. And when they're complete, we'll be generating enough energy to power 2 million homes. And that's progress. <p>We're also enforcing our trade laws to make sure countries like China aren't giving their solar companies an unfair advantage over ours. And that's important because countries all around the world&mdash;China, Germany, you name it&mdash;they understand the potential. They understand the fact that as countries all around the world become more interested in power generation&mdash;their population is expanding, their income level is going up, they use more electricity&mdash;and we're going to have to make sure that we're the guys who are selling them the technology and the know-how to make sure that they're getting the power that they need. <p>In fact, just yesterday our administration determined China wasn't playing fair when it came to solar power. And so we took the first step towards leveling the playing field, because my attitude is, when the playing field is level, then American workers and American businesses are always going to win. And that's why we've got to make sure that our laws are properly enforced. <p>Now, you'd think, given this extraordinary site, given the fact that this is creating jobs, generating power, helping to keep our environment clean, making us more competitive globally, you'd think that everybody would be supportive of solar power. That's what you'd think. And yet if some politicians had their way, there won't be any more public investment in solar energy. There won't be as many new jobs and new businesses. <p>Some of these folks want to dismiss the promise of solar power and wind power and fuel- efficient cars. In fact, they make jokes about it. One Member of Congress who shall remain unnamed called these jobs \\"phony\\"&mdash;called them phony jobs. I mean, think about that mindset, that attitude that says because something is new, it must not be real. If these guys were around when Columbus set sail, they'd be charter members of the Flat Earth Society. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's&mdash;we were just talking about this: that a lack of imagination, a belief that you can't do something in a new way. That's not how we operate here in America. That's not who we are. That's not what we're about. <p>These politicians need to come to Boulder City and see what I'm seeing. They should talk to the people who are involved in this industry, who have benefited from the jobs, who benefit from ancillary businesses that are related to what's going on right here. <p>Now, all of you know that when it comes to new technologies, the payoffs aren't always going to come right away. Sometimes you need a jumpstart to make it happen. That's been true of every innovation that we've ever had. And we know that some discoveries won't pan out. There's the VCR and the Beta and the&mdash;all that stuff. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And each successive generation recognizes that some technologies are going to work, some won't; some companies will fail, some companies will succeed. Not every auto company succeeded in the early days of the auto industry. Not every airplane manufacturer succeeded in the early days of the aviation. But we understood as Americans that if we keep on this track, and we're at the cutting edge, then that ultimately will make our economy stronger, and it will make the United States stronger. It will create jobs. It will create businesses. It will create opportunities for middle class Americans and folks who want to get into the middle class. That's who we are. That's what we're about. <p>So I want everybody here to know that as long as I'm President, we will not walk away from the promise of clean energy. We're not going to walk away from places like Boulder City. I'm not going to give up on the new to cede our position to China or Germany or all the other competitors out there who are making massive investments in clean energy technology. I refuse to see us stand by and not make the same commitment. That's not what we do in America. It's not who we are as a country. <p>One of the main reasons I ran for this office is I didn't think that our leaders were doing enough to tackle the big challenges, the hard challenges, to seize the big opportunities. And energy is one of the best examples. We have been talking about changing our energy policies for 30 years. When I was the age of these guys right here, when I was 10, 11, right, in the seventies, and my grandparents were complaining about long gas lines, we were talking about how we were going to do things differently. Thirty, forty years, and we keep on doing the same stuff. We keep on punting. We keep on putting it off. For decades, Washington kept kicking the can down the road. <p>I don't want to do that anymore. I want to make sure when these guys are grown up that they're seeing solar panels all across the country. They're seeing American-made energy and American-made power. They're benefiting from a cleaner environment. They're seeing jobs and opportunity. That's what I want to see. <p>So as long as I'm President, we're going to develop every available source of energy. That is a promise that I'm making to you. <p>And yes, that means we make investments in stuff that is new, and we stop subsidizing stuff that's old. The current members of the Flat Earth Society in Congress&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;they would rather see us continue to provide $4 billion&mdash;$4 billion in tax subsidies, tax giveaways, to the oil companies, $4 billion to an industry that is making record profits. Every time you fill up the pump, they're making money. They are doing just fine. They're not having any problems. <p>And yet, on top of what we're paying at the pump, we're also going to give them $4 billion in subsidies that could be going into making sure there were investments in clean energy for the future? That doesn't make any sense. Does that make any sense? <p><i>Audience members.</i> No! <p><i>The President.</i> All right, I just wanted to make sure. Because I didn't think it was a wise use of your tax dollars. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We have subsidized oil companies for a century. We want to encourage production of oil and gas and make sure that wherever we've got American resources, we are tapping into them. But they don't need an additional incentive when gas is 3.75 a gallon, when oil is 120 a barrel, 125 a barrel. They don't need additional incentives. They are doing fine. <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>]&mdash;our retirement! <p><i>The President.</i> Yes. A century of subsidies to oil companies is long enough. It's time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that's rarely been more profitable and double down on investments in an energy industry that has never been more promising. That's what we need to do. <p>So Congress needs to pass more tax credits for projects like this one, needs to provide certainty when it comes to these tax credits. We need to go out there and do what a lot of States are doing right now, which is saying, let's get a certain percentage of our energy from clean energy sources. Because when we do that, that gives a company like this one certainty that they're going to have customers, and they can invest more and build more. <p>We need to keep Americans on the job. We need to keep these homes powered by clean energy. We need to support the businesses that are doing it. <p>And again, I just want everybody to be clear, because sometimes, when you listen to the news and you listen to some of these other politicians, they seem a little bit confused about what I'm saying. We are going to continue producing oil and gas at a record pace. That's got to be part of what we do. We need energy to grow. That's why we're producing more oil right now, here in America, than at any time in the last 8 years&mdash;any time in the last 8 years. We're opening up more land for oil exploration. We've got more oil rigs operating. There are more pipelines out there that are being approved. I'll be visiting one of those rigs and one of those pipelines this week. <p>But an energy strategy that focuses only on drilling and not on an energy strategy that will free ourselves from our dependence on foreign oil, that's a losing strategy. And that's not a strategy I'm going to pursue. America uses 20 percent of the world's oil, and we've got 2 percent of the world's oil reserves. Think about&mdash;I wasn't a math major, but I just want&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;if you're using 20, you've only got 2, that means you got to bring in the rest from someplace else. Why wouldn't we want to start finding alternatives that make us less reliant, less dependent on what's going on in the Middle East? <p>So we've got to develop new energy technologies, new energy sources. It's the only way forward. And here in Boulder City, you know that better than anybody. You know the promise that lies ahead because this city has always been about the future. Eight decades ago, in the midst of the Great Depression, the people of Boulder City were busy working on another energy project you may have heard of. Like today, it was a little bit ahead of its time. It was a little bit bigger than this solar plant; it was a little louder too. It was called the Hoover Dam. And at the time, it was the largest dam in the world. Even today, it stands as a testimony to American ingenuity, American imagination, the power of the American spirit, a testimony to the notion we can do anything. <p>That was true back then; it is true today. You know the choice we need to make when it comes to energy. We've got to invest in a sustained, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of energy. We've got to stay ahead of the curve. We've got to make sure that we're taking some risks. We've got to make sure that we're making the investments that are necessary. We've got to support extraordinary entrepreneurs that are on the cutting edge. That's who we are. That's what we do. And if we keep on doing it, nothing's going to stop us. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you.\" "
"68" "\"Hello, New Mexico! Thank you so much for being here! Everybody have a seat. I know it's a little windy out here, but you guys are used to it. It is wonderful to be back in New Mexico. <p>I want to acknowledge a couple of folks who are here. Well, first, mainly I want to thank Concho Resources and the Southwest New Mexico ConocoPhillips team for helping to set this up. Thank you. Good job, everybody. <p>It was a wonderful trip over here. We took the helicopter. We had landed in Roswell. I announced to people when I landed that I had come in peace. [<i>Laughter</i>] Let me tell you, there are more 9- and 10-year-old boys around the country&mdash;when I meet them, they ask me, \\"Have you been to Roswell, and is it true what they say?\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] And I tell them, \\"If I told you I'd have to kill you.\\" So&mdash;and their eyes get all big. [<i>Laughter</i>] So we're going to keep our secrets here. <p>I'm here to talk about what we're calling an all-of-the-above energy strategy&mdash;a strategy that relies on producing more oil and gas here in America, but also producing more biofuels in America, more fuel efficient cars in America, more wind power in America, and more solar power in America. I believe this all-of-the-above approach is the only way we can continue to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and ultimately put an end to some of these gas spikes that we're going through right now and that, obviously, hurt a lot of families all across the country. <p>Now, you wouldn't know it from listening to some of these folks who are running for office&mdash;I won't mention their names, you know who they are&mdash;but producing more oil here in our own country has been and will continue to be, a key part of my energy strategy. Under my administration, America is producing more oil today than at any time in the last 8 years. That's a fact. That is a fact. We've approved dozens of new oil and gas pipelines, and we've announced our support for more, including one that I'm going to be visiting tomorrow in Oklahoma. <p>And we've quadrupled the number of operating oil rigs to a record high. More than 70 of those rigs are right here in this area. And I had a chance to see them all, I think, as I was flying over here. [<i>Laughter</i>] In fact, business is so good that today the biggest problem is finding enough qualified truck drivers to move all the oil that's coming out of these wells down to the refinery. Too much oil, that's a good problem to have. <p>Now, this is public land, it's been leased to the oil companies by the Federal Government. And over the last 3 years, I've directed my administration to open up millions of acres, just like this, for oil and gas exploration in 23 different States. Let me repeat that: millions of acres in 23 different States. That's just onshore. Offshore, I've directed my administration to open up more than 75 percent of our potential oil resources. And that includes an area in the Gulf of Mexico that we opened up a few months ago that could produce more than 400 million barrels of oil&mdash;about 38 million acres in the Gulf. <p>And I want to thank my Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar, who is here, because he helped make it happen. Where did Ken go? He's right over here. <p>Now, I make this point so that if you hear anybody on TV saying that somehow we're against drilling for oil, then you'll know that they either don't know what they're talking about, or they're not telling you the truth. We're drilling all over the place. That's one of the reasons we've been able to reduce our dependence on foreign oil every year since I took office. In 2010, it was under 50 percent for the first time in 13 years. And you have my word that we will keep drilling everywhere we can, and we'll do it while protecting the health and safety of the American people. That's a commitment that I'm making. <p>Now, there's no contradiction to say that we're going to keep on producing American oil and American gas and also saying drilling can't be the only part of our energy strategy. A recent independent analysis showed that over the last 36 years, there has been no connection between the amount of oil that we drill in this country and the price of gasoline. There's no connection. And the reason is that we've got a worldwide oil market. And so even if we produce more, the fact of the matter is we use 20 percent of the world's oil. And even if we drilled every square inch of this country, we'd still only have 2 or 3 or 4 percent of the world's known oil reserves. <p>So what ends up happening is the price is impacted not just by us, but by everybody&mdash;in the amount of oil that's used worldwide. And that means if we don't develop new sources of energy along with oil and gas, and if we don't develop technologies to use less energy for the same amount of output, we're always going to depend on other countries for our energy needs. <p>If we do nothing, every time there's instability in the Middle East, we will feel it at the pump even if we're drilling nonstop here in New Mexico and all across the country. If we only drill for our 2 percent of the world's oil reserves, the price of gas will continue to rise. Part of the reason is because China and India, they're growing. China added 10 million cars in 2010&mdash;10 million cars just in this one country. And they're just going to keep on going, which means they're going to use more and more oil. That's not a future I want for America. <p>In this country we control our own destiny. We control our own resources. We control our own economy. We chart our own course. I don't want to be subject to the whim of somebody, somewhere else. And that's why we need an all-of-the-above energy strategy. <p>So we're going to develop every possible source of American-made energy. Oil and gas, wind power, solar power, biofuels, fuel efficient cars and trucks that get more miles to the gallon&mdash;that's our future. And the good news is we're already seeing progress. <p>I just came from Boulder City, Nevada, which is home to the Nation's largest solar plant, a plant that was built by hundreds of American workers and that's now powering tens of thousands of homes. I've been visiting universities and factories where American workers are building cars that get more miles per gallon, because after 30 years of not doing anything, we put in place some of the toughest fuel economy standards in our history. And now, by the middle of the next decade, our cars will average nearly 55 miles per gallon, which is going to save the average family about $8,000 during the life of that car. I know you can use $8,000. <p><i>Audience member</i>. [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President. </i>Absolutely&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I don't know anybody who can't. <p>We've got to continue down this path. And that means we've got to make some important choices for our future. The oil companies that are drilling here in New Mexico and all over the country are making record profits. And like I said, as long as we drill safely and responsibly, I'm committed to making sure that we open more acres to gas and oil exploration. I want American oil companies to do well. I have said, though, it doesn't make sense for us be providing a $4 billion subsidy when oil and gas are doing plenty well on their own. Oil companies are making record profits and that's good. But we don't need to subsidize them. Four billion dollars is a lot of money, and we've been subsidizing them for a hundred years. <p>So my attitude is, let's make sure that we use that money in smarter ways to develop a whole range of new energy sources, since the oil industry is mature and has already taken off. Instead of investing tax dollars in profitable companies, let's invest in our future. Let's tell Congress to get their act together, let's allocate these subsidies in a smart kind of way. <p>Because if we're going to end our dependence on foreign oil and bring gas prices down once and for all, we've got to develop every single source of American energy. We've got to develop new technologies that help use less energy in our cars, our homes, our buildings, our businesses. That's where we need to go. That's what's at stake right now. And with your help, we're going to build that future. <p>So we're going to keep on seeing this incredible part of America's legacy, this incredible natural resource that we have, but we're also going to use our ingenuity and our brainpower to develop new sources of energy. That's going to be the key to our future. That's how we're going to build an economy that lasts. And I'm going to need your help, New Mexico, to make it happen. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. Appreciate you. God bless you. God bless New Mexico and the United States of America. Thank you.\" "
"69" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Oklahoma! Well, it's good to be here. Everybody, have a seat. Have a seat. <p><i>Audience member.</i> I love you, Mr. President! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. It's wonderful to see you. <p>It is good to be back in Oklahoma. I haven't been back here since the campaign, and everybody looks like they're doing just fine. [<i>Laughter</i>] Thank you so much for your hospitality. It is wonderful to be here. <p>Yesterday, I visited Nevada and New Mexico to talk about what we're calling an all-of-the-above energy strategy. It's a strategy that will keep us on track to further reduce our dependence on foreign oil, put more people back to work, and ultimately help to curb the spike in gas prices that we're seeing year after year after year. <p>So today I've come to Cushing, an oil town, because producing more oil and gas here at home has been and will continue to be a critical part of an all-of-the-above energy strategy. <p>Now, under my administration, America is producing more oil today than at any time in the last 8 years. Over the&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;that's important to know. Over the last 3 years, I've directed my administration to open up millions of acres for gas and oil exploration across 23 different States. We're opening up more than 75 percent of our potential oil resources offshore. We've quadrupled the number of operating rigs to a record high. We've added enough new oil and gas pipeline to encircle the Earth and then some. <p>So we are drilling all over the place right now. That's not the challenge. That's not the problem. In fact, the problem in a place like Cushing is that we're actually producing so much oil and gas in places like North Dakota and Colorado that we don't have enough pipeline capacity to transport all of it to where it needs to go, both to refineries, and then eventually all across the country and around the world. There's a bottleneck right here because we can't get enough of the oil to our refineries fast enough. And if we could, then we would be able to increase our oil supplies at a time when they're needed as much as possible. <p>Now, right now a company called TransCanada has applied to build a new pipeline to speed more oil from Cushing to state-of-the-art refineries down on the Gulf Coast. And today I'm directing my administration to cut through the redtape, break through the bureaucratic hurdles, and make this project a priority, to go ahead and get it done. <p>Now, you wouldn't know all this from listening to the television set. [<i>Laughter</i>] This whole issue of the Keystone pipeline has generated obviously a lot of controversy and a lot of politics. And that's because the original route from Canada into the United States was planned through an area in Nebraska that supplies some drinking water for nearly 2 million Americans and irrigation for a good portion of America's croplands. And Nebraskans of all political stripes, including the Republican Governor there, raised some concerns about the safety and wisdom of that route. <p>So to be extra careful that the construction of the pipeline in an area like that wouldn't put the health and the safety of the American people at risk, our experts said that we needed a certain amount of time to review the project. Unfortunately, Congress decided they wanted their own timeline. Not the company, not the experts, but Members of Congress, who decided this might be a fun political issue, decided to try to intervene and make it impossible for us to make an informed decision. <p>So what we've said to the company is, we're happy to review future permits. And today we're making this new pipeline from Cushing to the Gulf a priority. So the southern leg of it we're making a priority, and we're going to go ahead and get that done. The northern portion of it we're going to have to review properly to make sure that the health and safety of the American people are protected. That's common sense. <p>But the fact is that my administration has approved dozens of new oil and gas pipelines over the last 3 years, including one from Canada. And as long as I'm President, we're going to keep on encouraging oil development and infrastructure, and we're going to do it in a way that protects the health and safety of the American people. We don't have to choose between one or the other. We can do both. <p>So I just&mdash;if you guys are talking to your friends, your neighbors, your coworkers, your aunts, or your uncles and they're wondering what's going on in terms of oil production, you just tell them anybody who suggests that somehow we're suppressing domestic oil production isn't paying attention. They are not paying attention. <p>What you also need to tell them is anybody who says that just drilling more gas and more oil by itself will bring down gas prices tomorrow or the next day or even next year, they're also not paying attention. They're not playing it straight. Because we are drilling more, we are producing more. But the fact is, producing more oil at home isn't enough by itself to bring gas prices down. <p>And the reason is we've got an oil market that is global, that is worldwide. And I've been saying for the last few weeks, and I want everybody to understand this, we use 20 percent of the world's oil; we only produce 2 percent of the world's oil. Even if we opened up every inch of the country, if I put a oil rig on the South Lawn&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;if we had one right next to the Washington Monument, even if we drilled every little bit of this great country of ours, we'd still have to buy the rest of our needs from someplace else if we keep on using the same amount of energy, the same amount of oil. <p>The price of oil will still be set by the global market. And that means every time there's tensions that rise in the Middle East, which is what's happening right now, so will the price of gas. The main reason the gas prices are high right now is because people are worried about what's happening with Iran. It doesn't have to do with domestic oil production. It has to do with the oil markets looking and saying, you know what, if something happens, there could be trouble, and so we're going to price oil higher just in case. <p>Now, that's not the future that we want. We don't want to be vulnerable to something that's happening on the other side of the world somehow affecting our economy or hurting a lot of folks who have to drive to get to work. That's not the future I want for America. That's not the future I want for our kids. I want us to control our own energy destiny. I want us to determine our own course. <p>So yes, we're going to keep on drilling. Yes, we're going to keep on emphasizing production. Yes, we're going to make sure that we can get oil to where it's needed. But what we're also going to be doing as part of an all-above&mdash;all-of-the-above strategy is looking at how we can continually improve the utilization of renewable energy sources, new clean energy sources, and how do we become more efficient in our use of energy. <p>That means producing more biofuels, which can be great for our farmers and great for rural economies. It means more fuel-efficient cars. It means more solar power. It means more wind power, which, by the way, nearly tripled here in Oklahoma over the past 3 years, in part because of some of our policies. <p>We want every source of American-made energy. I don't want the energy jobs of tomorrow going to other countries. I want them here in the United States of America. And that's what an all-of-the-above energy strategy is all about. That's how we break our dependence on foreign oil. <p>Now, the good news is we're already seeing progress. Yesterday I went, in Nevada, to the largest solar plant of its kind anywhere in the country. Hundreds of workers built it. It's powering thousands of homes, and they're expanding to tens of thousands of homes more as they put more capacity online. <p>After 30 years of not doing anything, we've finally increased fuel efficiency standards on cars and trucks, and Americans are now designing and building cars that will go nearly twice as far on the same gallon of gas by the middle of the next decade. And that's going to save the average family $8,000 over the life of a car. And it's going to save a lot of companies a lot of money, because they're hurt by rising fuel costs as well. <p>All of these steps have helped put America on the path to greater energy independence. Since I took office, our dependence on foreign oil has gone down every single year. Last year, we imported 1 million fewer barrels per day than the year before. Think about that. America, at a time when we're growing, is actually importing less oil from overseas because we're using it smarter and more efficiently. America is now importing less than half the oil we use for the first time in more than a decade. <p>So the key is to keep it going, Oklahoma. We've got to make sure that we don't go backwards, that we keep going forwards. If we're going to end our dependence on foreign oil, if we're going to bring gas prices down once and for all, as opposed to just playing politics with it every single year, then what we're going to have to do is to develop every single source of energy that we've got, every new technology that can help us become more efficient. <p>We've got to use our innovation. We've got to use our brain power. We've got to use our creativity. We've got to have a vision for the future, not just constantly looking backwards at the past. That's where we need to go. That's the future we can build. <p>And that's what America has always been about, is building the future. We've always been at the cutting edge. We're always ahead of the curve. Whether it's Thomas Edison or the Wright Brothers or Steve Jobs, we're always thinking about what's the next thing. And that's how we have to think about energy. And if we do, not only are we going to see jobs and growth and success here in Cushing, Oklahoma, we're going to see it all across the country. <p>All right? Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"70" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Buckeyes! Oh, yes. Well, it is good to be back at the Ohio State University. I want to thank you&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> I love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. I am thrilled to be here. I want to thank a couple of people. First of all, the outstanding mayor of Columbus, Michael Coleman, is here. I want to thank OSU Provost Joe Alutto. <p>And I just got this extraordinary tour from Giorgio Rizzoni, who's the director of the Center for Automotive Research. So give him a big round of applause. <p>Now, let's face it, a Presidential visit isn't even close to being the biggest thing this weekend on campus. [<i>Laughter</i>] And despite what Vijay said, I did have the Buckeyes heading to the Final Four. I'm just saying. I think Sullinger is going to have a big game tonight. And I promise you I didn't do it because I knew I was coming here, because I am coldblooded when it comes to filling out my brackets. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I genuinely think you guys are looking good. <p>And by the way, I just read somewhere that 1 in every 4 teams in the Sweet 16 is from Ohio. You've got Ohio State, Ohio University, Xavier&mdash;Xavier is in the&mdash;Cincinnati. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> I'm not going to get in the middle of this. [<i>Laughter</i>] I do want to just say no State has ever done this before. So it's a testimony to Ohio basketball. <p>And I want to thank Vijay for the outstanding introduction, very much appreciate that. <p>Now, this is our last stop on a trip where we've been talking about an all-of-the-above energy strategy for America, a strategy where we produce more oil, produce more gas, but also produce more American biofuels and more fuel-efficient cars, more solar power, more wind power, more power from the oceans, more clean and renewable energy&mdash;more clean and renewable energy. <p>You know what I'm talking about here, because this school is a national leader in developing new sources of energy and advanced vehicles that use a lot less energy. <p>I just had a chance to take a tour of the Center for Automotive Research. Now, I admit the best part of it was seeing the Buckeye Bullet, which has gone over 300 miles an hour and is now shooting for 400 miles an hour. And I asked the guys who were helping to design this whether mom was going to let them actually test-drive this thing, and the answer was no. [<i>Laughter</i>] Only professional drivers are permitted. <p>But for anybody who's not familiar with this, the Buckeye Bullet is the fastest electric car in the world&mdash;the fastest in the world. I don't know who's going to need to go that fast. [<i>Laughter</i>] But it is a testament to the ingenuity here at Ohio State and what is essential to American leadership when it comes to energy&mdash;our brain power. <p>I will say, though, when Malia gets her license in a few years, she will not be allowed to go 300 miles per&mdash;an hour. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, one of the reasons that I've been talking so much about fuel-efficient cars and new sources of energy is obviously because we're seeing another spike in gas prices right now. And that's tough on folks. I remember when I was a student, filling up was always tough. And gas prices are putting pressure not just on students, but on a lot of families all across Ohio, all across the country. Whether you're trying to get to school, go to work, go grocery shopping, dropping off your kids, you've got to be able to fill up that gas tank. Right now, for most people, you don't have a choice. <p>So when prices spike, that tax hike feels like a&mdash;or that gas spike feels like a tax hike coming right out of your pocket. That's part of the reason that we passed a payroll tax cut at the beginning of this year so that the average American would get an extra $40 in every paycheck to help offset the price of gas. So that's going to offer some relief. <p>But the bigger question is how do we make sure that these spikes in gas prices don't keep on happening, because we've seen this movie before. This happens just about every year. This happened this time last year. Gas prices were even higher in the spring and summer of 2008. It has been going on for years, for decades. <p>And every time prices start to go up, especially during an election year, politicians, they start dusting off their three-point plan for two-dollar gas. [<i>Laughter</i>] Although this year, they decided it was going to be 2.50. [<i>Laughter</i>] This year they decided it was going to be $2.50. Now, I don't know where they pick that number, 2.50. Because it could have been 2.40, I guess. They could have said 2.10. They could have said 50 cents a gallon. But they all make the same promise. They head down to the gas station, and they make sure a few cameras are following them, and then they tell you how we're going to have cheap gas forever if you just vote for them. And it has been the same script for 30 years&mdash;the same thing. It has been like a bad rerun. <p>And when you ask them, what specifically is your&mdash;&mdash; <p>[<i>At this point, there was an audience interruption.</i>] <p>Sir, I'm here to speak to these folks. You can hold your own rally. You're being rude. Sir, we're trying to talk to these people. Show&mdash;I'll be happy to read your book; if you want to give me your book, I'll be happy to read it. But don't interrupt my conversation with these folks, all right? Show me some courtesy. All right? Show me some courtesy. I'll be happy to take your book. But don't interrupt everybody else. All right? Okay. <p>Now, where was I? [<i>Laughter</i>] Go ahead and get that book from him, guys. He wants to give me a book. Please feel free to grab it. You're touting this book; make sure that you've given it to us. <p>All right, now that we've gotten that settled. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, the question is, why is it that every year we hear the same story about how we're going to have two-dollar gas or dollar-fifty gas or whatever price they come up with, if we would just drill for more oil? That's the solution that you always here. Prices will immediately come down, and all our problems will go away, like magic. <p>There are two problems with that. First of all, we have been drilling. We're drilling right now. Under my administration, America is producing more oil today than at any time in the last 8 years&mdash;at any time. That's a fact. Over the last 3 years, we've opened millions of acres of land in 23 different States for oil and gas exploration. That's a fact. Offshore, I've directed my administration to open up more than 75 percent of potential oil resources. We've quadrupled the number of operating oil rigs to a record high. <p>I just visited New Mexico. Their big problem is they don't have enough truck drivers to transport all the oil that they are producing. We've added enough oil and gas pipeline to circle the entire Earth and then some. I just visited one of those new pipelines in Oklahoma, and today I directed my administration to make sure that we cut the redtape in terms of reducing some of these bottlenecks. <p>So the problem is not that we're not drilling or that we're not producing more oil. We are producing more oil than any time in the last 8 years. That's not the problem. There are probably a few spots where we're not drilling, it's true. I'm not drilling in the South Lawn. [<i>Laughter</i>] We're not drilling next to the Washington Monument. We're not drilling in Ohio Stadium. <p>So there are some spots out there that we are not drilling. But we're doing so in a way that protects the health and safety of the American people and protects America's incredible bounty that God gave us, our resources. <p>So that's point number one. But the second issue, which, because we got a lot of young people, you guys understand, is that a strategy that relies only on drilling defies the fact that America uses 20 percent of the world's oil, but we only have 2 percent of the world's known oil reserves. So we use 20 percent; we have 2 percent. Who's a math major here? [<i>Laughter</i>] All right. If I'm not mistaken, that leaves us about 18 percent short. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We can't simply drill our way out of the problem. Even if we drilled every square inch of this country right now, we're going to be relying on other countries for oil. Does anybody here think that's a good strategy? <p><i>Audience members.</i> No! <p><i>The President.</i> Of course it isn't. We shouldn't have to pay more at the pump every time there's instability in the Middle East, which is the main reason gas prices are going up right now. We should not be held hostage to events on the other side of the world. This is America. We control our own destiny. We forge our own future. And I will not accept an energy strategy that traps us in the past. We're not going to do it. <p>So as long as I'm President, America is going to be pursuing an all-of-the-above energy strategy. Yes, we'll develop as much oil and gas as we can, in a safe way, but we're also going to develop wind power and solar power and advanced biofuels. We can build the next-generation nuclear reactors that are smaller and safer and cleaner and cheaper, but we've got to also look at renewable energy as the key to our future. And we've got to build cars and trucks that get more miles to the gallon. We've got to build homes and businesses that waste less energy and put consumers in control of their energy bills. <p>And we'll do it by harnessing the same type of American ingenuity and imagination that's on display right here at Ohio State&mdash;right here at Ohio State. <p>So already we've made progress. After decades of inaction, we raised fuel economy standards, so that by the middle of the next decade, our cars will average nearly 55 miles per gallon, almost double what we get today. That means you'll be able to fill up your car every 2 weeks instead of every week. You like that? <p>That will save the average family about $8,000 at the pump over the life of a car, which is real money. To use even less oil, we're going to have to keep investing in clean, renewable, homegrown biofuels. And already we're using these biofuels to power everything from city buses to UPS trucks, even to Navy ships. And the more we rely on these homegrown fuels, the less oil we buy from other countries and the more jobs we create right here in America. <p>We also need to keep investing in clean energy like wind power and solar power. I just visited the biggest American solar plant of its kind in Boulder City, Nevada. It's powering thousands of homes. It put hundreds of local people at work. There are thousands of companies like that all across America. And today, thousands of Americans have jobs because of public investments that have nearly doubled the use of clean energy in this country. <p>And as long as I'm President, we are going to keep on making those investments. I am not going to cede the wind and solar and advanced battery industries to countries like China and Germany that are making those investments. I want those technologies developed and manufactured here in Ohio, here in the Midwest, here in America, by American workers. That's the future we want. <p>So all these steps, all these steps have put us on a path of greater energy independence. Here's a statistic I want everybody to remember: Since I took office, America's dependence on foreign oil has gone down every single year. In 2010, our oil dependence was under 50 percent for the first time in 13 years. Even as the economy was growing, we've made progress in reducing the amount of oil that we have to import because we're being smarter, we're doing things better. <p>But now we've got a choice. We can keep moving in that direction, we can keep developing new energy and new technology that uses less oil, or we can listen to these folks who actually believe that the only thing we can do is drill our way out of this problem. In fact, they make fun of clean energy. They call the jobs produced by them \\"phony\\" jobs. They make jokes about them at their rallies. <p>Lately, we've heard a lot of politicians, a lot of folks who are running for a certain office&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;they shall go unnamed&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;they dismiss wind power. They dismiss solar power. They make jokes about biofuels. I guess they like gas-guzzlers because they're against raising fuel standards. Imagine if these guys had been around when Columbus set sail. They'd be charter members of the Flat Earth Society. [<i>Laughter</i>] They don't ask what we can do; they explain what we can't do and why we can't do it. <p>And the point is there will always be cynics and naysayers who just want to keep on doing the same things the same way that we've always done them. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Then we wouldn't have a Black President, but we do! <p><i>The President.</i> Well, that's true. <p>They want to double down on the same ideas that got us exactly into this mess that we've been in and we've been digging our way out of. That's not who we are as Americans. <p>We've always succeeded because we refused to stand still. We put faith in the future. We are inventors. We are builders. We're makers of things. We're Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and Steve Jobs. By the way, the Wright Brothers were from Ohio. Just want to point that out. But that's who we are. That's who we need to be right now. We can't be afraid of the future. <p>The flat Earth crowd, they've got a different view. They would rather give $4 billion in taxpayer subsidies to oil companies this year than to invest in clean energy. Four billion dollars to an industry that's making record profits because of what you're paying at the gas station. Does anybody think that they need help, that they don't have enough incentive to drill for oil? Does anybody think that's a wise use of your tax dollars? <p><i>Audience members</i>. No! <p>We have been subsidizing oil companies for a century. That's long enough. It is time to stop a taxpayer giveaway to an industry that's rarely been more profitable and start making investments in a clean energy industry that has never been more promising. <p>And when Congress votes on this, you guys should put some pressure on to tell them, do the right thing. Bet on our future, not on our past. Put them on record: They can either stand with the oil industry, or they can stand with the American people. They can place their bets on the energy of the past or place their bets on America's future, on American workers, American technology, American ingenuity, American-made energy. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Our children. <p><i>The President.</i> Our children. The&mdash;that's the choice we face. That's what's at stake right now. <p>And, Ohio, we know the direction that we've got to go in. Ending these oil subsidies won't bring gas prices down tomorrow. Even if we drilled every inch of America, that won't bring gas prices down tomorrow. But if we're tired of watching gas prices spike every single year, if we're tired of being caught in this position, knowing that China and India are growing&mdash;China had 10 million cars purchased in 2010 alone. You've got a billion people&mdash;2 billion people out there, who are interested in buying cars, which means that unless we develop alternatives, oil prices are going to keep on going up. <p>I don't want folks in the Middle East taking your money out of your pocket because we did not develop the kind of strategies that will sustain our future and our independence. <p>So I need all of you guys to make your voices heard. Get on the phone, write an e-mail, send a tweet, let your Members of Congress know where you stand. Tell them to do the right thing. Tell them that we can win this fight. Tell them: Yes we can. We can build an economy that lasts. We can make this another American century. We can remind the entire world just why it is the United States of America is the greatest nation on Earth. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"71" "\"Hello, everybody. This week, I traveled across the country to talk about my all-of-the-above energy strategy for America, a strategy where we produce more oil and gas here at home, but also more biofuels and fuel-efficient cars, more solar power and wind power, and other sources of clean, renewable energy. <p>Now, you wouldn't know it by listening to some of the folks running for office out there today, but producing more oil at home has been, and will continue to be, a key part of my energy strategy. Under my administration, we're producing more oil than at any other time in the last 8 years. We've quadrupled the number of operating oil rigs to a record high. And we've added enough oil and gas pipeline to circle the entire Earth and then some. Those are the facts. <p>But as I've been saying all week, even though America uses around 20 percent of the world's oil, we only have around 2 percent of the world's known oil reserves. So even if we drilled everywhere, we'd still be relying on other countries for oil. <p>That's why we're pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy. We're producing more biofuels, more fuel-efficient cars, more solar power, more wind power. This week, I was in Boulder City, Nevada, where they've got the largest solar plant of its kind anywhere in the country&mdash;that's the future. I was at Ohio State University, where they've developed the fastest electric car in the world&mdash;that's the future. I don't want to cede these clean energy industries to China or Germany or some other country. I want to see solar panels and wind turbines and fuel-efficient cars manufactured right here, in America, by American workers. <p>Now, getting these clean energy industries to locate here requires us to maintain a national commitment to new research and development, but it also requires us to build world-class transportation and communications networks, so that any company can move goods and sell products all around the world as quickly and efficiently as possible. So much of America needs to be rebuilt right now. We've got crumbling roads and bridges, a power grid that wastes too much energy, an incomplete high-speed broadband network. And we've got thousands of unemployed construction workers, who've been looking for a job ever since the housing market collapsed. <p>But once again, we're waiting on Congress. You see, in a matter of days, funding will stop for all sorts of transportation projects. Construction sites will go idle, workers will have to go home, and our economy will take a hit. <p>This Congress cannot let that happen, not at a time when we should be doing everything in our power&mdash;Democrats and Republicans&mdash;to keep this recovery moving forward. The Senate did their part: They passed a bipartisan transportation bill. It had the support of 52 Democrats and 22 Republicans. Now it's up to the House to follow suit: to put aside partisan posturing, end the gridlock, and do what's right for the American people. <p>This is common sense. Right now, all across this country, we've got contractors and construction workers who've never been more eager to get back on the job. A long-term transportation bill would put them to work. And those are good jobs. We just released a report that shows nearly 90 percent of the construction, manufacturing, and trade jobs created through investments in transportation projects are middle class jobs. Those are exactly the jobs we need right now, and it will make the economy stronger for everybody. <p>We've done this before. During the Great Depression, America built the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge. After World War II, we connected our States with a system of highways. Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the workers who actually built them, to the businesses that still use them today. <p>So tell Congress that if we invest in new technology and new energy, in new roads and bridges and construction projects, we can keep growing our economy, put our people back to work, and remind the world why the United States is the greatest nation on Earth. <p>Thanks and have a great weekend.\" "
"72" "\"It's good to see you. Thank you. <p>Well, listen, I'm not going to give a long speech, because I just want to make sure that I get a chance to shake everybody's hands. I just want to point out that I was just presented this spiffy jacket. And so whoever arranged to make sure that it fit&mdash;I'm sure it wasn't the General&mdash;I appreciate it. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But as I told General Thurman and your commander here, you guys are the&mdash;at freedom's frontier. When you think about the transformation that has taken place in South Korea during my lifetime, it is directly attributed to this long line of soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, coast guardsmen who were willing to create the space and the opportunity for freedom and prosperity. And the contrast between South Korea and North Korea could not be clearer, could not be starker, both in terms of freedom, but also in terms of prosperity. <p>And the reason that the South is doing so well is obviously attributable to the incredible resilience of their people and their incredible talents and hard work, but it also has to do with you guys. And so my main message is the same obviously to every base that I go to all across&mdash;all around the world, which is, I could not be prouder of what you're doing. Everybody back home could not be prouder of what you guys do each and every day: the dedication, the professionalism that you show. But there's something about this spot in particular, where there's such a clear line and there's such an obvious impact that you have for the good each and every day that should make all of you proud. <p>And I'll just share with you real briefly, last time I was here, I was having lunch with the President of South Korea, President Lee. And he talked about how he was a small child when the Korean war was taking place and its aftermath, and the brutal poverty, the fact that they had nothing. And he went on to be a auto executive and ultimately the President of his country and watch it grow. And he specifically said to me&mdash;and this was a private moment, he didn't say this in front of the press, so you knew he meant it&mdash;he said, the only reason that was able to happen&mdash;and I still think back to all those American soldiers and the sacrifices that they made. <p>That's the legacy you're carrying on here. So we're grateful to you. We're proud of you. And I hope that all your family back home knows how proud your Commander in Chief is of you. <p>And the only other thing I'll say is, for those of you guys who missed the ball games&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;Florida got beat by Louisville, and Ohio State just beat Syracuse. So I don't know how your brackets are doing. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But anyway, thank you, God bless you, and let me just shake some hands and take some pictures. All right.\" "
"73" "\"Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Please, thank you very much. <p>To President Park, faculty, staff, and students, thank you so much for this very warm welcome. It is a great honor to be here at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. I want to thank Dr. Park for, a few moments ago, making me an honorary alumni of the university. <p>Now, I know that this school has one of the world's finest foreign language programs, which means that your English is much better than my Korean. [<i>Laughter</i>] All I can say is <i>kamsa hamnida</i>. <p>Now, this is my third visit to the Republic of Korea as President. I've now been to Seoul more times than any other capital, except for Washington, DC, of course. This reflects the extraordinary bonds between our two countries and our commitment to each other. I'm pleased that we're joined by so many leaders here today, Koreans and Americans, who help keep us free and strong and prosperous every day. That includes our first Korean American Ambassador to the Republic of Korea, Ambassador Sung Kim. <p>I've seen the deep connections between our peoples in my own life among friends and colleagues. I've seen it in so many patriotic Korean Americans, including a man born in the city of Seoul, who came to America and has dedicated his life to lifting up the poor and sick of the world. And last week I was proud to nominate him to lead the World Bank, Dr. Jim Yong Kim. <p>I've also seen the bonds in our men and women in uniform, like the American and Korean troops I visited yesterday along the DMZ, freedom's frontier. And we salute their service and are very grateful for them. We honor all those who have given their lives in our defense, including the 46 brave souls who perished aboard the <i>Cheonan</i> 2 years ago today. And in their memory, we reaffirm the enduring promise at the core of our alliance: We stand together, and the commitment of the United States to the defense and the security of the Republic of Korea will never waver. <p>Most of all, I see the strength of our alliance in all of you. For decades, this school has produced leaders&mdash;public servants, diplomats, businesspeople&mdash;who've helped propel the modern miracle that is Korea, transforming it, from crushing poverty to one of the world's most dynamic economies, from authoritarianism to a thriving democracy, from a country focused inward to a leader for security and prosperity not only in this region, but also around the world: a truly global Korea. <p>So to all the students here today, this is the Korea your generation will inherit. And I believe there's no limits to what our two nations can achieve together. For like your parents and grandparents before you, you know that the future is what we make of it. And you know that in our digital age, we can connect and innovate across borders like never before: with your smart phones and Twitter and Me2Day and Kakao Talk. (<i>Laughter</i>) It's no wonder so many people around the world have caught the Korean wave, <i>Hallyu</i>. <p>Or consider this: In advance of my visit, our Embassy invited Koreans to send us your questions using social media. Some of you may have sent questions. And they called it \\"Ask President Obama.\\" Now, one of you&mdash;maybe it was you, maybe it was somebody else; this is true&mdash;asked this question: \\"Have you posted, yourself, a supportive opinion on a Web site under a disguised name, pretending you are one of the supporters of President Obama?\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] I hadn't thought of this. [<i>Laughter</i>] But the truth is I have not done this. Maybe my daughters have. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I haven't done that myself. <p>So our shared future&mdash;and the unprecedented opportunity to meet shared challenges together&mdash;is what brings me to Seoul. Over the next two days, under President Lee's leadership, we'll move ahead with the urgent work of preventing nuclear terrorism by securing the world's nuclear materials. Now this is an important part of the broader, comprehensive agenda that I want to talk with you about today: our vision of a world without nuclear weapons. <p>Three years ago, I traveled to Prague, and I declared America's commitment to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and to seeking a world without them. I said I knew that this goal would not be reached quickly, perhaps not in my lifetime, but I knew we had to begin, with concrete steps. And in your generation, I see the spirit we need in this endeavor, an optimism that beats in the hearts of so many young people around the world. It's that refusal to accept the world as it is, the imagination to see the world as it ought to be, and the courage to turn that vision into reality. So today, with you, I want to take stock of our journey and chart our next steps. <p>Here in Seoul, more than 50 nations will mark our progress toward the goal we set at the summit I hosted 2 years ago in Washington: securing the world's vulnerable nuclear materials in 4 years so that they never fall into the hands of terrorists. And since then, nations, including the United States, have boosted security at nuclear facilities. <p>South Korea, Japan, Pakistan and others are building new centers to improve nuclear security and training. Nations like Kazakhstan have moved nuclear materials to more secure locations. Mexico, and just yesterday Ukraine, have joined the ranks of nations that have removed all the highly enriched uranium from their territory. All told, thousands of pounds of nuclear material have been removed from vulnerable sites around the world. This was deadly material that is now secure and can now never be used against a city like Seoul. <p>We're also using every tool at our disposal to break up black markets and nuclear material. Countries like Georgia and Moldova have seized highly enriched uranium from smugglers. And countries like Jordan are building their own countersmuggling teams, and we're tying them together in a global network of intelligence and law enforcement. Nearly 20 nations have now ratified the treaties and international partnerships that are at the center of our efforts. And I should add that with the death of Usama bin Laden and the major blows that we've struck against Al Qaida, a terrorist organization that has actively sought nuclear weapons is now on the path to defeat. <p>So, in short, the international community has made it harder than ever for terrorists to acquire nuclear weapons, and that has made us all safer. We're building an international architecture that can ensure nuclear safety. But we're under no illusions. We know that nuclear material, enough for many weapons, is still being stored without adequate protection. And we know that terrorists and criminal gangs are still trying to get their hands on it as well as radioactive material for a dirty bomb. We know that just the smallest amount of plutonium&mdash;about the size of an apple&mdash;could kill hundreds of thousands and spark a global crisis. The danger of nuclear terrorism remains one of the greatest threats to global security. <p>And that's why here in Seoul, we need to keep at it. And I believe we will. We're expecting dozens of nations to announce over the next several days that they've fulfilled the promises they made 2 years ago. And we're now expecting more commitments&mdash;tangible, concrete action&mdash;to secure nuclear materials and, in some cases, remove them completely. This is the serious, sustained global effort that we need, and it's an example of more nations bearing the responsibility and the costs of meeting global challenges. This is how the international community should work in the 21st century. And Korea is one of the key leaders in this process. <p>The United States will continue to do our part: securing our own material and helping others protect theirs. We're moving forward with Russia to eliminate enough plutonium for about 17,000 nuclear weapons and turn it instead into electricity. I can announce today a new agreement by the United States and several European partners toward sustaining the supply of medical isotopes that are used to treat cancer and heart disease without the use of highly enriched uranium. And we will work with industry and hospitals and research centers in the United States and around the world to recover thousands of unneeded radiological materials so that they can never do us harm. <p>Now, American leadership has been essential to progress in a second area: taking concrete steps towards a world without nuclear weapons. As a party to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, this is our obligation, and it's one that I take very seriously. But I believe the United States has a unique responsibility to act; indeed, we have a moral obligation. I say this as President of the only nation ever to use nuclear weapons. I say it as a Commander in Chief who knows that our nuclear codes are never far from my side. Most of all, I say it as a father who wants my two young daughters to grow up in a world where everything they know and love can't be instantly wiped out. <p>Over the past 3 years, we've made important progress. With Russia, we're now reducing our arsenal under the new START Treaty, the most comprehensive arms control agreement in nearly 20 years. And when we're done, we will have cut American and Russian deployed nuclear warheads to their lowest levels since the 1950s. <p>As President, I changed our nuclear posture to reduce the number and role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy. I made it clear that the United States will not develop new nuclear warheads. And we will not pursue new military missions for nuclear weapons. We've narrowed the range of contingencies under which we would ever use or threaten to use nuclear weapons. At the same time, I've made it clear that so long as nuclear weapons exist, we'll work with our Congress to maintain a safe, secure, and effective arsenal that guarantees the defense not only of the United States, but also our allies, including South Korea and Japan. <p>My administration's nuclear posture recognizes that the massive nuclear arsenal we inherited from the cold war is poorly suited to today's threats, including nuclear terrorism. So last summer, I directed my national security team to conduct a comprehensive study of our nuclear forces. That study is still underway. But even as we have more work to do, we can already say with confidence that we have more nuclear weapons than we need. Even after new START, the United States will still have more than 1,500 deployed nuclear weapons and some 5,000 warheads. <p>I firmly believe that we can ensure the security of the United States and our allies, maintain a strong deterrent against any threat, and still pursue further reductions in our nuclear arsenal. <p>Going forward, we'll continue to seek discussions with Russia on a step we have never taken before, reducing not only our strategic nuclear warheads, but also tactical weapons and warheads in reserve. I look forward to discussing this agenda with President Putin when we will meet in May. Missile defense will be on the agenda, but I believe this should be an area of cooperation, not tension. And I'm confident that, working together, we can continue to make progress and reduce our nuclear stockpiles. Of course, we'll consult closely with our allies every step of the way, because the security and defense of our allies, both in Europe and Asia, is not negotiable. <p>Here in Asia, we've urged China&mdash;with its growing nuclear arsenal&mdash;to join us in a dialogue on nuclear issues. That offer remains open. And more broadly, my administration will continue to pursue ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. And after years of delay, it's time to find a path forward on a new treaty that verifiably ends the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons, ends it once and for all. <p>By working to meet our responsibilities as a nuclear power, we've made progress in a third area: strengthening the global regime that prevents the spread of nuclear weapons. When I came into office, the cornerstone of the world's effort, which is the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, was fraying. Iran had started spinning thousands of centrifuges. North Korea conducted another nuclear test. And the international community was largely divided on how to respond. <p>Over the past 3 years, we have begun to reverse that dynamic. Working with others, we've enhanced the global partnership that prevent proliferation. The International Atomic Energy Agency is now conducting the strongest inspections ever. And we've upheld the basic bargain of the NPT: Countries with nuclear weapons, like the United States and Russia, will move towards disarmament; countries without nuclear weapons will not acquire them; and all countries can have access to peaceful nuclear energy. <p>Because of these efforts, the international community is more united and nations that attempt to flout their obligations are more isolated. Of course, that includes North Korea. <p>Here in Korea, I want to speak directly to the leaders in Pyongyang. The United States has no hostile intent toward your country. We are committed to peace. And we are prepared to take steps to improve relations, which is why we have offered nutritional aid to North Korean mothers and children. <p>But by now it should be clear: Your provocations and pursuit of nuclear weapons have not achieved the security you seek; they have undermined it. Instead of the dignity you desire, you're more isolated. Instead of earning the respect of the world, you've been met with strong sanctions and condemnation. You can continue down the road you are on, but we know where that leads. It leads to more of the same&mdash;more broken dreams, more isolation, ever more distance between the people of North Korea and the dignity and the opportunity that they deserve. <p>And know this: There will be no rewards for provocations. Those days are over. To the leaders of Pyongyang, I say, this is the choice before you. This is the decision that you must make. Today we say, Pyongyang, have the courage to pursue peace and give a better life to the people of North Korea. <p>This same principle applies with respect to Iran. Under the NPT, Iran has the right to peaceful nuclear energy. In fact, time and again, the international community, including the United States, has offered to help Iran develop nuclear energy peacefully. But time and again, Iran has refused, instead taking the path of denial, deceit, and deception. And that is why Iran also stands alone as the only member of the NPT unable to convince the international community that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes&mdash;the only member. That's why the world has imposed unprecedented sanctions, slowing Iran's nuclear program. <p>The international community is now poised to enter talks with Iran's leaders. Once again, there is the possibility of a diplomatic resolution that gives Iran access to peaceful nuclear energy while addressing the concerns of the international community. Today, I'll meet with the leaders of Russia and China as we work to achieve a resolution in which Iran fulfills its obligations. <p>There is time to solve this diplomatically. It is always my preference to solve these issues diplomatically. But time is short. Iran's leaders must understand they too face a choice. Iran must act with the seriousness and sense of urgency that this moment demands. Iran must meet its obligations. <p>For the global response to Iran and North Korea's intransigence, a new international norm is emerging: Treaties are binding, rules will be enforced, and violations will have consequences. We refuse to consign ourselves to a future where more and more regimes possess the world's most deadly weapons. <p>And this brings me to the final area where we've made progress: a renewed commitment to harnessing the power of the atom, not for war, but for peaceful purposes. After the tragedy at Fukushima, it was right and appropriate that nations moved to improve the safety and security of nuclear facilities. We're doing so in the United States. It's taking place all across the world. <p>As we do, let's never forget the astonishing benefits that nuclear technology has brought to our lives. Nuclear technology helps make our food safe. It prevents disease in the developing world. It's the high-tech medicine that treats cancer and finds new cures. And of course, it's the energy&mdash;the clean energy&mdash;that helps cut the carbon pollution that contributes to climate change. Here in South Korea, as you know, as a leader in nuclear energy, you've shown the progress and prosperity that can be achieved when nations embrace peaceful nuclear energy and reject the development of nuclear arms. <p>And with rising oil prices and a warming climate, nuclear energy will only become more important. That's why, in the United States, we've restarted our nuclear industry as part of a comprehensive strategy to develop every energy source. We supported the first new nuclear power plant in three decades. We're investing in innovative technologies so we can build the next generation of safe, clean nuclear power plants. And we're training the next generation of scientists and engineers who are going to unlock new technologies to carry us forward. <p>One of the great challenges they'll face and that your generation will face is the fuel cycle itself in producing nuclear energy. We all know the problem: The very process that gives us nuclear energy can also put nations and terrorists within the reach of nuclear weapons. We simply can't go on accumulating huge amounts of the very material, like separated plutonium, that we're trying to keep away from terrorists. <p>And that's why we're creating new fuel banks to help countries realize the energy they seek without increasing the nuclear dangers that we fear. That's why I've called for a new framework for civil nuclear cooperation. We need an international commitment to unlocking the fuel cycle of the future. In the United States we're investing in the research and development of new fuel cycles so that dangerous materials can't be stolen or diverted. And today I urge nations to join us in seeking a future where we harness the awesome power of the atom to build and not to destroy. <p>In this sense, we see how the efforts I've described today reinforce each other. When we enhance nuclear security, we're in a stronger position to harness safe, clean nuclear energy. When we develop new, safer approaches to nuclear energy, we reduce the risk of nuclear terrorism and proliferation. When nations, including my own, fulfill our responsibilities, it strengthens our ability to ensure that other nations fulfill their responsibilities. And step by step, we come closer to the security and peace of a world without nuclear weapons. <p>I know that there are those who deride our vision. There are those who say ours is an impossible goal that will be forever out of reach. But to anyone who doubts the great progress that is possible, I tell them, come to Korea. Come to this country, which rose from the ashes of war&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;a country that rose from the ashes of war, turning rubble into gleaming cities. Stand where I stood yesterday, along a border that is the world's clearest contrast between a country committed to progress, a country committed to its people, and a country that leaves its own citizens to starve. <p>Come to this great university, where a new generation is taking its place in the world, helping to create opportunities that your parents and grandparents could only imagine. Come and see some of the courageous individuals who join us today: men and women, young and old, born in the North, but who left all they knew behind and risked their lives to find freedom and opportunity here in the South. In your life stories we see the truth: Koreans are one people. And if just given the chance, if given their freedom, Koreans in the North are capable of great progress as well. <p>Looking out&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;looking out across the DMZ yesterday, but also looking into your eyes today, I'm reminded of another country's experience that speaks to the change that is possible in our world. After a terrible war, a proud people was divided. Across a fortified border, armies massed, ready for war. For decades, it was hard to imagine a different future. But the forces of history and hopes of man could not be denied. And today, the people of Germany are whole again, united, and free. <p>No two places follow the same path, but this much is true: The currents of history cannot be held back forever. The deep longing for freedom and dignity will not go away. So too on this divided peninsula, the day all Koreans yearn for will not come easily or without great sacrifice. But make no mistake, it will come. And when it does&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;when it does change will unfold that once seemed impossible. And checkpoints will open and watchtowers will stand empty and families long separated will finally be reunited. And the Korean people, at long last, will be whole and free. <p>Like our vision of a world without nuclear weapons, our vision of a Korea that stands as one may not be reached quickly. But from this day until then, and all the days that follow, we take comfort in knowing that the security we seek, the peace we want, is closer at hand because of the great alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea and because we stand for the dignity and freedom of all Koreans. And no matter the test, no matter the trial, we stand together. We work together. We go together. <i>Katchi kapshida! </i><p>Thank you very much.\" "
"74" "\"Thank you very much, President Lee, for welcoming us here today and for the extraordinary hospitality and accommodations that have been provided by the Republic of Korea. We are very grateful to you, and we are grateful to the Korean people for the outstanding leadership in bringing us here together in Seoul. <p>Like the G-20 summit 2 years ago, this gathering is a tribute to the nations that contribute to security and peace that's playing a leading role around the globe and that's taking its rightful place on the world stage. When I hosted the first Nuclear Security Summit 2 years ago in Washington, there were those who questioned whether our nations could summon the will to confront one of the gravest dangers of our time. In part because it involves a lot of technical issues, in part because the world was still grappling with a whole host of other issues like the economy and the global recession, there was some skepticism that we would be able to sustain an effort around this topic. But that's exactly what we've done. <p>We've agreed that nuclear terrorism is one of the most urgent and serious threats to global security. We agreed to the goal of securing the world's nuclear materials in 4 years. We committed ourselves to specific and concrete actions. And to get this done, we agreed a new effort of sustained and effective international cooperation was required, that we would need to create an architecture in which we could share best practices, help to enforce many of the commitments that we had already made, and continue to improve every aspect of this issue. <p>Over the past 2 years, the questions have been different: Would we back up our words with deeds? Would we sustain our cooperation? Today here in Seoul, we can answer with a resounding yes. We are fulfilling the commitments we made in Washington: We are improving security at our nuclear facilities; we are forging new partnerships; we are removing nuclear materials and, in some cases, getting rid of these materials entirely. And as a result, more of the world's nuclear materials will never fall into the hands of terrorists who would gladly use them against us. <p>Of course, what's also undeniable is that the threat remains. There are still too many bad actors in search of these dangerous materials, and these dangerous materials are still vulnerable in too many places. It would not take much&mdash;just a handful or so&mdash;of these materials to kill hundreds of thousands of innocent people. And that's not an exaggeration; that's the reality that we face. <p>And that's why what's required continues to be a serious and sustained effort, and why I'm so encouraged by the excellent participation today, which is, again, a testimony to President Lee's leadership. More nations have come to the table, this time more than 50, not to talk, but to take action. As a consequence of this summit, more commitments will be made, more real, tangible steps. As a consequence, more of our citizens will be safer from the danger of nuclear terrorism. <p>I think we all understand that no one nation can do this alone. This is one of those challenges in our interconnected world that can only be met when we work as an international community. And what we did in Washington, what we're now doing in Korea, becomes part of a larger global architecture designed to reduce the dangers of nuclear weapons and nuclear terrorism, but also allows us, then, to more safely and effectively pursue peaceful uses of nuclear energy. <p>So again, I want to thank President Lee for his leadership. I want to thank all the leaders who are participating here today. I know people's schedules are extraordinarily busy. We've come a long way in a very short time, and that should encourage us. And that should not lead us to complacency; however, it should fortify our will as we continue to deal with these issues. <p>I believe we can maintain that will and that focus. I believe we must, because the security of the world depends on the actions that we take. <p>So, President Lee, thank you again.\" "
"75" "\"Thank you very much. Everybody, please have a seat. Sorry we're running just a little bit behind, but I figured it's a great day to enjoy the Rose Garden. <p>Today Members of Congress have a simple choice to make: They can stand with the big oil companies, or they can stand with the American people. <p>Right now the biggest oil companies are raking in record profits, profits that go up every time folks pull up into a gas station. But on top of these record profits, oil companies are also getting billions a year&mdash;billions a year in taxpayer subsidies&mdash;a subsidy that they've enjoyed year after year for the last century. <p>Think about that. It's like hitting the American people twice. You're already paying a premium at the pump right now. And on top of that, Congress, up until this point, has thought it was a good idea to send billions of dollars more in tax dollars to the oil industry. <p>It's not as if these companies can't stand on their own. Last year, the three biggest U.S. oil companies took home more than $80 billion in profits. Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour. And when the price of oil goes up, prices at the pump go up and so do these companies' profits. In fact, one analysis shows that every time gas goes up by a penny, these companies usually pocket another $200 million in quarterly profits. Meanwhile, these companies pay a lower tax rate than most other companies on their investments, partly because we're giving them billions in tax giveaways every year. <p>Now, I want to make clear, we all know that drilling for oil has to be a key part of our overall energy strategy. We want U.S. oil companies to be doing well. We want them to succeed. That's why under my administration, we've opened up millions of acres of Federal lands and waters to oil and gas production. We've quadrupled the number of operating oil rigs to a record high. We've added enough oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some. And just yesterday we announced the next step for potential new oil and gas exploration in the Atlantic. <p>So the fact is, we're producing more oil right now than we have in 8 years, and we're importing less of it as well. For 2 years in a row, America has bought less oil from other countries than we produce here at home for the first time in over a decade. <p>So American oil is booming. The oil industry is doing just fine. With record profits and rising production, I'm not worried about the big oil companies. With high oil prices around the world, they've got more than enough incentive to produce even more oil. That's why<B> </B>I think it's time they got by without more help from taxpayers who are already having a tough enough time paying the bills and filling up their gas tank. And I think it's curious that some folks in Congress, who are the first to belittle investments in new sources of energy, are the ones that are fighting the hardest to maintain these giveaways for the oil companies. <p>Instead of taxpayer giveaways to an industry that's never been more profitable, we should be using that money to double down on investments in clean energy technologies that have never been more promising: investments in wind power and solar power and biofuels; investments in fuel-efficient cars and trucks and energy-efficient homes and buildings. That's the future. That's the only way we're going to break this cycle of high gas prices that happen year after year after year as the economy is growing. The only time you start seeing lower gas prices is when the economy is doing badly. That's not the kind of pattern that we want to be in. We want the economy doing well, and people to be able to afford their energy costs. <p>And keep in mind, we can't just drill our way out of this problem. As I said, oil production here in the United States is doing very well, and it's been doing well even as gas prices are going up. Well, the reason is because we use more than 20 percent of the world's oil but we only have 2 percent of the world's known oil reserves. And that means we could drill every drop of American oil tomorrow, but we'd still have to buy oil from other countries to make up the difference. We'd still have to depend on other countries to meet our energy needs. And because it's a world market, the fact that we're doing more here in the United States doesn't necessarily help us because even U.S. oil companies, they're selling that oil on a worldwide market. They're not keeping it just for us. And that means that if there's rising demand around the world, then the prices are going to go up. <p>That's not the future that I want for America. I don't want folks like these back here and the folks in front of me to have to pay more at the pump every time that there's some unrest in the Middle East and oil speculators get nervous about whether there's going to be enough supply. I don't want our kids to be held hostage to events on the other side of the world. <p>I want us to control our own destiny. I want us to forge our own future. And that's why, as long as I'm President, America is going to pursue an all-of-the-above energy strategy, which means we will continue developing our oil and gas resources in a robust and responsible way. But it also means that we're going to keep developing more advanced homegrown biofuels, the kinds that are already powering truck fleets across America. <p>We're going to keep investing in clean energy like the wind power and solar power that's already lighting thousands of homes and creating thousands of jobs. We're going to keep manufacturing more cars and trucks to get more miles to the gallon so that you can fill up once every 2 weeks instead of every week. We're going to keep building more homes and businesses that waste less energy so that you're in charge of your own energy bills. <p>We're going to do all of this by harnessing our most inexhaustible resource: American ingenuity and American imagination. That's what we need to keep going. That's what's at stake right now. That's the choice that we face. And that's the choice that's facing Congress today. They can either vote to spend billions of dollars more in oil subsidies that keep us trapped in the past, or they can vote to end these taxpayer subsidies that aren't needed to boost oil production so that we can invest in the future. It's that simple. <p>And as long as I'm President, I'm betting on the future. And as the people I've talked to around the country, including the people who are behind me here today, they put their faith in the future as well. That's what we do as Americans. That's who we are. We innovate. We discover. We seek new solutions to some of our biggest challenges. And ultimately, because we stick with it, we succeed. And I believe that we're going to do that again. Today the American people are going to be watching Congress to see if they have that same faith. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"76" "\"Over the last few months, I've been talking about a choice we face as a country. We can either settle for an economy where a few people do really well and everybody else struggles to get by. Or we can build an economy where hard work pays off again where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same rules. That's up to us. Today I want to talk to you about the idea that everyone in this country should do their fair share. <p>Now, if this were a perfect world, we'd have unlimited resources. No one would ever have to pay any taxes, and we could spend as much as we wanted. But we live in the real world. We don't have unlimited resources. We have a deficit that needs to be paid down. And we also have to pay for investments that will help our economy grow and keep our country safe: education, research and technology, a strong military, and retirement programs like Medicare and Social Security. <p>That means we have to make choices. When it comes to paying down the deficit and investing in our future, should we ask middle class Americans to pay even more at a time when their budgets are already stretched to the breaking point? Or should we ask some of the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share? <p>That's the choice. Over the last decade, we've spent hundreds of billions of dollars on what was supposed to be a temporary tax cut for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. Now we're scheduled to spend almost a trillion more. Today, the wealthiest Americans are paying taxes at one of the lowest rates in 50 years. Warren Buffett is paying a lower rate than his secretary. Meanwhile, over the last 30 years, the tax rates for middle class families have barely budged. <p>That's not fair. It doesn't make any sense. Do we want to keep giving tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans, folks like myself or Warren Buffett or Bill Gates, people who don't need them and never asked for them? Or do we want to keep investing in the things that will grow our economy and keep us secure? Because we can't afford to do both. <p>Now, some people call this class warfare. But I think asking a billionaire to pay at least the same tax rate as his secretary is just common sense. We don't envy success in this country. We aspire to it. But we also believe that anyone who does well for themselves should do their fair share in return so that more people have the opportunity to get ahead, not just a few. <p>That's the America I believe in. And in the next few weeks, Members of Congress will get a chance to show you where they stand. Congress is going to vote on what's called the Buffett rule: If you make more than a million dollars a year, you should pay at least the same percentage of your income in taxes as middle class families do. On the other end, if you make under $250,000 a year&mdash;like 98 percent of American families do&mdash;your taxes shouldn't go up. You're the ones struggling with the rising cost of everything from college tuition to groceries. You're the ones who deserve a break. <p>So every Member of Congress is going to go on record. And if they vote to keep giving tax breaks to people like me&mdash;tax breaks our country can't afford&mdash;then they're going to have to explain to you where that money comes from. Either it's going to add to our deficit, or it's going to come out of your pocket. Seniors will have to pay more for their Medicare benefits. Students will see their interest rates go up at a time when they can't afford it. Families who are scraping by will have to do more because the richest Americans are doing less. <p>That's not right. That's not who we are. In America, our story has never been about what we can do by ourselves, it's about what we can do together. It's about believing in our future and the future of this country. So tell your Members of Congress to do the right thing. Call them up, write them a letter, pay them a visit, and tell them to stop giving tax breaks to people who don't need them and start investing in the things that will help our economy grow and put people back to work. <p>That's how we'll make this country a little fairer, a little more just, and a whole lot stronger. Thanks.\" "
"77" "\"Thank you. Please, have a seat, have a seat. Well, good morning, and welcome to the White House. I want to thank my outstanding Vice President, Joe Biden, for being here. And we are joined by Members of both parties in Congress who helped to get this bill to my desk. So I'm very grateful to them. <p>I want to recognize Congresswoman Louise Slaughter and wish her a speedy recovery. She broke her leg yesterday, so she can't be here in person. I think she'll be okay. But she first introduced the STOCK Act in 2006, and I know how proud she is to see this bill that she championed finally become law. <p>Lately, I've been talking a lot about the choices facing this country. We can settle for a country that&mdash;an economy where a shrinking number of people do exceedingly well, while a growing number struggle to get by. Or we can build an economy where everybody gets a fair shot, everybody is doing their fair share, and everybody plays by the same set of rules. <p>Now, that last part, the idea that everybody plays by the same rules, is one of our most cherished American values. It goes hand in hand with our fundamental belief that hard work should pay off and responsibility should be rewarded. It's the notion that the powerful shouldn't get to create one set of rules for themselves and another set of rules for everybody else. <p>And if we expect that to apply to our biggest corporations and to our most successful citizens, it certainly should apply to our elected officials, especially at a time when there is a deficit of trust between this city and the rest of the country. And that's why, in my State of the Union, I asked Members of the House and the Senate to send me a bill that bans insider trading by Members of Congress, and I said that I would sign it right away. <p>Well, today I am happy to say that legislators from both parties have come together to do just that. The STOCK Act makes it clear that if Members of Congress use nonpublic information to gain an unfair advantage in the market, then they are breaking the law. It creates new disclosure requirements and new measures of accountability and transparency for thousands of Federal employees. That is a good and necessary thing. We were sent here to serve the American people and look out for their interests, not to look out for our own interests. <p>So I'm very proud to sign this bill into law. I should say that our work isn't done. There's obviously more that we can do to close the deficit of trust and limit the corrosive influence of money in politics. We should limit any elected official from owning stocks in industries that they have the power to impact. We should make sure people who bundle campaign contributions for Congress can't lobby Congress, and vice versa. These are ideas that should garner bipartisan support. And they certainly have wide support outside of Washington. And it's my hope that we can build off today's bipartisan effort to get them done. <p>In the months to come, we're going to have plenty of debates over competing visions for this country that we all love: whether or not we invest in the things that we need to keep our country safe and to grow our economy so that it's sustained and lasting; whether or not we'll ask some of our wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share; how we're going to make sure that America remains a land of opportunity and upward mobility for all people who are willing to work. Those are all debates that I'm looking forward to having. <p>But today I want to thank all the Members of Congress who came together and worked to get this done. It shows that when an idea is right that we can still accomplish something on behalf of the American people and to make our Government and our country stronger. <p>So to the ladies and gentlemen who helped make this happen, thank you very much for your outstanding work. And with that, let me sign this bill.\" "
"78" "\"<i>The President.</i> Good morning, everybody. Please, have a seat. Have a seat. Well, welcome to the White House. It is a pleasure to be with all of you this morning. <p>In less than a week, this house will be overrun by thousands of kids at the Easter egg roll. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I wanted to get together with you for a little prayer and reflection, some calm before the storm. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>It is wonderful to see so many good friends here today. To all the faith leaders from all across the country&mdash;from churches and congregations large and small, from different denominations and different backgrounds&mdash;thank you for coming to our third annual Easter prayer breakfast. And I'm grateful that you're here. <p>I'm even more grateful for the work that you do every day of the year: the compassion and the kindness that so many of you express through your various ministries. I know that some of you have joined with our Office of Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships. I've seen firsthand some of the outstanding work that you are doing in your respective communities, and it's an incredible expression of your faith. And I know that all of us who have an opportunity to work with you draw inspiration from the work that you do. <p>Finally, I want to just express appreciation for your prayers. Every time I travel around the country, somebody is going around saying, we're praying for you. [<i>Laughter</i>] We got a prayer circle going. Don't worry, keep the faith. We're praying. [<i>Laughter</i>] Michelle gets the same stuff. And that means a lot to us. It especially means a lot to us when we hear it from folks who, we know, probably didn't vote for me&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and yet expressing extraordinary sincerity about their prayers. And it's a reminder not only of what binds us together as a nation, but also what binds us together as children of God. <p>Now, I have to be careful; I am not going to stand up here and give a sermon. It's always a bad idea to give a sermon in front of professionals. [<i>Laughter</i>] But in a few short days, all of us will experience the wonder of Easter morning. And we will know, in the words of the Apostle Paul, \\"Christ Jesus . . . and Him crucified.\\" <p>It's an opportunity for us to reflect on the triumph of the resurrection and to give thanks for the all-important gift of grace. And for me, and I'm sure for some of you, it's also a chance to remember the tremendous sacrifice that led up to that day and all that Christ endured, not just as a Son of God, but as a human being. <p>For like us, Jesus knew doubt. Like us, Jesus knew fear. In the garden of Gethsemane, with attackers closing in around him, Jesus told His disciples, \\"My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death.\\" He fell to his knees, pleading with His Father, saying, \\"If it is possible, may this cup be taken from me.\\" And yet, in the end, He confronted His fear with words of humble surrender, saying, \\"If it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done.\\" <p>So it is only because Jesus conquered His own anguish, conquered His fear, that we're able to celebrate the resurrection. It's only because He endured unimaginable pain that wracked His body and bore the sins of the world that He burdened&mdash;that burdened His soul that we are able to proclaim, \\"He is risen!\\" <p>So the struggle to fathom that unfathomable sacrifice makes Easter all the more meaningful to all of us. It helps us to provide an eternal perspective to whatever temporal challenges we face. It puts in perspective our small problems relative to the big problems He was dealing with. And it gives us courage, and it gives us hope. <p>We all have experiences that shake our faith. There are times where we have questions for God's plan relative to us&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but that's precisely when we should remember Christ's own doubts and eventually His own triumph. Jesus told us as much in the book of John, when He said, \\"In this world you will have trouble.\\" I heard an amen. [<i>Laughter</i>] Let me repeat. [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"In this world, you will have trouble.\\" <p><i>Audience members.</i> Amen! <p><i>The President.</i> \\"But take heart!\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"I have overcome the world.\\" So we are here today to celebrate that glorious overcoming, the sacrifice of a risen Savior who died so that we might live. And I hope that our time together this morning will strengthen us individually, as believers and as a nation. <p>And with that, I'd like to invite my good friend, Dr. Cynthia Hale, to deliver our opening prayer. Dr. Hale.\" "
"79" "\"Thank you. Hello, everybody. Please, please have a seat. Good afternoon. I want to thank all of you for coming, and in particular, I want to thank the Members of Congress who are here today from both parties, whose leadership and hard work made this bill a reality. <p>One of the great things about America is that we are a nation of doers, not just talkers, but doers. We think big, we take risks, and we believe that anyone with a solid plan and a willingness to work hard can turn even the most improbable idea into a successful business. So ours is a legacy of Edisons and Graham Bells, Fords and Boeings, of Googles and of Twitters. This is a country that's always been on the cutting edge. And the reason is that America has always had the most daring entrepreneurs in the world. <p>Some of them are standing with me today. When their ideas take root, we get inventions that can change the way we live. And when their businesses take off, more people become employed because, overall, new businesses account for almost every new job that's created in America. <p>Now, because we're still recovering from one of the worst recessions in our history, the last few years have been pretty tough on entrepreneurs. Credit's been tight, and no matter how good their ideas are, if an entrepreneur can't get a loan from a bank or backing from investors, it's almost impossible to get their businesses off the ground. And that's why back in September, and again in my State of the Union, I called on Congress to remove a number of barriers that were preventing aspiring entrepreneurs from getting funding. And this is one useful and important step along that journey. <p>Here's what's going to happen because of this bill. For business owners who want to take their companies to the next level, this bill will make it easier for you to go public. And that's a big deal because going public is a major step towards expanding and hiring more workers. It's a big deal for investors as well because public companies operate with greater oversight and greater transparency. <p>And for startups and small businesses, this bill is a potential game changer. Right now you can only turn to a limited group of investors, including banks and wealthy individuals, to get funding. Laws that are nearly eight decades old make it impossible for others to invest. But a lot's changed in 80 years, and it's time our laws did as well. Because of this bill, startups and small business will now have access to a big new pool of potential investors, namely, the American people. For the first time, ordinary Americans will be able to go online and invest in entrepreneurs that they believe in. <p>Of course, to make sure Americans don't get taken advantage of, the web sites where folks will go to fund all these startups and small businesses will be subject to rigorous oversight. The SEC is going to play an important role in implementing this bill. And I've directed my administration to keep a close eye as this law goes into effect and to provide me with regular updates. It also means that&mdash;to all the Members of Congress who are here today, I want to say publicly before I sign this bill&mdash;it's going to be important that we continue to make sure that the SEC is properly funded, just like all our other regulatory agencies, so that they can do the job and make sure that our investors get adequate protections. <p>This bill represents exactly the kind of bipartisan action we should be taking in Washington to help our economy. I've always said that the true engine of job creation in this country is the private sector, not the government. Our job is to help our companies grow and hire. That's why I pushed for this bill. That's why I know that the bipartisan group of legislators here pushed for this bill. That's why I've cut taxes for small businesses over 17 times. That's why every day I'm fighting to make sure America is the best place on Earth to do business. <p>Our economy has begun to turn a corner, but we've still got a long way to go. We've still got a lot of Americans out there who are looking for a job or looking for a job that pays better than the one that they've got. And we're going to have to keep working together so that we can keep moving the economy forward. <p>But I've never been more confident about our future. And the reason is because of the American people. Some of the folks beside me here today are a testimony to that. Day out&mdash;after day, they're out there pitching investors. Some meetings go well; some meetings don't go so well&mdash;that's true for me, too. [<i>Laughter</i>] But no matter what, they keep at it. And who knows, maybe one of them or one of the folks in the audience here today will be the next Bill Gates or Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg. And one of them may be the next entrepreneur to turn a big idea into an entire new industry. That's the promise of America; that's what this country is all about. <p>So if these entrepreneurs are willing to keep giving their all, the least Washington can do is to help them succeed. I plan to do that now by proudly signing this bill. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"80" "\"I'd like to wish a happy holiday to all those celebrating Passover. <p>The story of the Exodus is thousands of years old, but it remains as relevant as ever. Throughout our history, there are those who have targeted the Jewish people for harm, a fact we were so painfully reminded of just a few weeks ago in Toulouse. Just as throughout history, there have been those who have sought to oppress others because of their faith, ethnicity, or color of their skin. <p>But tomorrow night Jews around the world will renew their faith that liberty will ultimately prevail over tyranny. They will give thanks for the blessings of freedom, while remembering those who are still not free. And they will ask one of our life's most difficult questions: Once we have passed from bondage to liberty, how do we make the most of all that God has given us? <p>This question may never be resolved, but throughout the years, the search for answers has deepened the Jewish people's commitment to repairing the world and inspired American Jews to help make our union more perfect. And the story of that first Exodus has also inspired those who are not Jewish with common hopes and a common sense of obligation. <p>So this is a very special tradition, and it's one I'm proud to be taking part of tomorrow night at the fourth annual White House Seder. Led by Jewish members of my staff, we'll retell the story of the Exodus, listen to our youngest guest ask the four questions, and of course, look forward to a good bowl of matzo ball soup. <p>Michelle and I are proud to celebrate with friends here at home and around the world, including those in the State of Israel. <p>So on behalf of the entire Obama family, <i>chag sameach</i>.\" "
"81" "\"Thank you. Everybody, sit down, sit down. I was going to head over here earlier and they said, no, no, this place is full of women, and they're still settling down. [<i>Laughter</i>] I said, what do you mean settling down? What are they doing over there? Just creating havoc. <p>Welcome to the White House, everybody. It is a pleasure to be surrounded by so many talented, accomplished women. It makes me feel right at home. Although usually, I've got my wingman Bo with me. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to thank everybody who's made this forum on women and the economy possible. I thank Mika for helping moderate today and proving that, on your show every morning, that women really are the better half. [<i>Laughter</i>] Joe is not denying it. [<i>Laughter</i>] He's not denying it. <p>I want to thank the members of my Cabinet and administration who are participating today. And I want to thank all of you who've come today lending your time and your energy to the critical cause of broadening opportunity for America's women <p>Right now no issue is more important than restoring economic security for all our families in the wake of the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression. And that begins with making sure everyone who wants a job has one. So we welcome today's news&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;we welcome today's news that our businesses created another 121,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate ticked down. Our economy has now created more than 4 million private sector jobs over the past 2 years and more than 600,000 in the past 3 months alone. But it's clear to every American that there will still be ups and downs along the way and that we've got a lot more work to do. <p>And that includes addressing challenges that are unique to women's economic security: challenges that have been around since long before the recession hit. And that's why one of the first things I did after taking office was to create a White House Council on Women and Girls. I wanted to make sure that every agency across my administration considers the needs of women and girls in every decision we make. And today we're releasing a report on women and the economy that looks at women's economic security through all stages of life: from young women furthering their education and beginning their careers, to working women who create jobs and provide for their families, to seniors in retirement or getting ready for retirement. <p>There's been a lot of talk about women and women's issues lately, as there should be. But I do think that the conversation has been oversimplified. Women are not some monolithic bloc. Women are not an interest group. You shouldn't be treated that way. Women are over half this country and its workforce, not to mention 80 percent of my household, if you count my mother-in-law. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I always count my mother-in-law. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Every decision made by those of us in public life impacts women just as much as men. And this report you all have explains some of what we've done to try to lift up the lives of women and girls in this country. But I'd like to spend some time talking about why we've done what we've done. <p>For me, at least, it begins with the women who've shaped my life. I grew up the son of a single mom who struggled to put herself through school and make ends meet, had to rely on food stamps at one point to get us by. But she earned her education; she made it through with scholarships and hard work. And my sister and I earned our degrees because of her motivation and her support and her impact. I've told this story before: She used to wake me up before dawn when I was living overseas, making sure that I was keeping up with my American education, and when I'd complain, she'd let loose with \\"this is no picnic for me either, buster.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] And that's part of the reason why my sister chose to become a teacher. <p>When my mom needed help with us, my grandmother stepped up. My grandmother had a high school education. My grandfather got to go to college on the GI bill; my grandmother wasn't afforded those same opportunities even though she had worked on an assembly line, a bomber assembly line in World War II. Nevertheless, she got a job at a local bank, and she was smart and tough and disciplined, and she worked hard. And eventually, she rose from being a secretary to being vice president at this bank, and I'm convinced she would have been the best president that bank had ever seen if she had gotten the chance. But at some point, she hit the glass ceiling, and for a big chunk of her career, she watched other men that she had trained&mdash;younger men that she had trained&mdash;pass her up that ladder. <p>And then there is the woman who once advised me at the law firm in Chicago where we met. [<i>Laughter</i>] Once&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;she gave me very good advice. That's why I decided to marry her. [<i>Laughter</i>] And once Michelle and I had our girls, she gave it her all to balance raising a family and pursuing a career&mdash;and something that could be very difficult on her, because I was gone a lot. <p>Once I was in the State legislature, I was teaching, I was practicing law, I'd be traveling, and we didn't have the luxury for her not to work. And I know when she was with the girls, she'd feel guilty that she wasn't giving enough time to her work. And when she was at work, she was feeling guilty she wasn't giving enough time to the girls. And like many of you, we both wished that there were a machine that could let us be in two places at once. And so she had to constantly juggle it and carried an extraordinary burden for a long period of time. <p>And then finally, as a father, one of my highlights of every day is asking my daughters about their day, their hopes, and their futures. That's what drives me every day when I step into the Oval Office: thinking about them. Every decision I make is all about making sure they and all our daughters and all our sons grow up in a country that gives them the chance to be anything they set their minds to, a country where more doors are open to them than were open to us. <p>So when I think about these efforts, when we put together this Council on Women and Girls, this is personal. That's what is at the heart of all our efforts. These are the experiences, the prism through which I view these efforts. And that's what we mean when we say that these issues are more than just a matter of policy. And when we talk about these issues that primarily impact women, we've got to realize they are not just women's issues. They are family issues, they are economic issues, they are growth issues, they are issues about American competitiveness. They're issues that impact all of us. <p>Now, think about it. When women make less than men for the same work, that hurts families who have to get by with less and businesses who have fewer customers with less to spend. When a job doesn't offer family leave to care for a new baby or sick leave to care for an ailing parent, that burdens men as well. When an insurance plan denies women coverage because of preexisting conditions, that puts a strain on emergency rooms, drives up costs of care for everybody. When any of our citizens can't fulfill the potential that they have because of factors that have nothing to do with talent, or character, or work ethic, that diminishes us all. It holds all of us back. And it says something about who we are as Americans. <p>Right now women are a growing number of breadwinners in the household. But they're still earning just 77 cents for every dollar a man does, even less if you're an African American or Latina woman. Overall, a woman with a college degree doing the same work as a man will earn hundreds of thousands of dollars less over the course of her career. <p>So closing this pay gap, ending pay discrimination, is about far more than simple fairness. When more women are bringing home the bacon, but bringing home less of it than men who are doing the same work, that weakens families, it weakens communities, it's tough on our kids, it weakens our entire economy. <p>Which is why the first bill I signed into law was the Lilly Ledbetter act&mdash;the Fair Pay Act&mdash;to make it easier for women to demand fairness: equal pay for equal work. We're pushing for legislation to give women more tools to pay&mdash;to fight pay discrimination. And we've encouraged companies to make workplaces more flexible so women don't have to choose between being a good employee or a good mom. <p>More women are also choosing to strike out on their own. Today, nearly 30 percent of small business owners are women. Their businesses generate $1.2 trillion last year. But they're less likely to get the loans that they need to start up or expand or to hire, which means they often have to depend on credit cards and the mounting debt that comes with them. And that's why, through some outstanding work by Karen Mills and the SBA and other parts of our administration, we've extended more than 16,000 new loans worth $4.5 billion to women-owned businesses&mdash;not to mention cut taxes for small businesses 17 times&mdash;so that more women have the power to create more jobs and more opportunity. <p>We're also focusing on making sure more women are prepared to fill the good jobs of today and tomorrow. Over the past decade, women have earned well over half of all the higher education degrees awarded in America. But once they get out of college, we still have a lot of ground to cover. Just 3 percent of Fortune 500 CEOs are women. Fewer than 20 percent of the seats in Congress are occupied by women. Is it possible that Congress would get more done if there were more women in Congress? [<i>Laughter</i>] Is that fair to say, Joe? I think it's fair to say. That is almost guaranteed. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And while women account for four in five degrees in areas like education&mdash;which is terrific because obviously, there's no profession that is more important than teaching&mdash;we also have to recognize that only two in five business degrees go to women; fewer than one in four engineering and computer science degrees go to women. They make up just 25 percent of the workforce in the science and technical fields. No unspoken bias or outdated barrier should ever prevent a girl from considering careers in these fields. When creativity is limited or ingenuity is discouraged, that hurts all of us. It denies America the game-changing products and world-changing discoveries we need to stay on top. <p>We've got to do more to encourage women to join these fields as well, make it easier to afford the education that's required to make it. Send a clear message to our daughters, which I'm doing every night: Math, science, nothing wrong with it, a lot right with it. We need you to focus. That's why our education reform, Race to the Top, has put a priority on science and technology and engineering and math education. It has rewarded States that took specific steps to ensure that all students&mdash;especially underrepresented groups like girls&mdash;have the opportunity to get excited about these fields at an early age. And we've helped more than 2.3 million more young women afford to pursue higher education with our increases in the Pell grants. That's good news. <p>Another example: health reform. It's been in the news lately. [<i>Laughter</i>] Because of the health reform law that we passed, women finally have more power to make their choices about their health care. Last year, more than 20 million women received expanded access to preventive services like mammograms and cervical cancer screenings at no additional cost. Nearly 2 million women enrolled in Medicare received a 50 percent discount on the medicine that they need. Over 1 million more young women are insured because they can now stay on their parent's plan. And later this year, women will receive new access to recommended preventive care like domestic violence screening and contraception at no additional cost. And soon, insurance companies will no longer be able to deny coverage based on preexisting conditions like breast cancer or charge women more just because they're women. <p>We don't know&mdash;we haven't gotten on the dry cleaning thing yet, though. I mean, I know that that's still&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that's still frustrating, I'm sure. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So when it comes to our efforts on behalf of women and girls, I'm proud of the accomplishments that we can point to. Yes, we've got a lot more to do. But there's no doubt we've made progress. The policies we've put in place over the past 3 years have started to take hold. And what we can't do now is go back to the policies that got us into so many of the problems that we've been dealing with in the first place. That's what's at stake. <p>But when people talk about repealing health care reform, they're not just saying we should stop protecting women with preexisting conditions, they're also saying we should kick about a million young women off their parents' health care plans. <p>When people say we should get rid of Planned Parenthood, they're not just talking about restricting a woman's ability to make her own health decisions, they're talking about denying, as a practical matter, the preventive care, like mammograms, that millions of women rely on. <p>When folks talk about doing away with things like student aid that disproportionately help young women, they're not thinking about the costs to our future, when millions of young Americans will have trouble affording to go to college. <p>And when something like the Violence Against Women Act&mdash;a bill Joe Biden authored, a bill that once passed by wide bipartisan margins&mdash;is suddenly called to question, that makes no sense. I don't need to&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;that's not something we should still be arguing about. <p>Now, I don't need to tell anybody here that progress is hard. Change can come slow. Opportunity and equality don't come without a fight. And sometimes you've got to keep fighting even after you've won some victories. Things don't always move forward. Sometimes they move backward if you're not fighting for them. <p>But we do know these things are possible. And all of you are proof to that. This incredible collection of accomplished women, you're proof of change. So is the fact that for the first time in history, young girls across the country can see three women sitting on the bench of the highest court in the land. Or they can read about the extraordinary leadership of a woman who went by the title Madam Speaker. Or they can turn on the news and see that one of the most formidable Presidential candidates and Senators we ever had is now doing as much as anybody to improve America's standing abroad as one of the best Secretaries of State that we've ever known. And they can see that every single day, another 500 women, just like yourselves, take the helm of their own company right here in America and do their part to grab those doors of opportunity that they walked through and open them just a little bit wider for the next generation. <p>As long as I've got the privilege of being your President, we're going to keep working every single day to make sure those doors forever stay open and widen the circle of opportunity for all our kids. Thank you for what you do. Keep it up. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"82" "\"For millions of Americans, this weekend is a time to celebrate redemption at God's hand. Tonight Jews will gather for a second Seder, where they will retell the story of the Exodus. And tomorrow my family will join Christians around the world as we thank God for the all-important gift of grace through the resurrection of His Son and experience the wonder of Easter morning. <p>These holidays have their roots in miracles that took place thousands of years ago. They connect us to our past and give us strength as we face the future. And they remind us of the common thread of humanity that connects us all. <p>For me, and for countless other Christians, Easter weekend is a time to reflect and rejoice. Yesterday many of us took a few quiet moments to try and fathom the tremendous sacrifice Jesus made for all of us. Tomorrow we will celebrate the resurrection of a Savior who died so that we might live. <p>And throughout these sacred days, we recommit ourselves to following His example. We rededicate our time on Earth to selflessness and to loving our neighbors. We remind ourselves that no matter who we are or how much we achieve, we each stand humbled before an almighty God. <p>The story of Christ's triumph over death holds special meaning for Christians. But all of us, no matter how or whether we believe, can identify with elements of His story; the triumph of hope over despair, of faith over doubt, the notion that there is something out there that is bigger than ourselves. <p>These beliefs help unite Americans of all faiths and backgrounds. They shape our values and guide our work. They put our lives in perspective. <p>So to all Christians celebrating the resurrection with us, Michelle and I want to wish you a blessed and happy Easter. And to all Americans, I hope you have a weekend filled with joy and reflection, focused on the things that matter most. <p>God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.\" "
"83" "\"<i>The President.</i> Good morning, everybody. How about Rachel Crow? Give her a big round of applause. <p>I want to wish everybody a wonderful Easter. And we are so thrilled that all of you could join us here today. My job is very simple: It is to introduce the powerhouse of the White House, the one truly in charge, as Malia, Sasha, and Bo all know, the First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Thank you, honey. My job is simple as well. I just want to officially welcome you all to the White House Easter egg roll. It is a beautiful day, perfect weather. We are so excited to have you all here. We've got a great set of activities planned for you. There's something for everyone. We're going to be over there doing a little egg roll. I think the President is going to try to beat a 3-year-old, which I hope he does not. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But we also have a wonderful yoga garden. We've got some storytime guests. We've got great readers here this year, as we do every year. You can get your face painted. We've got wonderful musical guests. Rachel was amazing, and she's a really sweet kid, which is more important. We've got wonderful athletes here. We've got Chris Evert&mdash;my gosh&mdash;and many, many others. The Harlem Globetrotters are here. You can do an obstacle course. We're going to be down at the kitchen learning how to do some healthy cooking with the&mdash;some of our celebrity chefs. <p>So it's a wonderful day, and I hope you all enjoy it. I hope you put on your comfortable shoes. We've got ours on, right, all the Obamas here. <p>So on behalf of our family, I also want to wish you all a happy Easter and a happy Easter egg roll. So in the theme of this year's Easter egg roll, let's go, let's play, let's move. <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you, everybody. Have a great time. We'll see you down there.\" "
"84" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Florida! Thank you! How is everybody doing today? Well, it is great to be back in Florida. It is great to be back in Boca. Great to be here at the home of the Fighting Owls. <p>I want to, first of all, thank Ayden not only for leading us in the Pledge of Allegiance, but also giving me great details about the burrowing owls. [<i>Laughter</i>] He explained it all to me. And then he told me he wants my job. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I explained to him that the Constitution requires you are 35 years old. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I will keep the seat warm for him for a few more years. <p>I want to thank Rebecca for that extraordinary performance. In addition to having an unbelievable singing voice, she wants to be a teacher&mdash;she is an English major&mdash;and we need great teachers out there, so we're very proud of her. <p>I want to thank your president, M.J. Saunders, the mayor of Boca Raton, Susan Whelchel, for hosting us here today. We've also got our outstanding Senator and former astronaut&mdash;which is very cool&mdash;Bill Nelson in the house. A wonderful Congressman, Ted Deutch is here. And my great friend, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz is here. And you are here, which is very exciting. I am glad you guys came out. Now&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you. <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. I do. <p>Now look, guys, I know this is a busy time of year. Some of you are less than a month away from graduation. [<i>Applause</i>] Some seniors in the house. Pretty soon, you'll be closing the books at Wimberly for the last time. Maybe you'll be making that one last trip to the beach or Coyote Jack's. We'll be&mdash;you'll be picking up that diploma that you worked so hard for. Your parents will be there; they'll be beaming, full of pride. And then comes what folks call the real world. <p>Now, I actually think college is part of the real world. But obviously, there's a transition that will take place as you leave college. And some of you may go on to postgraduate degrees, but some of you are going to be out there looking for work. College is the single-most important investment you can make in your future. So I'm proud that you've made it and you've seen it through. <p>But I also know that the future can be uncertain. Now, we've gone through the 3 toughest years in our lifetimes, economically&mdash;worst financial crisis, worst economic crisis. Our economy is now recovering, but it's not yet where it needs to be. Too many of your friends and too many of your neighbors are still hurting out there. They're still looking for work. Too many of your families are still searching for that sense of security that started slipping away long before this recession hit. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Amen. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Got the amen corner here. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So at a time like this, we've got to ask ourselves a central, fundamental question as a nation: What do we have to do to make sure that America is a place where, if you work hard, if you're responsible, that that hard work and that responsibility pays off? And the reason it's important to ask this question right now is because there are alternative theories. <p>There's a debate going on in this country right now: Could we succeed as a nation where a shrinking number of people are doing really, really well, but a growing number are struggling to get by? Or are we better off when everybody gets a fair shot and everybody does a fair share and everybody plays by the same set of rules? <p>That's what the debate in America is about right now. This is not just another run-of-the-mill gabfest in Washington. This is the defining issue of our time. This is a make-or-break moment for the middle class and everybody who's aspiring to get into the middle class. And we've got two very different visions of our future. And the choice between them could not be clearer. <p>Now keep in mind, I start from the belief that Government cannot and should not try to solve every single problem that we've got. Government is not the answer to everything. My first job in Chicago, when I wasn't much older than most of you, was working with a group of Catholic churches on the South Side of Chicago in low-income neighborhoods to try to figure out how could we improve the schools, and how could we strengthen neighborhoods and strengthen families. And I saw that the work that some of these churches did did more good for people in their communities than any Government program could. <p>In those same communities, I saw that no education policy, no matter how well-crafted it is, no matter how well funded it is, can take the place of a parent's love and attention. And I also believe that since Government is funded by you that it has an obligation to be efficient and effective. And that's why we've eliminated dozens of programs that weren't working, announced hundreds of regulatory reforms to save businesses and taxpayers billions of dollars. We've put annual domestic spending on a path to become the smallest share of our economy since Eisenhower was in the White House, which is before I was born much less you being born. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I believe the free market is the greatest force for economic progress in human history. But here's the thing. I also agree with our first Republican President, a guy from my home State, a guy with a beard, named Abraham Lincoln. And what Lincoln said was that through our Government, we should do together what we cannot do as well for ourselves. That's the definition of a smart Government. <p>And that's the reason why we have a strong military, to keep us safe, because I suppose each of us could just grab whatever is around the house and try to defend our country, but we do better when we do it together. And we've got the best military in the history of the world, with the greatest men and women in uniform. We pay for that. <p>That's why we have public schools to educate our children. If we didn't have public schools, there would still be some families who would do very well. They could afford private schools or some would home-school. But there would be a lot of kids who would fall through the cracks. So we do that together. <p>It's one of the reasons that we've laid down railroads and highways. We can't build a highway for ourselves. We got to get our neighbors and our friends to say let's go build a road. That's why we supported the research and the technology that saved lives and created entire industries. The Internet, GPS, all those things were created by us together, not by ourselves. <p>It's the reason why we contribute to programs like Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security and unemployment insurance. Because we understand that no matter how responsibly we live our lives, we know that eventually we're going to get older. We know that at any point, one of us might face hard times or bad luck or a crippling illness or a layoff. And the idea that together we build this safety net, this base of support, that allows all of us to take risks and to try new things, and maybe try&mdash;get a new job&mdash;because we know that there's this base that we can draw on. <p>So these investments&mdash;in things like education and research and health care&mdash;they haven't been made as some grand scheme to redistribute wealth from one group to another. This is not some socialist dream. They have been made by Democrats and Republicans for generations, because they benefit all of us and they lead to strong and durable economic growth. That's why we've made these investments. <p>If you're here at FAU because you got financial aid or a student loan, a scholarship, which, by the way, was how I was able to help finance my college education. That's how Michelle got her college education. That doesn't just benefit you. It benefits whatever company might end up hiring you and profiting from your skills. If one of you goes on to become the next Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg or one of you discovers the next medical breakthrough, think about all the people whose lives will be changed for the better. We made an investment in you; we'll get a return on the investment. <p>When we guarantee basic security for the elderly or the sick or those who are actively looking for work, that doesn't make us weak. What makes us weak is when fewer Americans can afford to buy the products that businesses are selling, when fewer people are willing to take risks and start their new business, because if it doesn't work out they worry about feeding their families. What drags our entire economy down is when the benefits of economic growth and productivity go only to the few, which is what's been happening for over a decade now, and gap between those at the very, very top and everybody else keeps growing wider and wider and wider and wider. <p>In this country, prosperity has never trickled down from the wealthy few. Prosperity has always come from the bottom up, from a strong and growing middle class. That's how a generation who went to college on the GI bill, including my grandfather, helped build the most prosperous economy that the world has ever known. That's why a CEO like Henry Ford made a point to pay his workers enough money so that they could buy the cars that they were building. Because he understood, look, there's no point in me having all this and then nobody can buy my cars. I've got to pay my workers enough so that they buy the cars, and that in turn creates more business and more prosperity for everybody. <p>This is not about a few people doing well. We want people to do well. That's great. But it's about giving everybody the chance to do well. That's the essence of America. That's what the American Dream is about. That's why immigrants have come to our shores, because the idea was, you know what, it doesn't matter what your name is, what you look like&mdash;you can be named Obama&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;you can still make it if you try. <p>And yet, we keep on having the same argument with folks who don't seem to understand how it is that America got built. And let me just say, the folks that we have political arguments with, they're Americans who love their country. Democrats, Republicans, Independents, everybody, we all love this country. But there is a fundamental difference in how we think we move this country forward. <p>These folks, they keep telling us that if we just weaken regulations that keep our air or our water clean or protect our consumers, if we would just convert these investments that we're making through our Government in education and research and health care, if we just turned those into tax cuts, especially for the wealthy, then somehow the economy is going to grow stronger. That's the theory. <p>And here's the news: We tried this for 8 years before I took office. We tried it. It's not like we didn't try it. [<i>Laughter</i>] At the beginning of the last decade, the wealthiest Americans got two huge tax cuts&mdash;2001, 2003. Meanwhile, insurance companies, financial institutions, they were all allowed to write their own rules or find their way around rules. We were told the same thing we're being told now: This is going to lead to faster job growth; this is going to lead to greater prosperity for everybody. <p>Guess what, it didn't. [<i>Laughter</i>] Yes, the rich got much richer. Corporations made big profits. But we also had the slowest job growth in half a century. The typical American family actually saw their incomes fall by about 6 percent even though the economy was growing, because more and more of that growth was just going to a few, and the average middle class American wasn't seeing it in their paychecks. Health care premiums skyrocketed. Financial institutions started making bets with other people's money that were reckless. And then our entire financial system almost collapsed. You remember that? It wasn't that long ago. I know you guys are young, but it was pretty recent. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, some of you may be science majors in here. I like that. We need more scientists, need more engineers. Now I was not a science major myself, but I enjoyed science when I was young. And if I recall correctly, if an experiment fails badly&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;you learn from that, right? Sometimes you can learn from failure. That's part of the data that teaches you stuff, that expands our knowledge. But you don't then just keep on doing the same thing over and over again. You go back to the drawing board. You try something different. But that's not what's been happening with these folks in Washington. <p>A lot of the folks who were peddling these same trickle-down theories&mdash;including Members of Congress and some people who are running for a certain office right now, who shall not be named&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;they're doubling down on these old broken-down theories. Instead of moderating their views even slightly, instead of saying, you know what, what we did really didn't work and we almost had a second great depression, and maybe we should try something different, they have doubled down. <p>They proposed a budget that showers the wealthiest Americans with even more tax cuts and then pays for these tax cuts by gutting investments in education and medical research and clean energy, in health care. <p>Now, these are the facts. If the cuts they're proposing are spread out evenly across the budget, then 10 million college students&mdash;including some of you&mdash;would see your financial aid cut by an average of more than $1,000 each. <p>Now, thousands of medical research grants for things like Alzheimer's and cancer and AIDS would be eliminated. Tens of thousands of researchers and students and teachers could lose their jobs. Our investments in clean energy that are making us less dependent on imported oil would be cut by nearly a fifth. <p>By the time you retire, instead of being enrolled in Medicare like today's seniors are, you'd get a voucher to pay for your health care plan. But here's the problem. If health care costs rise faster than the amount of the voucher, like they have been for decades, the rest of it comes out of your pockets. If the voucher isn't enough to buy a plan with the specific doctors and care that you need, you're out of luck. And by the middle of the next century&mdash;by the middle of this century&mdash;excuse me&mdash;by about 2050, at a time when most of you will have families of your own, funding for most of the investments I've talked about today would have been almost completely eliminated altogether. <p>Now, this is not an exaggeration. This is math. And when I said this about a week ago, the Republicans objected. They said, we didn't specify all these cuts. Well, right, you didn't because you knew that people wouldn't accept them. So you just gave a big number and so what we've done is we've just done the math. This is what it would it mean. <p>They say, well, we didn't specifically propose to cut student loans. Okay, if you don't cut student loans, then that means you've got to cut basic research even more. The money has got to come from somewhere. You can't give over $4 trillion worth of additional tax cuts, including to folks like me who don't need them and weren't asking for them, and it just comes from some magic tree somewhere. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So if you hear them saying, well, the President is making this stuff up. No, we're doing the math. If they want to dispute anything that I've said right now, they should show us specifically where they would make those cuts. They should show us. They should show us. Because, by the way, they're not proposing to cut defense, they're actually proposing to increase defense spending, so it's not coming out of there. So show me. <p>Look, America has always been a place where anybody who's willing to work and play by the rules can make it. A place where prosperity doesn't trickle down from the top, it grows from the bottom; it grows outward from the heart of a vibrant middle class. <p>And I believe that we cannot stop investing in the things that help create that middle class; that create real, long-lasting, broad-based growth in this country. And we certainly shouldn't be doing it just so the richest Americans can get another tax cut. We should be strengthening those investments. We should be making college more affordable. We should be expanding our investment in clean energy. <p>Now here's the other thing that the Republicans will tell you. They'll say, well, we've got to make all these drastic cuts because our deficit is too high. Our deficit is too high. And their argument might actually have a shred of credibility to it if you didn't find out that they wanted to spend $4.6 trillion on lower tax rates. I don't know how many of you are math majors, business majors&mdash;you can't pay down a deficit by taking in $4.6 trillion of less money, especially when you're denying that you're going to be making all these cuts. It doesn't add up. It doesn't make sense. <p>And keep in mind, more than a trillion dollars of the tax cuts they propose would be going to people who make more than $250,000 a year. That is an average of at least $150,000&mdash;again, we're just taking the numbers with the details they've given us and you spread it out&mdash;that averages to at least $150,000 for every millionaire, billionaire in the country. Each millionaire and billionaire, on average, would get $150,000. Some folks would get a lot more. <p>So we did some math of our own. We added up all the investments $150,000 could pay for. All right? So let's say a tax break that I might get that I really don't need&mdash;I've got&mdash;treated pretty well in this life. [<i>Laughter</i>] So right now, I'm going to be okay. Malia, Sasha, they're going to be able to go to college. Michelle is doing fine. So understand what this means. <p>Here's what $150,000 means&mdash;$150,000, this is what each millionaire and billionaire would get, on average. This could pay for a tax credit that would make a year of college more affordable for students like you, plus a year's worth of financial aid for students like you, plus a year's worth of prescription drug savings for one of your grandparents, plus a new computer lab for this school, plus a year of medical care for a veteran in your family who went to war and risked their lives fighting for this country, plus a medical research grant for a chronic disease, plus a year's salary for a firefighter or police officer&mdash;$150,000 could pay for all of these things combined. Think about that. <p>So let me ask you, what's the better way to make our economy stronger? Do we give another $50,000 in tax breaks to every millionaire and billionaire in the country? Or should we make investments in education and research and health care and our veterans? <p>And I just want to emphasize again&mdash;look, I want folks to get rich in this country. I think it's wonderful when people are successful. That's part of the American Dream. It is great that you make a product, you create a service, you do it better than anybody else, that's what our system is all about. But understand, the share of our national income going to the top 1 percent has climbed to levels we haven't seen since the 1920s. The folks who are benefitting from this are paying taxes at one of the lowest rates in 50 years. <p>You might have heard of this, but Warren Buffett is paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. Now, that's wrong. That's not fair. And so we've got to choose which direction we want this country to go in. Do we want to keep giving those tax breaks to folks like me who don't need them or give them to Warren Buffet&mdash;he definitely doesn't need them&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;or Bill Gates&mdash;he's already said, I don't need them. Or do we want to keep investing in those things that keep our economy growing and keep us secure? That's the choice. <p>And, Florida, I've told you where I stand. So now it's time for Members of Congress to tell you where they stand. In the next few weeks, we're going to vote on something called the Buffett rule, very simple: If you make more than $1 million a year&mdash;now, I'm not saying you have a million dollars&mdash;right? I'm not saying you saved up all your money and you made smart investments and now you've got your nest egg and you're preparing for retirement. I'm saying, you're bringing in a million bucks or more a year. Then, what the rule says is you should pay the same percentage of your income in taxes as middle class families do. You shouldn't get special tax breaks. You shouldn't be able to get special loopholes. <p>And if we do that, then it makes it affordable for us to be able to say for those people who make under $250,000 a year&mdash;like 98 percent of American families do&mdash;then your taxes don't go up. And we can still make those investments in things like student loans and college and science and infrastructure and all the things that make this country great. <p>And this is where you come in. This is why I came to see you. I mean, it's nice to see you. The weather is nice; you guys have been a wonderful audience. I learned about the burrowing owl. So there were all kinds of reasons for me to want to come down here. But one of the reasons I came was I want you to call your Members of Congress. I want you to write them an e-mail. I want you to tweet them. [<i>Laughter</i>] Tell them don't give tax breaks to folks like me who don't need them. Tell them to start investing in the things that will help the economy grow. Tell them if we want to bring down our deficit sensibly, then we've got to do it in a balanced way that's fair for everybody. Remind them who they work for. Tell them to do the right thing. <p>As I look out across this gymnasium, everybody here&mdash;from all different backgrounds, from all different parts of the country&mdash;each of us is here because somebody, somewhere, felt responsibility for other people. Our parents, obviously, our grandparents, great-grandparents, the sacrifices they made&mdash;some of them took enormous risks coming to this country with nothing because they wanted to give a better life to their kids and their grandkids. A lot of them did without so that you could benefit. But they weren't just thinking about their families. They were thinking about their communities. They were thinking about their country. <p>That's what responsibility means. It means that as you have greater and greater opportunity, then the scope of you being able to help more people and think about the future expands. And so you're not just thinking about yourself; you're thinking about your kids, your spouse, your family, your grandkids, your neighborhood, your State, your nation. You're thinking about the future. <p>And now it's our turn to be responsible. Now it's our turn to preserve the American Dream for future generations. Now it's our turn to rebuild, to make the investments that will assure our future, to make sure that we've got the most competitive workforce on Earth, to make sure that we've got clean energy that can help clean the planet and help fuel our economy. <p>It's our turn. It's our turn to rebuild our roads and our bridges and our airports and our ports. It's our turn to make sure that everybody here, every child born in whatever neighborhood in this country it is, that if they're willing to dream big dreams and put some blood, sweat and tears behind it, they can make it. <p>I know we can do that. I know we can do it because of you. You're here because you believe in your future. You're working hard. Some of you are balancing a job or a family on the side. <p>You have faith in America. You know it's not going to be easy, but you don't give up. That's the spirit we need right now, because here in America we don't give up. Here in America, we look out for one another. Here in America, we help each other get ahead. Here in America, we have a sense of common purpose. Here in America, we can meet any challenge. Here in America, we can seize any moment. We can make this century another great American century. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"85" "\"Everybody, please have a seat. Thank you. Well, it's wonderful to see you&mdash;&mdash; <p>[<i>At this point, a baby started crying.</i>] <p>&mdash;&mdash;especially you. Oh man, I know, having to listen to a speech. Yes. Aww. <p>Anyway, good morning everybody. It is wonderful to see you. Lately, we've been talking about the fundamental choice that we face as a country. We can settle for an economy where a shrinking number of people do very, very well, and everybody else is struggling to get by. Or we can build an economy where we're rewarding hard work and responsibility, an economy where everybody has a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same set of rules. <p>The people who have joined me here today are extremely successful. They've created jobs and opportunity for thousands of Americans. They're rightly proud of their success. They love the country that made their success possible, and most importantly, they want to make sure that the next generation&mdash;people coming up behind them&mdash;have the same opportunities that they had. <p>They understand, though, that for some time now, when compared to the middle class, they haven't been asked to do their fair share. And they are here because they believe there is something deeply wrong and irresponsible about that. <p>At a time when the share of national income flowing to the top 1 percent of people in this country has climbed to levels we haven't seen since the 1920s, these same folks are paying taxes at one of the lowest rates in 50 years. In fact, one in four millionaires pays a lower tax rate than millions of hard-working middle class households. And while many millionaires do pay their fair share, some take advantage of loopholes and shelters that let them get away with paying no income taxes whatsoever. And that's all perfectly legal under the system that we currently have. <p>You've heard that my friend Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary, because he's the one who's been pointing that out and saying we should fix it. The executives who are with me here today&mdash;not just behind me, but in the audience&mdash;agree with me. They agree with Warren. This should be fixed. They, in fact, have brought some of their own assistants to prove that same point: that it is just plain wrong that middle class Americans pay a higher share of their income in taxes than some millionaires and billionaires. <p>Now, it's not that these folks are excited about the idea of paying more taxes. This thing I've always made clear: I have yet to meet people who just love taxes. Nobody loves paying taxes. In a perfect world, none of us would have to pay any taxes; we'd have no deficits to pay down; and schools and bridges and roads and national defense and caring for our veterans would all happen magically. <p>We'd all have the money we need to make investments in the things that help us grow&mdash;investments, by the way, that have always been essential to the private sector's success as well. Not just&mdash;they're not just important in terms of the people that directly benefit from these programs, but historically, those investments that we've made in infrastructure, in education, in science, in technology, in transportation, that's part of what has made us an economic superpower. <p>And it would be nice if we didn't have to pay for them, but this is the real world that we live in. We have real choices and real consequences. Right now we've got significant deficits that are going to have to be closed. Right now we have significant needs if we want to continue to grow this economy and compete in this 21st-century, hypercompetitive, technologically integrated economy. That means we can't afford to keep spending more money on tax cuts for wealthy Americans who don't need them and weren't even asking for them. And it's time we did something about it. <p>Now, I want to emphasize, this is not simply an issue of redistributing wealth. That's what you'll hear from those who object to a tax plan that is fair. This is not just about fairness. This is also about growth. This is also about being able to make the investments we need to succeed. And it's about we as a country being willing to pay for those investments and closing our deficits. That's what this is about. <p>Now next week, Members of Congress are going to have a chance to vote on what we call the Buffett rule. And it's simple: If you make more money, more than $1 million a year&mdash;not if you have $1 million, but if you make more than $1 million a year&mdash;you should pay at least the same percentage of your income in taxes as middle class families do. If on the other hand, you make less than $250,000 a year, like 98 percent of American families do, your taxes shouldn't go up. <p>That's all there is to it. That's pretty sensible. Most Americans agree with me. So do most millionaires. One survey found that two-thirds of millionaires support this idea. So do nearly half of all Republicans across America. <p>So we just need some of the Republican politicians here in Washington to get on board with where the country is. I know that some prefer to run around using the same reflexive, false claims about wanting to raise people's taxes. What they won't tell you is the truth: that I've cut taxes for middle class families each year that I've been in office. I've cut taxes for small-business owners not once or twice, but 17 times. <p>As I said, for most of the folks in this room, taxes are lower than they've been, or as low as they've been, in 50 years. There are others who are saying, well, this is just a gimmick. It's&mdash;just taxing millionaires and billionaires, just imposing the Buffett rule, won't do enough to close the deficit. Well, I agree. That's not all we have to do to close the deficit. But the notion that it doesn't solve the entire problem doesn't mean that we shouldn't do it at all. <p>There are enough excuses for inaction in Washington. We certainly don't need more excuses. I'd just point out that the Buffett rule is something that will get us moving in the right direction towards fairness, towards economic growth. It will help us close our deficit, and it's a lot more specific than anything that the other side has proposed so far. And if Republicans in Congress were truly concerned with deficits and debt, then I'm assuming they wouldn't have just proposed to spend an additional $4.6 trillion on lower tax rates, including an average tax cut of at least $150,000 for every millionaire in America. <p>They want to go in the opposite direction. They want to double down on some of the inequities that already exist in the Tax Code. If we're going to keep giving somebody like me or some of the people in this room tax breaks that we don't need and we can't afford, then one of two things happens: Either you've got to borrow more money to pay down a deeper deficit, or you've got to demand deeper sacrifices from the middle class, and you've got to cut investments that help us grow as an economy. <p>You've got to tell seniors to pay a little bit more for their Medicare. You've got to tell the college student, we're going to have to charge you higher interest rates on your student loan or you're just going to get smaller student loans. You're going to have to tell that working family that's scraping by that they're going to have to do more because the wealthiest of Americans are doing less. <p>That's not right. The middle class has seen enough of its security erode over the past few decades that we shouldn't let that happen. And we're not going to stop investing in the things that create real and lasting growth in this country just so folks like me can get an additional tax cut. We're not going to stop building first-class schools and making sure that they've got science labs in them. We're not going to fail to make investments in basic science and research that could cure diseases that harm people or create the new technology that ends up creating entire jobs and industries that we haven't seen before. In America, prosperity has never just trickled down from a wealthy few. Prosperity has always been built from the bottom up and from the heart of the middle class outward. And so it's time for Congress to stand up for the middle class and make our tax system fairer by passing this Buffett rule. <p>Let me just close by saying this: I'm not the first President to call for this idea that everybody has got to do their fair share. Some years ago, one of my predecessors traveled across the country pushing for the same concept. He gave a speech where he talked about a letter he had received from a wealthy executive who paid lower tax rates than his secretary and wanted to come to Washington and tell Congress why that was wrong. So this President gave another speech where he said it was \\"crazy\\"&mdash;that's a quote&mdash;that certain tax loopholes make it possible for multimillionaires to pay nothing, while a bus driver was paying 10 percent of his salary. That wild-eyed, socialist, tax-hiking class warrior was Ronald Reagan. <p>He thought that in America the wealthiest should pay their fair share, and he said so. I know that position might disqualify him from the Republican primaries these days&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but what Ronald Reagan was calling for then is the same thing that we're calling for now: a return to basic fairness and responsibility, everybody doing their part. And if it will help convince folks in Congress to make the right choice, we could call it the Reagan rule instead of the Buffett rule. <p>But the choice is clear. This vote is coming up. I'm asking every American who agrees with me to call your Member of Congress or write them an e-mail, tweet them. Tell them to stop giving tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans who don't need them and aren't asking for them. Tell them to start asking everybody to do their fair share and play by the same rules so that every American who's willing to work hard has a chance at similar success, so that we're making the investments that help this economy grow, so that we're able to bring down our deficits in a fair and balanced and sensible way. Tell them to pass the Buffett rule. I'm going to keep on making this case across the country because I believe that this rule is consistent with those principles and those values that have helped make us this remarkable place where everybody has opportunity. <p>Each of us is only here because somebody somewhere felt responsibility not only for themselves, but also for their community and for their country. They felt a responsibility to us, to future generations. And now it's our turn to be similarly responsible. Now it's our turn to preserve that American Dream for future generations. <p>So I want to thank those of you who are here with me today. I want to thank everybody who's in the audience. And I want to appeal to the American people: Let's make sure that we keep the pressure on Congress to do the right thing. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"86" "\"Hello, Tampa! Well, it is great to be here in Tampa. Good to be in Florida. I just got a tour of this magnificent port. I was hoping to try out one the cranes&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;Secret Service wouldn't let me. They don't let me have fun. They were more concerned about your safety than mine, though&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;they didn't want me messing anything up. <p>I want to thank David for that introduction. I want to thank Mayor Buckhorn for welcoming us to Tampa. I want to thank an outstanding Member of Congress, Kathy Castor, for joining us here today. <p>Now, if you guys have chairs, feel free to sit down&mdash;some of you do. I don't want you to feel&mdash;it's warm in here, we want you to&mdash;I don't want anybody dropping off. [<i>Laughter</i>] I've been talking a lot lately about the fundamental choice that we face as a country. We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really, really well, while a growing number are struggling to get by, or we can build an economy where everybody gets a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same set of rules. <p>Now part of building that economy is making sure that we're not a country that's known just for what we buy and what we consume. After all, our middle class was built by workers who invented products and made products and sold products&mdash;the best in the world&mdash;all around the world. Our economy was thriving when shipping containers left ports like this packed with goods that were stamped with three proud words: Made in America. And those exports supported a lot of good-paying jobs in America, including right here in Florida. <p>That's the country I want us to be again. And that's why, 2 years ago, I set the goal of doubling American exports by the end of 2014. Today, with the trade agreements that I've signed into law, we're on track to meet that goal. Soon, there are going to be millions of new customers for American goods in South Korea, in Colombia, in Panama. Soon there will be new cars on the streets of Seoul that are imported from Detroit and Toledo and Chicago. <p>And that's progress. And I want to thank two key members of my Cabinet who are here today&mdash;Labor Secretary Hilda Solis is in the house and U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk&mdash;because they worked really hard to make this happen. <p>Now, one of the ways that we've helped American businesses sell their products around the world is by calling out our competitors, making sure they're playing by the same rules. For example, we've brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration. We just brought a new case last month. And we've set up a trade enforcement unit that's designed to investigate any questionable trade practices taking place anywhere in the world. See, we're going to take action whenever other countries are skirting the rules, breaking the rules, and putting our workers and our businesses at an unfair position. <p>We're also going to make sure that you've got access to more customers. Ninety-five percent of the world's consumers live outside our borders. We want them buying our products. And I'm willing to go anywhere in the world to open up new markets for American businesses. In fact, that's what I'm going to be doing right after this visit to Tampa. I'm heading to Colombia to take part in the Summit of the Americas, which brings together leaders from the Caribbean and from North, South, and Central America. <p>Everybody here knows how critical this part of the world is to our economy and to creating jobs. A lot of the countries in the region are on the rise. In Latin America alone, over the past decade, tens of millions of people have stepped out of poverty and into the middle class. So they're now in a position to start buying American products. That means they've got more money to spend. We want them spending money on American-made goods, that American businesses can put more Americans back to work. <p>Now the good news is already our exports to the Western Hemisphere are up by 46 percent since 2009. I want to repeat that because that's obviously important to Tampa. Tampa is one of the biggest ports in the country and a lot of the business being done here has to do with trade between us and Latin America. So the fact that it has gone up 46 percent since 2009 is a big deal for Tampa. In Florida, exports to this region are up nearly 30 percent. We now export more to the Western Hemisphere than to any other region in the world. And those exports support nearly 4 million U.S. jobs. <p>This is one of the most active trading relationships in the world and you see it up close here at the Port of Tampa. Every year, more than 2.5 million tons of fertilizer head out from here to farmers in the Caribbean and Central and South America. Engine oils that are produced not far from this port get shipped to countries throughout the hemisphere. Everything from recycled steel to animal feed gets sent from here to customers all across Latin America. <p>So while I'm in Colombia talking with other&mdash;leaders, I'm going to be thinking about you. I'm going to be thinking about how we can get more businesses like David's access to more markets and more customers in the region because I want us selling stuff and I want to put more Americans back to work. <p>One of the new things that we're doing is launching something called the Small Business Network of the Americas. Obviously, a lot of the exports that leave from America to other places are big business and that's great, we want our big corporations successful, selling products all around the world because we've got a lot of small businesses that are suppliers to those big business. But we also want our small and medium-sized businesses to have access to these markets. So this initiative is going to help our small businesses: Latino-owned businesses, women-owned businesses, African American-owned businesses. We want every business to be able to access these new markets, start exporting to these countries. So it'll make&mdash;this initiative will make it easier for them to get financing, it will link them up with foreign buyers who are interested in their products. <p>I've always said that the true engine of job creation in this country is the private sector, not Washington. Our job in Government is to help businesses grow and to hire, to create platforms for their success. That's one of the reasons I've cut taxes 17 times for small businesses. That's why I've fought to tear down barriers that were preventing entrepreneurs from getting funding. And that's why, yes, I've traveled around the world, opening new markets, so that American businesses can better compete in the global marketplace. <p>See, ultimately, this is what America is about. We're a nation of doers and a nation of builders. And we've never shied away from competition. We thrive on competition. If the global playing field is level, then America is going to win. So as long as I'm President, I'm going to keep on doing everything I can to give our workers and our businesses the opportunity to succeed. <p>That's how we're going to make this recovery felt by all people. It's how we're going to make sure that we build not just from the top down, but from the bottom up and from the middle out. It's how we're going to make sure that everybody has a fair shot. It's how we're going to make sure that anybody who wants a job can find one. And anybody who wants to succeed and live out that American Dream has the opportunity to do so. <p>We've gone through 3 very tough years with this global financial crisis&mdash;worst crisis we've seen in a generation. And as I travel around the country and I talk to our workers and I talk to our businesses, you can't help, but have confidence. We don't quit. We are resilient. We stay with it. We are the most inventive country in the world. We've got the best entrepreneurs in the world. We've got the best universities in the world. We've got the best research in the world. We've got the best infrastructure in the world, and we're going to keep on at it and make sure that the 21st century is the American century, just like the 20th century. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you.\" "
"87" "\"One of the fundamental challenges of our time is building an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, everybody does their fair share, and everybody plays by the same set of rules. <p>And as many Americans rush to file their taxes this weekend, it's worth pointing out that we've got a tax system that doesn't always uphold the principle of everybody doing their part. <p>Now, this is not just about fairness. This is also about growth. It's about being able to make the investments we need to strengthen our economy and create jobs. And it's about whether we as a country are willing to pay for those investments. <p>In a perfect world, of course, none of us would have to pay any taxes. We'd have no deficits to pay down. And we'd have all the resources we needed to invest in things like schools and roads and a strong military and new sources of energy, investments that have always bolstered our economy and strengthened the middle class. <p>But we live in the real world, with real choices and real consequences. Right now we've got significant deficits to close. We've got serious investments to make to keep our economy growing. And we can't afford to keep spending more money on tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans who don't need them and didn't even ask for them. <p>Warren Buffett is one of the world's wealthiest men. But he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary. That's just the way the system is set up. In fact, one in four millionaires pays a lower tax rate than millions of hard-working middle class households. <p>As Warren points out, that's not fair and it doesn't make sense. It's wrong that middle class Americans pay a higher share of their income in taxes than some millionaires and billionaires. <p>Now, this week Members of Congress are going to have a chance to set things right. They get to vote on what we call the Buffett rule. <p>It's simple: If you make more than $1 million every year, you should pay at least the same percentage of your income in taxes as middle class families do. On the other hand, if you make less than $250,000 a year, like 98 percent of American families do, your taxes shouldn't go up. <p>That's all there is to it. It's pretty sensible. Most Americans support this idea. One survey found that two-thirds of millionaires do too. So do nearly half of all Republicans. <p>We just need some Republican politicians to get on board with where the country is. I know they'll say that this is all about wanting to raise people's taxes. They probably won't tell you that if you belong to a middle class family, then I've cut your taxes each year that I've been in office, and I've cut taxes for small-business owners 17 times. <p>But the thing is, for most Americans like me, tax rates are near their lowest point in 50 years. In 2001 and 2003, the wealthiest Americans received two huge new tax cuts. We were told these tax cuts would lead to faster job growth. Instead, we got the slowest job growth in half a century, and the typical American family actually saw its income fall. <p>On the flip side, when the most well-off Americans were asked to pay a little more in the 1990s, we were warned that it would kill jobs. Instead, tens of millions of jobs followed. <p>So we've tried this trickle-down experiment before. It doesn't work. And middle class families have seen too much of their security eroded over the past few decades for us to tell them they're going to have to do more because the wealthiest Americans are going to do less. We can't stop investing in the things that will help grow our economy and create jobs&mdash;things like education, research, new sources of energy&mdash;just so folks like me can get another tax cut. <p>So I hope you'll ask your Member of Congress to step up and echo that call this week by voting for the Buffett rule. Remind them that in America, prosperity has never just trickled down from a wealthy few. Prosperity has always been built by a strong, thriving middle class. That's a principle worth reaffirming right now. <p>Thanks. God bless you, and have a great weekend.\" "
"88" "\"<i>Buenas tardes</i>! It is a great honor to be here with President Santos, the First Lady, so many distinguished guests. I am especially thankful to all the children because they are sitting very still and well-behaved, and I want to get lessons for my own children from the parents and teachers, because they're doing a great job here. <p>And I'm thrilled that&mdash;I'm thrilled we're joined by another champion of these communities, especially the education development of these beautiful children. So thank you, Shakira, for the wonderful work that you do. <p>This is a historic day, decades, even centuries in the making. For generations, many of you have lived on these lands, toiled these lands, raised your families on these lands. And now, from this day forward, you will at long last hold title to this land: La Boquilla and Basilio de Palenque. <p>And being here holds special meaning for me. Early in my Presidency, my family and I visited Ghana in West Africa. And we visited the historic Cape Coast Castle, and I'll never forget my two young daughters&mdash;the descendants of Africans and African Americans&mdash;looking out through the door of no return where so many Africans began their forced journey to this hemisphere. <p>Today we gather in a port city where so many of those Africans arrived in chains. Like their brothers and sisters in both our countries and across this hemisphere, they endured unimaginable cruelty. But in their suffering, which revealed man's capacity for evil, we also see the spirit of this day, man's capacity for good, for perseverance, for healing; the belief that we can overcome. <p>President Santos and I just took a tour of this magnificent cathedral dedicated to a man of faith who devoted his life to the least among us: San Pedro Claver&mdash;in the United States, Peter Claver. And in the United States, it was another man of faith, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, who said that the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice. And that's what's happening today. <p>Throughout my visit here in Colombia, I've spoken about the remarkable transformation that's underway in this country: more security, more prosperity, more hope. And this is a tribute to the perseverance of leaders like President Santos and you, the Colombian people. But we all understand that peace is not simply the absence of war. True and lasting peace has to be based on justice and dignity for every person. <p>And that's why today is so important. Giving you and so many Afro-Colombian communities title to this land is part of ending this nation's long conflict. It gives you a new stake in a new Colombia. Not far from here, your ancestors were bought and sold. Going forward, Colombia can realize its full potential by empowering all of its people, no matter what you look like or where you come from. <p>Both our nations have struggled to overcome a painful past. Both keep striving to fulfill our ideals of justice and equality. And I stand here today as President of the United States and you can stand here with title to the land, and that is proof that progress is possible. <p>And so when we look out to these children behind us, these beautiful children, they have a brighter future ahead of them. But that future will only be fulfilled if we're making investments in them every single day, as Shakira and the First Lady are working to do, as President Santos and I have to commit ourselves to do. But today is an important first step in creating that brighter future for them. And as you seek peace and prosperity and the dignity that all people deserve, I promise you, you will always have a strong and steady partner in the United States of America. <p><i>Muchas gracias</i>.\" "
"89" "\"Good morning, everybody. Lately, I've been speaking a lot about our need for an all-of-the-above strategy for American energy, a strategy that produces more oil and gas here at home, but also produces more biofuels and fuel-efficient cars, more solar power and wind power and other sources of clean, renewable energy. <p>This strategy is not just the right thing to do for our long-term economic growth; it's also the right way for us to reduce our dependence on foreign oil right now. It's the right way for us to put people to work right now. And ultimately, it's the right way to stop spikes in gas prices that we've put up [with; White House correction] every single year, the same kind of increases that we've seen over the past couple of months. <p>Obviously, rising gas prices means a rough ride for a lot of families. Whether you're trying to get to school, trying to get to work, do some grocery shopping, you have to be able to fill up that gas tank. And there are families in certain parts of the country that have no choice but to drive 50 or 60 miles to get to the job. So when gas prices go up, it's like an additional tax that comes right out of your pocket. <p>That's one of the reasons we passed a payroll tax cut at the beginning of this year and then made sure it extended all the way through this year so that the average American is getting that extra $40 in every paycheck right now. <p>But I think everybody understands that there are no quick fixes to this problem. There are politicians who say that if we just drilled more then gas prices would come down right away. What they don't say is that we have been drilling more. Under my administration, America is producing more oil than at any time in the last 8 years. We've opened up new areas for exploration. We've quadrupled the number of operating rigs to a record high. We've added enough new oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some. <p>But, as I've said repeatedly, the problem is we use more than 20 percent of the world's oil and we only have 2 percent of the world's proven oil reserves. Even if we drilled every square inch of this country right now, we'd still have to rely disproportionately on other countries for their oil. That means we pay more at the pump every time there's instability in the Middle East or growing demand in countries like China and India. <p>That's what's happening right now. It's those global trends that are affecting gas prices. So even as we're tackling issues of supply and demand, even as we're looking at the long term in terms of how we can structurally make ourselves less reliant on foreign oil, we still need to work extra hard to protect consumers from factors that should not affect the price of a barrel of oil. <p>That includes doing everything we can to ensure that an irresponsible few aren't able to hurt consumers by illegally manipulating or rigging the energy markets for their own gain. We can't afford a situation where speculators artificially manipulate markets by buying up oil, creating the perception of a shortage and driving prices higher, only to flip the oil for a quick profit. We can't afford a situation where some speculators can reap millions, while millions of American families get the short end of the stick. That's not the way the market should work. And for anyone who thinks this cannot happen, just think back to how Enron traders manipulated the price of electricity to reap huge profits at everybody else's expense. <p>Now, the good news is, my administration has already taken several actions to step up oversight of oil markets and close dangerous loopholes that were allowing some traders to operate in the shadows. <p>We closed the so-called Enron loophole that let traders evade oversight by using electronic or overseas trading platforms. In the Wall Street reform law, we said, for the first time, that Federal regulators will make sure no single trader can buy such a large position in oil that they could easily manipulate the market on their own. So I'd point out that anybody who's pledging to roll back Wall Street reform&mdash;Dodd-Frank&mdash;would also roll back this vital consumer protection along with it. <p>I've asked Attorney General Holder to work with Chairman Leibowitz of the Federal Trade Commission, Chairman Gensler of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and other enforcement agencies to make sure that acts of manipulation, fraud, or other illegal activity are not behind increases in the price that consumers pay at the pump. <p>So today we're announcing new steps to strengthen oversight of energy markets. Things that we can do administratively, we are doing. And I call on Congress to pass a package of measures to crack down on illegal activity and hold accountable those who manipulate the market for private gain at the expense of millions of working families. And be specific. <p>First, Congress should provide immediate funding to put more cops on the beat to monitor activity in energy markets. This funding would also upgrade technology so that our surveillance and enforcement officers aren't hamstrung by older and less sophisticated tools than the ones that traders are using. We should strengthen protections for American consumers, not gut them. And these markets have expanded significantly. <p>Chairman Gensler actually had a good analogy; he said, imagine if the NFL quadrupled the number of teams, but didn't increase the number of refs; you'd end up having havoc on the field and it would diminish the game. It wouldn't be fair. That's part of what's going on in a lot of these markets. So we have to properly resource enforcement. <p>Second, Congress should increase the civil and criminal penalties for illegal energy market manipulation and other illegal activities. So my plan would toughen key financial penalties tenfold and impose these penalties not just per violation, but for every day a violation occurs. <p>Third, Congress should give the agency responsible for overseeing oil markets new authority to protect against volatility and excess speculation, by making sure that traders can post appropriate margins, which simply means that they actually have the money to make good on their trades. <p>Congress should do all of this right away. A few weeks ago, Congress had a chance to stand up for families already paying an extra premium at the pump; congressional Republicans voted to keep spending billions of Americans' hard-earned tax dollars on more unnecessary subsidies for big oil companies. So here's a chance to make amends, a chance to actually do something that will protect consumers by increasing oversight of energy markets. That should be something that everybody, no matter their party, should agree with. And I hope Americans will ask their Members of Congress to step up. <p>In the meantime, my administration will take new executive actions to better analyze and investigate trading activities in energy markets and more quickly implement the tough consumer protections under Wall Street reform. <p>Let me close by saying none of these steps by themselves will bring gas prices down overnight. But it will prevent market manipulation and make sure we're looking out for American consumers. And in the meantime we're going to keep pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy for American energy to break the cycle of price spikes year after year. We are going to keep producing more biofuels, we're going to keep producing more fuel-efficient cars, we are going to keep tapping into every source of American-made energy. <p>And these steps have already helped put America on a path to greater energy independence. Our foreign&mdash;our dependence on foreign oil has actually decreased each year I've been in office, even as the economy has grown. America now imports less than half of the oil we use for the first time in more than a decade. So we are less vulnerable than we were, but we're still too vulnerable. <p>We've got to continue the hard, sustained work on this issue. And as long as I'm President, we're going to keep placing our bets on America's future: America's workers, America's technology, America's ingenuity, and American-made energy. That's how we're going to solve this problem once and for all. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"90" "\"Thank you so much, everybody. Please, please have a seat. Welcome to the White House, and congratulations to Tony Stewart on his third Sprint Cup Championship. [<i>Applause</i>] You can give him a round of applause for that. It is great to have NASCAR back in Washington. <p>I want to thank Brian France and Mike Helton for their leadership. We've got some Members of Congress who are big racing fans who are here. We've got some of my staff who are big racing fans who are here. I also want to welcome the rest of the drivers who are with us, the best of the best right here. Thank you all for coming. We really appreciate it. <p>Now, full disclosure: I invited Tony here today because of what he did on the track. But I was also hoping he would give me some tips on the media, because he's got that quiet, reserved personality&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and I was figuring I'd stay out of trouble if Tony gave me some advice on that. <p>It's good to see Number 14 on the South Lawn. Every year I try to take a lap; nobody lets me do it. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I am still holding out hope that, at some point, I'm going to be able to get behind the wheel. <p>A few years ago, Jimmie Johnson showed up and showed me how to start one of these cars up, explained how everything worked. It was impressive. But what was even more impressive is he got in and got out dressed like he is now, and he did not rip his suit&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;which took some skill. <p>And I do want to acknowledge Jimmie because, even though his 5-year streak is over, I think we can all acknowledge he is one of the all-time greats. And I know he is itching to take the title back. So congratulations, Jimmie, on everything that you've done. <p>But this was Tony's year. And \\"Smoke\\" gave us one of the most dramatic finishes that we have ever seen. After barely making The Chase, Tony took off, winning an amazing four races in the postseason. And then came the final race in Miami&mdash;a must-win. Tony went all out. Twice he came from back of the pack, passing 118 cars, sometimes 3 wide. Tony said it felt like he passed half the State of Florida. But in the end, he hung on to take the checkered flag and win the championship with a tie-breaker. <p>And Tony himself acknowledged he didn't see it coming; nobody saw it coming. We've all heard about athletes who say they're going to do what it takes to win it all. But back in August, with the season winding down, Tony predicted he wouldn't be able to pull it off. In fact, he said that if he did end up winning the championship&mdash;this is a quote&mdash;\\"I'll declare I'm a total bumbling idiot.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Here's your chance, Tony. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But I think Tony's hero, the great A.J. Foyt, put it best when he said the reason Tony won was because he drove the best race of his life&mdash;period. And he did it with the rest of these drivers on his tail. <p>I want to make special mention out of this outstanding group of Carl Edwards; he's also a member of my fitness council. Carl battled Tony down to the wire and came about as close as you can get without actually winning. And congratulations on all your unbelievable success as well. And I think everybody who saw Carl after the race, it was a great lesson in how you handle disappointment with grace and with class, and he's a outstanding representative for all of NASCAR. <p>And that's typical. Underneath the helmets, behind all the trash talking&mdash;and I notice it seems to be picking up quite a bit lately&mdash;these are some outstanding men. And it's true about the whole NASCAR organization. One thing especially I want to thank NASCAR for is the support that you guys have provided to our men and women in uniform. You give active duty soldiers, wounded warriors, veterans all a VIP experience at races. And Michelle had a chance to see that firsthand at the Homestead race last year. You look out for military families. You look out for Gold Star families. You make regular visits to Walter Reed to raise spirits there. And for you guys to give that much back to folks who have given so much to us as a country and help protect us and keep us safe is remarkable. So I want to thank all of you for what you do on behalf of our troops. <p>So congratulations again to Tony and his entire team. Thanks to everybody at NASCAR for what you do for our country. Thank you for not tearing up my grass&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and best of luck in the season to come. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. Give them a big round of applause.\" "
"91" "\"Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat. Well, hello, Ohio! It is good to be back here at Lorain. Last time I was here, I had an outstanding burger at Smitty's. [<i>Laughter</i>] I got my own Presidential football helmet at Riddell. I got a feeling I may need it between now and November. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>It's also great to be back at Lorain Community College. I want to thank Bronson for that wonderful introduction. He is&mdash;I had a chance to meet Bronson and Andrea and Dave and Duane. And I just want Bronson's wife to know that he gives her all the credit in the world. So just in case you're watching&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;Gladys, he loves you to death. <p>I also want to thank your president, Dr. Roy Church, your mayor, Holly Brinda, for hosting us here today. I want to recognize my outstanding Secretary of Labor, Hilda Solis, in the house. And I want to thank all of you for coming. <p>I came here for a simple reason. In an economy that's still recovering from the worst financial crisis and the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes, the work that's going on here could not be more important. I meet business owners all the time who want to hire in the United States, but they can't always find the workers with the right skills. You've got growing industries in science and technology that have twice as many openings as we have workers who can do the job. That makes no sense: openings at a time when there's still a lot of Americans, including some on this stage, who are looking for work. So we've got to do a better job training more people for the skills that businesses are looking for. <p>When I met with manufacturers a while back, they said it's starting to make economic sense to bring jobs back to Ohio, to bring jobs back to Michigan, to bring jobs back to Illinois and Iowa and Indiana, because even if the labor costs are lower there, the workers are better here. And when you factor in transportation costs, a lot of times it makes sense to insource now, but that's only going to be true if we can make sure that we've got workers who have higher skills and can manage fancier machinery than folks in other places. And all that starts with community colleges like this one. <p>So I just had a chance to listen to four of your classmates and hear a little bit about how they got here, where they're headed. I talked to Duane, who was laid off at a packaging company, is now learning how to operate high-tech machinery. Andrea lost her job as an HR analyst, but she's now getting certified in the fast-growing field of electronic medical records. David, who in addition to being a truck driver for 23 years was also a marine, so we know he can do the job, he's here to retrain for a higher paying job. And you just heard from Bronson, who was laid off 2 years ago, and you heard what he said. He was in a dead end in his life, and this program, along with his wife&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;gave him an opportunity. So he's going to be learning hands-on machining over the next few weeks, after having already done some of the bookwork. <p>Now, I have to tell you, when I meet these folks, these folks inspire me, because a lot of them have gone through tough times. Andrea is still dealing with the aftermath of the flood that damaged her home. All of them have supportive family members. And it's hard being out of work. It's hard especially when you're midcareer, when you're having to change jobs. And the resilience they show and the determination they show, that's what America's about. That's our defining spirit. We don't quit. <p>And so the question now is, how do we make sure that all of America is expressing that spirit through making sure that everybody is getting a fair shot? Because that's going to be a major debate that we have in this country not just for the next few months, but for the next few years. Should we settle for an economy where a few people do really well and then a growing number are struggling to get by? Or do we build an economy where people like Duane and Andrea and David and Bronson, they've got a chance to get ahead, where there are ladders of opportunity, where everybody gets a fair shot and everybody does their fair share and everybody is playing by the same set of rules? <p>And this is not just another run-of-the-mill political debate. There's always chatter in Washington. Folks argue about whether the sun rises in the east and whether it sets in the west&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;whether the sky is blue. There's always going to be arguments in Washington. But this one is different, because we're talking about the central challenge of our time. Right now we have two competing visions of our future, and the choice could not be clearer. And let me say, those folks on the other side, I am sure they are patriots, I'm sure they're sincere in terms of what they say. But their theory, I believe, is wrong. <p>See, I've never believed that government can or should try to solve every problem we've got. I believe that the free market is the greatest force for economic progress in human history. I agree that everybody has personal responsibility for their own lives. Everybody has got to work hard. Nothing is ever handed to us. But I also agree with our first Republican President&mdash;a guy named Abraham Lincoln&mdash;who said that, through government, we should do together what we cannot do as well on our own. <p>There's some things we don't do well on our own. That's why we've got a strong military to keep us safe. That's why we have fire departments, because we never know when we might have a fire in our house. That's why we've got public schools to educate our children. That's how we laid down railroads and highways and supported research and technology that's saved lives and helped create entire industries. That's why we have programs like Medicare and Social Security and unemployment insurance, because any one of us&mdash;I don't care how lucky you are, how rich you are, how blessed you are&mdash;you never know, you could face a layoff or a crippling illness or a run of bad luck or a tragedy. <p>Folks in Ohio know about that. Nothing is given. And that's why we're helping more community colleges like this one to become community career centers, so folks who are looking for a new job or a better paying job can learn the skills that businesses need right now. And that's good for all of us. <p>These&mdash;investing in a community college, just like investing in a new road or a new highway or broadband lines that go into rural communities, these investments are not part of some grand scheme to redistribute wealth. They've been made by Democrats and Republicans for generations because they benefit all of us. That's what leads to strong, durable economic growth. That's how America became an economic superpower. That's how we built the transcontinental railroad. That's why we've got the best universities and colleges in the world. That's why we have cutting-edge research that takes place here, and that then gets translated into new jobs and new businesses, because somebody did the groundwork. We created a foundation for those of us to prosper. <p>Somebody gave me an education. I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth. Michelle wasn't. But somebody gave us a chance, just like these folks up here are looking for a chance. <p>When you take classes at a community college like this one and you learn the skills that you need to get a job right away, that does not just benefit you, it benefits the company that ends up hiring and profiting from your skills. It makes the entire region stronger economically. It makes this country stronger economically. <p>In this country, prosperity does not trickle down, prosperity grows from the bottom up. And it grows from a strong middle class out. That's how we grow this economy. And that's why I'm always confused when we keep having the same argument with folks who don't seem to remember how America was built. They keep telling us, well, if we just weaken regulations that keep our air and water clean and protect our consumers, if we just cut everybody's taxes and convert these investments in community colleges and research and health care into tax cuts, especially for the wealthy, that somehow the economy is going to get stronger and Ohio and the rest of the country will prosper. That's the theory. <p>Ohio, we tested this theory. Take a look at what happened in Ohio between 2000 and 2008. It's not like we didn't try it. And instead of faster job growth, we had the slowest job growth in half a century. Instead of broad-based prosperity, the typical American family saw their incomes fall by about 6 percent. Outsourcing, rampant, phony financial profits all over the place, and instead of strengthening our economy, our entire financial system almost collapsed. We spent the last 3&frac12; years cleaning up after that mess. So their theory did not work out so well. Maybe they haven't been paying attention, but it didn't work out so well. <p>And instead of kind of stepping back and saying to themselves, well, maybe this didn't work so maybe we should try something different, they decided to double down. Instead of moderating their views even slightly, you now have Republicans in Washington and the ones running for President proposing budgets that shower the wealthiest Americans with even more tax cuts. Folks like me don't need them, weren't looking for them. And when you give somebody like me a tax cut, there are only two ways of paying for it: either it adds to our deficit, meaning it's not paid for, or you end up&mdash;which is what they've proposed&mdash;gutting investments in education and medical research and clean energy and job training programs like this one. <p>If these cuts are spread out evenly, then 10 million college students, including some of you, would see your financial aid cut by an average of more than a thousand dollars each. Thousands of medical research grants for things like Alzheimer's and cancer and AIDS would be eliminated. Our investment in clean energy that are helping to break our dependence on foreign oil and are creating jobs here in Ohio would be cut by nearly a fifth. By the time you retire, Medicare would've been turned into a voucher system that likely would not cover the doctors or the care that you need; that would have to come out of your pocket. Job training programs like this one would be forced to cut back. Thousands of Americans would lose out on critical employment and training services. That's the truth. <p>When you ask the Republicans, well, what do you say about that, they say, well, no, no, Obama is making this up, because we didn't specify which cuts we'd make. Well, the reason they didn't specify it is because they know folks wouldn't like it. [<i>Laughter</i>] But if you've got to cut a certain amount of money&mdash;and they've already said they're not going to cut defense spending, and they're going with their tax cuts&mdash;then you've got to go to all the other stuff that's left over, or else you're going to add to the deficit. That's just math. That's not theorizing on my part. <p>They'll tell you, well, we've got to do this because the deficit is so bad. The deficit is bad. We've got to deal with the deficit in a serious way, and that means all of us are going to have to make tough choices. But it's one thing to deal with the deficit in a way that is fair and asks everybody to do their fair share and dealing with the deficit as an excuse to do what you wanted to do anyway. <p>Their argument might fly if it weren't for the fact that they're also proposing to spend $4.6 trillion on lower tax rates on top of the 1 trillion they would spend on tax cuts for people making more than $250,000 a year or more. That's their priority. They want to give me more of a tax break. Now, I just paid taxes, so I'm&mdash;it's not like I love paying taxes. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I can afford it. I don't need another tax break. <p>Right now companies can't find enough qualified workers for the jobs they need to fill. So programs like this one are training hundreds of thousands of workers with the skills that companies are looking for. And it's working. And it's going to help America grow. I've seen it. Here in Lorain County, 90 percent of people who graduate from this program have a job 3 months later&mdash;90 percent. That's a big deal. Why would we want to cut this program to give folks like me a tax cut that we don't need and that the country can't afford? <p>What's the better way to make our economy stronger: give more tax breaks to every millionaire and billionaire in the country or make investments in education and research and health care and job training, make investments in Bronson and Duane and Andrea and David and put folks back to work? This is just common sense. <p>Understand this is not a redistribution argument. This is not about taking from rich people to give to poor people. This is about us together making investments in our country so everybody has got a fair shot. And that will make all of us better off. <p>Now, on Monday, nearly every Republican in the Senate voted to block what's called the Buffett rule. Think about this. The Buffet rule says if you make a million dollars or more&mdash;I'm not saying you got a million dollars&mdash;let's say you're a small-business person, you saved, you worked, and after 10, 20, 30 years of working you finally saved up your little nest egg&mdash;that's not what I'm talking about. I'm saying you make a million dollars a year. And we said you should at least pay the same percentage in income tax as middle class families do, as a teacher or a bus driver. And by doing that, that helps us afford being to say to the 98 percent of families who make $250,000 a year or less, your taxes won't go up. <p>This was an idea that was supported by a strong majority of the American people, including nearly half of Republicans. The majority of millionaires supported it. And Senate Republicans didn't listen. They refused to even let it come up for a vote, refused to ask the wealthiest among us to do their fair share. Meanwhile, Republicans in the House just signaled their willingness to gut programs like this one that make a real difference in people's lives: thousands of middle class families or folks who are trying to get into the middle class. <p>And my point is the middle class has sacrificed enough over the last few decades. They're having enough trouble. And as I travel around the country, people aren't just concerned about their immediate circumstances. They're also concerned about our future. They're thinking how do we make sure that America stays ahead? How do we make sure that if somebody is willing to work hard, they can get ahead in this country? <p>And people understand Government is not all the answer, and if they see taxpayer money wasted, that makes them angry. They know the Government has got to be lean and mean and do smart things. But they also understand we can't stop investing in the things that are going to create real, lasting growth in this country. And we certainly can't do it just as an excuse to give me another tax cut. That's not who we are as a country. We're better than that. <p>Everybody here, we're here because somebody, somewhere, felt a sense of larger responsibility, not just to themselves, to their family, first of all, but then also to their community, also to their country. Maybe they served like Dave. Maybe they worked in a local charity. They understood&mdash;like my grandparents understood, like my mother understood, like Michelle's parents understood&mdash;that we do what we do not just for ourselves, but also for this larger project we call America. And now it's our turn to be responsible. Now it's our turn to make sure the next generation has the same opportunities that we do. <p>And I know we can do it. And the reason I know is because of the folks I had a chance to meet. It's because of you. You're working hard. You've haven't given up. You've gone through some struggles, but you're resilient. Ohio is a great example of the core strength and decency of the American people. You believe in our future. You believe in this country. <p>And if we work together in common purpose, I guarantee you we will make this an American century just like the 20th century was the American century. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"92" "\"<i>The President.</i> Well, good afternoon, everybody. Have a seat. Have a seat. It is my pleasure to welcome the Alabama Crimson Tide back to the White House. And congratulate them on winning their 14th national championship, their second in 3 years. Roll Tide. <p>I told Coach he's making this a habit. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm also happy to see the best team in DC high school football in the house. Congratulations to the other Crimson Tide&mdash;Dunbar High School&mdash;on their city championship. Might have some recruits out here, Coach. <p>Now, we've got a lot of proud 'Bama fans here today. It is good to see Mayor Maddox of Tuscaloosa again. Mayor Bell of Birmingham is here, as well as Members of Congress, including several Alabama alums. I also want to recognize Alabama Director of Athletics Mal Moore and interim university president Dr. Judy Bonner for their support of the best team in college football. <p>Now obviously, this is a team that knows something about adversity. It was 1 year ago next week that an F4 tornado carved a path right through the town of Tuscaloosa. I traveled down there 2 days later to see the devastation with the mayor and the Governor. And I've got to tell you, I'd never seen anything like it. <p>And I remember something the mayor said that day. He said that when something like that happens, folks tend to forget all their petty differences. Things like politics, religion, race, when we're confronted with a tragedy of such magnitude, all that just fades away. We're reminded that all we have is each other. And if you need proof of that, just look how the Auburn community stepped up during that time of need. <p>The storm took the lives of 248 people, including 6 students. And it touched this team personally. Long snapper Carson Tinker's girlfriend lost her life in the storm. And a few weeks later, there was fresh grief for Aaron Douglas, an offensive lineman who passed away. So this became a team in every sense of the word. They remembered Aaron and those lost in the storm not just with their hearts, but on their helmets, with a houndstooth ribbon and the number 77. <p>And then they took to the field, they steamrolled opponent after opponent, they racked up an 8-0 record going into the rivalry game against LSU. Folks called it the \\"game of the century.\\" The top two teams in the country&mdash;number 1 versus number 2; primetime national television. And it delivered. It was a defensive slugfest that wouldn't be settled until overtime. In the end, one team had to lose. And 'Bama gave up its only loss of the season. <p>Fortunately, they got a rematch. In the national championship game, the Tide not only beat the Tigers; they shut them out&mdash;the first in BCS championship game history. LSU earned just five first downs, crossed the midfield line only once, and were held to less than 100 yards. <p>And it wasn't just the defense that played lights out. Kicker Jeremy Shelley nailed a bowl-record five field goals. Heisman Trophy finalist Trent Richardson rushed for the only touchdown of the game in his usual fashion, like a boulder rolling downhill. Offensive lineman Barrett Jones summed it up pretty well when he said, \\"We felt like we were capable of dominating, and we did that.\\" <p>So this team didn't just shatter records. I hear the championship trophy also took a bit of a spill&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;earlier this week. <p>So this was a fun season to watch, but it was also a deeply meaningful season for the Tide. And what's even more impressive is that these young men showed that success isn't about the individual, it's about the ability to work as a team. That's why senior linebacker Courtney Upshaw handed his defensive MVP award to his teammates, saying the whole defense deserved it. <p>That's why Coach became the first to win three BCS national championships, but he gave credit to his players' hard work and persistence. They played as a team because of what they had endured as a team. And so each victory was about more than getting to the title game; it was about the lives of these players and coaches that they'd carried with them and what they meant to each other. <p>Each of them found different ways to honor these memories. Coach Saban started a program called \\"13 for 30\\" that aims to rebuild 13 houses for families who lost theirs in the tornado. Strength coach Scott Cochran pitched in with players almost every Saturday helping families recover and rebuild. Courtney Upshaw raised $20,000 in relief funds for the impacted families. And Barrett Jones lugged a chainsaw around Tuscaloosa to remove tornado debris from homes and yards. So the Tide showed us what it takes to win as a team, but they also showed what it means to be a part of a larger community: to look out for one another, to help. And that makes them pretty special. <p>So I just want to say to all these outstanding men and all the staff, Coach and the entire Crimson Tide community, congratulations on an extraordinary season and best of luck next season. Who knows, I may see you again. <p>Thank you. <p>[<i>At this point, University of Alabama Football Head Coach Nick L.Saban made brief remarks and presented the President with a game jersey.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Now, that's a nice-looking jersey right there. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Mr. Saban.</i> From the 2011 national champs. We would also like to give you a helmet over here. We certainly don't want to be responsible for any head injuries that the President might have. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> I was mentioning yesterday, I'm probably going to need a helmet between now and November. What do you think, Shelby? [<i>Laughter</i>] Huh? All right. <p><i>Mr. Saban.</i> Well, good. Well, we really&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you so much. <p><i>Mr. Saban.</i> We really appreciate the opportunity, and thank you so much for your time to honor our team. Thank you very much. <p><i>The President.</i> Coach, I appreciate you.\" "
"93" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you so much. Well, good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to the White House. Thank you, Ric, for that introduction. More importantly, thank you for your service and for everything you do for our veterans and our wounded warriors. <p>And we've also got here today Senator Tom Udall and Congresswoman Corrine Brown with us. Thank you all for coming. <p>This is the fourth time we've had the Soldier Ride here in the South Lawn. And this year, you've already covered some ground: 34 miles over the last few days and another 24-mile ride tomorrow. So our job is to give you a break, maybe even a little extra fuel, and get you back on the road. <p>The reason I ask this group to stop by every year is because this is one of the most inspiring events that we have here at the White House. As Commander in Chief, I can't take sides, but I know the Army is represented here. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> Navy's represented here. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Navy! <p><i>The President.</i> [<i>Laughter</i>] We've got some Air Force. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> We've got some Marines in the house. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> And we've got some Coast Guard. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Hooah! [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> And there's some folks here who don't wear a uniform, but who work just as hard and sacrifice just as much alongside you, and that's our outstanding military families in the house. <p>So this is a pretty diverse group, and I know you're all doing this ride for different reasons. Some of you may be athletes looking to get the competitive juices flowing again. Maybe some of you are trying to see how far you can push yourselves. Some of you are doing it for the camaraderie and the bond that comes when you work hard alongside people who know what you're going through. Maybe you're doing it to honor a loved one or a buddy. But all of you are here because you believe in living your lives to the fullest. You know that each of us has a responsibility to seize the opportunities we've been blessed with. You ride because you can, and you ride for those who can't. That's what this is all about. <p>And that's what inspired Chris Carney to hop on a bike and head across country on the first Soldier Ride 8 years ago to raise money and awareness for returning troops and wounded warriors. Chris came up with the idea working as a bartender in Long Island. And I have to say, it's better than most of the ideas that come out of bars. [<i>Laughter</i>] At least that's been my experience. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Today there are Soldier Rides all across the country. They serve as a reminder that all of us can do our part to serve the men and women who serve us. And I'm glad to see you're all decked out in the stars and stripes, because I want anybody who sees this ride to go by to know that they're in the presence of heroes. <p>Some of these guys I've had a chance to meet before. I first met Hospital Corpsman 3d Class Max Rohn when he was in the hospital recovering from a grenade attack in Fallujah that cost him his leg. And Max, I think, will admit he was in pretty rough shape at the time. But the next time I saw him, at a dinner that we hosted here recently for Iraq war veterans, Max had gained 80 pounds&mdash;or 40 pounds and was training for the upcoming Wounded Warrior Games. I offered him two dinners after he finished the first one kind of quick, and he readily accepted. [<i>Laughter</i>] After he finished the first dessert kind of quick, I offered him another one. He accepted that one too. I am positive it is the most anybody has ever eaten in the White House. [<i>Laughter</i>] And now he's ready to ride. <p>We've also got Captain Leslie Smith here today. Leslie lost her leg and her eyesight after serving in Bosnia, and this is her first time back on a bike. She's going to be riding in tandem alongside Meghan Speicher-Harris, who works with the Wounded Warrior Project. And it's good to have them both here. <p>And then there are the Schei brothers: Erik and Deven. When Erik enlisted in the Army, Deven made a promise that if anything bad ever happened, he would finish what his brother started. And during his second tour in Iraq, Erik was shot in the head by a sniper. So Deven enlisted. And then 2 years ago, Deven was injured in Afghanistan. And now the two brothers ride a specially made tandem bike, with Deven leading the way. They're taking on this latest challenge just like they did every other one, together. <p>So these men and women, they're an inspiration. And it's also inspiring to meet the families behind them: the moms and dads and the brothers and sisters, the sons and daughters who are standing by their side through good times and bad. You're heroes too. And I know Michelle and I look forward to any time we get to spend with military families. <p>So I want to encourage everybody who sees these riders going by this weekend to go out and cheer and say thanks and salute and show your support. And as Commander in Chief, I promise to do everything I can to make sure that you guys get the care and the benefits that you deserve, that you've earned. All of you have served your country. That's why now it's time for the country to serve you. It's what you deserve, and here in America we take care of our own. <p>So to all the riders here today, we are proud of you. Your country is proud of you. And now I'm going to see how you guys do taking some laps around the South Lawn. But you got to do it on the horn. I don't want anybody cheating. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>All right. On your marks, get set&mdash;&mdash; <p>[<i>At this point, the President sounded a horn.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Hey!\" "
"94" "\"Hi. This week, I got the chance to sit down with some impressive students at Lorain County Community College in Ohio. One of them was a woman named Andrea Ashley. Two years ago, Andrea lost her job as an HR analyst. Today, she's getting certified in the fast-growing field of electronic medical records. Before enrolling at Lorain, Andrea told me she was looking everywhere trying to find a new job. But without a degree, she said that nobody would hire her. <p>Andrea's story isn't unique. I've met so many Americans who are out there pounding the pavement looking for work only to discover that they need new skills. And I've met a lot of employers who are looking for workers, but can't find ones with the skills they're looking for. <p>So we should be doing everything we can to put higher education within reach for every American, because at a time when the unemployment rate for Americans with at least a college degree is about half the national average, it's never been more important. But here's the thing: it's also never been more expensive. Students who take out loans to pay for college graduate owing an average of $25,000. For the first time, Americans owe more debt on their student loans than they do on their credit cards. And for many working families, the idea of owing that much money means that higher education is simply out of reach for their children. <p>Now, in America, higher education cannot be a luxury. It's an economic imperative that every family must be able to afford. That's why next week I'll be visiting colleges across the country, talking to students about how we can make higher education more affordable and what's at stake right now if Congress doesn't do something about it. You see, if Congress doesn't act, on July 1st interest rates on some student loans will double. Nearly 7&frac12; million students will end up owing more on their loan payments. That would be a tremendous blow. And it's completely preventable. <p>This issue didn't come out of nowhere. For some time now, I've been calling on Congress to take steps to make higher education more affordable: to prevent these interest rates from doubling, to extend the tuition tax credit that has saved middle class families millions of dollars, and to double the number of work-study jobs over the next 5 years. <p>Instead, over the past few years, Republicans in Congress have voted against new ways to make college more affordable for middle class families, and voted for huge new tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires, tax cuts that would have to be paid for by cutting things like education and job-training programs that give students new opportunities to work and succeed. <p>We cannot just cut our way to prosperity. Making it harder for our young people to afford higher education and earn their degrees is nothing more than cutting our own future off at the knees. Congress needs to keep interest rates on student loans from doubling, and they need to do it now. <p>This is a question of values. We cannot let America become a country where a shrinking number of people do really well, while a growing number of people struggle to get by. We've got to build an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. That's how the middle class gets stronger. That's an economy that's built to last. And I'm not only going to take that case to college campuses next week; I'm going to take it to every part of the country this year. Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"95" "\"Well, good afternoon. Now, I heard last year, with this trophy on the line, Jon Davis said, \\"You don't get to meet the President every day.\\" Today, you do. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Congratulations to the Fighting Falcons on winning their second straight and record 18th Commander in Chief Trophy last season.[<i>Applause</i>] There we go. I'm happy to meet you too. [<i>Laughter</i>] And welcome, everybody, to the White House. <p>Now, this trophy, which by the way is the biggest trophy&mdash;I give a lot of these out&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;this is the monster of all trophies here. This trophy has logged a lot of miles just jetting back and forth between Cadet Field House and the White House the past couple of years. And I'm looking forward to seeing it again when I visit Colorado Springs next month. <p>We are honored to be joined today by the Superintendent of the Air Force Academy, Lieutenant General Michael Gould, as well as Representative Mike McIntyre is in the house. To all the friends of Air Force football, congratulations on holding onto the title of gridiron supremacy in the Armed Forces. <p>Now, it was no easy feat for this team to make it here today. These guys faced a brutal schedule, but they never backed down. As Coach Calhoun said, \\"This group had a warrior spirit in them.\\" And they brought that fight to every game this season. They shut out New Mexico on the road. They brought home the Ram-Falcon Trophy with a decisive victory over Colorado State, a game that won them a bowl bid for a record-setting fifth straight year. They battled down to the wire against Toledo in an exciting Military Bowl, boldly going for the win with a 2-point conversion and falling just short. But I like that in you. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Even when they were dogged by injuries, this team pulled together when it mattered most. These guys toughed it out&mdash;toughed out a narrow overtime victory against Navy, with Alex Means blocking an extra point in overtime and Tim Jefferson barreling the last yard into the end zone with the game on the line. They stormed from behind to beat Army and secure this trophy with a third quarter that included two field goals, two touchdowns, a 2-point conversion, and two takeaways. <p>So this team had to fight hard this whole season. But the work paid off. The senior class standing behind me distinguished itself as one of the most talented in school history. Brady Amack and Jon Davis put together the sixth-ranking passing defense in the country. Asher Clark led the Nation's third-best rushing attack. Tim Jefferson will graduate as the winningest Air Force quarterback of all time and the first quarterback in service academy history to lead his team to four consecutive bowl games. <p>So these young men have a lot to be proud of. And if the past couple of seasons are any indication of what is to come, Coach Calhoun, we expect the Air Force will be back here this time next year. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, I know Army and Navy will have something to say about that. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I know that the next year will take these young men from the Cadet Field House to pilot training, to air bases around the world, in defense of our country. Ultimately, these seniors understand that shutouts and bowl games and trophies are not nearly as important as the solemn obligation, the solemn oath that they will take in just a few weeks as the newest officers in the world's finest Air Force. <p>So, gentlemen, I have no higher privilege and no greater honor than serving as your Commander in Chief, and I look forward to joining you for that important ceremony. <p>Today, we honor the success that these outstanding young men had on the playing field. And we look forward to their continuing excellence on behalf of the Nation. And, cadets, as you look to trade the proud uniform of your team for the proud uniform of your country, I want you to know that this country will stand by you and do everything possible to help you succeed and come home safe. <p>So God bless all those who serve, and God bless the United States of America, and God bless Air Force. <p>Thank you so much.\" "
"96" "\"Good morning, everyone. It is a great honor to be with you here today. Of course, it is a truly humbling moment to be introduced by Elie Wiesel. Along with Sara Bloomfield, the outstanding director here, we just spent some time among the exhibits, and this is now the second visit I've had here. My daughters have come here. It is a searing occasion whenever you visit. And as we walked, I was taken back to the visit that Elie mentioned, the time that we traveled together to Buchenwald. <p>And I recall how he showed me the barbed-wire fences and the guard towers. And we walked the rows where the barracks once stood, where so many left this Earth, including Elie's father Shlomo. We stopped at an old photo: men and women lying in their wooden bunks, barely more than skeletons. And if you look closely, you can see a 16-year old boy, looking right at the camera, right into your eyes. You can see Elie. <p>And at the end of our visit that day, Elie spoke of his father. \\"I thought one day I will come back and speak to him,\\" he said, \\"of times in which memory has become a sacred duty of all people of good will.\\" Elie, you've devoted your life to upholding that sacred duty. You've challenged us all, as individuals, and as nations, to do the same, with the power of your example, the eloquence of your words, as you did again just now. And so to you and Marion, we are extraordinarily grateful. <p>To Sara, to Tom Bernstein, to Josh Bolten, members of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, and everyone who sustains this living memorial, thank you for welcoming us here today. To the Members of Congress, members of the diplomatic corps, including Ambassador Michael Oren of Israel, we are glad to be with you. <p>And most of all, we are honored to be in the presence of men and women whose lives are a testament to the endurance and the strength of the human spirit, the inspiring survivors. It is a privilege to be with you on a very personal level. As I've told some of you before, I grew up hearing stories about my great uncle, a soldier in the 89th Infantry Division who was stunned and shaken by what he saw when he helped to liberate Ordruf, part of Buchenwald. And I'll never forget what I saw at Buchenwald, where so many perished with the words of <i>Sh'ma Yis'ra'eil</i> on their lips. <p>I've stood with survivors in the old Warsaw ghettos, where a monument honors heroes who said we will not go quietly, we will stand up, we will fight back. And I've walked those sacred grounds at Yad Vashem, with its lesson for all nations: The <i>Shoah</i> cannot be denied<i>.</i> <p>During my visit to Yad Vashem, I was given a gift, inscribed with those words from the Book of Joel: \\"Has the like of this happened in your days or in the days of your fathers? Tell your children about it, and let your children tell theirs, and their children the next generation.\\" That's why we're here. Not simply to remember, but to speak. <p>I say this as a President, and I say it as a father. We must tell our children about a crime unique in human history. The one and only Holocaust&mdash;6 million innocent people, men, women, children, babies&mdash;sent to their deaths just for being different, just for being Jewish. We tell them, our children, about the millions of Poles and Catholics and Roma and gay people and so many others who also must never be forgotten. Let us tell our children not only how they died, but also how they lived: as fathers and mothers and sons and daughters and brothers and sisters who loved and hoped and dreamed just like us. <p>We must tell our children about how this evil was allowed to happen, because so many people succumbed to their darkest instincts and because so many others stood silent. Let us also tell our children about the Righteous Among the Nations. Among them was Jan Karski, a young Polish Catholic, who witnessed Jews being put on cattle cars, who saw the killings, and who told the truth, all the way to President Roosevelt himself. <p>Jan Karski passed away more than a decade ago. But today I'm proud to announce that this spring I will honor him with America's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. <p>We must tell our children. But more than that, we must teach them. Because remembrance without resolve is a hollow gesture. Awareness without action changes nothing. In this sense, \\"never again\\" is a challenge to us all to pause and to look within. <p>For the Holocaust may have reached its barbaric climax at Treblinka and Auschwitz and Belzec, but it started in the hearts of ordinary men and women. And we have seen it again, madness that can sweep through peoples, sweep through nations, embed itself. The killings in Cambodia, the killings in Rwanda, the killings in Bosnia, the killings in Darfur, they shock our conscience, but they are the awful extreme of a spectrum of ignorance and intolerance that we see every day, the bigotry that says another person is less than my equal, less than human. These are the seeds of hate that we cannot let take root in our heart. <p>\\"Never again\\" is a challenge to reject hatred in all of its forms, including anti-Semitism, which has no place in a civilized world. And today, just steps from where he gave his life protecting this place, we honor the memory of Officer Stephen Tyrone Johns, whose family joins us today. <p>\\"Never again\\" is a challenge to defend the fundamental right of free people and free nations to exist in peace and security, and that includes the State of Israel. And on my visit to the old Warsaw Ghetto, a woman looked me in the eye, and she wanted to make sure America stood with Israel. She said, \\"It's the only Jewish state we have.\\" And I made her a promise in that solemn place. I said I will always be there for Israel. <p>So when efforts are made to equate Zionism to racism, we reject them. When international fora single out Israel with unfair resolutions, we vote against them. When attempts are made to delegitimize the State of Israel, we oppose them. When faced with a regime that threatens global security and denies the Holocaust and threatens to destroy Israel, the United States will do everything in our power to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. <p>\\"Never again\\" is a challenge to societies. We're joined today by communities who've made it your mission to prevent mass atrocities in our time. This museum's Committee of Conscience, NGOs, faith groups, college students, you've harnessed the tools of the digital age: online maps and satellites and a video and social media campaign seen by millions. You understand that change comes from the bottom up, from the grassroots. You understand&mdash;to quote the task force convened by this museum&mdash;\\"preventing genocide is an achievable goal.\\" It is an achievable goal. It is one that does not start from the top, it starts from the bottom up. <p>It's remarkable&mdash;as we walked through this exhibit, Elie and I were talking as we looked at the unhappy record of the State Department and so many officials here in the United States during those years. And he asked, \\"What would you do?\\" But what you all understand is you don't just count on officials, you don't just count on governments, you count on people and mobilizing their consciences. <p>And finally, \\"never again\\" is a challenge to nations. It's a bitter truth: Too often, the world has failed to prevent the killing of innocents on a massive scale. And we are haunted by the atrocities that we did not stop and the lives we did not save. <p>Three years ago today, I joined many of you for a ceremony of remembrance at the U.S. Capitol. And I said that we had to do \\"everything we can to prevent and end atrocities.\\" And so I want to report back to some of you today to let you know that as President I've done my utmost to back up those words with deeds. Last year, in the first-ever Presidential directive on this challenge, I made it clear that \\"preventing mass atrocities and genocide is a core national security interest and a core moral responsibility of the United States of America.\\" <p>That does not mean that we intervene militarily every time there's an injustice in the world. We cannot and should not. It does mean we possess many tools&mdash;diplomatic and political, and economic and financial, and intelligence and law enforcement and our moral suasion&mdash;and using these tools over the past 3 years, I believe&mdash;I know&mdash;that we have saved countless lives. <p>When the referendum in South Sudan was in doubt, it threatened to reignite a conflict that had killed millions. But with determined diplomacy, including by some people in this room, South Sudan became the world's newest nation. And our diplomacy continues, because in Darfur, in Abyei, in Southern Kordofan, and the Blue Nile, the killing of innocents must come to an end. The Presidents of Sudan and South Sudan must have the courage to negotiate, because the people of Sudan and South Sudan deserve peace. That is work that we have done, and it has saved lives. <p>When the incumbent in Cote d'Ivoire lost an election, but refused to give it up&mdash;give up power, it threatened to unleash untold ethnic and religious killings. But with regional and international diplomacy, and U.N. peacekeepers who stood their ground and protected civilians, the former leader is now in The Hague, and Cote d'Ivoire is governed by its rightful leader, and lives were saved. <p>When the Libyan people demanded their rights and Muammar Qadhafi's forces bore down on Benghazi, a city of 700,000, and threatened to hunt down its people like rats, we forged with allies and partners a coalition that stopped his troops in their tracks. And today, the Libyan people are forging their own future, and the world can take pride in the innocent lives that we saved. <p>And when the Lord's Resistance Army led by Joseph Kony continued its atrocities in Central Africa, I ordered a small number of American advisers to help Uganda and its neighbors pursue the LRA. And when I made that announcement, I directed my National Security Council to review our progress after 150 days. We have done so, and today I can announce that our advisers will continue their efforts to bring this madman to justice and to save lives. It is part of our regional strategy to end the scourge that is the LRA and help realize a future where no African child is stolen from their family and no girl is raped and no boy is turned into a child soldier. <p>We've stepped up our efforts in other ways. We're doing more to protect women and girls from the horror of wartime sexual violence. With the arrest of fugitives like Ratko Mladic, charged with ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, the world sent a message to war criminals everywhere: We will not relent in bringing you to justice. Be on notice. And for the first time, we explicitly barred entry into the United States of those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity. <p>Now we're doing something more. We're making sure that the United States Government has the structures, the mechanisms to better prevent and respond to mass atrocities. So I created the first-ever White House position dedicated to this task. It's why I created a new Atrocities Prevention Board, to bring together senior officials from across our Government to focus on this critical mission. This is not an afterthought. This is not a sidelight in our foreign policy. The board will convene for the first time today, at the White House. And I'm pleased that one of its first acts will be to meet with some of your organizations, citizens, and activists who are partners in this work, who have been carrying this torch. <p>Going forward, we'll strengthen our tools across the board, and we'll create new ones. The intelligence community will prepare, for example, the first-ever National Intelligence Estimate on the risk of mass atrocities and genocide. We're going to institutionalize the focus on this issue. Across Government, alert channels will ensure that information about unfolding crises and dissenting opinions quickly reach decisionmakers, including me. <p>Our Treasury Department will work to more quickly deploy its financial tools to block the flow of money to abusive regimes. Our military will take additional steps to incorporate the prevention of atrocities into its doctrine and its planning. And the State Department will increase its ability to surge our diplomats and experts in a crisis. USAID will invite people and high-tech companies to help create new technologies to quickly expose violations of human rights. And we'll work with other nations so the burden is better shared, because this is a global responsibility. <p>In short, we need to be doing everything we can to prevent and respond to these kinds of atrocities, because national sovereignty is never a license to slaughter your people. <p>We recognize that, even as we do all we can, we cannot control every event. And when innocents suffer, it tears at our conscience. Elie alluded to what we feel as we see the Syrian people subjected to unspeakable violence, simply for demanding their universal rights. We have to do everything we can. And as we do, we have to remember that despite all the tanks and all the snipers, all the torture and brutality unleashed against them, the Syrian people still brave the streets. They still demand to be heard. They still seek their dignity. The Syrian people have not given up, which is why we cannot give up. <p>And so with allies and partners, we will keep increasing the pressure, with a diplomatic effort to further isolate Asad and his regime, so that those who stick with Asad know that they are making a losing bet. We'll keep increasing sanctions to cut off the regime from the money it needs to survive. We'll sustain a legal effort to document atrocities so killers face justice and a humanitarian effort to get relief and medicine to the Syrian people. And we'll keep working with the Friends of Syria to increase support for the Syrian opposition as it grows stronger. <p>Indeed, today we're taking another step. I've signed an Executive order that authorizes new sanctions against the Syrian Government and Iran and those that abet them for using technologies to monitor and track and target citizens for violence. These technologies should not empower&mdash;these technologies should be in place to empower citizens, not to repress them. And it's one more step that we can take toward the day that we know will come&mdash;the end of the Asad regime that has brutalized the Syrian people&mdash;and allow the Syrian people to chart their own destiny. <p>Even with all the efforts I've described today, even with everything that, hopefully, we have learned, even with the incredible power of museums like this one, even with everything that we do to try to teach our children about our own responsibilities, we know that our work will never be done. There will be conflicts that are not easily resolved. There will be senseless deaths that aren't prevented. There will be stories of pain and hardship that test our hopes and try our conscience. And in such moments, it can be hard to imagine a more just world. <p>It can be tempting to throw up our hands and resign ourselves to man's endless capacity for cruelty. It's tempting sometimes to believe that there is nothing we can do. And all of us have those doubts. All of us have those moments, perhaps especially those who work most ardently in these fields. <p>So in the end, I come back to something Elie said that day we visited Buchenwald together. Reflecting on all that he had endured, he said, \\"We had the right to give up.\\" \\"We had the right to give up on humanity, to give up on culture, to give up on education, to give up on the possibility of living one's life with dignity, in a world that has no place for dignity.\\" They had that right. Imagine what they went through. They had the right to give up. Nobody would begrudge them that. Who would question someone giving up in such circumstances? <p>But, Elie said, \\"We rejected that possibility, and we said, no, we must continue believing in a future.\\" To stare into the abyss, to face the darkness and insist there is a future, to not give up, to say yes to life, to believe in the possibility of justice. <p>To Elie and to the survivors who are here today, thank you for not giving up. You show us the way. You show us the way. If you cannot give up, if you can believe, then we can believe. If you can continue to strive and speak, then we can speak and strive for a future where there's a place for dignity for every human being. That has been the cause of your lives. It must be the work of our nation and of all nations. <p>So God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you.\" "
"97" "\"<i>The President.</i> Wow, thank you, everybody. Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat. Have a seat. Welcome to the White House. <p>Before we get started, I want to recognize one of our greatest advocates for education and for teachers, our Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, is here. Give him a big round of applause. <p>Now let's face it, a lot of important people visit the White House. [<i>Laughter</i>] But to young people in classrooms around the country, nobody is more important than the men and women that we honor here today, the State and National Teachers of the Year. <p>These are the kind of teachers who change lives forever. I wouldn't be here today if it were not for teachers like these who challenged me and pushed me and put up with me and inspired me and set me straight when they had to. And I think everybody here can say the exact same thing. <p>Teachers matter. That's why I often tell young people: If you want a guarantee that you're making a difference every single day, become a teacher. A teacher is the key to a child reaching their potential. And if we need more proof&mdash;&mdash; <p>[<i>At this point, a baby chattered.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Yes, it's true. [<i>Laughter</i>] Yes. She agrees. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And if we need more proof that teachers matter, all we've got to do is look around this room. I'm honored to be here with teachers like Gay Barnes, from Madison, Alabama, one of the four finalists for this award. There's Angela Wilson, who teaches children of military families at Vicenza Middle School in Italy. Not a bad place to hang out. [<i>Laughter</i>] There is Alvin Aureliano Davis, who teaches music in Florida. <p>And there is our 2012 National Teacher of the Year, Rebecca Mieliwocki, from Burbank, California. So give Rebecca a big round of applause. And this is Rebecca's crew right here&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;who are very proud. Auntie and cousins and&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Rebecca Mieliwocki.</i> My boss. <p><i>The President.</i> Oh, boss. [<i>Laughter</i>] Even more important. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, you might say that teaching is in Rebecca's DNA, because both her parents taught in public schools. She saw how hard they worked, how much time and energy they devoted to their jobs, how much they gave to their students. <p>But when she was 18, of course, the last thing she wanted to be was a teacher. What teenager wants to do what their parents are doing? [<i>Laughter</i>] So in college, she really rebelled and went to law school. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, she then tried a few different careers after that. After studying to become a lawyer, she went into publishing and floral design and event planning. But ultimately, she found herself drawn back to the classroom, and her students are so lucky that she did. <p>She's got high expectations for her seventh graders and for herself, but she also knows that school can be fun. And that fits a personality that she describes as \\"a 12 year-old goofball dying to get out.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] And I have to say, she was a little goofy when I met her. [<i>Laughter</i>] She was back there teasing me and asking Arne about our basketball games and stuff. [<i>Laughter</i>] You can tell she's just got a wonderful spirit. <p>And so in addition to everything they learn in her English class, Rebecca's students have had a chance to film their own adaptations of an O. Henry short story. They worked with a local writer to develop 5-minute plays, which professional actors then performed. Rebecca has led field trips to the science center, to the aquarium, to Chinatown, even the La Brea tar pits&mdash;that's a trip you really don't want to lose track of anybody. [<i>Laughter</i>] Only one kid? [<i>Laughter</i>] They never showed up that morning&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I was wondering where they were. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Rebecca knows that education also is a responsibility that begins at home. So she hosts family nights to get parents involved. She sends home weekly parent memos so moms and dads know what's going on in school. She maintains a Facebook page for her class, where families can get information and updates 24/7. <p>And all this extra work makes a huge difference. When kids finish a year in Rebecca's class, they're better readers and writers than when they started. But even more than that, they know how important they are. And they understand how bright their futures can be. And they know that if they work at it, there's no limit to what they can achieve. <p>So Rebecca is the definition of \\"above and beyond.\\" And so many teachers around the country are like her. She throws herself into her work for a simple reason: She knows that her students depend on her. And as she puts it, \\"Life is too short and too difficult to have anything less than the most engaged, enthusiastic teachers in schools.\\" I couldn't agree more. And I know Arne couldn't agree more. <p>I also want to point something else out. Rebecca said in applying for this award, she said that in some ways it's harder than ever to be an educator. Even in the best of times, teachers are asked to do more with less. And today, with our economy still recovering from the worst recession since the Great Depression, States and communities have to stretch budgets tighter than ever. <p>So we've got a particular responsibility as elected officials in difficult times, instead of bashing teachers to support them. We should be giving States the resources to keep good teachers on the job and reward the best ones. And we should grant our educators the flexibility to teach with creativity and passion in the classroom and not just teaching to the test. And we should allow schools to replace teachers, who, even with the right resources and support, just aren't helping our kids to learn. <p>Because we've all got something at stake here. Our parents, our grandparents, they didn't build the world's most prosperous economy and the strongest middle class in the world out of thin air. It started with a world class education system. That was the foundation. And in the long run, no issue will have a bigger impact in our success as a country and the success of our citizens. <p>So every day, when teachers like you put in long hours or dig into your own pockets to pay for school supplies or tweak lessons so they're even better than they were last year, you're not just serving your schools or your students, you're also serving your country. And you're helping to preserve the basic promise of America, that no matter who you are, where you come from, what you look like, what your last name is, you can succeed. You can make it if you try, if you put in the effort. <p>So on behalf of the American people, thank you all for everything that you do. And congratulations. I'm going to present this spiffy looking award to Rebecca Mieliwocki.\" "
"98" "\"Hey, everybody. Thanks for being on the call. And first of all, let me apologize if the connection sounds fuzzy. As was just mentioned, I'm joining you guys on Air Force One. <p>I'm just leaving North Carolina; I was at UNC-Chapel Hill. Now I'm on my way to the University of Colorado at Boulder. And tomorrow we're going to be at the University of Iowa in Iowa City. And what we're doing is going to schools to talk to students directly about the critical importance of the possibility that 7.4 million students with Federal student loans would see their interest rates double on July 1 unless Congress steps up and does what it needs to do. <p>I've always believed that we should be doing everything we can to help put higher education within reach for every single American student, because the unemployment rate for Americans with at least a college degree is about half the national average. And it's never been more important. Unfortunately, it's also never been more expensive. And most of you guys, I'm sure, have reported about this and know this: Students who take out loans to pay for college graduate owing an average of $25,000 a year. And I know what this is like, because when Michelle and I graduated from college and law school, we had enormous debts, and it took us a lot of years to pay off. So that's probably why I feel this thing so personally. <p>For a lot of working families, the idea of owing that much money means higher education is simply out of reach for their children. And for the first time, now we've got Americans owing more debt on their student loans than they do on their credit cards. <p>The key point here is, is that in America, higher education can't be a luxury. It's an economic imperative that every family has got to be able to afford. We've already taken some important steps to make college more affordable. So for example, we extended Pell grants to 3 million more students, and we signed a tax credit worth up to $10,000 to help middle class families cover the cost of tuition. We've eliminated a major expense for young people by allowing young adults to stay on their parents' health insurance plans until they're 26. <p>But there's clearly more work to be done. And that's why I'm going to colleges across the country. I want to talk to students right now about how we can make higher education more affordable and what's at stake right now if Congress doesn't do something about it. <p>So the key point I want to make: If Congress doesn't act on July 1, interest rates on Stafford loans, on student loans from the Federal Government, will double. Nearly 7&frac12; million students will end up owing more on their loan payments. And that would be obviously a tremendous blow. And it's completely preventable. <p>And for some time now, I've been calling on Congress to take steps to make higher education more affordable, to prevent these interest rates from doubling, and to extend the tuition tax credit that has saved middle class families millions of dollars, but also, to double the number of work-study jobs over the next 5 years. <p>And instead, over the past few years, Republicans in Congress have voted against new ways to make college more affordable for middle class families, even while they're voting for huge tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires, tax cuts that, by the way, would have to be paid for by cutting things like education and job training programs that give students new opportunities to work and succeed. <p>So the bottom line here is we can't just cut our way to prosperity. Making it harder for our young people to afford higher education, allowing them to earn their degrees, that's nothing more than cutting our own future off at the knees. And Congress has to keep interest rates on student loans from doubling, and they need to do it now. <p>And I have to say, from my perspective, this is a question of values. We can't let America become a country where a shrinking number of people are doing really well, a growing number of people struggle to get by, and you've got fewer ladders for people to climb into the middle class and to get opportunity. We've got to build an economy where everybody is getting a fair shot, everybody is doing their fair share, everybody is playing by the same set of rules. That's ultimately how the middle class gets stronger. And that's an economy that's built to last. <p>So I'm going to take this issue to every part of the country this year. I'm going to keep focusing on it until Congress passes legislation to keep interest rates low and to continue to give students the chance to get the college education they need for the jobs of today, but also for the jobs of tomorrow. <p>And part of the reason I wanted to be on this call is to let you know, very personally, I need your help on this. I need you all to tell your readers and your listeners why they've got to speak up, why they've got to speak out. Let Congress know that they need to do the right thing. And for those of you on Twitter, use the hashtag \\"dontdoublemyrate.\\" That's \\"dontdoublemyrate.\\" <p>Because we don't want Congress to double the interest rates on so many students. We need to reward hard work and responsibility. And part of that is keeping interest rates on students low&mdash;student loans low so more Americans get a fair shot at an affordable college education, the skills they need to find a good job, a clear path to the middle class that's not blocked by a mountain of debt. And the time to act is right now, and I'm going to need your help getting that message out. <p>So thanks so much to all of you for being on the call. And thanks for taking the time to shine a light on this important issue. And I know that our team is going to be on the phone call after I hang up. They can answer a bunch of specific details that you may have. <p>Talk to you soon. Bye-bye.\" "
"99" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you! Hello, North Carolina! What's up, Tar Heels? <p>Now, first of all, I want to thank Dominique for that unbelievable introduction. Wasn't she good? You can tell she will be an outstanding teacher. <p><i>Audience member.</i> I love you, President Obama! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. I do. Love North Carolina. I love North Carolina. I do. Every time I come down to this State, I just love it that much more. I said a while back, the thing about North Carolina is even the folks who don't vote for me are nice to me. [<i>Laughter</i>] I can't say that about everyplace. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, I want to issue a quick spoiler alert: Later today I am getting together with Jimmy Fallon&mdash;and the Dave Matthews Band&mdash;right here on campus. We're going to tape Jimmy's show for tonight, so I want everybody to tune in, make sure it has high ratings. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's a Dave Matthews fan right here. <p>We've got some wonderful people who are here who are doing a great job for you guys. First of all, your Governor, Bev Perdue, is in the house. Give her a big round of applause. Where's Bev? There she is. We've got your Congressman, Dave Price&mdash;Congressman David Price; Congressmen G.K. Butterfield; Congressman Brad Miller; your mayor, Mark Kleinschmidt; chancellor of UNC, Holden Thorp. <p>It is great to be back on the Lady Tar Heels' home court. This is an arena with some serious hoops history. I know the men's team used to play here back in the day. I just want to remind you right off the bat: I picked UNC to win it all in March Madness. Want to point out. And if Kendall hadn't gotten hurt&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;who knows where we might have been. <p>I saw McAdoo, by the way, at the airport. He came by and said hello, which I was excited. So I just want you to know I have faith in you guys. <p>Now, it's always good to begin with some easy applause lines, talk about the Tar Heels. [<i>Laughter</i>] But the reason I came to Chapel Hill today is to talk about what most of you do here every single day, and that's study, I assume. [<i>Laughter</i>] Higher education is the single most important investment you can make in your future. So I'm proud of all of you for doing what it takes to make that investment: for the long hours in the library&mdash;I hope&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;in the lab, in the classroom. This has never been more important. <p>Whether you're here at a 4-year college or university or you're at a 2-year community college, in today's economy, there's no greater predictor of individual success than a good education. Right now the unemployment rate for Americans with a college degree or more is about half the national average. The incomes of folks with a college degree are twice as high as those who don't have a high school diploma. A higher education is the clearest path into the middle class. <p>Now, I know that those of you who are about to graduate are wondering about what's in store for your future. Not even 4 years ago, just as the global economy was about to enter into freefall, you were still trying to find your way around campus. And you've spent your years here at a time when the whole world has been trying to recover, but has not yet fully recovered from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the worst economic crisis in most of our lifetimes, and that includes your teachers. <p>Our businesses have added more than 4 million jobs over the past 2 years, but we all know there's still too many Americans out there looking for work or trying to find a job that pays enough to cover the bills and make the mortgage. We still have too many folks in the middle class that are searching for that security that started slipping away years before the recession hit. <p>So we've still got a lot of work to do to rebuild this economy so that it lasts, so that it's solid, so that it's firm. But what I want you to know is that the degree you earn from UNC will be the best tool you have to achieve that basic American promise, the idea that if you work hard, you can do well enough to raise a family and own a home, send your own kids to college, put a little away for retirement. That American Dream is within your reach. <p>And there's another part of this dream, which is the idea that each generation is going to know a little bit more opportunity than the last generation. That our kids&mdash;I can tell you now as a parent&mdash;and I guarantee you, your parents feel this about you&mdash;nothing is more important than your kid's success. You want them to do better than you did. You want them to shoot higher, strive more, and succeed beyond your imagination. <p>So keeping that promise alive is the defining issue of our time. I don't want this to be a country where a shrinking number of Americans are doing really, really well, but a growing number of people are just struggling to get by. That's not my idea of America. I don't want that future for you. I don't want that future for my daughters. I want this forever to be a country where everybody gets a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same set of rules. That's the America I know and love. That's the America within our reach. <p>I think back to my grandfather. He had a chance to go to college because this country decided every returning veteran of World War II should be able to afford it, should be able to go to college. My mother was able to raise two kids by herself because she was able to get grants and work her way through school. I am only standing here today, Michelle is only who she is today, because of scholarships and student loans. That gave us a shot at a great education. We didn't come from families of means, but we knew that if we worked hard we'd have a shot. <p>This country has always made a commitment to put a good education within the reach of all who are willing to work for it. That's what makes us special. That's what made us an economic superpower. That's what kept us at the forefront of business and science and technology and medicine. And that's a commitment we have to reaffirm today in 2012. <p>Now, everybody will give lip service to this. You'll hear a lot of folks say, yes, education is important, it's important. [<i>Laughter</i>] But it requires not just words, but deeds. And the fact is, that since most of you were born, tuition and fees at America's colleges have more than doubled. And that forces students like you to take out a lot more loans. There are fewer grants. You rack up more debt. Can I get an \\"amen\\"? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Amen! <p><i>The President.</i> Now, the average student who borrows to pay for college now graduates with about $25,000 in student loan debt. That's the average; some are more. Can I get an \\"amen\\" for that? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Amen! <p><i>The President.</i> Yes, because some folks have more debt than that. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Amen! [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Americans now owe more on their student loans than they do on their credit cards. And living with that kind of debt means that this generation is not getting off to the same start that previous generations, because you're already loaded up with debt. So that means you've got to make pretty tough choices when you are first starting out. You might have to put off buying a house. It might mean that you can't go after that great idea for a startup that you have, because you're still paying off loans. Maybe you've got to wait longer to start a family or save for retirement. <p>When a big chunk of every paycheck goes towards loan debt, that's not just tough on you, that's not just tough for middle class families, it's not just tough on your parents, it's painful for the economy, because that money is not going to help businesses grow. I mean, think about the sooner you can start buying a house, that's good for the housing industry. The sooner you can start up that business, that means you're hiring some folks. That grows the economy. <p>And this is something Michelle and I know about firsthand. I just wanted everybody here to understand this is not&mdash;I didn't just read about this. [<i>Laughter</i>] I didn't just get some talking points about this. I didn't just get a policy briefing on this. Michelle and I, we've been in your shoes. Like I said, we didn't come from wealthy families. <p>So when we graduated from college and law school, we had a mountain of debt. When we married, we got poorer together. [<i>Laughter</i>] We added up our assets, and there were no assets. [<i>Laughter</i>] And we added up our liabilities, and there were a lot of liabilities, basically in the form of student loans. We paid more in student loans than we paid on our mortgage when we finally did buy a condo. For the first 8 years of our marriage, we were paying more in student loans than what we were paying for our mortgage. So we know what this is about. <p>And we were lucky to land good jobs with a steady income. But we only finished paying off our student loans&mdash;check this out, all right, I'm the President of the United States&mdash;we only finished paying off our student loans about 8 years ago. [<i>Laughter</i>] That wasn't that long ago. And that wasn't easy, especially because when we had Malia and Sasha, we're supposed to be saving up for their college educations, and we're still paying off our college educations. <p>So we have to make college more affordable for our young people. That's the bottom line. And like I said, look, not everybody is going to go to a 4-year college or university. You may go to a community college. You may go to a technical school and get into the workforce. And then, it may turn out that after you've had kids and you're 35, you go back to school because you're retraining for something new. But no matter what it is, no matter what field you're in, you're going to have to engage in lifelong learning. That's the nature of the economy today. And we've got to make sure that's affordable. <p>That's good for the country; it's good for you. At this make-or-break moment for the middle class, we've got to make sure that you're not saddled with debt before you even get started in life. Because I believe college isn't just one of the best investments you can make in your future, it's one of the best investments America can make in our future. This is important for all of us. <p>We can't price the middle class out of a college education. Not at a time when most new jobs in America will require more than a high school diploma. Whether it's at a 4-year college or a 2-year program, we can't make higher education a luxury. It's an economic imperative. Every American family should be able to afford it. <p>So that's why I'm here. Now before I ask for your help, I've got something very specific I'm going to need you to do. But, North Carolina, indulge me. I want to briefly tell you what we've already done to help make college more affordable, because we've done a lot. <p>Before I took office, we had a student loan system where tens of billions of taxpayer dollars were going to banks, not students. They were processing student loan programs, except the student loans were federally guaranteed so they weren't taking any big risks, but they were still taking billions of dollars out of the system. So we changed it. <p>Some in Washington fought tooth and nail to protect the status quo, where billions of dollars were going to banks instead of students. And they wanted to protect that. They wanted to keep those dollars flowing to the banks. <p>One of them said&mdash;and I'm going to quote here because it gives you a sense of the attitudes sometimes we're dealing with in Washington. They said, it would be \\"an outrage\\" if we changed the system so that the money wasn't going through banks and they weren't making billions of dollars of profits off of it&mdash;said it was \\"an outrage.\\" <p>And I said, no, the real outrage is letting these banks keep these subsidies without taking any risks while students are working two or three jobs just to get by. That's an outrage. [<i>Applause</i>] That's an outrage. <p>So we kept at it, we kept it at, we won that fight. Today, that money is going where it should be going&mdash;should have been going in the first place: It's going directly to students. We're bypassing the middleman. That means we can raise Pell grants to a higher level. More people are eligible. More young people are able to afford college because of what we did. Over 10 years, that's going to be $60 billion that's going to students that wasn't going to students before. <p>Now, then last fall, I acted to cap student loan payments faster, so that nearly 1.6 million students who make their payments on time will only have to pay 10 percent of their monthly income towards loans once they graduate. Now, this is useful&mdash;this is especially helpful for young people who decide, like Dominique, to become teachers, or maybe they go into one of the&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> Social work. <p><i>The President. &mdash;</i>&mdash;social work or one of the helping professions. And they may not get paid a lot of money, but they've got a lot of debt. And so being able to cap how much per month you're paying as a percentage of your income gives you a little bit more security knowing you can choose that profession. <p>And then we wanted every student to have access to a simple factsheet on student loans and financial aid, so you can have all the information you need to make your own choices about how to pay for college. And we set up this new consumer watchdog called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and so they're now putting out this information. We call it \\"Know Before You Owe.\\" \\"Know Before You Owe.\\" It's something Michelle and I wish we had had when we were in your shoes because sometimes we got surprised by some of this debt that we were racking up. <p>So that's what we've done. But it's not enough just to increase student aid. We can't keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition or we'll run out of money. And colleges and universities, they've got to do their part also to keep college costs down. So I've told Congress to steer Federal aid to those schools that keep tuition affordable, that provide good value, that serve their students well. And we've put colleges on notice: If you can't stop tuition from just going up every single year a lot faster than inflation, then funding you get from taxpayers, at least at the Federal level, will go down, because we need to push colleges to do better and hold them accountable if they don't. <p>Now, public universities know well, and Governor Perdue knows well: States also have to do their part by making higher education a higher priority in their budgets. I know that Bev is fighting hard to make tuition affordable for North Carolina families. That's a priority for her. But last year, over 40 States cut their higher education spending. And these budget cuts have been among the largest factors in tuition increases at public colleges over the past decade. So we're challenging States to take responsibility. We told them, if you can find new ways to bring down the cost of college and make it easier for students to graduate, then we'll help you do it. <p>But I want everybody here, as you're thinking about voting, make sure you know where your State representative and your State senator stands when it comes to funding higher education. They've got to be responsible. They've got to be accountable as well to prioritize higher education. <p>All right. So helping more families, helping more young people afford a higher education, offering incentives for States and colleges and universities to keep their costs down, that's what we've been doing. Now Congress has to do their part. <p>They need to extend the tuition tax credit that we put in place back when I came into office. It's saving middle class families thousands of dollars. Congress needs to safeguard aid for low income students, like Pell grants, so that today's freshmen and sophomores knows that they'll be able to count on it. That's what Congress has to do. Congress needs to give more young people the chance to earn their way through college by doubling the number of work-study jobs over the next 5 years. That's what Congress needs to do. <p>And then there's one specific thing&mdash;and now this is where you come in&mdash;there's one specific thing that Congress needs to do right now to prevent the interest rates on student loans, Federal student loans, from shooting up and shaking you down. So this is where you come in. I want to explain this, so everybody listen carefully. <p>Five years ago, Congress cut the rate on Federal student loans in half. That was a good thing to do. But on July 1&mdash;that's a little over 2 months from now&mdash;that rate cut expires. And if Congress does nothing, the interest rates on those loans will double overnight. <p>So I'm assuming a lot of people here have Federal student loans. The interest rates will double unless Congress acts by July 1. And just to give you some sense of perspective: for each year that Congress doesn't act, the average student with these loans will rack up an additional thousand dollars in debt&mdash;an extra thousand dollars. That's basically a tax hike for more than 7 million students across America, more than 160,000 students here in North Carolina alone. Anybody here can afford to pay an extra thousand dollars right now? <p><i>Audience members.</i> No! [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> I didn't think so. So stopping this from happening should be a no-brainer. Helping more of our young people afford college, that should be at the forefront of America's agenda. It shouldn't be a Republican or a Democratic issue. This is an American issue. <p>The Stafford loans we're talking about, they're named after a Republican Senator. The Pell grants that have helped millions of Americans earn a college education, that's named after a Democratic Senator. When Congress cut those rates 5 years ago, 77 Republicans in the House of Representatives voted for it&mdash;along with a couple hundred Democrats&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;including the Democrats who are here. <p>So this shouldn't be a partisan issue. And yet the Republicans who run Congress right now have not yet said whether or not they'll stop your rates from doubling. We're 2 months away. Some have hinted that they'd only do it if we cut things like aid for low income students instead. So the idea would be, well, all right, we'll keep interest rates low if we take away aid from other students who need it. That doesn't make sense. <p>One Republican Congresswoman said just recently&mdash;I'm going to quote this because I know you guys will think I'm making it up. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member.</i> We trust you. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> No, no, no. The&mdash;she said she had \\"very little tolerance for people who tell me they graduate with debt because there's no reason for that.\\" <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> I'm just quoting here. I'm just quoting. She said, students who rack up student loan debt are just sitting on their butts, having opportunity \\"dumped in your lap.\\" <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> I mean, I'm reading it here, so I didn't make this up. Now, can you imagine saying something like that? Those of you who have had to take out student loans, you didn't do it because you're lazy. You didn't do it lightly. You don't like debt. I mean, a lot of you, your parents are helping out, but it's tough on them. They're straining. And so you do it because the cost of college keeps going up and you know this is an investment in your future. <p>So if these folks in Washington were serious about making college more affordable, they wouldn't have voted for a budget that could cut financial aid for tens of millions of college students by an average of more than a thousand dollars. <p>They certainly wouldn't let your student loan rates double overnight. So when you ask them, well, why aren't you making this commitment? They say, well, we got to bring down the deficit. Of course, this is the deficit they helped run up over the past decade: didn't pay for two wars, didn't pay for two massive tax cuts. And now this is the reason why you want students to pay more? <p>They just voted to keep giving billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies to big oil companies that are raking in record profits. They just voted to let millionaires and billionaires keep paying lower tax rates than middle class workers and their secretaries. They even voted to give an average tax cut of at least $150,000 to folks like me, the wealthiest Americans, a tax cut paid for by cutting things like education and job training programs that give students new opportunities to work and succeed. <p>Now, that's their priorities. And that doesn't make any sense. Do we want to keep tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans who don't need them and didn't ask for them, or do we want to make sure that they're paying their fair share? Do we want to keep subsidizing big oil, or do we want to make sure we're investing in clean energy? Do we want to jack up interest rates on millions of students, or do we want to keep investing in things that will help us and help them in the long term, things like education and science and a strong military and care for our veterans? We can't do both. We can't have it both ways. We've got to make a choice about what our priorities are. <p>You know, I've said this before, but I'm just going to keep on repeating it: In America, we admire success. We aspire to it. I want everybody to be rich. I want everybody to work and hustle and start businesses and study your tails off to get there. [<i>Laughter</i>] But America is not just about a few people doing well. America is about giving everybody a chance to do well: everybody&mdash;not just a few&mdash;everybody. That's what built this country. That's what the American Dream is all about. <p>A lot of us had parents or grandparents who said, maybe I can't go to college, but some day my son, he'll go to college, and I'll be so proud of him. A lot of us had parents or grandparents who said, maybe I can't start my own business, but maybe someday my daughter, she's going to start her own business, she's going to work for herself. A lot of us had parents or grandparents who said, I may be an immigrant, but I believe that this is a country where no matter what you look like and where you come from, no matter what your name is, you can make it if you try. <p>North Carolina, that's who we are. That's our values. That's what we're about. So no, \\"set your sights lower\\"&mdash;that's not an education plan. \\"You're on your own\\"&mdash;that's not an economic plan. We can't just cut our way to prosperity. <p>Previous generations made the investments necessary for us to succeed, to build a strong middle class, to create the foundation for America's leadership in science and technology and medicine and manufacturing. And now it's our turn. We've got to do the right thing. I want one of you to discover the cure for cancer or the formula for fusion or the next game-changing American industry. And that means we've got to support those efforts. <p>So if you agree with me, I need your help. I need you to tell your Member of Congress, we're not going to set our sights lower. We're not going to settle for something less. Now, all of you are lucky, you already have three Congressmen who are on board. So don't&mdash;you don't need to call them. [<i>Laughter</i>] They're already doing the right thing. But I'm asking everyone else who's watching or following online, call your Member of Congress, e-mail them, write on their Facebook page, tweet them. We've got a hashtag. [<i>Laughter</i>] All right. Here's the hashtag for you to tweet them: \\"dontdoublemyrate.\\" All right? Don't double my rate. I'm going to repeat that. The hashtag is \\"dontdoublemyrate.\\" You tweet&mdash;everybody say it just so everybody remembers it. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Don't double my rate. <p><i>The President.</i> Don't double my rate&mdash;it's pretty straightforward. <p>Your voice matters. So stand up. Be heard. Be counted. Tell them now is not the time to double interest rates on your student loans. Now is the time to double down on smart investments to build a strong and secure middle class. Now is the time to double down on building an America that lasts. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Absolutely! <p><i>The President.</i> You&mdash;absolutely. <p>You and me, all of us here, every single one of us&mdash;we're here only because somebody, somewhere, felt responsibility not just for themselves, but they felt responsibility for something larger. It started with them feeling responsible for their families. So your parents sacrificed, your grandparents sacrificed to make sure you could succeed. But then they thought bigger than that. They thought about their neighborhood, they thought about their community, they thought about their country. Now&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> The planet. <p><i>The President.</i> They thought about the planet. And now it's our turn to be responsible. It's our turn to keep that promise alive. <p>And no matter how tough these times have been, no matter how many obstacles that may stand in our way, I promise you, North Carolina, there are better days ahead. We will emerge stronger than we were before. Because I believe in you. I believe in your future. I believe in the investment you're making right here at North Carolina. That tells me that you share my faith in America's future. And that's what drives me every single day: your hopes, your dreams. And I'm not quitting now, because in America, we don't quit. We get each other's backs. We help each other get ahead. <p>And if we work together, we'll remind the world just why it is that America's the greatest nation on Earth. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"100" "\"Hello, everybody. It is great to be back in Iowa City. I'm not going to give a long speech here. I just want to say thank you to all the people who are taking an interest in this important issue. I know we've got a lot of students here. Everybody cares about making sure you guys can pay for college in an affordable way, so that's what I'm going to be talking about. <p>But I just want to tell all of you I couldn't appreciate you more, taking the time to come out, and I hope that&mdash;how many seniors do we have here? [<i>Applause</i>] All right. Seniors, you've got just a few more weeks to go, so make sure to finish strong; don't goof off too much. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And I just want you to know that Iowa always feels like home to me because I spend so much time here. So all right, thank you, everybody. I'm going to shake some hands. Thanks, everybody.\" "
"101" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Hawkeyes! It is good to be back in Iowa! Can folks please give it up for Blake for that outstanding introduction? And I want to thank the University of Iowa Pep Band for firing everybody up. <p>There is some good hospitality here, and I should know. I spent a little time here in Iowa, spent a little time here in Iowa City. I'm glad that my hometown of Chicago will get to return the hospitality when your football team kicks off its season at Soldier Field. <p>I want to thank a couple guests. First of all, your Congressman, Dave Loebsack, is here; Attorney General Tom Miller; State Treasurer Mike Fitzgerald; your mayor, Matt Hayek; the president of the University of Iowa, Sally Mason. <p>So I have come to the University of Iowa to talk a little bit about you and some of the issues you guys are dealing with every single day. Now, I believe that college isn't just the best investment that you can make in your future, it's the best investment you can make in your country's future. And I'm proud of all of you for making that investment, because it's never been more important. <p>In today's economy, there's no greater predictor of individual success than a good education. That's at the top. Right now the unemployment rate for Americans with a college degree or more is about half the national average. Their incomes are twice as high as those who don't have a high school diploma. A higher education is the single clearest path to the middle class. <p>I know that those of you who are about to graduate are wondering what's in store for your future. Because not even 4 years ago, just as the global economy was about to enter into freefall, you were still trying to find your way around campus, and now, 4 years later, you're looking at what it means when you leave this campus. <p>Now, the good news is, today our economy is recovering. That's the good news. But I'll be honest with you. It has not yet fully healed from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Our businesses have added more than 4 million jobs over the past 2 years. But there's still a lot of Americans who are out there looking for a job or at least finding a job that pays the bills and helps cover the mortgage. There's still too many families who don't have that security, that basic middle class security that started slipping away even before this crisis hit. <p>But what I want all of you to know is that the degree you earn from Iowa will be the best tool you have to achieve that basic American promise, the idea that if you work hard, if you give it your all, if you're responsible, then you can do well enough to raise a family and own a home, send your own kids to college, put a little away for retirement. It's the idea that each generation is going to have a little more opportunity than the last. That's at the heart of the American Dream. <p>And I can tell you, as a parent now, when I see Malia and Sasha doing well, there's nothing more important to me. And that's true for American families everywhere, and it's the hope your parents have for you. That's the hope you'll have some day for your own kids. And keeping that promise alive is the defining issue of our time. I don't want this a country&mdash;I don't want this to be a country where a shrinking number of people are doing really, really well and then a growing number are barely able to get by. I don't want that future for you. I don't want it for my daughters. I don't want it for America. <p>I want this forever to be a country where everybody gets a fair shot and everybody's doing their fair share and everybody's playing by the same set of rules. That's the America I know, that's the America I love, and that's the America within our reach if we work for it. <p>And this is personal for me. <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you, Barack! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. I love you guys, and I believe in you guys. That's the most important thing. I believe in you. And I believe in your future. <p>And I think about my own life. My grandfather had the chance to go to college because this country decided that every returning veteran of World War II should be able to afford it through the GI bill. My mom was a single mom&mdash;my dad wasn't around&mdash;and she raised two kids by herself with some help from my grandparents because she was able to get grants and work her way through school. And I'm only here today, and Michelle is only where she is today, because scholarships and student loans gave us a shot at a great education. That's how we succeeded. <p>And this country's always made a commitment to put a good education within the reach of everybody who's willing to work for it. That's part of what made us special. That's what kept us at the forefront of business and science and technology and medicine. That's a commitment that we need to reaffirm today. <p>Now, here's the challenge we've got. Since most of you were born, tuition and fees at America's colleges have more than doubled. And that forces students like you to take out more loans and rack up more debt. The average student who borrows to pay for college now graduates with about $25,000 in student loan debt. And in this State, it's even higher. Americans now owe more on their student loans than they owe on credit cards. <p>And living with that debt means you've got to make some pretty tough choices. It might mean putting off buying a first home or chasing that great startup idea that you've got. Maybe you'll have to wait a little bit longer to start a family or save for retirement. And when a big chunk of every paycheck goes towards loan debt, that's not just tough on you, that's not just tough on middle class families. That's not good for our economy, because that money that could be going into businesses is going just to service debt. <p>And as I said, this is personal for me. I know something about this, because Michelle and I, we went through it. And it wasn't that long ago. We've been in your shoes. We didn't come from wealthy families. We needed loans and we needed grants to get our way through. <p>And that meant that when Michelle and I graduated from college and law school, we had a mountain of debt. When we got married, we got poorer together. [<i>Laughter</i>] Sort of, we combined our assets, and they were zero. [<i>Laughter</i>] And then we combined our liabilities, and they were a lot. [<i>Laughter</i>] So we ended up paying more for our student loans in the first few years that we were married than we paid on our mortgage each month when we finally bought a small condo. And we were lucky to land good jobs with a steady income, but we only finished paying off our student loans about 8 years ago. Think about that. I'm the President of the United States&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;it was only about 8 years ago that we finished paying off our student loans, so&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>And let me tell you, it wasn't easy making those payments, because once we had Malia and Sasha, we're trying to save for their college education even as we're paying off our own college educations. <p>So this is personal. This is at the heart of who we are. We've got to make college more affordable for more young people. We can't put the middle class at a disadvantage. We can't price out folks who are trying to make sure that they not only succeed for themselves, but help the country succeed. We can't price the middle class out of a college education. Not when&mdash;we can't do it, especially when most new jobs in America will require more than a high school diploma. Higher education&mdash;whether it's at a 4-year institution or a 2-year program at a community college&mdash;it can't be a luxury. It's an economic imperative every family in America should be able to afford. <p>And before I came out here, I had a chance to meet not just with Blake, but with a number of other students, and we had a little roundtable. And the stories they told me were so familiar. One young man&mdash;single mom, she had lost her job. He was already about $30,000 in debt. He was only halfway through here at University of Iowa. Another young woman, her dad had been laid off at Maytag. They were trying to figure out how to make ends meet. She's about to graduate. <p>Now, what I told them is, you're making the right decision, because over the lifetime of earnings you will more than earn back this investment you're making. But making it more affordable would sure help. It would sure help. <p>Now, I'm going to have a specific request for you. I'm going to need your help, Iowa, but let me briefly tell you what we've already done to try to make college more affordable, because I'm not just interested in talking the talk, I want to walk the walk. <p>So before I took office, we had a student loan system where tens of billions of taxpayer dollars were going to banks who were the middlemen on the Federal student loan program. So they were getting billions of dollars in profits managing a loan program where they had no risk because it was all federally guaranteed loans. So we changed that. <p>And there were folks in Washington who fought tooth and nail to protect the status quo. One of them said it would be \\"an outrage\\" to change the system where banks are managing this thing. But the real outrage was letting them serve as middlemen and siphon off profits, while students were working two or three jobs just to get by. So we kept at it, and we fought, and we fought, and today, we don't have middlemen. That money is going directly where it should have been to&mdash;the first place. It's going to help more young people afford college. <p>And then last fall, I acted to cap student loan payments faster, so that nearly 1.6 million students who make their payments on time only have to pay 10 percent of their monthly income toward loans once they graduate, which means if you decide to become a teacher or a social worker or a guidance counselor, something that doesn't pay a lot of money, you can still afford to do it because you'll never have to pay more than 10 percent of your income in order to stay current on your loan. <p>And then we decided, you know what, you guys need more information about this whole process. We want to have student&mdash;we want students to have a&mdash;access to a simple fact sheet on student loans and financial aid so you can have all the information you need to make your own choices about how to pay for college. So some of you know we set up this new Consumer Finance Protection Bureau to look out for consumers, and so they're now putting out a fact sheet called \\"Know Before You Owe.\\" \\"Know Before You Owe,\\" which is something Michelle and I could have used when we were in your shoes. <p>And then what we said was it's not enough just to increase student aid. We've also got to stop subsidizing skyrocketing tuition, or we'll run out of money. So the schools themselves have to keep their tuition lower. So we've challenged&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;so we've put out the challenge to colleges and universities. And I've told Congress, steer Federal aid to those schools that are doing a good job keeping tuition affordable and providing good value and serving their students well. And we've put colleges on notice: If you can't stop tuition from skyrocketing, the funding you get from taxpayers is going to go down. We're going to put money into the schools that are doing a better job. And we're going to hold schools accountable. <p>Of course, as public universities like this one know, States and State legislators also have to do their part by making higher education a higher priority in their budgets. Last year, over 40 States cut their higher education spending. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> Yes, that's not good. [<i>Laughter</i>] These budget cuts are one of the biggest reasons why tuition goes up at public colleges and have been over the last decade. So we're challenging States: Take responsibility. If you can find new ways to bring down costs on college, make it easier for students to graduate, then we'll help you do it at the Federal level. <p>So that's what we've already done: helped more families, more young people afford a higher education, offer incentives to States and colleges and universities to keep costs down. That's what we've been doing. Now comes the tricky part: We got to get Congress to do their part. And that's where you come in. <p>There are a couple of things I'd like Congress to be doing this year. First, they need to extend the tuition tax credit that we put in place when I first came into office, because it's saving middle class families thousands of dollars. They get a tax break when they are helping their kids go to college. That's important. <p>Second, we need Congress to safeguard aid for low-income students so that today's freshmen and sophomores know they're going to be able to count on it. We've got to make sure the Pell grants are there for people who need them. <p>Number three, we've got to give more young people the chance to earn their way through college by doubling the number of work-study jobs over the next 5 years. That's an achievable goal. <p>And then most immediately&mdash;and this is where I really need you guys&mdash;Congress needs to act right now to prevent interest rates on Federal student loans from shooting up and shaking you down. That's where you come in. <p>You see, 5 years ago, Congress cut the rates on Federal student loans in half. That was a good thing to do. But on July 1 of this year, which means about 2 months from now, that rate cut will expire. And if it expires, interest rates on these loans will double overnight. And for each year that Congress doesn't act, the average student with these loans will rack up an additional thousand dollars in debt. That's basically a thousand-dollar tax hike on more than 7 million students around America, including 250,000 students right here in Iowa. <p>Now, let me see if&mdash;I'll do a quick poll. This may be unscientific. How many people can afford to pay an extra thousand dollars right now? <p><i>Audience members.</i> No! <p><i>The President.</i> [<i>Laughter</i>] I don't think so. Stopping this from happening should be a no-brainer. <p>[<i>At this point, the President coughed.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> It makes me sick just thinking about it. [<i>Laughter</i>] Helping more young people afford college should be at the forefront of America's agenda. And it shouldn't be a Republican or Democratic issue. This is an American issue. The Stafford loans we're talking about were named after a Republican Senator; Pell grants named after a Democratic Senator. When Congress cut these rates 5 years ago, a majority of Democrats voted for it, but 77 Republicans in the House of Representatives voted for it too. <p>Now, the good news is, the Senate introduced a bill last night that would keep student loan rates from doubling. That's the good news. And what's also good news is some Republican Senators look like they might support it. And I'm ready to work with them to make it happen. That's good. <p>But I've got to tell you, the Republicans who run the House of Representatives have not yet said whether or not they'll stop your rates from doubling. And they've hinted that the only way they'd do it is if they cut things like aid for low-income students. So let me scratch my head there for a second. Think about that. We're going to help some students by messing with other students. That's not a good answer. How many people think that's a good answer? <p><i>Audience members.</i> No! <p><i>The President.</i> No, I didn't think so. One of these Members of Congress&mdash;I&mdash;you know, sometimes I like just getting these quotes, because I'm always interested in how folks talk about this issue. You've got one Member of Congress who compared these student loans&mdash;I'm not kidding here&mdash;to a \\"stage-three cancer of socialism.\\" <p>Stage-three cancer? [<i>Laughter</i>] I don't know where to start. What do you mean? [<i>Laughter</i>] What are you talking about? Come on. Just when you think you've heard it all in Washington, somebody comes up with a new way to go off the deep end. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And then you've got the spokesman for the Speaker of the House who says, we're&mdash;meaning me, my administration&mdash;we're just talking about student loans to distract people from the economy. Now, think about that for a second. Because these guys don't get it. This is the economy. This is the economy. This is about your job security. This is about your future. If you do well, the economy does well. This is about the economy. <p>What economy are they talking about? You are the economy. If you've got skills, if you've got talents, if you're starting a business, if companies are locating here in Iowa because it's got a well-trained workforce, that's the economy. That's how we're going to compete. Making sure our next generation earns the best education possible is exactly America's business. Making sure that education is available to everybody and not just the few, that is America's business. Our future depends on it. <p>And then some of them suggest that students like you have to pay more so we can help bring down the deficit. Now, think about that. These are the same folks who ran up the deficits for the last decade. They voted to keep giving billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies to big oil companies who are raking in record profits. They voted to let millionaires and billionaires keep paying lower taxes than middle class workers. They voted to give folks like me, the wealthiest Americans, an average tax cut of at least $150,000, and that tax cut would be paid for by cutting things like education and job training programs that give students and workers opportunities to get what they need to succeed. <p>Now, does that make any sense? Does that some&mdash;sound like folks who are really concerned with the deficit? <p><i>Audience members.</i> No! <p><i>The President. </i>How can we want to maintain tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans who don't need them and weren't even asking for them? I don't need one. I needed help back when I was your age. I don't need help now. I don't need an extra thousand dollars or few thousand dollars. You do. <p>We need to make sure everybody pays their fair share. How can we continue to subsidize an oil industry that's making record profits instead of investing in things like clean energy that will help shape our future? Do we want to jack up interest rates on millions of students? Or do we want to keep investing in the things that help us in the long term, things like education and science and a strong military and care for our veterans? Because we can't have it both ways. We can't do all things on the cheap. <p>And one thing I want to be clear about, because when I talk like this, sometimes the other side, they get all hot and bothered, and they say, he's getting&mdash;he's engaging in class warfare. This isn't about class warfare. We want every American to succeed. That's the point. We&mdash;I want all of you to be rich. I want all of you to be successful. We aspire to it. That's what Americans do. We work and we hustle and we study and we take risks to succeed. And we don't expect a handout. But we also understand we're in this thing together, and America is not about just a few people doing well, it's about everybody having a chance to do well. That's what the American Dream is all about. <p>You look at this auditorium, everybody who's here, you're here because somebody made a commitment to you. First, your parents. But it wasn't just your parents. It was the folks who decided, you know what, we're going to set up a public university. It was the folks who made a decision early on in this Republic that said we believe that all men are created equal, that everybody is endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights. Those were commitments that were made by previous generations to future generations. <p>So somebody here had a parent or a grandparent who said, maybe I can't go to college, but some day my son can. Maybe I can't start my own business, but someday I can picture my daughter starting her own business. Maybe I'm an immigrant, but I believe that this is the country, this is the place where no matter who you are, no matter what you look like, no matter where you come from, no matter what your last name is, you can make it if you try. That's what we believe. <p>That is what we believe. You and me, all of us, we're only here because someone, somewhere, felt a responsibility not just to themselves, but to this country's future. And now it's our turn to be responsible. Now it's our turn to keep that promise alive. That's where I need your help. <p>I'm asking everybody here, anybody who's watching, anybody who's following online, send your Member of Congress a message. Tell them you're not going to set your sights lower. Tell them you're not going to settle for something less. Call them, e-mail them, write on their Facebook page, tweet. [<i>Laughter</i>] We've got a hashtag: \\"dontdoublemyrate\\"&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;\\"dontdoublemyrate\\"&mdash;\\"dontdoublemyrate.\\" <p>We asked students at North Carolina, then at University of Colorado, to do this yesterday. They got it trending worldwide for a while. Let's see if you guys can do even better. See how the Hawkeyes can do. Because we've got to keep the heat on Congress until this gets done. And I need your help to do it. I need you to be heard. I need you to be counted. <p>Now is not the time to double the interest rates on our student loans. Now is not the time to double interest rates. Now is the time to double down on starting investments that build a strong and secure middle class. Now is the time to double down on building an America that's built to last. <p>If we work together, with clear eyes and a common purpose, I guarantee you we'll meet our challenges. We will rise to this moment. And the reason I know that is because I believe in you. I believe in you. And it's because of you that we will remind everybody just why it is that this is the greatest nation on Earth. <p>Thank you, Iowa. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"102" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Boulder! How's it going, Buffaloes? Well, you guys are just happy because school is almost out, isn't it? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Please give Daniel a big round of applause for that great introduction. I just saw Daniel over at The Sink. I bought some pizza, and I heard a rumor that Robert Redford used to work there. <p>So that's just a sign. Always be nice to your server because you never know where they'll end up. [<i>Laughter</i>] I will say that I was shaking hands with folks outside, and a young woman, she got very excited and spilled yogurt on me. [<i>Laughter</i>] More hazardously, she spilled yogurt on the Secret Service, which you just&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;the agent just stood there, just looking at her. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to thank the chancellor of UC-Boulder, Phil DiStefano. Give him a big round of applause for having me here today. We've got the Lieutenant Governor of Colorado, Joe Garcia, in the house. And I want to thank you for being indoors when it is gorgeous outside. <p>Now, I've just come from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I was talking to another good-looking group of students. Jimmy Fallon and I taped his show there. Tonight, make sure to tune in. [<i>Laughter</i>] But we saved the primetime event for Boulder. <p>And I've come here to talk to you about what most of you are focused on every day, at least you're supposed to be, and that is studying and college. Look, college isn't just the best investment you can make in your future. It is the best investment that you can make in your country's future. I believe that. <p>And by the way, I just want to say, all of you who have seats, feel free to sit down, because it's hot in here, and I don't want folks dropping off. [<i>Laughter</i>] There you go, make yourself comfortable, take a load off. <p>So I'm proud of all of you for doing what it takes to make this investment in a college education because it has never been more important. In today's economy, there's no greater predictor of individual success than a good education. Right now, the unemployment rate for Americans with a college degree or more is about half the national average. Their incomes are twice as high as those who don't have a high school diploma. Higher education, whether it's a 4-year college or 2 years at a community college, it's the clearest path we've got to the middle class. <p>Now, I know that those of you who are about to graduate&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. You're pretty cheerful about that. I know those of you who are about to graduate sometimes are wondering what's in store for your future. Because not even 4 years ago, just as the global economy was about to enter into freefall, you were still trying to find your way around campus. And today, our economy is recovering, but it's not yet fully recovered from the worst financial crisis and economic crisis that we've experienced since the Great Depression. <p>Our businesses have added more than 4 million jobs over the past 2 years. But there are still too many Americans who are out there looking for a job or trying to figure out how to pay the bills and cover the mortgage. There are too many folks who still lack the basic security that has always been at the heart of the American promise, but has been slipping away for more than a decade now, even before the recession hit. <p>But here's the thing. I want all of you to know that the degree you earn from Colorado is going to be the best tool that you've got to achieve the American promise, by far. That basic idea that if you work hard&mdash;no matter where you come from, no matter what you look like, no matter what the circumstances of your birth&mdash;if you work hard, you can do well enough to raise a family and own a home, send your own kids to college, put a little bit away for retirement, that idea that each generation has a little more opportunity than the last. <p>I can tell you that now as a parent. When I look at Malia and Sasha&mdash;sometimes I coach Sasha's basketball games, and if she scores a basket, I am so excited compared to when I used to score a basket. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's the hope that all your parents have for you, that your own kids will surpass you, that they're going to be able to shine as bright as they can imagine. And that's the dream that your parents have for you. And keeping that promise alive, that's the defining issue of our time. <p><i>Audience member.</i> We believe in you! <p><i>The President.</i> I believe in you. <p>And I don't want this to be a country where a shrinking number of Americans are doing really, really well while a growing number are struggling to get by. That's not the future I want for you. That's not the future I want for my daughters. I want this forever to be a country where everybody gets a fair shot, everybody is doing their fair share, everybody plays by the same set of rules. That's the America I know. That's the America I love. <p>It's a big and bold and generous America. It's not a cramped America. It's not an America that says, set your sights lower. And that's the America that's within our reach. <p>I think back sometimes to my own circumstances. My grandfather had the chance to go to college because this country decided that every returning veteran of World War II should be able to go to school. And then my mother was able to raise two kids by herself while she was going to school because she was able to get grants and work her way through school. And then I'm only standing here today, and Michelle is only where she is today, because scholarships and student loans gave us a shot at a great education. <p>We didn't come from well-to-do backgrounds. We didn't have famous families. But it wasn't just that we worked hard. It was also that somebody made an investment in us. That's what America did for us. <p>This country has always made a commitment to put a good education within the reach of everybody. Everybody who's willing to work for it, we've said, you know what, you've got a shot. That's what makes us special; that's what makes us exceptional. That's what kept us at the forefront of business and science and technology and medicine. And that's the commitment that we've got to reaffirm today. That's what we believe in. <p>But I don't need to tell all of you that it's gotten harder. Since most of you were born, tuition and fees at American colleges have more than doubled. And that forces students like you to take out more loans and rack up more debt. The average student who borrows to pay for college now, graduates about $25,000 in student loan debt&mdash;not good. Americans now owe more on their student loans than they do on their credit cards. <p>And living with that kind of debt means some pretty tough choices when you're first starting out. It means putting off buying your first house. Or it means maybe you can't start up that business right away that you've got this great idea for. <p>When I was over at The Sink, I was talking to three business majors, and they all had these business ideas. But it's tougher if you've got all this loan that you're already thinking about the minute you get out of school. Maybe you've got to start a family a little bit later. It takes you a longer time to save for retirement. And when a big chunk of every paycheck goes towards loan debt, that's not just tough on you, it's not just tough on your families. It's painful for the whole economy because that's money that could be going into the economy and could be going into new businesses and could be helping businesses grow. <p>And I want to point out: Listen, I know about this firsthand. Michelle and I, we know about this firsthand. This is not something I read in a briefing book. [<i>Laughter</i>] This is not some abstract idea for us. We've been in your shoes. When we graduated from college and law school, we had a mountain of debt, both of us. That means when we got married, we got poorer together. We added our assets together, and they were zero. And then we added our liabilities together, and they were a lot. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We paid more for our student loans than we paid for our mortgage each month when we first bought our small condo in Chicago. And we were lucky to land good jobs with a steady income, but we only finished paying off our student loans about 8 years ago. Think about that. I'm the President of the United States, and so&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;so here I am, and we were writing those checks every month. And that wasn't easy, especially when we had Malia and Sasha, because at that point, we're supposed to be saving for their college educations, and we're still paying off our&mdash;on our college educations. So I've been in your shoes. I know what I am talking about here. This is not something that I just read about. <p>So we've got to make college more affordable for you. We cannot price the middle class out of a college education. When most new jobs in America require more than a high school diploma, higher education&mdash;whether at a 4-year college, at a 2-year program&mdash;it can't be a luxury. It's an economic imperative for every family in America. And every family in America should be able to afford it. As long as those young people are willing to put in the work, as long as you're willing to study hard and take advantage of this opportunity, then we've got to make sure it's there for you. <p>So&mdash;now, I'm going to be asking for your help, but let me tell you what I've already done on this issue, Colorado, because I think it's important to know that we haven't just been talking the talk. We've been walking the walk to try to help make college more affordable. <p>Before I took office, we had a student loan system where tens of billions of taxpayer dollars were going to subsidize banks in the student loan program instead of going to students. So we changed it. We cut out the middleman. We said, why do we need the banks? They're not taking a risk. These are federally guaranteed loans. Let's give the money directly to students. <p>And I have to tell you, there were folks in Washington who fought us tooth and nail because they want to protect the status quo. One of them, when they heard that we wanted to take this business away from the banks, they said, this is \\"an outrage.\\" But the real outrage was letting these banks keep these subsidies while students were working two or three jobs just to try to pay tuition. So we kept at it, and we kept at it, and we won that fight. And today, that money is going directly to where it should have been going in the first place, and that's helping millions of young people afford a college education. <p>And then last fall, I acted to cap student loan payments faster, so that nearly 1.6 million students who make their payments on time, they have the option of only paying 10 percent of their monthly income towards loans once they graduate. And that means if you decide to be a teacher or you decide to be a social worker or you're going into a profession that doesn't pay a lot of money, you still have that option because you know that your monthly payment will be manageable. And we want&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. And that's important. <p>And then we decided we've got to make sure every student has access to a simple fact sheet on student loans and financial aid so you can have all the information you need to make intelligent choices on your own about how to pay for college. So some of you know we created this new Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. It's a watchdog for consumers. And one of their mandates is to focus on student loans. And so they've produced a web site and fact sheets called \\"Know Before You Owe\\"&mdash;\\"Know Before You Owe\\"&mdash;which is something I wish Michelle and I knew about, wish we had had. <p>So we've done those steps to help provide you good information and to make sure that we've expanded access to Pell grants and student loans, but that's not enough. It's not enough just to increase student aid. We can't keep on subsidizing skyrocketing tuition, or we're just going to run out of money. We'll just run out of money. <p>So what I said to colleges and universities is, you got to get&mdash;you guys have to do your parts to keep costs down. And I've told Congress, steer Federal aid to those schools that keep tuition affordable and provide good value and serve their students well. We've put colleges on notice: If you can't show us that you're making every effort to keep tuition from going up, then funding from taxpayers will go down. You've got to make an effort. We've got to hold colleges accountable if they don't. <p>Of course, public universities like this one also understand that States have to do their part, State legislators have to do their part in making higher education a priority. Last year, over 40 States cut their higher education spending&mdash;not good. These budget cuts have been one of the biggest factors in your tuition going up. So we're challenging States to take responsibility. We told them, if you can bring&mdash;find new ways to bring down costs of college, make it easier for students to graduate, we'll help you do it. <p>So that's what we've already done. We've helped families, helped more young people afford a higher education. We're offering incentives to States and colleges and universities to keep costs down. And now, guess what: Congress has to do their part; Congress has to do their part. <p>They need to extend the tuition tax credit that we put in place when I first came into office that saves middle class families thousands of dollars. They need to safeguard aid for low-income students so that today's freshmen and sophomores know they're going to be able to count on it. Our Pell grants have to be there for students. They need to give more young people the chance to earn your way through college by doubling the number of work-study jobs over the next 5 years. And then there's something that they've got to do right now. They have to prevent the interest rates on Federal student loans from shooting up and shaking you down. And that's where you come in. <p>All right. Now, 5 years ago, Congress cut the rates on Federal student loans in half. That's 5 years ago&mdash;not the current Congress&mdash;Congress 5 years ago. [<i>Laughter</i>] On July 1 of this year, 2 months from now, that rate cut expires. I want everybody to understand this. Interest rates on those loans will double overnight, starting on July 1, if Congress does not act. And for each year that Congress does not act, the average student with these loans is going to rack up an additional $1,000 in debt. So this is money out of your pocket. It's basically a $1,000 tax hike for more than 7 million students across America, almost 170,000 students here in Colorado alone. <p>Now, I just want to see a show of hands because I want to make sure I'm not misinformed here. How many of you can afford to pay an extra $1,000 right now? I didn't think so. So stopping this should be a no-brainer. Helping more of our young people afford college should be at the forefront of America's agenda. It shouldn't be a Democratic or a Republican issue. Think about it: This wasn't a partisan issue in the past. The Stafford loans, that's named after a Republican Senator. Pell grants, they're named after a Democratic Senator. <p>When&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> America! <p><i>The President.</i> America. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's what we're supposed to be thinking about. <p>Look, when Congress cut these rates 5 years ago, 77 Republicans in the House of Representatives voted for it. Of course, a couple hundred Democrats voted for it, but that's okay. It was a bipartisan effort. Today, you've got Republicans who run for Congress, and they're not saying whether or not they're going to stop your rates from doubling. Some have hinted that they'd only do it if we cut things like aid for low-income students instead. So think about this. They'll say, we'll keep your rates low as long as we're messing with folks who need them even more. Does that make sense to you? <p><i>Audience members.</i> No! <p>I want to read a quote. This is from a Republican Congresswoman. I didn't really understand this. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm quoting her. She said, \\"very\\"&mdash;she said that she has \\"very little tolerance for people who tell me they graduate with debt . . . because there's no reason for that.\\" She said, students who rack up student loan debt are just sitting on their butts, having opportunity \\"dumped in your lap.\\" <p>You guys can Google her or what have you, but&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;now, think about that, think about that. I can tell you, Michelle and I, we didn't take out loans because we were lazy. You didn't take out loans because you're lazy. You don't take out loans lightly. You don't say to yourself, \\"Man, this is great. I'm going to be really in debt. I'm thrilled.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] You did it because the cost of college kept on going up, and you're trying to graduate. <p>And if these guys were serious about making college more affordable, then they wouldn't be voting to cut financial aid in&mdash;their budget, if you look at their budget, what it means is you're going to be cutting aid for 10 million college students by an average of more than 10&mdash;more than $1,000. They certainly wouldn't let student rates double overnight if they really cared about this issue. <p>They say that, well, we've got to do it because we've got to bring down the deficit. Now, first of all, these guys ran up the deficit. Remember, these are the same folks who voted in favor of two wars without paying for it and big tax cuts without paying for it. They just voted to keep billions of dollars of taxpayer subsidies to big oil companies who are raking in record profits. They just voted to let millionaires and billionaires keep paying low tax rates, lower tax rates than middle class workers. They just voted to give an average tax cut of at least $150,000 to the wealthiest Americans, folks like me who don't need it, weren't asking for it. And the way they pay for it is to cut things like education and job training that give students opportunities to work and succeed. So they can't be too serious about deficits. <p>I mean, do we want to keep tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans who don't need them, didn't ask for them? The country can't afford it. Or do we want to make sure that everybody pays their fair share and make sure that young people are able to afford to go to college? <p>Do we want to keep giving taxpayer giveaways to big oil or do we want to invest in clean energy? And do we want to make sure that we're rebuilding this country, and make sure that we can keep interest rates on millions of students affordable? We need to be investing in the things that build America over the long term&mdash;things like education and science and caring for our veterans and a strong military. And we can't have it both ways. We've got to make choices. <p>In America, we admire success. We aspire to it. I want everybody here to do great, be rich, go out, start a business. That's wonderful&mdash;we work and we hustle. You study hard to get your degree because you believe in success and individual initiative. But America is not just about a few people doing well. America is about everybody having the chance to do well. That's what the American Dream is all about. <p>Some of us had parents or grandparents who said: Maybe I can't go to college, but some day my son can go to college; maybe I can't start my own business, but some day my daughter, she can start her own business. Maybe I'm an immigrant and I won't have every opportunity, but I believe that in this country, in this place&mdash;this is a place where no matter who you are or what you look like or where you come from or what your last name is, you can make it if you try. That's what America is about. That's who we are. That's who we are. <p>So let me just be clear here. We need to send a message to folks who don't seem to get this&mdash;that setting your sights lower, that's not an education plan. You're on your own, that's not an economic plan. We can't just cut our way to prosperity. <p>Earlier generations made investments necessary to build a strong middle class. Somebody started this university. Somebody gave us a chance. Somebody made the investment in us, because they helped to forge America's leadership in things like science and technology and manufacturing. That's what previous generations did, and now it's our turn. Somebody here might be discovering the cure for cancer. Somebody here might be getting the formula for fusion. Somebody here might be inventing the next great American industry. But that's only going to happen if we understand that we're in this together. <p>And that's why I need your help. I'm asking everybody who's here and anybody who's watching, anybody who's following online, you need to send a message to your Member of Congress. Tell them you're not going to set your sights lower. Tell them you're not going to settle for something less. You call them, you e-mail them, you write on their Facebook page, tweet. [<i>Laughter</i>] We've got, actually, a hashtag that I want everybody to use: \\"dontdoublemyrate.\\" It's pretty&mdash;everybody, I want you to repeat that. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Don't double my rate. <p><i>The President.</i> Don't double my rate. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Don't double my rate. <p><i>The President.</i> I asked students at North Carolina to do this earlier today, and they got it trending worldwide for a while. So let's see if you can do better, because we've got to keep the heat on. Your voice matters. You've got to stand up. You've got to be heard. You've got to be counted. You've got to tell them now is not the time to double your interest rates on student loans. Now is the time to double down on the investments in a strong and a secure middle class, and double down on an America that's built to last. <p>You, me, all of us, we're here because somebody, somewhere&mdash;starting with our parents or our grandparents or our great-grandparents&mdash;they made an investment not just in themselves, but in each other and in the future of our country. And now it's our turn. It's our turn to keep that promise alive. <p>And that's what drives me every single day. I used to&mdash;when I was running for this office, I said to people: Look, I will not be a perfect man or a perfect President, but here's what I can do. I can work every single day as hard as I know how to make sure that you've got a chance, to make sure you can live out your hopes and your dreams. And I'm not about to quit now. We don't give up here in America. We get up. We get each other's back. We help each other get ahead. We work together. <p>And if you all are willing to join me, I guarantee you not only will we stop these interest rates from going up, but we're going to remind the rest of the world just why it is that America is the greatest nation on Earth. <p>God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"103" "\"Thank you. Hello, Fort Stewart! It is good to be here at Fort Stewart. First of all, how about the First Lady, Michelle Obama? Hooah! She is a tough act to follow. For the gentlemen out there who are not yet married, let me just explain to you, your goal is to improve your gene pool by marrying somebody who is superior to you. Isn't that right, General? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Listen, and as you just heard, when it comes to all of you&mdash;when it comes to our military, our veterans, your families&mdash;Michelle Obama and Jill Biden have your back. They are working tirelessly to make sure that our military families are treated with the honor and respect and support that they deserve. And I could not be prouder of all the efforts that they've been making on their behalf. <p>It's a privilege to hang out with some of America's finest. The \\"Dog Face Soldiers\\" of the 3d Infantry Division! Rock of the Marne! We've got a lot of folks in the house. We've got the Raider Brigade! We've got the Spartan Brigade! We've got the Vanguard Brigade! We've got the Provider Brigade! And we've got the Falcon Brigade! <p>Let me thank Major General Abrams and his beautiful wife Connie, for welcoming us. Abe is doing an incredible job carrying on his family's incredible tradition of service to our country. So we are grateful for him. Give him a big round of applause. I want to thank Command Sergeant Major Edd Watson and his beautiful wife Sharon. <p>I want to thank someone who's made it her life's mission to stand up for the financial security of you and your families, somebody who knows a little bit about military families and military service. And actually, this is a homecoming for her because she spent over 3 years when they were posted down here&mdash;Holly Petraeus is in the house. I want you guys to give her a big round of applause. <p>But most importantly, I want to thank all of you. I want to thank you for your service. I want to thank you for your sacrifice. I want to thank you for your unshakeable commitment to our country. You have worn the uniform with honor. You've performed heroically in some of the most dangerous places on Earth. You have done everything that has been asked of you, and more. And you have earned a special place in our Nation's history. <p>Future generations will speak of your achievements. They'll speak of how the 3d Infantry Division's \\"thunder run\\" into Baghdad signaled the end of a dictatorship and how you brought Iraq back from the brink of civil war. They'll speak of you and your service in Afghanistan and in the fight against Al Qaida, which you have put on the path to defeat. <p>And to the members of the Special Operations Forces community, while the American people may never know the full extent of your service, they will surely speak of how you kept our country safe and strong and how you delivered justice to our enemies. <p>So history will remember what you did, and so will we. We will remember the profound sacrifices that you've made in these wars. Michelle and I just had a few moments at the Warriors Walk, paying tribute to 441 of your fallen comrades, men and women who gave their last full measure of devotion to keep our Nation safe. And we will remember them. We will honor them, always. And our thoughts and prayers also go out to the troops from Fort Stewart who are serving so bravely right now as we speak in Afghanistan. And I know many of you will be deploying there too, so you know you're going to be in our thoughts and prayers. <p>Your generation&mdash;the 9/11 generation&mdash;has written one of the greatest chapters of military service that America has ever seen. But I know that for many of you, a new chapter is unfolding. The war in Iraq is over. The transition in Afghanistan is underway. Many of our troops are coming home, back to civilian life. And as you return, I know that you're looking for new jobs and new opportunities and new ways to serve this great country of ours. <p>And 3 years ago, I made your generation a promise: I said that when your tour comes to an end&mdash;when you see our flag, when you touch down on our soil&mdash;you'll be coming home to an America that will forever fight for you, just as you fought for us. <p>For me, as President, it's been a top priority. It's something I worked on as a Senator, when I served on the Veterans Affairs Committee. It's something I continue to this day. Since I took office, we've hired over 200,000 veterans to serve in the Federal Government. <p>We've made it easier for veterans to access all sorts of employment services. You just heard how Michelle and Jill have worked with businesses to secure tens of thousands of jobs for veterans and their families. And with support from Democrats and Republicans, we've put in place new tax credits for companies that hire veterans. We want every veteran who wants a job to get a job. That's the goal. <p>And those of you who want to pursue a higher education and earn new skills, you deserve that opportunity as well. <p>Like General Abrams's dad, my grandfather&mdash;the man who helped raise me&mdash;served in Patton's army. And when he came home, he went to school on the GI bill, because America decided that every returning veteran of World War II should be able to afford it. And we owe that same commitment to all of you. <p>So as President, I've made sure to champion the post-9/11 GI bill. And with that bill and the tuition assistance program, last year we supported more than 550,000 veterans and 325,000 servicemembers who are pursuing a higher education. Because a higher education is the clearest path to the middle class. Now that's progress, but we've got more to do. We can't be satisfied with what we've already done, we've got more to do. We've got to make sure you've got every tool you need to make an informed decision when it comes to picking a school. And that's why Michelle and I are here today. <p>Right now it's not that easy. I've heard the stories. Some of you guys can relate; you may have experienced it yourselves. You go online to try and find the best school for military members or your spouses or other family members. You end up on a web site that looks official. They ask you for your e-mail, they ask you for your phone number. They promise to link you up with a program that fits your goals. Almost immediately after you've typed in all that information, your phone starts ringing. Your inbox starts filling up. You've never been more popular in your life. All of these schools want you to enroll with them. <p>And it sounds good. Every school and every business should be out there competing for your skills and your talent and your leadership, everything that you've shown in uniform. But as some of your comrades have discovered, sometimes you're dealing with folks who aren't interested in helping you. They're not interested in helping you find the best program. They are interested in getting the money. They don't care about you; they care about the cash. <p>So they harass you into making a quick decision with all those calls and emails. And if they can't get you online, they show up on post. One of the worst examples of this is a college recruiter who had the nerve to visit a barracks at Camp Lejeune and enroll marines with brain injuries just for the money. These marines had injuries so severe some of them couldn't recall what courses the recruiter had signed them up for. That's appalling. That's disgraceful. It should never happen in America. <p>I'm not talking about all schools. Many of them&mdash;for-profit and nonprofit&mdash;provide quality education to our servicemembers and our veterans and their families. But there are some bad actors out there. They'll say you don't have to pay a dime for your degree, but once you register, they'll suddenly make you sign up for a high interest student loan. They'll say that if you transfer schools, you can transfer credits. But when you try to actually do that, you suddenly find out that you can't. They'll say they've got a job placement program when in fact, they don't. It's not right. They're trying to swindle and hoodwink you. And today, here at Fort Stewart, we're going to put an end to it. We're putting an end to it. <p>The Executive order I'm about to sign will make life a whole lot more secure for you and your families and our veterans and a whole lot tougher for those who try to prey on you. Here's what we're going to do. <p>First, we're going to require colleges that want to enroll members of our military or veterans or your families to provide clear information about their qualifications and available financial aid. You'll be able to get a simple fact sheet called \\"Know Before You Owe\\"&mdash;\\"Know Before You Owe.\\" And it will lay out all the information that you need to make your own choices about how best to pay for college. <p>Second, we're going to require those schools to step up their support for our students. They need to provide a lot more counseling. If you've got to move because of a deployment or a reassignment, they've got to help you come up with a plan so that you can still get your degree. <p>Number three&mdash;&mdash; <p>[<i>At this point, the President sneezed.</i>] <p>Excuse me. Number three&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>Number three, we're going to bring an end to the aggressive and sometimes dishonest recruiting that takes place. We're going to up our oversight of improper recruitment practices. We're going to strengthen the rules about who can come on post and talk to servicemembers. And we're going to make it a lot easier for all of you to file complaints and for us to take action when somebody is not acting right. <p>This is about making sure you succeed, because when you succeed, our country succeeds. It's that simple. After all, at the end of World War II, so many Americans like my grandfather came home to new opportunities. Because of the original GI bill, by 1947, half of all Americans who enrolled in college were veterans. And you know what, they did pretty well. <p>They rose to become Presidents and Supreme Court Justices and Nobel Prize winners. They went on to become scientists and engineers and doctors and nurses. Eight million Americans were educated under the original GI bill. And together, they forged the backbone of what would become the largest middle class that the world had ever seen. They built this country. They turned us into that economic superpower. <p>And we can do it again. We've faced tough times: gone through the worst recession since the Great Depression, two wars. But you know what, we've faced tough times before. And all of you know something that America should never forget: Just as you rise or fall as one unit, we rise or fall as one Nation. Just as you have each other's backs, what has always made America great is that we have each other's backs. Each of us is only here because somebody looked out for us. Not just our parents, but our neighbors and our communities and our houses of worship and our VFW halls. Each of us is here because we had a country that was willing to invest in things like community colleges and universities and scientific research and medicine and caring for our veterans. Each of us is only here because somebody, somewhere, had our backs. <p>This country exists because generations of Americans worked together and looked out for one other. Out of many, we are one. Those are the values we've got to return to. If we do, there's nothing this country cannot achieve. There's no challenge that's too great for us. There's no destiny beyond our reach. As long as we're joined in common purpose and common resolve, better days will always lie ahead, and we will remind everybody why the United States of America is the greatest country on Earth. <p>And as I look out at this sea of incredible men and women, it gives me confidence that our best days are still ahead. <p>God bless you. God bless our Armed Services. God bless the Third Division. God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. <p>And now I'm going to sign this Executive order.\" "
"104" "\"On Friday, I traveled to Fort Stewart in Georgia to meet with soldiers from the 3d Infantry Division. <p>These men and women have fought with bravery and honor in some of the most dangerous places on the planet. Some of them didn't make it back. But those who did are now fighting a different kind of battle here at home. They're looking for new jobs, new opportunities, and new ways to serve. <p>For many, that means going back to school, and America has a long tradition of making sure our veterans and our men and women in uniform can afford to do that. After World War II, we helped a generation of Americans, including my grandfather, to go to school on the GI bill. Now, thanks to the 9/11 GI bill and the tuition assistance program, last year, we supported more than half a million veterans and over 300,000 servicemembers who are pursuing a higher education. <p>And that's progress. But it's not enough to just help our veterans and servicemembers afford school. We need to make sure they have all the tools they need to make an informed decision when it comes to picking the right program. <p>The sad truth is, is that there are people out there who are less interested in helping our men and women in uniform get ahead and more interested in making a buck. They bombard potential students with e-mails and pressure them into making a quick decision. Some of them steer recruits towards high-interest loans and mislead them about credit transfers and job placement programs. One of the worst examples was a college recruiter who visited a marine barracks and enrolled marines with brain injuries so severe that some of them couldn't recall what courses the recruiter had signed them up for. <p>That's appalling. It's disgraceful. And even though the vast majority of schools do the right thing, we need to guard against the bad actors who don't. <p>That's why, on Friday, I signed an Executive order making life a whole lot more secure for our servicemembers, veterans, and their families, and a whole lot tougher for anyone who tries to prey on them. <p>We're making sure veterans and servicemembers get a simple fact sheet called \\"Know Before You Owe\\" that lays out all the information they need about financial aid and paying for college. We're requiring schools to offer counseling to help students finish their degree even if they have to move or deploy. And we're stepping up our efforts to fight dishonest recruiters by strengthening the rules about who can come on base and make it easier to file complaints. <p>When our men and women in uniform succeed, our country succeeds. They have our backs; now it's our turn to have theirs. And as long as I'm President, I'm going to make sure that anyone who serves this country gets every opportunity they deserve. <p>Thank you, and have a great weekend.\" "
"105" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. Good evening, everybody. Good evening. I could not be more thrilled to be here tonight&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;at the White House Correspondents' Dinner. This is a great crowd. They're already laughing. It's terrific. <p>Chuck Todd, love you, brother. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm delighted to see some of the cast members of \\"Glee\\" are here. [<i>Laughter</i>] And Jimmy Kimmel, it's an honor, man. [<i>Laughter</i>] What's so funny? <p>My fellow Americans, we gather during a historic anniversary. Last year at this time&mdash;in fact, on this very weekend&mdash;we finally delivered justice to one of the world's most notorious individuals. <p>[<i>At this point, a photo of Donald J. Trump, chairman and chief executive officer, Trump Organization, was shown.</i>] <p>Now, this year, we gather in the midst of a heated election season. And Axelrod tells me I should never miss a chance to reintroduce myself to the American people. So tonight this is how I'd like to begin: My name is Barack Obama. My mother was born in Kansas. My father was born in Kenya. And I was born, of course, in Hawaii. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>The President winked at the audience.</i>] <p>In 2009, I took office in the face of some enormous challenges. Now, some have said I blame too many problems on my predecessor, but let's not forget that's a practice that was initiated by George W. Bush. [<i>Laughter</i>] Since then, Congress and I have certainly had our differences; yet, I've tried to be civil, to not take any cheap shots. And that's why I want to especially thank all the Members who took a break from their exhausting schedule of not passing any laws to be here tonight. [<i>Laughter</i>] Let's give them a big round of applause. <p>Despite many obstacles, much has changed during my time in office. Four years ago, I was locked in a brutal primary battle with Hillary Clinton. Four years later, she won't stop drunk-texting me from Cartagena. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Four years ago, I was a Washington outsider. Four years later, I'm at this dinner. Four years ago, I looked like this. <p>[<i>A photo of the President during his 2008 election campaign was shown.</i>] <p>Today, I look like this. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>A recent photo of the President was shown.</i>] <p>And four years from now, I will look like this. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>A photo of actor Morgan Freeman was shown.</i>] <p>That's not even funny. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Anyway, it's great to be here this evening in the vast, magnificent Hilton ballroom, or what Mitt Romney would call a little fixer-upper. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, look at this party. We've got men in tuxes, women in gowns, fine wine, first-class entertainment. I was just relieved to learn this was not a GSA conference. [<i>Laughter</i>] Unbelievable. Not even the mindreader knew what they were thinking. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Of course, the White House Correspondents' dinner is known as the prom of Washington, DC, a term coined by political reporters who clearly never had the chance to go to an actual prom. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Our chaperone for the evening is Jimmy Kimmel, who is perfect for the job since most of tonight's audience is in his key demographic, people who fall asleep during \\"Nightline.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Jimmy got his start years ago on \\"The Man Show.\\" In Washington, that's what we call a congressional hearing on contraception. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And plenty of journalists are here tonight. I'd be remiss if I didn't congratulate the Huffington Post on their Pulitzer Prize. You deserve it, Arianna. There's no one else out there linking to the kinds of hard-hitting journalism that HuffPo is linking to every single day. [<i>Laughter</i>] Give them a round of applause. And you don't pay them. It's a great business model. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Even Sarah Palin is getting back into the game, guest hosting on \\"The Today Show,\\" which reminds me of an old saying: What's the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? A pit bull is delicious. [<i>Laughter</i>] A little soy sauce&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>Now, I know at this point many of you are expecting me to go after my likely opponent, Newt Gingrich. [<i>Laughter</i>] Newt, there's still time, man. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to attack any of the Republican candidates. Take Mitt Romney. He and I actually have a lot in common. We both think of our wives as our better halves, and polls show, to a alarmingly insulting extent, the American people agree. [<i>Laughter</i>] We also both have degrees from Harvard; I have one, he has two. What a snob. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Of course, we've also had our differences. Recently, his campaign criticized me for slow jamming the news with Jimmy Fallon. In fact, I understand Governor Romney was so incensed he asked his staff if he could get some equal time on \\"The Merv Griffin Show.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Still, I guess Governor Romney is feeling pretty good about things because he took a few hours off the other day to see \\"The Hunger Games.\\" Some of you have seen it. It's a movie about people who court wealthy sponsors and then brutally savage each other until only one contestant is left standing. I'm sure this was a really great change of pace for him. [<i>Laughter</i>] I have not seen \\"The Hunger Games,\\" not enough class warfare for me. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Of course, I know everybody is predicting a nasty election, and thankfully, we've all agreed that families are off limits. Dogs, however, are apparently fair game. [<i>Laughter</i>] And while both campaigns have had some fun with this, the other day I saw a new ad from one of these outside groups that, frankly, I think crossed the line. I know Governor Romney says he has no control over what his super PACs do, but can we show the ad real quick? <p>[A<i> video was shown.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> That's pretty rough&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but I can take it, because my stepfather always told me, it's a boy-eat-dog world out there. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, if I do win a second term as President, let me just say something to all the&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;let me just say something to all my conspiracy-oriented friends on the right who think I'm planning to unleash some secret agenda: You're absolutely right. [<i>Laughter</i>] So allow me to close with a quick preview of the secret agenda you can expect in a second Obama administration. <p>In my first term, I sang Al Green; in my second term, I'm going with Young Jeezy. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Yeah. <p><i>The President.</i> Michelle said \\"yeah.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] I sing that to her sometimes. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>In my first term, we ended the war in Iraq; in my second term, I will win the war on Christmas. [<i>Laughter</i>] In my first term, we repealed the policy known as \\"don't ask, don't tell\\"&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;wait, though; in my second term, we will replace it with a policy known as \\"it's raining men.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] In my first term, we passed health care reform; in my second term, I guess I'll pass it again. <p>I do want to end tonight on a slightly more serious note. Whoever takes the oath of office next January will face some great challenges, but he will also inherit traditions that make us greater than the challenges we face. And one of those traditions is represented here tonight: a free press that isn't afraid to ask questions, to examine, and to criticize. And in service of that mission, all of you make sacrifices. <p>Tonight we remember journalists such as Anthony Shadid and Marie Colvin, who made the ultimate sacrifice as they sought to shine a light on some of the most important stories of our time. So whether you are a blogger or a broadcaster, whether you take on powerful interests here at home or put yourself in harm's way overseas, I have the greatest respect and admiration for what you do. I know sometimes you like to give me a hard time&mdash;and I certainly like to return the favor&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but I never forget that our country depends on you. You help protect our freedom, our democracy, and our way of life. <p>And just to set the record straight, I really do enjoy attending these dinners. In fact, I had a lot more material prepared, but I have to get the Secret Service home in time for their new curfew. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.\" "
"106" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you, guys. Everybody, take a seat. Well, thank you, Sean, for that outstanding introduction. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Four more years! Four more years! <p>The President. I'll take it! <p><i>Audience members.</i> Four more years! Four more years! <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. Thank you. <p>Well, it is good to be back among friends. The last time I was here we&mdash;was Saturday night. And they tell me I did okay. But I want to not only thank Sean for his extraordinary leadership, I want to acknowledge all the other presidents who are on stage for what they do each and every day on behalf of not just their members, but on behalf of all working people. I'm proud of that. <p>I want to thank my good friend, Tim Kaine, who is here and is a friend of labor&mdash;the next United States Senator from the great Commonwealth of Virginia. <p>And obviously, we come here at a time where&mdash;I just want to repeat my condolences to everybody in the building and construction trades on the passing of Mark Ayers. Mark was a tremendous leader. He was a good friend. His commitment to the labor movement and to working people will leave a mark for years to come. And my thoughts and prayers are with his family. But I know that Sean is going to do an outstanding job, and we wish him all the best in his future endeavors. So congratulations. <p>So it's good to be back in front of all of you. It's always an honor to be with folks who get up every day and work real jobs&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and every day fight for America's workers. You represent the latest in a long, proud line of men and women who built this country from the bottom up. That's who you are. It was workers like you who led us westward. It was workers like you who pushed us skyward. It was your predecessors who put down the hardhats and helped us defeat fascism. And when that was done, you kept on building&mdash;highways that we drive on and the houses we live in and the schools where our children learn. And you established the foundation of what it means to be a proud American. <p>And along the way, unions like yours made sure that everybody had a fair shake, everybody had a fair shot. You helped build the greatest middle class that we've ever seen. You believed that prosperity shouldn't be reserved just for a privileged few; it should extend all the way from the boardroom, all the way down, to the factory floor. That's what you believe. <p>Time and again, you stood up for the idea that hard work should pay off; responsibility should be rewarded. When folks do the right thing, they should be able to make it here in America. And because you did, America became home of the greatest middle class the world has ever known. You helped make that possible, not just through your organizing, but how you lived, looking after your families, looking out for your communities. You're what America is about. <p>And so sometimes when I listen to the political debates, it seems as if people have forgotten American progress has always been driven by American workers. And that's especially important to remember today. <p>The last decade has been tough on everybody. But the men and women of the building and construction trades have suffered more than most. Since the housing bubble burst, millions of your brothers and sisters have had to look for work. Even more have had to struggle to keep the work coming in. And that makes absolutely no sense at a time when there is so much work to be done. <p>I don't have to tell you, we've got roads and bridges all over this country in desperate need of repair. Our highways are clogged with traffic. Our railroads are no longer the fastest in the world. Our skies are congested. Our airports are the busiest on the planet. All of this costs families and businesses billions of dollars a year. That drags down our entire economy. <p>And the worst part of it is that we could be doing something about it. I think about what my grandparents' generation built: the Hoover Dam, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Interstate Highway System. That's what we do: We build. There was a time where we would never accept the notion that some other country has better roads than us and some other country has better airports than us. I don't know about you, but I'm chauvinistic. I want America to have the best stuff. I want us to be doing the building, not somebody else. We should be having&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;people should be visiting us from all over the world. They should be visiting us from all over the world and marveling at what we've done. <p>That kind of unbridled, can-do spirit, that's what made America an economic superpower. And now, it's up to us to continue that tradition, to give our businesses access to the best roads and airports and high-speed rail and Internet networks. It's up to us to make sure our kids are learning in state-of-the-art schools. It's our turn to do big things; it is our turn to do big things. <p>But here's the thing: As a share of the economy, Europe invests more than twice what we do in infrastructure; China about four times as much. Are we going to sit back and let other countries build the newest airports and the fastest railroads and the most modern schools at a time when we've got private construction companies all over the world&mdash;or all over the country&mdash;and millions of workers who are ready and willing to do that work right here in the United States of America? <p>American workers built this country, and now we need American workers to rebuild this country. That's what we need. It is time we take some of the money that we spend on wars, use half of it to pay down our debt, and then use the rest of it to do some nation-building right here at home. There is work to be done, there are workers ready to do it, and you guys can help lead the way. <p><i>Audience member.</i> We can do it! <p><i>The President.</i> We can do it! We've done it before. And the truth is, the only way we can do it on a scale that's needed is with some bold action from Congress. They're the ones with the purse strings. That's why, over the last year, I've sent Congress a whole series of jobs bills to put people to work, to put your members back to work. Again and again, I've said now is the time do this. Interest rates are low, construction workers are out of work, contractors are begging for work, and the work needs to be done. Let's do it. And time after time, the Republicans have gotten together, and they've said no. <p>I sent them a jobs bill that would have put hundreds of thousands of construction workers back to work repairing our roads, our bridges, schools, transit systems; along with saving the jobs of cops and teachers and firefighters; creating a new tax cut for businesses. They said no. <p>I went to the Speaker's hometown, stood under a bridge that was crumbling. Everybody acknowledges it needs to be rebuilt. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Let him drive on it! [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> You know, that&mdash;maybe he doesn't drive anymore. Maybe he didn't notice how messed up it was. [<i>Laughter</i>] They still said no. <p>There are bridges between Kentucky and Ohio where some of the key Republican leadership come from, where folks are having to do detours an extra hour, hour and a half drive every day on their commute because these bridges don't work. They still said no. <p>So then I said, well, maybe they couldn't handle the whole bill in one big piece. Let's break it up. Maybe it was just too much for them. So I sent them just the part of the bill that would have created these construction jobs. They said no. <p>We're seeing it again right now. As we speak, the House Republicans are refusing to pass a bipartisan bill that could guarantee work for millions of construction workers. Already passed the Senate&mdash;ready to go&mdash;ready to put folks back to work. Used to be the most&mdash;the easiest bill to pass in Washington used to be getting roads and bridges built, because it's not like only Democrats are allowed to use these things. Everybody is permitted. [<i>Laughter</i>] Everybody needs them. <p>So this makes no sense. Congress needs to do the right thing. Pass this bill right away. It shouldn't be that hard; it shouldn't be that hard. Not everything should be subject to thinking about the next election instead of thinking about the next generation. Not everything should be subject to politics instead of thinking about all those families out there and all your membership that need work, that don't just support their own families, but support entire communities. <p>So we're still waiting for Congress. But we can't afford to just wait for Congress. You can't afford to wait. So where Congress won't act, I will. That's why I've taken steps on my own. That's why I've taken steps on my own and speeded up loans and speeded up competitive grants for projects across the country that will support thousands of jobs. That's why we're cutting through the redtape and launching a lot of existing projects faster and more efficiently. <p>Because the truth is, Government can be smarter. A whole bunch of projects at the State level sometimes are ready to go, but they get tangled up in all kinds of bureaucracy and redtape. So what we've said is, if there's redtape that's stopping a project and stopping folks from getting to work right now, let's put that aside. <p>Because the point is, infrastructure shouldn't be a partisan issue. Investments in better roads and safer bridges, these have never been made by just one party or another because they benefit all of us. They lead to a strong, durable economy. Ronald Reagan once said that rebuilding our infrastructure is \\"common sense\\"&mdash;\\"an investment in tomorrow that we need to make today.\\" Ronald Reagan said that. That great socialist, Ronald Reagan&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;couldn't get through a Republican primary these days. <p>The folks up on Capitol Hill right now, they seem to have exactly the opposite view. They voted to cut spending on transportation infrastructure by almost 30 percent. That means instead of putting more construction workers back on the job, they want to lay more off. Instead of breaking ground on new projects, they want to let existing projects grind to a halt. Instead of making the investments we need to get ahead, they're willing to let us all fall further behind. <p>Now, when you ask them, well, why are you doing this? Other than the fact that I'm proposing it&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;they'll say it's because we need to pay down our deficit. And you know what? The deficit is a real problem. All of us recognize in our own lives and our own families&mdash;we try to live within our means. So we got to deal with the debt, and we got to deal with the deficit. <p>And their argument might actually fly if they didn't just vote to spend $4.6 trillion on lower tax rates&mdash;that's with a \\"T,\\" trillion&mdash;on top of the $1 trillion they'd spend on tax cuts for people making more than $250,000 a year. So they're willing to spend over $5 trillion to give tax breaks to folks like me who don't need them and weren't even asking for them at a time when this country needs to be rebuilt. That gives you a sense of their priorities. <p>Think about that. Republicans in Congress would rather put fewer of you to work rebuilding America than ask millionaires and billionaires to live without massive new tax cuts on top of the ones they've already got. <p>Now, what do you think will make the economy stronger? Giving another tax break to every millionaire and billionaire in the country? Or rebuilding our roads and our bridges and our broadband networks that will help our businesses sell goods all around the world? It's pretty clear. This choice is not a hard one. <p>Of course, we need to bring down our deficits in the long term. But if we're smart about it, we also will be making and can afford to make the investments that will help our country and the American people in the short term. Not only will it put people back to work, but if the economy is growing&mdash;look, every time one of your members is on a job, that means they've got more money in their pockets. That means that they're going to the restaurant, and that restaurant owner suddenly is doing a little bit better. They're going to Home Depot to buy some stuff, and suddenly Home Depot is doing a little bit better. <p>This is a no-brainer. And by the way, when everybody is doing better and the economy is growing, lo and behold, that actually helps to bring down the deficit, helps us pay off our debt. Previous generations understood this. Apparently, right now, Republicans disagree. <p>And what makes it worse&mdash;it would be bad enough if they just had these set of bad ideas, but they've also set their sights on dismantling unions like yours. I mean, if you ask them, what's their big economic plan in addition to tax cuts for rich folks, it's dismantling your unions. After all you've done to build and protect the middle class, they make the argument you're responsible for the problems facing the middle class. Somehow, that makes sense to them. <p>That's not what I believe. I believe our economy is stronger when workers are getting paid good wages and good benefits. That's what I believe. That's what I believe. I believe the economy is stronger when collective bargaining rights are protected. I believe all of us are better off when we've got broad-based prosperity that grows outwards from a strong middle class. I believe when folks try and take collective bargaining rights away by passing so-called \\"right to work\\" laws&mdash;that might also be called \\"right to work for less\\" laws&mdash;that's not about economics, that's about politics. That's about politics. <p>That's why we've reversed harmful decisions designed to undermine those rights. That's why we passed the Fair Pay Act to help stop pay discrimination. That's why we've supported Davis-Bacon. That's why we reversed the ban on project labor agreements, because we believe in those things as part of a strategy to rebuild America. <p>And as long as I'm your President, I'm going to keep it up. I am going to keep it up, because the right to organize and negotiate fair pay for hard work, that's the right of every American, from the CEO in the corner office all the way to the worker who built that office. <p>And every day, you're hearing from the other side, whether it's the idea that tax cuts for the wealthy are more important than investing for our future or the notion we should pursue antiworker policies in the hopes that somehow unions are going to crumble. It's all part of that same old philosophy&mdash;tired, wornout philosophy&mdash;that says if you've already made it, we'll protect you; if you haven't made it yet, well, tough luck, you're on your own. <p>That misreads America. That's not what America is about. The American story has never been about what we can do on our own. It's about what we do together. In the construction industry, nobody gets very far by themselves. I'm the first to admit&mdash;I've got to be careful here because I'm&mdash;just barely can hammer a nail into the wall. [<i>Laughter</i>] And my wife is not impressed with my skills when it comes to fixing up the house. Right now, fortunately, I'm in a rental, so I don't end up having to do a lot of work. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But here is what I know about the trades: If you've got folks who aren't pulling together, doing their own thing, things don't work. But if you've got enough people with the same goal, pulling in the same direction, looking at the same game plan, you can build something that will stand long after you're gone. That's how a Hoover Dam or a Golden Gate Bridge or a Empire State Building gets built, folks working together. We can do more together than we can do on our own. <p>That's why unions were built&mdash;understood workers on their own wouldn't have the same ability to look after themselves and their families as they could together. And what's true for you is true for America. We can't settle for a country where just a few people do really well and everybody else struggles to get by. We've got to build an economy where everybody has got a fair shot and everybody does their fair share and everybody plays by the same set of rules. We can't just cut our way to prosperity. We need to fight for an economy that helps everybody, one built on things like American education and American energy and American manufacturing and a kind of world-class infrastructure that makes it all possible. <p>Now these have been some tough years we've been in. I know a lot of your membership can get discouraged, and they can feel like nobody is looking out for them, and they can get frustrated and they. Sure, it's easy to give up on Washington. I know that. But we've been through tougher times before. Your unions have been through tougher times before. And we've always been able to overcome it because we don't quit. <p>I know we can get there, because here in America we don't give up. We've been through tougher times before, and we've made it through because we didn't quit and we didn't throw in the towel. We rolled up our sleeves, we fired up our engines, and we remembered a fundamental truth about our country. Here in America, we rise or fall together as one nation, as one people. <p>It doesn't matter where you come from, what you look like, what your last name is. It doesn't matter whether your folks came from Poland or came from Italy or came from Mexico. One people&mdash;strong, united, firing all cylinders&mdash;that's the America I know. That's the America I believe in. That's the America we can rebuild together. <p>So if you're willing to join us in this project of rebuilding America, I want you to know: When I was running for this office, I told people I'm not perfect, not a perfect man&mdash;Michelle can tell you that&mdash;not a perfect President. But I made a promise, I'd always tell you where I stood. I'd always tell you what I thought, what I believed in. And most importantly, I would wake up every single day working as hard as I know how to make your lives a little bit better. <p>And for all that we've gone through over the last 3&frac12; , 4 years, I have kept that promise. I have kept that promise. And I'm still thinking about you. I'm still thinking about you, and I still believe in you. And if you join me, we'll remind the world just why it is that America is the greatest nation on Earth. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"107" "\"Good evening from Bagram Air Base. This outpost is more than 7,000 miles from home, but for over a decade, it's been close to our hearts. Because here in Afghanistan, more than half a million of our sons and daughters have sacrificed to protect our country. <p>Today I signed a historic agreement between the United States and Afghanistan that defines a new kind of relationship between our countries, a future in which Afghans are responsible for the security of their nation and we build an equal partnership between two sovereign states, a future in which war ends and a new chapter begins. <p>Tonight I'd like to speak to you about this transition. But first, let us remember why we came here. It was here, in Afghanistan, where Usama bin Laden established a safe haven for his terrorist organization. It was here, in Afghanistan, where Al Qaida brought new recruits, trained them, and plotted acts of terror. It was here, from within these borders, that Al Qaida launched the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 innocent men, women, and children. <p>And so 10 years ago, the United States and our allies went to war to make sure that Al Qaida could never again use this country to launch attacks against us. Despite initial success, for a number of reasons, this war has taken longer than most anticipated. In 2002, bin Laden and his lieutenants escaped across the border and established safe haven in Pakistan. America spent nearly 8 years fighting a different war in Iraq. And Al Qaida's extremist allies within the Taliban have waged a brutal insurgency. <p>But over the last 3 years, the tide has turned. We broke the Taliban's momentum. We built strong Afghan security forces. We devastated Al Qaida's leadership, taking out over 20 of their top 30 leaders. And 1 year ago, from a base here in Afghanistan, our troops launched the operation that killed Usama bin Laden. The goal that I set to defeat Al Qaida and deny it a chance to rebuild is now within our reach. <p>Still, there will be difficult days ahead. The enormous sacrifices of our men and women are not over. But tonight I'd like to tell you how we will complete our mission and end the war in Afghanistan. <p>First, we've begun a transition to Afghan responsibility for security. Already, nearly half of the Afghan people live in places where Afghan security forces are moving into the lead. This month, at a NATO summit in Chicago, our coalition will set a goal for Afghan forces to be in the lead for combat operations across the country next year. International troops will continue to train, advise, and assist the Afghans, and fight alongside them when needed. But we will shift into a support role as Afghans step forward. <p>As we do, our troops will be coming home. Last year, we removed 10,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Another 23,000 will leave by the end of the summer. After that, reductions will continue at a steady pace, with more and more of our troops coming home. And as our coalition agreed, by the end of 2014, the Afghans will be fully responsible for the security of their country. <p>Second, we are training Afghan security forces to get the job done. Those forces have surged and will peak at 352,000 this year. The Afghans will sustain that level for 3 years and then reduce the size of their military. And in Chicago, we will endorse a proposal to support a strong and sustainable long-term Afghan force. <p>Third, we're building an enduring partnership. The agreement we signed today sends a clear message to the Afghan people: As you stand up, you will not stand alone. It establishes the basis for our cooperation over the next decade, including shared commitments to combat terrorism and strengthen democratic institutions. It supports Afghan efforts to advance development and dignity for their people. And it includes Afghan commitments to transparency and accountability and to protect the human rights of all Afghans: men and women, boys and girls. <p>Within this framework, we'll work with the Afghans to determine what support they need to accomplish two narrow security missions beyond 2014: counterterrorism and continued training. But we will not build permanent bases in this country, nor will we be patrolling its cities and mountains. That will be the job of the Afghan people. <p>Fourth, we're pursuing a negotiated peace. In coordination with the Afghan Government, my administration has been in direct discussions with the Taliban. We've made it clear that they can be a part of this future if they break with Al Qaida, renounce violence, and abide by Afghan laws. Many members of the Taliban&mdash;from foot soldiers to leaders&mdash;have indicated an interest in reconciliation. The path to peace is now set before them. Those who refuse to walk it will face strong Afghan security forces, backed by the United States and our allies. <p>Fifth, we are building a global consensus to support peace and stability in South Asia. In Chicago, the international community will express support for this plan and for Afghanistan's future. And I have made it clear to its neighbor Pakistan that it can and should be an equal partner in this process in a way that respects Pakistan's sovereignty, interests, and democratic institutions. In pursuit of a durable peace, America has no designs beyond an end to Al Qaida safe havens and respect for Afghan sovereignty. <p>As we move forward, some people will ask why we need a firm timeline. The answer is clear: Our goal is not to build a country in America's image or to eradicate every vestige of the Taliban. These objectives would require many more years, many more dollars, and most importantly, many more American lives. Our goal is to destroy Al Qaida, and we are on a path to do exactly that. Afghans want to assert their sovereignty and build a lasting peace. That requires a clear timeline to wind down the war. <p>Others will ask, why don't we leave immediately? That answer is also clear: We must give Afghanistan the opportunity to stabilize. Otherwise, our gains could be lost, and Al Qaida could establish itself once more. And as Commander in Chief, I refuse to let that happen. <p>I recognize that many Americans are tired of war. As President, nothing is more wrenching than signing a letter to a family of the fallen or looking into the eyes of a child who will grow up without a mother or father. I will not keep Americans in harm's way a single day longer than is absolutely required for our national security. But we must finish the job we started in Afghanistan and end this war responsibly. <p>My fellow Americans, we've traveled through more than a decade under the dark cloud of war. Yet here in the predawn darkness of Afghanistan, we can see the light of a new day on the horizon. The Iraq war is over. The number of our troops in harm's way has been cut in half, and more will soon be coming home. We have a clear path to fulfill our mission in Afghanistan, while delivering justice to Al Qaida. <p>This future is only within reach because of our men and women in uniform. Time and again, they have answered the call to serve in distant and dangerous places. In an age when so many institutions have come up short, these Americans stood tall. They met their responsibilities to one another and to the flag they serve under. I just met with some of them and told them that as Commander in Chief, I could not be prouder. And in their faces, we see what is best in ourselves and our country. <p>Our soldiers, our sailors, our airmen, marines, coastguardsmen, and civilians in Afghanistan have done their duty. Now we must summon that same sense of common purpose. We must give our veterans and military families the support they deserve and the opportunities they have earned. And we must redouble our efforts to build a nation worthy of their sacrifice. <p>As we emerge from a decade of conflict abroad and economic crisis at home, it's time to renew America. An America where our children live free from fear and have the skills to claim their dreams, a united America of grit and resilience, where sunlight glistens off soaring new towers in downtown Manhattan and we build our future as one people, as one nation. <p>Here in Afghanistan, Americans answered the call to defend their fellow citizens and uphold human dignity. Today we recall the fallen and those who suffered wounds, both seen and unseen. But through dark days, we have drawn strength from their example and the ideals that have guided our Nation and led the world: a belief that all people are treated equal and deserve the freedom to determine their destiny. That is the light that guides us still. <p>This time of war began in Afghanistan, and this is where it will end. With faith in each other and our eyes fixed on the future, let us finish the work at hand and forge a just and lasting peace. <p>May God bless our troops, and may God bless the United States of America.\" "
"108" "\"<i>The President. </i>How's everybody doing tonight? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President. </i>Hooah! <p>It is good to be back here with all of you. I've got a few acknowledgments I've got to make before I say what I've got to say. First of all, somebody who has served our country with the kind of distinction that doesn't happen a lot, somebody who has been a leader for you and a leader for our country for a very long time&mdash;give your commander, General John Allen, a big, big round of applause. <p>We also have somebody who is John's partner on the civilian side and has made extraordinary sacrifices, first in Iraq, now in Afghanistan&mdash;Ambassador Ryan Crocker is here. Please give him a big round of applause. <p>All right, now, let me just see if I've got this right. We've got the 1st Infantry Division in the house. We've got the 455th Air Expeditionary Wing. We've got the Task Force Muleskinner. We've got the 101st Army Field Sustainment Brigade. We've got Task Force Paladin in the house. And we've got Task Force Defender in the house. And we've got me in the house. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Eighty-second! <p><i>The President.</i> Eighty-second. Eighty-second in the house&mdash;82d in the house. You know, somebody is going to be in trouble that they didn't have 82d on here. Anybody else I'm missing? <p><i>Audience members.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> There you go. All right. I love all of you. <p>Now listen, I'm not going to give a long speech. I'm going to have the opportunity to address the Nation from Bagram just in a little bit, and it's going to be broadcast back home during primetime. So all I want to do is just say thank you. <p>The sacrifices all of you have made, the sacrifices your families make every single day are what make America free and what make America secure. And I know that sometimes, out here, when you're in theater, it's not clear whether folks back home fully appreciate what's going on. And let's face it, a lot of times it's easier to get bad news on the news than good news. <p>But here's the good news, and here's part of the reason that I'm here. I just finished signing a strategic partnership agreement with Afghanistan that signals the transition in which we are going to be turning over responsibility for Afghan security to the Afghans. We're not going to do it overnight. We're not going to do it irresponsibly. We're going to make sure that the gains, the hard-fought gains that have been made are preserved. But the reason we're able to do that is because of you. The reason that the Afghans have an opportunity for a new tomorrow is because of you. And the reason America is safe is because of you. <p>We did not choose this war. This war came to us on 9/11. And there are a whole bunch of folks here, I'll bet, who signed up after 9/11. <p>We don't go looking for a fight. But when we see our homeland violated, when we see our fellow citizens killed, then we understand what we have to do. And because of the sacrifices now of a decade, and a new greatest generation, not only were we able to blunt the Taliban momentum, not only were we able to drive Al Qaida out of Afghanistan, but slowly and systematically we have been able to decimate the ranks of Al Qaida. And a year ago, we were able to finally bring Usama bin Laden to justice. <p>That could have only happened because each and every one of you, in your own way, were doing your jobs. Each and every one of you&mdash;without a lot of fanfare, without a lot of fuss&mdash;you did your jobs. No matter how small or how big, you were faithful to the oath that you took to protect this Nation. And your families did their job supporting you and loving you and remembering you and being there for you. <p>And so, together, you guys represent what is best in America. And you're part of a long line of those who have worn this uniform to make sure that we are free and secure, to make sure that those of us at home have the capacity to live our lives. And when you're missing a birthday or you're missing a soccer game or when you're missing an anniversary, and those of us back home are able to enjoy it, it's because of you. <p>And I'm here to tell you, everybody in America knows that. And everybody in America appreciates it. And everybody in America honors it. And when the final chapter of this war is written, historians will look back and say, not only was this the greatest fighting force in the history of the world, but all of you also represented the values of America in an exemplary way. <p>I could not be prouder of you. And I want you to understand, I know it's still tough. I know the battle is not yet over. Some of your buddies are going to get injured, and some of your buddies may get killed. And there's going to be heartbreak and pain and difficulty ahead. But there's a light on the horizon because of the sacrifices you've made. And that's the reason why for Michelle and me nothing is more important than looking after your families while you're here. And I want everybody here to know that when you get home, we are going to be there for you when you're in uniform, and we will stay there for you when you're out of uniform. Because you've earned it; you've earned a special place in our hearts. And I could not be prouder to be your Commander in Chief. <p>God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. Now I want to shake some hands.\" "
"109" "\"<i>Hola, hola</i>! <i>Gracias y bienvenidos</i>. I am honored to welcome you to Cinco de Mayo at the White House. Even though it's only <i>tres de Mayo</i>. We just like to get the fiesta started early around here. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>It is a pleasure to be joined by so many Latinos and Latinas and those who wish they were Latino and Latina. [<i>Laughter</i>] I knew you wouldn't miss an opportunity for great music and dancing at the White House, especially with the outstanding Ballet Folklorico from Georgetown University. Give them a big round of applause. <p>Our great friend Ambassador Arturo Sarukhan and his lovely wife Veronica are here. I'm honored to welcome Hispanic Americans serving at every level of my administration, including Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis. I want to recognize Charlie Gonzalez, chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. As all of you know, Charlie's birthday is on Cinco de Mayo, so don't forget to wish him a <i>feliz cumpleanos</i>. <p>Finally, thank you to the White House Hispanic Summit steering committee for your hard work to engage thousands of Latino leaders across the country this year. Good job. Your work demonstrates that this celebration is all about pride in the heritage and contributions of Hispanics in all aspects of American life. <p>Cinco de Mayo marks a singular moment in Mexican history. Exactly 150 years ago, General Zaragoza and his ragtag band of patriots made a brave stand against the invading forces of a world-renowned European army. Sounds familiar. And the story goes that after these heroic citizens and soldiers beat the odds and turned back the invaders, General Zaragoza found time to sit down and write a brief note to the war minister. He celebrated the glory of the national army, noting that they never turned their backs. And today we honor their valor. <p>When the news of the Mexican victory at Puebla reached this house, this country was in the midst of its own struggles. But soon after, the U.S. lent assistance to help Mexico definitively expel the French from their land. And ever since, the United States and Mexico have lived intersecting and overlapping histories. Our two countries share the ties of history and <i>familia</i> and values and commerce and culture. And today, we are more united than ever in friendship and in common purpose. <p>Right now there are more than 50 million Americans of Latino descent, one sixth of our population. You're our neighbors, our coworkers, our family, our friends. You're starting businesses. You're teaching in classrooms. You're defending this country. You're driving America forward. <p>And for our part, we know that securing our future depends on making sure that all Americans have the opportunity to reach their potential. And that's why we've worked hard over the last 3&frac12; years to create jobs, to make sure you get the care you need when you get sick, to make college affordable for everybody, to ensure that no matter where you are, where you come from, what you look like, what your last name is&mdash;even if it's Obama&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;you can make it if you try. <p>These are victories for Latinos, but they're, more importantly, victories for America. We could not have come this far without you. Of course, there is still plenty of unfinished business, including fixing our broken immigration system. And it is long past the time that we unleash the promise of all our young people and make the \\"DREAM Act\\" a reality. <p>A lot of you remember, over a year ago, we brought the \\"DREAM Act\\" to a vote in Congress, thanks to the hard work of many of you. And it passed the House and a majority of votes in the Senate. Unfortunately, we had some on the other side of the aisle that got together and blocked it. But we didn't come this far just to let partisan politics stand in our way. <p>So we're going to keep fighting for this commonsense reform&mdash;not just because hundreds of thousands of talented young students depend on it, but because ultimately, America depends on it. \\"No\\" is not an option. I want to sign the \\"DREAM Act\\" into law. I've got the pens all ready. I'm willing to work with anybody who is serious to get this done and to achieve bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform that solves this challenge once and for all. <p>It's worth remembering, America is and always will be a nation of immigrants. We are richer because of the men and women and children who have come to our shores and joined our union. So as we mark Cinco de Mayo, on both sides of the border, we pay tribute to our shared heritage and our future partnership. <p>We honor what brings us together. We are mothers and fathers of a great generation, and we're going to keep on making sure that our sons and daughters have every opportunity to realize the American Dream. That's what drives me every day. That's what I know drives a lot of you. And I look forward for us making future progress together. <p>So with that, let's party. Let's have a good time. <i>Feliz Cinco de Mayo</i>. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you.\" "
"110" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. Come on over here Coach. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Everybody, have a seat. Have a seat. Have a seat. Welcome to the White House, and congratulations to the Kentucky Wildcats on your eighth national championship. Eighth national champ&mdash;that's not bad. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's not bad. Although this is the first in 14 years. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, this was the fourth year that I filled out my bracket on ESPN. And what I've learned is that if I make the right picks, I look like a genius. But if things go the other way, then a team like Kentucky gets to come to my house and remind me in person that I was wrong. [<i>Laughter</i>] So it is a double-edged sword. <p>Of course, I knew Kentucky was good. I had them in the championship game. But in the end, I thought, these&mdash;they got all these freshmen. These guys are too young. [<i>Laughter</i>] And keep in mind, at this time last year, three of the Wildcats' five starters were still in high school. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist couldn't even vote yet. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But let's face it, sometimes talent triumphs experience. And sometimes, a bunch of young players, even if they're used to being big fishes in their ponds, even if they've never played together before, they can buy into a system, they understand the concept of team, and they do something special right away. And that's exactly what happened in Kentucky. <p>Of course, a lot of credit for that goes to their outstanding coach, Coach Calipari. My understanding is, when he recruited these players, Coach started off by asking them some simple questions: Do you want to win a national title? The answer was yes, apparently. [<i>Laughter</i>] Can you do it by yourself? The answer was no. He took a roster with six former All-Americans and got them to do something even more impressive, and that was share the ball. So you had six players average double figures in points this year; nobody averaged more than nine shots a game. If you didn't play defense, you didn't play. <p>And as a result, the Wildcats started winning. At one point, they won 24 straight. And they spent the final eight weeks of the season ranked number one. They cruised through the tournament, trailed for less than 10 minutes total, before beating Kansas in front of 70,000 fans at the Super Dome. So that's a pretty good run. <p>Most importantly, though, they did it as a team. And nobody, I think, was a better example of that than Anthony Davis, who&mdash;everybody kept on remarking on it. Nobody has ever seen somebody who didn't have a lot of field goals and yet still controlled the game. Still ended up being the most valuable player: racked up 16 rebounds, 6 blocks, 3 steals. That doesn't count all the intimidation factor&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that the other team had to go through. Of course, that's what happens when you grow 8 inches between your sophomore and senior years of high school. In fact, he has grown an inch since he got to the White House. [<i>Laughter</i>] His pants are already like this. [<i>Laughter</i>] Just got a new suit, you know, and his&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>When Anthony needed help, Doron Lamb stepped up, dropping 22 points in the biggest game of his career. First off the bench, Darius Miller, who became the first player in Kentucky history to be named Mr. Basketball, win a State championship in high school and win a national title with the Wildcats. I'm pretty sure Coach Cal is right that if Darius decides to run for Governor, he'll do all right in Kentucky. [<i>Laughter</i>] I also want to congratulate Darius and Eloy Vargas for getting their diplomas on Sunday. That's worth a big round of applause. <p>And I want to congratulate them for doing their share of community service in the Lexington community, from packing backpacks full of food for kids who don't have enough to raising money for tornado victims. <p>So these guys do it all. Everybody's got to take a good look now, because a whole bunch of these guys are going on to the NBA. Who knows, one of them might end up here in Washington. We'll take him. <p>Coach Cal is back on the recruiting trail, and if the next group of Wildcats is anything like this one, then I might see them again sometime soon. <p>So congratulations again to all the fans, to all the faculty, to all the&mdash;everybody who helps to make Kentucky such an outstanding university. Most of all, congratulations to the team and to Coach Calipari. <p><i>Head Coach John V. Calipari.</i> Thank you very much. Mr. President, on behalf of the Big Blue Nation, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, we are honored and humbled to be here. This team, when they won that championship on that court in New Orleans, they were jumping up and down not saying: \\"We did it! We won!\\" They were saying: \\"We're going to the White House! We're going to the White House!\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Because they wanted to meet you. <p>As a member of our team, I'd like our seniors, Darius Miller, to give you his number-one jersey that he wore for 4 years. <p><i>The President</i>. That's great. <p><i>Coach Calipari. </i>Eloy Vargas has a ball that he&mdash;the team has signed, and the young&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. There's the number-one jersey. <p><i>The President.</i> That's a good-looking jersey right there. <p><i>Coach Calipari.</i> And the young guy from your home city of Chicago&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The President.</i> Chicago! [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Coach Calipari.</i> &mdash;&mdash;would like to present you with the 2012 National Championship ring, and I might say, it is the first. <p><i>The President.</i> Hold that up. Look at that. That's all right. That's beautiful, man. Fantastic. Well, this is some nice gear. [<i>Laughter</i>] I have to say, by the way, after the game, I called the coach and the team, and I mentioned to Anthony that I had actually been to his school, a small charter school in Chicago, when I was still a Senator. And I had spoken to the kids there, and he told me, yes, I was there. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I didn't recognize him. He looked a little different apparently 4 years ago. So what a wonderful set of gifts. I appreciate that.\" "
"111" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Generals! Hello, Virginia! Well, let me first of all say, following Amirah is kind of tough. [<i>Laughter</i>] She is really good. Give her a big round of applause for the great introduction. There are a couple of other people I want to introduce who are here today. First of all, my Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, is here. Give him a round of applause. Your Congressman, Jim Moran, is here. <p>And before we came out, I had a chance to meet with Amirah and her mom, but also a couple other of your classmates. Brendan Craig is here, and his dad, and also Rina Castaneda and her mom. Let me just say, they represented you really well. Those were three impressive seniors. Thanks for hanging out with me on a Friday. I know that you're happy not because I'm here. There are seniors in the crowd&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;and you're excited about graduating. I know the juniors are excited to get the seniors&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;they're excited to get the seniors out so they'll be at the top of the heap. <p>You've got prom coming up. I guess you've already got your dress all picked out, huh? Yes. [<i>Laughter</i>] All right. You've got final exams. You've got a great summer coming up. And then, more than 90 percent of this year's seniors from this school are going to some sort of postsecondary education, whether it is a 4-year college, community college, vocational. That makes us proud. That is a testament to your principal, who is doing a great job. So we're very proud of him. Thank you. <p>Now, I know a lot of you&mdash;certainly a lot of your parents&mdash;are focused on how you're going to pay for college. And that's what I was talking to your classmates and some of your parents about. That's why I'm here. But first, I want to say something about the economy that we're going to be working to rebuild for you. Because not only do we want you to have a good education, we want to make sure that you're getting a job after you graduate. <p>Now, this morning, we learned that our economy created 130,000 private sector jobs in April and the unemployment rate ticked down again. So after the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, our businesses have now created more than 4.2 million new jobs over the last 26 months, more than 1 million jobs in the last 6 months alone. <p>So that's the good news. But there are still a lot of folks out of work, which means that we've got to do more. If we're going to recover all the jobs that were lost during the recession, and if we're going to build a secure economy that strengthens the middle class, then we're going to have to do more. And that's why, next week, I'm going to urge Congress, as they start getting back to work, to take some actions on some commonsense ideas, right now, that can accelerate even more job growth. That's what we need, and my message to Congress is going to be, just saying \\"no\\" to ideas that will create new jobs is not an option. There's too much at stake for us not to all be rowing in the same direction. And that's true for you, and that's true for your parents. <p>Now, that's in the short term. But in the long run, the most important thing we can do for our economy is to give all of you and all Americans the best education possible. That's the most important thing we can do. That means helping our schools hire and reward the best teachers, and you've got some great teachers here. That means stepping up our focus on math and science, something I tell Malia and Sasha every day. [<i>Applause</i>] You're solid on math? Okay, I like to hear that. [<i>Laughter</i>] That means giving more Americans the chance to learn the skills that businesses are looking for right now. And in the 21st century, it also means higher education cannot be a luxury; it is an economic imperative that every American should be able to afford. <p>Now, my grandfather had the chance to go to college because this country decided that every returning veteran of World War II should be able to afford it. And on a bipartisan basis, the GI bill was created that allowed him to go to college. My mother was able to raise two kids by herself because she was also able to get grants and loans to work her way through school. Michelle and I are only where we are because scholarships and student loans gave us a shot at a great education. We didn't come from a wealthy background, but this country gave us a chance at a good education. <p>This country has always made a commitment to put a good education within the reach of everybody who is willing to work for it. That's what makes us special. That's the kind of investment in our own people that helped us lead the world in business and science and technology and medicine. That's what made us an economic superpower. <p>But unfortunately, since you guys were born&mdash;which doesn't seem that long ago to me&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;maybe it does to you&mdash;the cost of going to college has more than doubled. And that means students have to take out more loans. It's now to the point where the average student who borrows to pay for college graduates with about $25,000 worth of debt&mdash;$25,000. And Americans now owe more for their student loans than they do on their credit cards. <p>Now, I want to give you guys some relief from that debt. I don't want you to start off life saddled with debt. And I don't want your parents to be taking on so much debt as well. Because when you start off already owing a lot of money graduating from school it means making a lot of really tough choices, like maybe waiting longer to buy a house or to start a family or to chase that career that you really want. <p>And like I said, Michelle and I know about this. We graduated from college and law school with a truckload of student loan debt. We got married, and together, we got poorer. [<i>Laughter</i>] After we graduated, we were lucky enough to land good jobs, so it was still a great investment for us to go to college and law school. But we only finished paying off our student loans about 8 years ago. And I know some of your teachers here probably can relate. When we should have been starting to save up for Malia's and Sasha's college educations, we were still paying off our educations. <p>So we can't price the middle class out of a higher education. We've got to make college more affordable. And that's why we fixed a broken student loan system that was giving tens of billions of dollars to big banks, and we said, let's use that money to help more people afford college. That's why we strengthened aid for low-income students. That's why we fought to set up a new, independent consumer watchdog agency that's now working with every student and their parents to access a simple fact sheet on student loans and financial aid, so you can make your own choices, the best choices, about how to pay for college. We call it \\"Know Before You Owe.\\" Know before you owe. <p>But making college more affordable isn't something Government can or should do alone. I was mentioning to your classmates, we're talking to colleges and universities about doing their part. And I've told Congress to steer Federal aid to schools that keep tuition affordable and provide good value and serve their students well. If colleges and universities can't stop their costs from going up, then the funding they get from taxpayers, that&mdash;it should go down. We should steer it to the schools that are really giving students the best deal. <p>And States have to do their part by making higher education a higher priority in their budgets. Last year, over 40 States cut their higher education spending. These cuts have been among the largest drivers of public college tuition increases over the past decade. So we've told States, if you can find new ways to bring down the cost of college and make it easier for students to graduate, then we're going to help you do it, which is good news. <p>Now, Congress also has to do its part. Right now that means preventing the interest rates on Federal student loans from doubling, which would make it harder for you to pay for college next year. The three classmates of yours that I met, they're all getting Stafford loans to help pay for college. And these Stafford loans right now have a very low interest rate, because 5 years ago Congress cut the rate for these student loans in half. That was a good idea. It made college more affordable. But here's the bad news. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Uh-oh. <p><i>The President.</i> Uh-oh. [<i>Laughter</i>] On July 1&mdash;less than 2 months from now&mdash;that rate cut expires, and interest rates on those loans will double overnight. <p><i>Audience members</i>. Boo! <p><i>The President. </i>That's not good. For each year that college doesn't act, the average student with these Stafford loans will rack up an additional thousand dollars in debt. That's like a thousand-dollar tax hike for more than 7 million students across America. <p>Now, let me ask, is that something that you can afford if you're going to college? <p><i>Audience members.</i> No! <p><i>The President.</i> You guys shouldn't have to pay an extra thousand dollars just because Congress can't get its act together. This is something&mdash;this should be a no-brainer. This is something that we need to get done. <p>So the good news is, the Senate will vote next week on a bill that would keep student loan rates from doubling. And some Republican Senators look like they might support it. I'm ready to work with them to make it happen. But unfortunately, rather than find a bipartisan way to fix this problem, the House Republicans are saying they're only going to prevent these rates from doubling if they can cut things like preventive health care for women instead. So&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> That's not good. We shouldn't have to choose between women having preventive health care and young people keeping their student loan rates low. <p>Some of the Republicans in the House are coming up with all sorts of different reasons why we should just let these rates double. One of them compared student loans to a \\"stage-three cancer of socialism,\\" whatever that means. I don't know. [<i>Laughter</i>] Another warned that this is all about giving you a \\"free college education,\\" which doesn't make sense because, of course, loans aren't free; you've got to pay them back. The spokesman for the Speaker of the House said that we were&mdash;meaning me&mdash;we're just talking about student loans to distract folks from the economy. Now, this makes no sense, because this is all about the economy. Making sure our young people can earn the best possible education, that's one of the best things we can do for the economy. Making sure college is available to everyone and not just a few at the top, that's one of the best things we can do for our economy. <p>And I don't think it's fair when they suggest that students like you should pay more so we can bring down deficits that they helped to run up over the past decade. They just voted&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;we've got to do something about our deficits. We paid for two wars with a credit card, debt that you're going to have to pay off. We gave two tax cuts to folks that don't need it and weren't asking for it. They&mdash;the Republicans in the House just voted to keep giving billions of taxpayer dollars every year to big oil companies raking in record profits. They just voted to let millionaires and billionaires keep paying lower tax rates than middle class workers. They even voted to give an average tax cut of at least $150,000 to every millionaire in America. And they want you to pay an extra thousand dollars a year for college. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> No, no, that doesn't make sense. In America, we admire success. We aspire to it. I was talking to folks&mdash;Rina wants to study business, and I'm confident she's going to be really wealthy some day and the&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;we want all of you to work and hustle and study your tails off and achieve your dreams. But America is not just about protecting a few people who are doing well. America is about giving everybody a chance to do well. That's what makes us strong. That's what the American Dream is all about. Everybody here, you're only here, you're only succeeding because somebody, somewhere, felt a responsibility not just to themselves, not even just to their own families, but to the country as a whole. And now it's our turn to be responsible. It's our turn to keep that promise alive for the next generation. <p>So if you agree with me, then I need all of you&mdash;I see a lot of cell phones here and a lot of&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;all kinds of stuff. [<i>Laughter</i>] I want you to send a message to Congress. Tell them \\"don't double my rate.\\" You should&mdash;\\"don't double my rate.\\" You should call them, you should e-mail them, write on their Facebook page, tweet them. [<i>Applause</i>] Tweet them. Teach your parents how to tweet. [<i>Laughter</i>] And there's a&mdash;use the hashtag \\"dontdoublemyrate.\\" Don't double my rate. [<i>Applause</i>] Don't double it. I asked some students at the University of North Carolina and the University of Colorado and the University of Iowa to do this last week, and they got it trending worldwide for a while. So there were, of course&mdash;there were more of them than there were of you. I had Jimmy Fallon's help. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But what I do expect from each of you on this and every other issue that you come to care about, I want you guys to realize your voice makes a difference. Your voice matters. I know sometimes it seems like it doesn't, but I guarantee you, Members of Congress, they pay attention. And if they start getting a lot of folks telling them they care deeply about something, it changes their mind. Sometimes, it changes their vote. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise. <p>It doesn't matter how old you are, what you look like, where you come from, or how much you have, your voice can make a difference. So tell Congress now is not the time to double your interest on your student loans. Now is the time to double down on our smart investments in building a strong and secure middle class. Now is the time to double down on building an America that lasts. And if we work together, I guarantee you, we'll meet our challenges. <p>When I met your classmates, when I look out at your faces, it gives me confidence about our future. I believe in you. And I believe you're going to do great things. And I believe your generation will remind the world just why it is America is the greatest nation on Earth. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you.\" "
"112" "\"This week, I traveled to Afghanistan to thank our troops serving far from home and to sign a historic agreement that will help us complete our mission and end the war. <p>As Commander in Chief, nothing is more humbling or inspiring than the chance to spend some time with our troops. At Bagram Air Base, I visited with some of our outstanding men and women in uniform. I thanked them for their extraordinary service. And I let them know that America honors their sacrifice. <p>Because of their bravery and dedication, the tide of war has turned in Afghanistan. We've broken the Taliban's momentum. We've built strong Afghan security forces. We've devastated Al Qaida's leadership. And 1 year ago, our troops launched the operation that killed Usama bin Laden. The goal that I set to defeat Al Qaida and deny it a chance to rebuild is within reach. <p>Because of the progress we've made, I was able to sign an historic agreement between the United States and Afghanistan that defines a new kind of relationship between our countries; a future in which Afghans are responsible for the security of their nation, and we build an equal partnership between two sovereign states, a future in which the war ends and a new chapter begins. <p>The enormous sacrifices of our men and women in uniform are not over, but many of our troops are already coming home. Last year, we removed 10,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan; another 23,000 will leave by the end of the summer. As our coalition agreed, by the end of 2014, the Afghans will be fully responsible for the security of their country. And this is as it should be, because after more than a decade of war, it's time to focus on nation-building here at home. <p>As a new greatest generation returns from overseas, we must ask ourselves: What kind of country will they come back to? Will it be a country where a shrinking number of Americans do really well while a growing number barely get by? Or will it be a country where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules, a country with opportunity worthy of the troops who protect us? <p>America has answered this question before. My grandfather, a veteran of Patton's army, got the chance to go to college on the GI bill. My grandmother, who worked on a bomber assembly line, was part of a workforce that turned out the best products on Earth. They contributed to a story of success that every American had the chance to share in: the basic American promise that if you worked hard, you could do well enough to raise a family, own a home, send your kids to college, and put a little away for retirement. <p>Keeping that promise alive is the defining issue of our time. But it means making responsible choices. <p>I don't think we should prioritize things like more tax cuts for millionaires while cutting the kinds of investments that build a strong middle class. That's why I've called on Congress to take the money we're no longer spending at war: Use half of it to pay down our debt and use the other half to rebuild America. <p>Because we've got more jobs to create, more students to educate, more clean energy to generate, more entrepreneurs with the next great idea, just looking for their shot at success. We've got to invest in things like education and medical research. We've got to build newer and faster transportations and communications networks. And we've got to secure the care and benefits our veterans have earned, so that we serve them as well as they've served us. <p>Every time I have the privilege of meeting with our troops, I'm struck by their courage, their commitment, their selflessness, and their teamwork. They have something to teach us. Recovering from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression is a work in progress, but if we follow their example, then I have no doubt we will preserve the promise of this country, protect the freedoms we cherish, and leave for our children an America that's built to last. <p>God bless you, and have a great weekend.\" "
"113" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. Everybody, please, please, have a seat. Have a seat. You're making me blush. [<i>Laughter</i>] <i>Mahalo</i>! <p><i>Audience members.</i> <i>Mahalo</i>! <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you so much. Thank you, Norm, for that kind introduction. More importantly, thank you for your lifetime of distinguished service to our country. I want to thank all the Members of Congress who are with us&mdash;including two people who are fighting hard every day on behalf of every member of this community&mdash;Judy Chu and Mike Honda. Give them a big round of applause. <p>Now, I am thrilled to be here tonight because all of you hold a special place in my heart. When I think about Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, I think about my family&mdash;my sister Maya; my brother-in-law Konrad, who's in the house somewhere&mdash;I don't know where Konrad is&mdash;my nieces Suhaila and Savita. I think about all the folks I grew up with in Honolulu, as part of the&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Aloha! [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> &mdash;&mdash;as part of the Hawaiian <i>ohana</i>. I think about the years I spent in Indonesia. So for me, coming here feels a little bit like home. This is a community that helped to make me who I am today. It's a community that helped make America the country that it is today. <p>So your heritage spans the world. But what unites everyone is that in all of your families you have stories of perseverance that are uniquely American. Some of you&mdash;those from Hawaii or the Pacific Islands&mdash;live where your family has lived for generations and your story is in part, about keeping alive treasured native traditions. But for others, your story starts with ancestors who at some point, left behind everything they knew to seek the promise of a new land. Maybe the story traces back a century and a half, to the laborers who risked their lives to connect our coasts by rail. Maybe it begins with one of the hundreds of thousands of immigrants who, decades ago, made the tough journey to Angel Island. <p>Maybe the story starts with your parents. Or maybe it starts with you. But here's the thing. No matter when it began, no matter where it began, your stories are about someone who came here looking for new opportunities not merely for themselves, but for their children, and for their children's children, and for all generations to come. <p>Few of them had money. A lot of them didn't have belongings. But what they did have was an unshakeable belief that this country&mdash;of all countries&mdash;is a place where anybody can make it if they try. <p>Now, many of them faced hardship, many of them faced ridicule, many of them faced racism. Many were treated as second-class citizens, as people who didn't belong. But they didn't give up. They didn't make excuses. They kept forging ahead. They kept building up America. They kept fighting for America. Like Danny Inouye, who's here. They were trailblazers. Danny, who was my Senator most of my life. [<i>Laughter</i>] Love that man. <p>But they were trailblazers like Dalip Singh Saund, a young man from India who, in 1920, came to study agriculture, stayed to become a farmer, and took on the cause of citizenship for all people of South Asian descent. And once Dalip earned his own citizenship, he stepped up to serve the country he loved, and became the first Asian American elected to the Congress. <p>They were pioneers like my former Congresswoman Patsy Mink, who was not only the first Asian American woman elected to Congress, but the author of Title IX, which has changed the playing field for all of our girls. <p>And then there's the story of a young Japanese American boy, just 10 when his family was forced from their home and taken hundreds of miles away to an internment camp. For 3 years, they lived in that camp, but when that boy got home, he didn't turn his back on America, he devoted his life to America. In his words, he pledged \\"to speak out for the underrepresented and to pick up on those issues that weren't being carried by others.\\" And as the first Asian American to ever serve in a President's Cabinet, Norm Mineta made good on that pledge. <p>So think about how proud all those previous generations would be to see this room, to see how far this community has come. Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders are now the inventors and entrepreneurs keeping our country on the cutting edge; the business men and women at the helm of some of our most successful industries; leaders in every aspect of American life&mdash;in science and medicine, in education, in sports, in the arts, in our Armed Forces, in our Government, and in our courts. In fact, over the past 3 years, we have more than doubled the number of Asian Americans on the Federal bench. <p>Just yesterday, Jacqueline Nguyen became the first Asian American woman to get confirmed as a Federal appellate judge. Where's Jacqueline? She's here tonight. There she is. You didn't bring your robe though. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's pretty cool. [<i>Laughter</i>] And we're so proud to have her along with another appellate judge I appointed, Denny Chin. He's here. Where's Denny? There he is, back there. So we thank them for their service. <p>Whether your heritage stems from South Asia or East Asia, from my native Hawaii or the Pacific Islands, whether you're first generation&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> Woo-hoo! <p><i>The President.</i> These Hawaiians here&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;what's up with that? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Woo-hoo! [<i>Laughter</i>] Aloha! <p><i>The President.</i> Whether you are first generation or the fifth, you're helping to build a better America. <p>And I know it can be tempting&mdash;given the success that's on display here tonight&mdash;for people to buy into the myth of the \\"model minority\\" and glance over the challenges that this community still faces. But we have to remember there's still educational disparities like higher dropout rates in certain groups, lower college enrollment rates in others. There's still economic disparities like higher rates of poverty and obstacles to employment. There are health disparities like higher rates of diabetes and cancer and Hepatitis B. Those who are new to America, many still face language barriers. Others, like Vincent Chin, who we lost three decades ago, have been victims of horrible hate crimes, driven by the kinds of ignorance and prejudice that are an affront to everything America stands for. <p>So those are real problems, and we can't ignore them. And if we're going to do a better job addressing them, then we first have to stop grouping everybody just in one big category. Dozens of different communities fall under the umbrella of the Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and we have to respect that the experiences of immigrant groups are distinct and different. And your concerns run the gamut. <p>That's something that Washington needs to understand better. And that's why I reestablished the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders&mdash;so that we could better identify specific issues within specific communities. Many of those Commissioners are here. I want to thank them for the great job that they're doing. <p>And so we're making a difference on that front and on many other fronts. When we stepped up support for America's small businesses, we stepped up support for this community, providing over $7 billion in loans for small businesses owned by Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. When we passed health care reform, we put in place new mechanisms to get better data about health disparities. Because of that law, nearly 3 million Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are going to receive expanded and preventive coverage through private insurance, and nearly 1 million are receiving free preventive services through Medicare. <p>So some of the things that matter to this community are things that matter to every community, like making sure that a woman earns an equal day's pay for an equal day's work, or ending \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" so that nobody has to hide who they love to serve the country they love, or enacting education reform so that every child has access to good schools and higher education, or caring for our veterans because it's our duty to serve them as well as they have served us. <p>That's what this country is about. That's what we've always been about. We've gone through some tough years because of this extraordinary recession and we've still got a long way to go. But we will get there. We will arrive at that destination where every child born in America regardless of race, creed, color, is going to have a chance. We're going to do that together, because in this country, we look out for each other. We fight for each other. If somebody is suffering through injustice or inequality, we take up their cause as if it was our own. That's the story of America. And that's certainly the story of this community. <p>In the midst of World War II, when the son of Japanese immigrants, Gordon Hirabayashi, ignored the curfews and refused transfer to an internment camp, when he was jailed for his defiance, when he later appealed his conviction and took his case all the way to the Supreme Court, he understood that he was fighting for something larger than himself. And he once said, \\"I never look at my case just as a Japanese American case. It's an American case, with principles that affect the fundamental human rights of all Americans.\\" And while Gordon is no longer with us, later this year I'll award him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award America has to offer. Because he reminds us that each of us is only who we are today because somebody, somewhere, felt a sense of responsibility&mdash;not just to themselves, but to their family, and their communities and to this country that we all love. <p>So tonight we honor the trailblazers who came before. But we also celebrate the leaders yet to come, all the young people who are here tonight. Together, it's our turn to be responsible for the future. It's our turn to make sure the next generation has more opportunities than we did. It's our turn to make sure that no matter who you are, no matter where you came from, no matter what you look like, America forever remains the place where you can make it if you try. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"114" "\"Hello, New York! Thank you. Thank you so much. Everybody, please have a seat. It is great to be back in Albany. It is wonderful to be with all of you here today. <p>And I want to thank Governor Cuomo not only for the outstanding introduction, but also for the extraordinary leadership that he's showing here in the great State of New York. Please give him a big round of applause. He is doing outstanding work. <p>I also want to thank Mayor Jennings, who's here. Give the mayor a big round of applause. Don't be shy. We've got Chancellor Zimpher&mdash;we appreciate very much. Dr. Kaloyeros&mdash;I want to make sure I say that right, folks mess up my name all the time&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;Kaloyeros for hosting us here today. We've got a couple Members of Congress here&mdash;Paul Tonko, and also, Representative Chris Gibson is here. And all of you are, and I'm happy about that. Yes. <p>So it is wonderful to be here at the University of Albany NanoCollege. This is one of the only colleges in the world dedicated to nanotechnology. And it's a incredible complex. But you're working on particles as small as an atom, and you're doing it in rooms that are 10,000 times cleaner than a hospital operating room, which is very impressive, since \\"clean\\" is not usually a word I associate with college students. [<i>Laughter</i>] Maybe things have changed since I was in school. <p>Now, the reason I came here today is because this school&mdash;&mdash; <p>[<i>At this point, an audience member sneezed.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> &mdash;&mdash;bless you&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and this community represents the future of our economy. Right now some of the most advanced manufacturing work in America is being done right here in upstate New York. Cutting-edge businesses from all over the world are deciding to build here and hire here. And you've got schools like this one that are training workers with the exact skills that those businesses are looking for. <p>Now, we know the true engine of job creation in this country is the private sector; it's not Washington. But there are steps we can take as a nation to make it easier for companies to grow and to hire, to create platforms of success for them, everything from giving more people the chance to get the right training and education to supporting new research projects into science and technology. In fact, there was a substantial investment made here; I was talking to Governor Cuomo about the investment his father made here to help get this center started. <p>There are things we can do to make sure that if you're willing to work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can find a job, own a home, maybe start a business, and most importantly, give your kids a chance to do even better than you did. And that's something we believe has to be available to everybody, no matter where you come from, no matter what you look like. We can make a difference. And at this make-or-break moment for America's middle class, there's no excuse for inaction. There's no excuse for dragging our feet. None. <p>Now, over the last few years, there are certain steps that I've been able to take on my own to help spur the kind of innovation that we're seeing here and also to help the overall economy grow. So we announced a new policy several months back that will help families refinance their mortgages, save up to a&mdash;to thousands of dollars a year. We sped up loans and competitive grants for new projects all across the country so thousands of construction workers can get back on the job. We simplified the student loan process to help roughly 5.8 million students like the students here save money on repayments. <p>So these are some steps that the administration's been able to take on its own. But the truth is, the only way we can accelerate the job creation that takes place on a scale that is needed is bold action from Congress. <p>Because of the Recovery Act, because of all the work we've done, we've created over 4 million jobs over the last 2 years. We've created hundreds of thousands of jobs each month over the last several months. So we're making progress, but everybody knows we need to do more. And in order to do that, we're going to need some more action from Congress. Democrats and Republicans have to come together. And they've shown that they can do it. I mean, they did some important work. They passed tax cuts for workers, approved trade deals to open up new markets for American products. We reformed our patent system to make it easier for innovative ideas to come to market. Those are all good things. But the size of the challenges we face requires us to do more. <p>So back last September, I sent Congress a jobs bill that included all sorts of policies that we knew would help grow our economy and put more Americans back to work. That wasn't just my opinion, that wasn't just the opinion of Democrats. It was the opinion of independent, nonpartisan experts, economists who do this for a living and analysts on Wall Street who evaluate what's going to really make the economy grow. And the one big piece that we were able to get done was make sure that we didn't see payroll tax go up and people get 40 bucks taken out of their paychecks each time. <p>But most of it didn't get done in Congress. Just about every time we put these policies up for a vote, the Republicans in Congress got together and they said no. They said no to putting hundreds of thousands of construction workers back on the job repairing our roads and our bridges and our schools and our transit systems. No to a new tax cut for businesses that hire new workers. No to putting more teachers back in our classrooms, more cops back on the beat, more firefighters back to work. And this is at a time when we know one of the biggest drags on our economy has been layoffs by State and local governments. That's true all across the country. <p>And it's worth noting, by the way&mdash;this is just a little aside&mdash;after there was a recession under Ronald Reagan, government employment went way up. It went up after the recessions under the first George Bush and the second George Bush. So each time there was a recession with a Republican President, compensated&mdash;we compensated by making sure that government didn't see a drastic reduction in employment. <p>The only time government employment has gone down during a recession has been under me. So I make that point just so you don't buy into this whole bloated government argument that you hear. And frankly, if Congress had said yes to helping States put teachers back to work and put the economy before our politics, then tens of thousands of more teachers in New York would have a job right now. That is a fact. And that would mean not only a lower unemployment rate, but also more customers for businesses. <p>Now, I know this is an election year. But it's not an excuse for inaction. Six months is plenty of time for Democrats and Republicans to get together and do the right thing, taking steps that will spur additional job creation right now. Just saying no to ideas that we know will help our economy isn't an option. There's too much at stake. We've all got to pull in the same direction. <p>So even if Republicans are still saying no to some of the bigger proposals we made in the jobs act, there are some additional ideas that could help people get to work right now and that they haven't said no to yet, so I'm hoping they say yes. And they're simple ideas. They're the kinds of things that, in the past, have been supported by Democrats and Republicans. These are traditionally ideas that have had bipartisan support. They won't have as big of an impact as rebuilding our infrastructure or helping States hire back teachers, but together, all of these ideas will do two things: They'll grow the economy faster; they'll create more jobs. <p>So today I'm announcing a handy little to-do list&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that we've put together for Congress. You can see it for yourselves at whitehouse.gov. It's about the size of a Post-it note, so every Member of Congress should have time to read it&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and they can glance at it every so often. And you, hopefully, will just be checking off the list, just like when Michelle gives me a list, I check it off. [<i>Laughter</i>] Each of the ideas on this list will help accelerate our economy and put people back to work&mdash;not in November, not in next year, but right now. <p>All right, so I'm going to go through the list. First, Congress needs to help the millions of Americans who have worked hard, made their mortgage payments on time, but still have been unable to refinance their mortgages with these historically low rates. This would make a huge difference for the economy. <p>Families could save thousands of dollars, and that means they got more money in their pocket, which means they can either build their equity back up on their homes or they go out and use that money to do things like helping to&mdash;their kids finance a college education. So Congress should give those responsible homeowners a chance to refinance at a lower rate. We estimate they'd save at least $3,000 a year. So that's on our to-do list. It's not complicated. <p>Second, if Congress fails to act soon, clean energy companies will see their taxes go up and they could be forced to lay off employees. In fact, we're already hearing from folks who produce wind turbines and solar panels and a lot of this green energy that they're getting worried because there's uncertainty out there. Congress hasn't renewed some of the tax breaks that are so important to this industry. And since I know that the other side in Congress have promised they'll never raise taxes as long as they live, this is a good time to keep that promise when it comes to businesses that are putting Americans to work and helping break our dependence on foreign oil. So we should extend these tax credits. That's on the to-do list. That's number two. <p>Number three, Congress should help small-business owners by giving them a tax break for hiring more workers and paying them higher wages. We believe small businesses are the engine of economic growth in this country. We should not hold them to a situation where they may end up having to pay higher taxes just by hiring more workers. We should make it easier for them to succeed. So that's on our to-do list. That's number three. <p>Number four, Congress should help our veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan find a good job once they come home. Our men and women in uniform have served this country with such honor and distinction. A lot of them come from upstate New York. Now it's our turn to serve them. So we should create a veterans job corps that helps them find work as cops and firefighters, employees at our national parks. That's on our to-do list. <p>And then the last item, the fifth item, which bears especially on what's going on here, the last item on our congressional to-do list is something that will help a lot of you in particular. You know better than anybody that technology has advanced by leaps and bounds over the last few decades. And that's a great thing. Businesses are more productive; consumers are getting better products for less. But technology has also made a lot of jobs obsolete. Factories where people once thought they'd retire suddenly left town. Jobs that provided a decent living got shipped overseas. And the result's been a lot of pain for a lot of communities and a lot of families. <p>There is a silver lining to all this though. After years of undercutting the competition, now it's getting more expensive to do business in places like China. Wages are going up. Shipping costs are going up. And meanwhile, American workers are getting more and more efficient. Companies located here are becoming more and more competitive. So for a lot of businesses, it's now starting to make sense to bring jobs back home. <p>And here in the tri-city area, you've got companies like IBM and GlobalFoundries that could have decided to pack up and move elsewhere, but they chose to stay in upstate New York because it made more sense to build here and to hire here. You had more to offer&mdash;got some of the best workers in the world, you got an outstanding university. <p>Now I want what's happening in Albany to happen all across the country, places like Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh. I want to create more opportunities for hard-working Americans to start making things again and selling them all over the world stamped with those proud words: Made in America. That's the goal. <p>So the good news is we're already starting to see it happen. American manufacturers are creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s. And that's good for you, but it's also good for the businesses that supply the materials you use. It's good for the construction workers who build the facilities you work in. It's good for communities, where people are buying more houses and spending more money at restaurants and stores. Everybody benefits when manufacturing is going strong. <p>So you've heard about outsourcing. Today, more and more companies are insourcing. One recent study has found that half of America's largest companies are thinking of moving their manufacturing operations from China back to the United States of America. That's good news. Because even when we can't make things cheaper than other countries because of their wage rates, we can always make them better. That's who we are. That's what America is all about. <p>So this brings me back to our to-do list. What we need to do now is to make it easier for more companies to do the right thing, and one place to start is our Tax Code. At the moment, companies get tax breaks for moving factories, jobs, and profits overseas. They can actually end up saving on their tax bill when they make the move. Meanwhile, companies that choose to stay here are getting hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world. That doesn't make sense. <p>And politicians from both parties have been talking about changing it for years, so I've put forward my own plan to make it right in the long term. But in the short term, before we completely rework the Tax Code, before we've done a full-blown tax reform, at the very least what we can do right away is stop rewarding companies who ship jobs overseas and use that money to cover moving expenses for companies that are moving jobs back here to America. So we're putting that on Congress's to-do list. This should&mdash;this is something simple to do. We shouldn't wait. We should get it done right now. <p>So that's the fifth item. That's all on our to-do list. Not trying to overload Congress here. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So over the next few weeks, I'm going to be taking about this to-do list when I'm on the road. I'm going to be talking about all the things that Congress can do right now to boost our economy and accelerate even more job growth. Of course, it's not enough just to give them the list; we've also got to get them to start crossing things off the list. And that's where all of you come in. <p>I'm going to need you to pick up the phone, write an e-mail, tweet, remind your Member of Congress we can't afford to wait until November to get things done. Tell them now is the time to help more Americans save money on their mortgages, time for us to invest more in clean energy and small businesses, it's time for us to help more veterans find work, and it's time to make it easier for companies to bring jobs back to America. It's the right thing to do. <p>Now, I'm cheating a little bit. I said that was my to-do list. There actually is one other thing they've got to do. Before they do anything else, Congress needs to keep student loan rates from doubling for students who are here and all across the country. That has to happen by January 1 [July 1; White House correction] or rates on Stafford loans double. These young people are nodding their heads. They don't like that. They've heard about this. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And we need to pass a transportation bill that guarantees almost a million construction workers can stay on the job. So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>The good news is both parties say they want to make this happen. We've done this before. So Congress just needs to work out the details. Don't let politics get in the way. Get this done before July 1. Those bills should be passed right now. <p>So I'm cheating a little bit. There are actually seven items on the to-do list. [<i>Laughter</i>] But two of them are old business, and folks have already said they want to get them done. <p>Albany, we've got a long way to go if we're going to make sure everybody who wants a job can find one and every family can feel that sense of security that was the essence of America's middle class experience. But we can't just go back to the way things used to be. We've got to move forward to an economy where everybody gets a fair shot, everybody is doing their fair share, everybody plays by the same set of rules. <p>And that's what you guys are doing here in Albany. You're investing in your future. You're not going backwards, you're going forward. With your help, I know we can get there, because here in America, we don't give up. We keep moving. We look out for one another. We pull each other up. That's who we are. And if we work together with common purpose, I've got no doubt we can keep moving this country forward and remind the world just why it is the United States of America is the greatest nation on Earth. <p>Thank you so much, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"115" "\"Good evening, everybody. Well, thank you all for joining us tonight to honor a legendary songwriting duo: Burt Bacharach and Hal David. <p>I want to start by thanking the outstanding artists who are here to pay tribute to Burt and Hal. They have just been extraordinary. <p>I'd also like to thank Dr. James Billington of the Library of Congress and the outstanding team of producers for their hand in making tonight's wonderful evening possible. <p>And finally, I want to say a word about someone who is missing tonight. Even though Hal cannot be here with us, this celebration is for him. And we're happy that his lovely wife Eunice David is here to receive his award&mdash;this award on his behalf. <p>The Gershwin Prize is named for one of the great American songwriting duos of all time. And it's fitting that tonight's award is being presented to another. <p>Burt and Hal first met at Famous Music in the Brill Building in New York. Burt had come a long way from his days of hoping to be a football player&mdash;[<i>laughte</i>r]&mdash;as well as a musical career. And Hal had taken his wordsmithing from the pages of New York newspapers to the frontlines of big band. Soon, the football player and the journalist started writing songs, and they struck gold in 1957 with Marty Robbins singing \\"The Story of My Life.\\" <p>What began as an occasional collaboration in the late fifties quickly became a partnership that produced dozens of Top 40 hits. There was even a span of 10 years during the 1960s and seventies when a week rarely went by without one of their songs being on the Billboard charts. <p>Burt and Hal racked up Grammys and Oscars and have been honored by numerous lifetime achievement awards. And today, more than 55 years after their first songs hit the airwaves, these guys have still got it. Alicia Keys and John Legend are recording their songs. Burt is appearing on \\"American Idol\\" and \\"Dancing with the Stars.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] And in 2004, Burt and Hal worked with Twista, Kanye West, and Jamie Foxx to get back to number one with a slow jam medley. So these guys can work with anybody. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Like the Gershwin brothers, Burt and Hal have never been limited to one genre or even one generation. Burt once said that all he looks for in writing a good melody is \\"to write something that I like.\\" Hal agreed, saying, \\"We just tried to write with as much integrity as we could.\\" Above all, they stayed true to themselves. And with an unmistakable authenticity, they captured the emotions of our daily lives&mdash;the good times, the bad times, and everything in between. And they've lived their lives on their own terms, and they've taught Americans of all ages to embrace their individual stories, even as we move forward together. <p>So tonight, on behalf of a grateful nation, it is my privilege to present the Nation's highest prize for popular music to two kings of songwriting, Burt Bacharach and Hal David.\" "
"116" "\"Well, good afternoon, everybody. And thank you for arranging a beautiful day. This is just a spectacular afternoon and I'm thrilled to be here. <p>We all know how difficult these past few years have been for this country, but especially for this State. After the worst recession in our lifetimes&mdash;a crisis that followed the collapse of the housing market&mdash;it's going to take a long time for the economy to fully recover. More time than any of us would like. But there are plenty of steps that we can take to speed up the recovery right now. There are things we can do right now to help create jobs and help restore some of the financial security that too many families have lost. <p>Now, I have to say that there are a few too many Republicans in Congress who don't seem to be as optimistic as we are. They think that all we can do are try the things that have been done in the past&mdash;things that they've tried in the past. So they want to cut more taxes, especially for the wealthiest Americans. They want to cut back on the rules that we put in place for banks and financial institutions. They've said that they want to let the housing market hit bottom and just hope for the best. That's it. We've heard those ideas before. That's their economic agenda. And I'll be honest with you; I don't buy it. I think they're wrong. <p>We've tried their ideas for nearly a decade and they didn't work. And I refuse to sell this country short by going back to the exact same ideas that helped to get us in this mess in the first place. Our goal is to build an economy where hard work and responsibility are rewarded, where you can find a good job, make a good wage, own your own home, maybe start a business, send your kids to college. Hopefully, their lives will be even better than ours. That's what I wish for Malia and Sasha, and I know you guys feel the same way; who have kids. <p>And that's where we need to go. I've been pushing Congress to help us get there by passing a few commonsense policies that we're convinced will make a difference. We even made a handy to-do list for Congress so they can just check them off. It's a list like Michelle gives me. [<i>Laughter</i>] I know Paul is familiar with that list. He gets it from Val. <p>Now, there are only five things on this list, because I don't want to overload Congress with too much at once. But they're ideas that will help create jobs and build a stronger economy right now. <p>So first up on the list&mdash;it makes absolutely no sense that we actually give tax breaks to companies that ship jobs and factories overseas. That doesn't make any sense at all. So we told Congress it's time to end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and use that money to cover moving expenses for companies that bring jobs back to America. <p>Second, instead of just talking about job creators, Congress should help small businesses and help small-business owners who create most of the new jobs in America. So we want to give them a tax break for hiring more workers and paying them higher wages. <p>The third thing on our to-do list&mdash;Congress should extend tax credits that are set to expire for our clean energy companies. These businesses are putting folks to work here in this state of Nevada. Last time I was here, in fact, I went to see a huge solar plant&mdash;solar energy plant. A lot of folks are working both in the construction of it and maintaining it. That's happening all across the country. And so we've got to make sure that we are helping those folks, because that helps us break our dependence on foreign oil. Over the long term that will help drive down gas prices and it puts people to work right now. It's the right thing to do. <p>Fourth, Congress should create a veterans jobs corps so that we can help communities hire returning heroes&mdash;our veterans&mdash;as cops and firefighters and employees at national parks, because nobody who fights for this country should ever have to come home and fight for a job or fight for a roof over their heads. <p>All right, so that's four, which brings me to the fifth. The fifth thing on the list&mdash;and that's why I'm here today&mdash;I'm calling on Congress to give every responsible homeowner the chance to save an average of $3,000 a year by refinancing their mortgage. It's a simple idea. It makes great sense. And I know it will have an impact. <p>Last October, I was in Clark County, where I announced new steps to help responsible homeowners refinance their homes. And at the time, Congress wasn't willing to act, so we did. We went ahead and did what we could do administratively, without a new law being passed. And as a result, Americans who were previously stuck in high interest loans have been able to take advantage of these lower rates. And they've been able to save thousands of dollars every year. <p>And it turns out that two of those people are your neighbors, Paul and Valerie Keller. So I just had a chance to visit with Paul and Valerie and look at their beautiful home and check out the grill out back. [<i>Laughter</i>] Valerie says Paul is a pretty good cook, so I'm going to take her word for it. <p>The Kellers have lived in this house for 14 years. Val works nearby, helping secure loans for farmers and ranchers. Paul is a retired electrical contractor who started a family business with their son. Last year, with mortgage rates at historic lows, the Kellers decided it would make sense for them to refinance. They thought it would be easy, since they're current on their mortgage; they make their payments on time. So this is an example of responsible homeowners doing the right thing. <p>But when they tried to refinance, they were told they couldn't do it. Because the Kellers' house, like thousands of others in this State and probably some of the neighbors here, their house is underwater, which means that the price is currently lower than what they owe on it. So they were hit&mdash;you were hit with a historic drop in housing prices, which caused the value of homes in their neighborhood to plummet. And a lot of banks, historically, have said; well, we're not going to refinance you if your home is underwater. <p>Now, luckily, the Kellers saw my announcement that I had made down in Clark County. So I'm assuming it must have been Val because whenever something smart is done, it's usually the wife in the house. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So they called their lender and within a few months&mdash;within 90 days&mdash;they were able to refinance under this new program that we set up. Their monthly mortgage bill has now dropped $240 dollars a month and that means every year they're saving close to $3000. <p>Now, Val says that they've been talking to some of their neighbors&mdash;maybe some of you are here today&mdash;and you're saying, well, that sounds like a pretty good idea. And a lot of folks across the country recognize this is a smart thing to do not only for homeowners, but for our economy, because if Paul and Val have an extra 240&mdash;$250 a month, then they might spend it on the local business. They might go to a restaurant a little more often. They might spoil their grandkids even more. [<i>Laughter</i>] And that means more money in the economy and businesses do better and slowly home prices start rising again. So it makes sense for all of us. <p>And the good news is, since I've made this announcement, refinancing applications have gone up by 50 percent nationwide and 230 percent here in Nevada alone. That's the good news. People are taking advantage of this. That's what we want to see. <p>But here's the only catch&mdash;and this is where you come in, because you're going to have to pressure Congress. The pool of folks who can refinance right now, when their homes are underwater, is still too small. The reason the Kellers were able to refinance is, because the only thing that we could do without congressional action was to give opportunities for refinancing for folks with a Government-backed loan&mdash;an FHA-backed loan. But in order to expand that opportunity&mdash;we want to include everybody, people whose mortgages aren't Government-backed&mdash;and in order to do that, we've got to have Congress move. <p>There's absolutely no reason why they can't make this happen right now. If they started now, in a couple of weeks, in a month, they could make every homeowner in America, who is underwater right now, eligible to be able to refinance their homes&mdash;if they're making their payments, if they're responsible, if they're doing the right thing. And think about all those families saving $3,000 on average a month [year; White House correction]. That's a huge boost to our economy. And for some of you who are underwater, you might say, \\"Instead of spending that money I can plow that back into equity in my home and build that back up,\\" which would further strengthen housing prices here in Nevada and around the country. <p>So it's the right thing to do. There's already a bill in the works. It's supported by independent, nonpartisan economists. It's supported by industry leaders. Congress should pass it right now. <p>And let me just say this&mdash;maybe there are some Members of Congress watching&mdash;if you need some motivation to make this happen, then you should come to Reno and you should visit with folks like the Kellers. I'm not saying the Kellers want all these Members of Congress up in their house. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's bad enough having me and Secret Service in there. [<i>Laughter</i>] But at least they&mdash;they probably wouldn't mind saying hello and talking to them here in front of their house. [<i>Laughter</i>] But they should talk to people whose lives are better because of the action that we took. <p>All over the country, there are people just like Paul and Val, folks just like you, who are doing everything they can to do the right thing: to meet their responsibilities, to look after their families, to raise their kids right, give them good values. You're not looking for a handout. You just want to make sure that somebody is looking out for you, and that when you do the right thing, that you're able to keep everything that you've worked for. That's what folks are looking for and that's what they expect from Washington: to put the politics aside and the electioneering aside and just do what's right for people. <p>So I need all of you, and everybody who's watching, to push Congress on their to-do list. Nag them until they actually get it done. We need to keep moving this country forward. Send them an e-mail, tweet them, write them a letter if you're old-fashioned like me. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But communicate to them that this will make a difference. It's one small step that will help us create the kind of economy that all Americans deserve. And that's an economy that's built to last. An economy where everybody has a fair shot, everybody gets a fair share, everybody is playing by the same set of rules. That's what made us great in the past. That's what's going to make us great in the future. <p>All right. Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America. And give Paul and Val a big round of applause.\" "
"117" "\"We all know the past few years have been difficult for this country. After the worst recession of our lifetimes, it's going to take longer than any of us would like for the economy to fully recover. But there are plenty of steps we can take to speed up the recovery. There are things we can do right now to help create jobs and restore some of the financial security that so many families have lost. <p>Now, the other side isn't so optimistic. They think all we can do is cut taxes, especially for the wealthiest Americans, and go back to letting banks and corporations write their own rules again. That's their plan. <p>But I think they're wrong. We tried their ideas for nearly a decade, and it didn't work out so well. We can't go back to the same policies that got us into this mess. We've got to move forward. We need to build an economy where hard work and responsibility are rewarded, where you can find a good job, own your own home, maybe start a businesses, and give your kids the chance to do even better. <p>That's where we need to go. And I've been pushing Congress to help us get there by passing a few commonsense policies that would make a difference. Democrats and Republicans have already done some important work together, from passing tax cuts for workers, to opening up new markets for American products, to reforming our patent system. But now we need to do more. <p>That's why we made Congress a handy to-do list, just like the kind I get from Michelle. It's short, but each of the ideas on this list will help create jobs and build a stronger economy right now. <p>First, Congress should stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas and use that money to cover moving expenses for companies that bring jobs back to America. <p>Second, Congress should help the millions of Americans who have worked hard and made their mortgage payments on time refinance their mortgages at lower rates and save at least $3,000 a year. <p>Third, Congress should help small-business owners by giving them a tax break for hiring more workers and paying them higher wages. Small businesses are the engine of economic growth in this country. We shouldn't be holding them back; we should be making it easier for them to succeed. <p>Fourth, if Congress fails to act soon, clean energy companies will see their taxes go up and could be forced to lay off employees. These companies are putting Americans to work and helping break our dependence on foreign oil. Congress should extend these tax credits. <p>And finally, Congress should help our veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan by creating a veterans' job corps. Our men and women in uniform have served this country with honor. Now it's our turn to serve them. <p>So that's Congress's to-do list. But now we need them to start crossing things off. I need you to call your Members of Congress, write them an e-mail, tweet, and let them know we can't afford to wait any longer to get things done. Tell them now is the time to take steps we know will grow our economy and create jobs. <p>You're working harder. You're meeting your responsibilities, and your representatives in Washington should do the same. Let's push Congress to do the right thing. Let's keep moving this country forward together. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"118" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you, everybody. Please, please, have a seat. <p>Well, welcome to the White House. It is wonderful to be with all of you. It is especially good to be with somebody who has been fighting on behalf of law enforcement all his life. Everywhere I go, in every community, people see the track record and the legacy of Joe Biden's work when it comes to looking after law enforcement. And so I just want to thank my Vice President, who has shown leadership in this administration to make sure you guys have what you need. <p>My Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, is here. She does outstanding work. The Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, and a longtime police officer, Gil Kerlikowske, is here. Give Gil a big round of applause. Representative John Conyers is here. And of course, I want to welcome the leaders of the National Association of Police Organizations, including your president, Tom Nee. Tom told me he just had a new granddaughter. <p><i>Thomas J. Nee.</i> Grandson. <p><i>The President.</i> Grandson. What's his name? <p><i>Mr. Nee.</i> Nicholas Joseph. <p><i>The President.</i> Nicholas Joseph. So give him a round of applause for that. <p>You know, I look forward to this event each and every year, because it's a chance to say thank you. Every day, hundreds of thousands of law enforcement officers keep our neighborhoods safe, and frankly, they don't ask for a lot. They don't ask for a lot of credit. They don't go to work planning to be heroes. They just do their jobs. <p>But when you put on that badge, you assume a special responsibility. And every time you put it on, you never know if this day will be the day that you've spent your entire career training for&mdash;the day when just doing your job and being a hero are exactly the same thing. For the men and women standing behind me, America's TOP COPS, that day came. And when it did, they were ready. They didn't flinch. They didn't back off. There are people who are alive today only because of their courage. <p>I had a chance to just shake each one of these individuals' hands and express my appreciation to them personally. They're a pretty humble group. Some of them will tell you they don't deserve to be called heroes; they're entitled to their opinion. [<i>Laughter</i>] I disagree with them. I think they are. What else do you call a team that takes down a deranged gunman and saves countless lives? Or a unit that flies a helicopter into dangerous winds and pulls off a daring nighttime rescue? Or an officer who, after being shot three times, switches her gun from her right hand to her left, so that she can return fire until backup arrives? <p>I guarantee you that when the bullets were flying, when lives were on the line, these men and women weren't thinking about bravery. They weren't thinking of themselves. Instead, they were looking out for their fellow officers and for the civilians that they swore to protect. And when they return home, they'll go back to being just another member of the team. <p>But they've earned this moment. Today we celebrate 34 extraordinary individuals, and we recognize the sacrifices they and their fellow officers make. Some of our TOP COPS are still recovering from gunshot wounds. I'm sure that many are, even now, thinking of a partner or a teammate who fell in the line of duty. <p>So we honor their memories today. We honor all those who have put their lives on the line in order to protect their fellow citizens, even if they were complete strangers. I hope that we also pledge to learn something from the example that they set. Because while most of us will never be asked to run straight into a hail of bullets or chase down an armed suspect on foot, we also have responsibilities to meet. <p>For those of us in elected office, that includes helping States and cities to keep first-responders on the job. It includes supporting cutting-edge tools they need, from a high-speed public safety broadband network to a new generation of mobile apps. <p>Even as we do everything we can to support men and women like our TOP COPS, and to make police work safer and more effective, we do have to recognize that one thing will never change. Our safety will always depend on the quiet heroism of ordinary Americans, like the ones that we recognize today. We will be forever in debt to those who wear the badge, to men and women with a deep sense of duty and a willingness to serve and sacrifice on our behalf. And I think these individuals don't mind me saying that they are representative of the sacrifices and that quiet courage that exists among law enforcement officers all across the country, and their families, because I know the strains of families in such a difficult job is significant as well. And those families, those of you who are here today, we want to say thank you to you as well. <p>So again, to the 2012 TOP COPS, thank you for everything you do. God bless you and your families, and God bless the United States of America. All right.\" "
"119" "\"<i>The President.</i> Please, please have a seat. Thank you. Thank you, President Spar, trustees, President Bollinger. Hello, class of 2012! Congratulations on reaching this day. Thank you for the honor of being able to be a part of it. <p>There are so many people who are proud of you&mdash;your parents, family, faculty, friends&mdash;all who share in this achievement. So please give them a big round of applause. To all the moms who are here today, you could not ask for a better Mother's Day gift than to see all of these folks graduate. <p>I have to say, though, whenever I come to these things, I start thinking about Malia and Sasha graduating, and I start tearing up and&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;it's terrible. I don't know how you guys are holding it together. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I will begin by telling a hard truth: I'm a Columbia College graduate. [<i>Laughter</i>] I know there can be a little bit of a sibling rivalry here. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I'm honored nevertheless to be your commencement speaker today, although I've got to say, you set a pretty high bar, given the past 3 years. Hillary Clinton, Meryl Streep, Sheryl Sandberg, these are not easy acts to follow. <p>But I will point out Hillary is doing an extraordinary job as one of the finest Secretaries of State America has ever had. We gave Meryl the Presidential Medal of Arts and Humanities. Sheryl is not just a good friend, she's also one of our economic advisers. So it's like the old saying goes: Keep your friends close and your Barnard commencement speakers even closer. There's wisdom in that. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, the year I graduated&mdash;this area looks familiar&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;the year I graduated was 1983, the first year women were admitted to Columbia. Sally Ride was the first American woman in space. Music was all about Michael and the moonwalk. [<i>Laughter</i>] We had the Walkman&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> Do it! [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> No, no moonwalking. [<i>Laughter</i>] No moonwalking today. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We had the Walkman, not iPods. Some of the streets around here were not quite so inviting. [<i>Laughter</i>] Times Square was not a family destination. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I know this is all ancient history. Nothing worse than commencement speakers droning on about bygone days. [<i>Laughter</i>] But for all the differences, the class of 1983 actually had a lot in common with all of you. For we too were heading out into a world at a moment when our country was still recovering from a particularly severe economic recession. It was a time of change. It was a time of uncertainty. It was a time of passionate political debates. <p>You can relate to this because just as you were starting out finding your way around this campus, an economic crisis struck that would claim more than 5 million jobs before the end of your freshman year. Since then, some of you have probably seen parents put off retirement, friends struggle to find work. And you may be looking toward the future with that same sense of concern that my generation did when we were sitting where you are now. <p>Of course, as young women, you're also going to grapple with some unique challenges, like whether you'll be able to earn equal pay for equal work, whether you'll be able to balance the demands of your job and your family, whether you'll be able to fully control decisions about your own health. <p>And while opportunities for women have grown exponentially over the last 30 years, as young people, in many ways you have it even tougher than we did. This recession has been more brutal, the job losses steeper. Politics seems nastier, Congress more gridlocked than ever. Some folks in the financial world have not exactly been model corporate citizens. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>No wonder that faith in our institutions has never been lower, particularly when good news doesn't get the same kind of ratings as bad news anymore. Every day you receive a steady stream of sensationalism and scandal and stories with a message that suggest change isn't possible, that you can't make a difference, that you won't be able to close that gap between life as it is and life as you want it to be. <p>My job today is to tell you, don't believe it. Because as thing&mdash;as tough as things have been, I am convinced you are tougher. I've seen your passion, and I've seen your service. I've seen you engage, and I've seen you turn out in record numbers. I've heard your voices amplified by creativity and a digital fluency that those of us in older generations can barely comprehend. I've seen a generation eager, impatient even, to step into the rushing waters of history and change its course. <p>And that defiant, can-do spirit is what runs through the veins of American history. It's the lifeblood of all our progress. And it is that spirit which we need your generation to embrace and rekindle right now. <p>See, the question is not whether things will get better; they always do. The question is not whether we've got the solutions to our challenges; we've had them within our grasp for quite some time. We know, for example, that this country would be better off if more Americans were able to get the kind of education that you've received here at Barnard, if more people could get the specific skills and training that employers are looking for today. <p>We know that we'd all be better off if we invest in science and technology that sparks new businesses and medical breakthroughs, if we developed more clean energy so we could use less foreign oil and reduce the carbon pollution that's threatening our planet. <p>We know that we're better off when there are rules that stop big banks from making bad bets with other people's money; when insurance companies aren't allowed to drop your coverage when you need it most or charge women differently from men. Indeed, we know we are better off when women are treated fairly and equally in every aspect of American life, whether it's the salary you earn or the health decisions you make. <p>We know these things to be true. We know that our challenges are eminently solvable. The question is whether, together, we can muster the will&mdash;in our own lives, in our common institutions, in our politics&mdash;to bring about the changes we need. And I'm convinced your generation possesses that will. And I believe that the women of this generation&mdash;that all of you&mdash;will help lead the way. <p>Now, I recognize that's a cheap applause line when you're giving a commencement at Barnard. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's the easy thing to say. But it's true. It is&mdash;in part, it is simple math. Today, women are not just half this country, you're half its workforce. More and more women are outearning their husbands. You're more than half of our college graduates and master's graduates and Ph.D.s. So you've got us outnumbered. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>After decades of slow, steady, extraordinary progress, you are now poised to make this the century where women shape not only their own destiny, but the destiny of this Nation and of this world. <p>But how far your leadership takes this country, how far it takes this world, well, that will be up to you. You've got to want it. It will not be handed to you. And as someone who wants that future&mdash;that better future&mdash;for you and for Malia and Sasha, as somebody who's had the good fortune of being the husband and the father and the son of some strong, remarkable women, allow me to offer just a few pieces of advice. That's obligatory. [<i>Laughter</i>] Bear with me. <p>My first piece of advice is this: Don't just get involved. Fight for your seat at the table. Better yet, fight for a seat at the head of the table. <p>It's been said that the most important role in our democracy is the role of citizen. And indeed, it was 225 years ago today that the Constitutional Convention opened in Philadelphia and our Founders, citizens all, began crafting an extraordinary document. Yes, it had its flaws, flaws that this Nation has strived to protect [perfect; White House correction] over time. Questions of race and gender were unresolved. No woman's signature graced the original document, although we can assume that there were founding mothers whispering smarter things in the ears of the Founding Fathers. I think that's almost certain. <p>What made this document special was that it provided the space&mdash;the possibility&mdash;for those who had been left out of our charter to fight their way in. It provided people the language to appeal to principles and ideals that broadened democracy's reach. It allowed for protest and movements and the dissemination of new ideas that would repeatedly, decade after decade, change the world, a constant forward movement that continues to this day. <p>Our Founders understood that America does not stand still. We are dynamic, not static. We look forward, not back. And now that new doors have been opened for you, you've got an obligation to seize those opportunities. <p>You need to do this not just for yourself, but for those who don't yet enjoy the choices that you've had, the choices you will have. One reason many workplaces still have outdated policies is because women only account for 3 percent of the CEOs at Fortune 500 companies. One reason we're actually refighting long-settled battles over women's rights is because women occupy fewer than one in five seats in Congress. <p>Now, I'm not saying that the only way to achieve success is by climbing to the top of the corporate ladder or running for office. Although, let's face it, Congress would get a lot more done if you did. [<i>Laughter</i>] That I think we're clear about. But if you decide not to sit yourself at the table, at the very least you've got to make sure you have a say in who does. It matters. <p>Before women like Barbara Mikulski and Olympia Snowe and others got to Congress, just to take one example, much of federally funded research on diseases focused solely on their effects on men. It wasn't until women like Patsy Mink and Edith Green got to Congress and passed title IX, 40 years ago this year, that we declared women too should be allowed to compete and win on America's playing fields. Until a woman named Lilly Ledbetter showed up at her office and had the courage to step up and say, you know what, this isn't right, women aren't being treated fairly, we lacked some of the tools we needed to uphold the basic principle of equal pay for equal work. <p>So don't accept somebody else's construction of the way things ought to be. It's up to you to right wrongs. It's up to you to point out injustice. It's up to you to hold the system accountable and sometimes upend it entirely. It's up to you to stand up and to be heard, to write and to lobby, to march, to organize, to vote. Don't be content to just sit back and watch. <p>Those who oppose change, those who benefit from an unjust status quo, have always bet on the public's cynicism or the public's complacency. Throughout American history, though, they have lost that bet, and I believe they will this time as well. But ultimately, class of 2012, that will depend on you. Don't wait for the person next to you to be the first to speak up for what's right. Because maybe, just maybe, they're waiting on you. <p>Which brings me to my second piece of advice: Never underestimate the power of your example. The very fact that you are graduating, let alone that more women now graduate from college than men, is only possible because earlier generations of women&mdash;your mothers, your grandmothers, your aunts&mdash;shattered the myth that you couldn't or shouldn't be where you are. <p>I think of a friend of mine who's the daughter of immigrants. When she was in high school, her guidance counselor told her, you know what, you're just not college material. You should think about becoming a secretary. Well, she was stubborn, so she went to college anyway. She got her master's. She ran for local office, won. She ran for State office, she won. She ran for Congress, she won. And lo and behold, Hilda Solis did end up becoming a secretary. [<i>Laughter</i>] She is America's Secretary of Labor. <p>So think about what that means to a young Latina girl when she sees a Cabinet Secretary that looks like her. Think about what it means to a young girl in Iowa when she sees a Presidential candidate who looks like her. Think about what it means to a young girl walking in Harlem right down the street when she sees a U.N. Ambassador who looks like her. Do not underestimate the power of your example. <p>This diploma opens up new possibilities, so reach back, convince a young girl to earn one too. If you earned your degree in an area where we need more women, like computer science or engineering, reach back and persuade another student to study it too. If you're going into fields where we need more women, like construction or computer engineering, reach back, hire someone new. Be a mentor. Be a role model. <p>Until a girl can imagine herself, can picture herself as a computer programmer or a combatant commander, she won't become one. Until there are women who tell her, ignore our pop culture obsession over beauty and fashion and focus instead on studying and inventing and competing and leading, she'll think those are the only things that girls are supposed to care about. Now, Michelle will say, nothing wrong with caring about it a little bit. [<i>Laughter</i>] You can be stylish and powerful too. That's Michelle's advice. <p>And never forget that the most important example a young girl will ever follow is that of a parent. Malia and Sasha are going to be outstanding women because Michelle and Marian Robinson are outstanding women. So understand your power, and use it wisely. <p>My last piece of advice&mdash;this is simple, but perhaps most important: Persevere. Persevere. Nothing worthwhile is easy. No one of achievement has avoided failure&mdash;sometimes catastrophic failures. But they keep at it. They learn from mistakes. They don't quit. <p>You know, when I first arrived on this campus, it was with little money, fewer options. But it was here that I tried to find my place in this world. I knew I wanted to make a difference, but it was vague how, in fact, I'd go about it. [<i>Laughter</i>] I&mdash;but I wanted to do my part to shape a better world. <p>So even as I worked after graduation in a few unfulfilling jobs here in New York&mdash;I will not list them all&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;even as I went from motley apartment to motley apartment, I reached out. And I started to write letters to community organizations all across the country. And one day, a small group of churches on the South Side of Chicago answered, offering me work with people in neighborhoods hit hard by steel mills that were shutting down and communities where jobs were dying away. <p>The community had been plagued by gang violence, so as&mdash;once I arrived, one of the first things we tried to do was to mobilize a meeting with community leaders to deal with gangs. And I'd worked for weeks on this project. We invited the police, we made phone calls, we went to churches, we passed out flyers. The night of the meeting, we arranged rows and rows of chairs in anticipation of this crowd. And we waited, and we waited. And finally, a group of older folks walked in to the hall and they sat down. And this little old lady raised her hand and asked, \\"Is this where the bingo game is?\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] It was a disaster. Nobody showed up. My first big community meeting&mdash;nobody showed up. <p>And later, the volunteers I worked with told me, that's it, we're quitting. They'd been doing this for 2 years even before I had arrived. They had nothing to show for it. And I'll be honest, I felt pretty discouraged as well. I didn't know what I was doing. I thought about quitting. And as we were talking, I looked outside and saw some young boys playing in a vacant lot across the street. And they were just throwing rocks up at a boarded building. They had nothing better to do&mdash;late at night, just throwing rocks. And I said to the volunteers: \\"Before you quit, answer one question. What will happen to those boys if you quit? Who will fight for them if we don't? Who will give them a fair shot if we leave?\\" <p>And one by one, the volunteers decided not to quit. We went back to those neighborhoods, and we kept at it, and we registered new voters, and we set up afterschool programs, and we fought for new jobs and helped people live lives with some measure of dignity. And we sustained ourselves with those small victories. We didn't set the world on fire. Some of those communities are still very poor. There are still a lot of gangs out there. But I believe that it was those small victories that helped me win the bigger victories of my last 3&frac12; years as President. <p>And I wish I could say that this perseverance came from some innate toughness in me. But the truth is, it was learned. I got it from watching the people who raised me. More specifically, I got it from watching the women who shaped my life. <p>I grew up as the son of a single mom who struggled to put herself through school and make ends meet. She had marriages that fell apart, even went on food stamps at one point to help us get by. But she didn't quit. And she earned her degree and made sure that, through scholarships and hard work, my sister and I earned ours. She used to wake me up when we were living overseas&mdash;wake me up before dawn to study my English lessons. And when I'd complain, she'd just look at me and say, \\"This is no picnic for me either, buster.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And my mom ended up dedicating herself to helping women around the world access the money they needed to start their own businesses; she was an early pioneer in microfinance. And that meant, though, that she was gone a lot, and she had her own struggles trying to figure out balancing motherhood and a career. And when she was gone, my grandmother stepped up to take care of me. <p>She only had a high school education. She got a job at a local bank. She hit the glass ceiling and watched men she once trained promoted up the ladder ahead of her. But she didn't quit. Rather than grow hard or angry each time she got passed over, she kept doing her job as best as she knew how and ultimately ended up being vice president at the bank. She didn't quit. <p>And later on, I met a woman who was assigned to advise me on my first summer job at a law firm. And she gave me such good advice that I married her. [<i>Laughter</i>] And Michelle and I gave everything we had to balance our careers and a young family. But let's face it, no matter how enlightened I must have thought myself to be, it often fell more on her shoulders when I was traveling, when I was away. I know that when she was with our girls, she'd feel guilty that she wasn't giving enough time to her work, and when she was at her work, she'd feel guilty she wasn't giving enough time to our girls. And both of us wished we had some superpower that would let us be in two places at once. But we persisted. We made that marriage work. <p>And the reason Michelle had the strength to juggle everything and put up with me and eventually the public spotlight was because she too came from a family of folks who didn't quit. Because she saw her dad get up and go to work every day even though he never finished college, even though he had crippling MS. She saw her mother, even though she never finished college, in that school, that urban school, every day making sure Michelle and her brother were getting the education they deserved. Michelle saw how her parents never quit. They never indulged in self-pity, no matter how stacked the odds were against them. They didn't quit. <p>Those are the folks who inspire me. People ask me sometimes, who inspires you, Mr. President? Those quiet heroes all across this country&mdash;some of your parents and grandparents who are sitting here&mdash;no fanfare, no articles written about them, they just persevere. They just do their jobs. They meet their responsibilities. They don't quit. I'm only here because of them. They may not have set out to change the world, but in small, important ways, they did. They certainly changed mine. <p>So whether it's starting a business or running for office or raising a amazing family, remember that making your mark on the world is hard. It takes patience. It takes commitment. It comes with plenty of setbacks, and it comes with plenty of failures. <p>But whenever you feel that creeping cynicism, whenever you hear those voices say you can't make a difference, whenever somebody tells you to set your sights lower, the trajectory of this country should give you hope. Previous generations should give you hope. What young generations have done before should give you hope. Young folks who marched and mobilized and stood up and sat in, from Seneca Falls to Selma to Stonewall, didn't just do it for themselves; they did it for other people. <p>That's how we achieved women's rights. That's how we achieved voting rights. That's how we achieved workers' rights. That's how we achieved gay rights. That's how we've made this Union more perfect. <p>And if you're willing to do your part now, if you're willing to reach up and close that gap between what America is and what America should be, I want you to know that I will be right there with you. If you are ready to fight for that brilliant, radically simple idea of America that no matter who you are or what you look like, no matter who you love or what God you worship, you can still pursue your own happiness, I will join you every step of the way. <p>Now more than ever, America needs what you, the class of 2012, has to offer. America needs you to reach high and hope deeply. And if you fight for your seat at the table and you set a better example and you persevere in what you decide to do with your life, I have every faith not only that you will succeed, but that, through you, our Nation will continue to be a beacon of light for men and women, boys and girls, in every corner of the globe. <p>So thank you. Congratulations. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"120" "\"Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat. Have a seat. Well, welcome to the White House, everybody. And congratulations to the LA Galaxy on your third MLS Cup&mdash;number three. <p>Before we start, I want to acknowledge an L.A. native and my outstanding Secretary of Labor&mdash;I don't know how her game is, but she's a fan&mdash;Hilda Solis is here. We've got some proud members of the California delegation of the House of Representatives who are here. We're thrilled to have them. <p>I'm not going to flatter myself by assuming these cameras are for me. [<i>Laughter</i>] I want to thank the Galaxy for letting me share in the spotlight. The truth is, in America, most professional soccer players have the luxury of being able to walk around without being recognized, but not these guys. This is the Miami Heat of soccer. And together, they&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;together they represent one of the most talented lineups that MLS has ever seen. <p>You've got Robbie Keane, all-time leading scorer of the Irish national team. Cousin of mine. [<i>Laughter</i>] Robbie arrived halfway through last season, scored his first goal in the first 21 minutes of his first game. His teammates were so happy to have him that they filled his locker with what they called the pleasures of Ireland: Guinness, Baileys, and Irish Spring. [<i>Laughter</i>] Hopefully Robbie has broadened their horizons a little bit since then. <p>We also have a young up-and-comer on the team, a guy named David Beckham. [<i>Laughter</i>] I have to say I gave David a hard time. I said half his teammates could be his kids. [<i>Laughter</i>] We're getting old, David, although you're holding up better than me. <p>Last year, at the age of 36, David had his best year in MLS, leading the team with 15 assists. He did it despite fracturing his spine halfway through the season, injuring his hamstring the week before the championship game. He is tough. In fact, it is a rare man who can be that tough on the field and also have his own line of underwear. [<i>Laughter</i>] David Beckham is that man. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And then there's the captain, Landon Donovan, who has done more for American soccer than just about anybody. Landon's eye for the net, his will to win are legendary, and once again, he stepped up when his teammates needed him most. <p>After going undefeated at home last season, the Galaxy was struggling in the cold and rainy championship match. But then, in the 72d minute, David headed the ball to Robbie, who made the perfect pass to Landon, who chipped in the game winner. And that set off an all-night celebration in L.A., although my understanding is that David had to get up for carpool duty at 8 a.m.&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;so his day was ending a little early. <p>So the big names came through in the clutch, but they didn't do it alone. For a group with so much firepower, this team shone on defense, recording 17 shutouts. They were led by two local guys, Omar Gonzalez&mdash;give it up&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;and A.J. DeLaGarza, who won a national championship at Maryland. Now they've got another title to their resumes. <p>And of course, a lot of credit goes to Coach Bruce Arena. He took this team from worst to first in just 4 years. And I want to take this opportunity to apologize to Bruce. When I called to congratulate him on winning the Cup, the team was in Indonesia; it was in the middle of the night. Thank you for taking my call and acting like you actually wanted to talk to me. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So everyone who's a part of this club&mdash;the staff, the players, the fans back in L.A.&mdash;together, you pulled off one of the toughest feats in team sports: You lived up to the hype. You combined star power, hard work; it paid off. And I also want to thank you for doing a little Q&A with some of the younger players after we're done. As a soccer dad, I know you've inspired a lot of kids. And today you're giving them an experience that they will never forget. <p>So again, give a big round of applause to the LA Galaxy. Congratulations. Best of luck this season.\" "
"121" "\"Please have a seat. Thank you so much. Thank you, Chuck, for that very kind introduction. Chuck is a proud police officer, he's the proud parent of a police officer, and he has dedicated his life to law enforcement and their families. So I want to thank him for his extraordinary service. <p>I want to recognize the entire Fraternal Order of Police and its leadership, including Jim Pasco, for all your work on behalf of those who wear the badge. I'd like to recognize FOP Auxiliary President Linda Hennie, all the members of the FOP Auxiliary, Members of Congress including Speaker Boehner, Congressman Hoyer, and Senator Leahy, as well as members of my administration. And most of all, I want to acknowledge and thank the families of those who have fallen. <p>As Scripture tells us, \\"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.\\" Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God. <p>Our country's law enforcement officers use force when they have to. They are well armed, and they are well trained. But they never forget that theirs is a mission of peace. Their job is to keep the peace, to allow all of us to enjoy peace in our neighborhoods and for our families. And today, with heavy hearts, we honor those who gave their lives in the service of that mission. Their families are in our thoughts and prayers, as we remember the quiet courage of the men and women we have lost. <p>These are officers like Detective John Falcone, of Poughkeepsie, New York. In February, Detective Falcone responded to a shot fired call on Main Street. And when he arrived on the scene, he saw a man holding a gun with one hand and a small child with the other. <p>In a situation like that, every instinct pushes us towards self-preservation. But when the suspect fled, still holding the child, Detective Falcone didn't think twice. He took off in pursuit, and tragically, in the struggle that followed, he was shot and killed. He is survived by his parents. <p>But there's another survivor as well: A 3-year old child who might not be alive today had it not been for the sacrifice of a hero who gave his life for another. <p>This willingness to risk everything for a complete stranger is extraordinary. And yet, among our Nation's law enforcement officers, it is also commonplace. Last summer, the North Platte River was running high near Douglas, Wyoming. When a teenage girl got caught in the current, Deputy Bryan Gross, of the Converse County Sheriff's Office, jumped in after her. <p>The girl was eventually pulled from the water, but Deputy Gross was swept away. And he is survived by his wife Amy. Today we remember a man who swore to protect his neighbors and who kept that promise no matter what the cost. <p>I suspect that at that moment, Deputy Gross wasn't trying to be a hero, he was just doing his job. You can find that bravery, the courage to do your duty, day in and day out, in so many officers across our country. <p>One of those officers was Deputy Sheriff Suzanne Hopper, from Clark County, Ohio. Deputy Hopper was known as the go-to person in her department, no task was too large or too small. <p>And on New Year's Day 2011, Deputy Hopper arrived at a crime scene and began a preliminary investigation, just as she had done many times during her 12 years of service. But as she was photographing evidence, a man opened the door of his trailer and fired at her with his shotgun, killing her. And today we remember not just a fine officer, but a wife, a mother, and a stepmother. <p>Like all those we honor today, Deputy Hopper is also survived by the fellow officers who she meant so much to and who meant so much to her. Last week, her childhood friend, Sergeant Kris Shultz, posted her flag at a memorial in Ohio. He made a promise in her memory. He said, \\"To honor her, we will keep going and continue to do what we've done, no matter how hard it is at times.\\" <p>We will keep going. There is no pledge that better honors the memory of those we have lost. And there are no memories&mdash;there are no words that better capture the unbreakable spirit of those who wear the badge. <p>Because even in the face of tragedy, I know that so many of you will return home and continue to do what you have always done. Some of you will kiss your husbands or wives goodbye each morning and send them out the door not knowing what might happen that day. Some of you are children and parents, sisters and brothers, whose pride is mixed with worry. <p>And of course, there are the officers themselves. Every American who wears the badge knows the burdens that come with it: the long hours and the stress, the knowledge that just about any moment could be a matter of life or death. You carry these burdens so the rest of us don't have to. <p>And this shared sense of purpose brings you together, and it brings you to our Nation's Capital today. You come from different States and different backgrounds and different walks of life, but I know that you come here as a community&mdash;one family, united by a quiet strength and a willingness to sacrifice on behalf of others. <p>The rest of us can never fully understand what you go through, but please know that we hold you in our hearts, not just today, but always. We are forever in your debt. And it is on behalf of all of us&mdash;the entire American people&mdash;that I offer my thoughts, my prayers, and my thanks. <p>May God shine a light upon the fallen and comfort the mourning. May He protect the peacemakers who protect us every day. And may He bless, now and forever, the United States of America.\" "
"122" "\"Well, listen, what I just want to say to the reporters who are here: You've got three small businesses who are outstanding examples of American entrepreneurship, whether it's food services, retail, construction. All across the country, you're seeing examples of folks who have confidence in the economy and have confidence in America, and it's their ingenuity and their hard work that's allowed them to be successful. <p>But organizations like the SBA have also made a difference, because sometimes private financing isn't willing to take a chance on a couple of young guys who have an idea about starting a great hoagie shop. Sometimes, it may be that a smaller business like a construction business, where it's relatively capital intensive, is going to have difficulty competing with some of the larger companies in terms of buying the equipment that they need. <p>And so actions by Congress and good execution by the Small Business Administration can make a big difference in helping these folks. See, it's not going to do it for them, it's not going to make up for bad service or a bad product, but when you've got a great service or a great product and people are willing to work really hard, then action by Government and the SBA can help give them a hand up and get them started. <p>And this is the reason why we think it's so important for Congress to act right now. The economy is recovering, but we've still got a long way to go. Too many folks are still out of work. We've got some headwinds: the situation in Europe and still a difficult housing market. <p>And so we want to sustain momentum. And one of the ways that we can sustain momentum is for Congress to take some actions right now&mdash;even though it's election season, even though there's gridlock, even though there's partisanship&mdash;take some actions right now that would really make a difference. And we've put together a handy to-do list; it's very short. I've been talking about it over the last couple of weeks. <p>One of the items on that to-do list would be to provide tax breaks for companies like these that are hiring new employees or raising the wages and salaries of their existing employees. Either way, what that does is it gives them an incentive as their expanding to say: Maybe we hire an extra 2 people; maybe we hire an extra 3 people; maybe we hire an extra 10 people. <p>And they will have additional resources to continue to grow and to continue to expand. It's something that in the past has been an idea that garnered support from Democrats and Republicans. There's no reason why we shouldn't act on that right now, the same way that we should be allowing all families to refinance, because if they've got an extra $3,000 in their pocket, then they can buy more hoagies or go shop for some outstanding organic foods. <p>And it's the same reason why all the other items on the to-do list could really make a difference. For example, some of these small businesses may be interested in hiring a veteran, and we've already done a lot of work on veterans hiring. A lot of the items on the to-do list is a veterans job corps that could potentially put some veterans who are coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan to work rebuilding America. <p>So my message to Congress&mdash;and I'm going to have a chance to see the congressional leadership when I get back to the White House; I'm going to offer them some hoagies while they're there&mdash;is let's go ahead and act to help build and sustain momentum for our economy. There will be more than enough time for us to campaign and politick, but let's make sure that we don't lose steam at a time when a lot of folks like these are feeling pretty optimistic and are ready to go. <p>All right. Thank you, everybody.\" "
"123" "\"<i>The President.</i> Please be seated. Thank you, General Rutherford. Good afternoon, everyone. We gather today to present the Medal of Honor for valor above and beyond the call of duty. In so doing we celebrate the soldier, the life that produced such gallantry, Specialist Leslie H. Sabo, Jr. <p>Today is also a solemn reminder that when an American does not come home from war, it is our military families and veterans who bear that sacrifice for a lifetime. They are spouses, like Rose Mary, who all these years since Vietnam still displays in her home her husband's medals and decorations. They are siblings, like Leslie's big brother George, who carries the childhood memories of his little brother tagging along at his side. And they are our veterans, like the members of Bravo Company, who still speak of their brother Les with reverence and with love. <p>Rose, George, Bravo Company, more than a hundred family and friends, Michelle and I are honored to welcome you to the White House. The Medal of Honor is the highest military decoration that America can bestow. It reflects the gratitude of the entire Nation. So we're joined by Members of Congress and leaders from across our Armed Forces, including Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta; Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Sandy Winnefeld; from the Army, Secretary John McHugh and Chief of Staff General Ray Odierno; and from the Marine Corps, the Commandant, General Jim Amos. <p>We're honored to be joined by Vietnam veterans, including recipients of the Medal of Honor. And we're joined by those who have carried on Les's legacy in our time, in Iraq and Afghanistan, members of the 101st Airborne Division, the legendary Screaming Eagles. <p>This gathering of soldiers, past and present, could not be more timely. As a nation, we've ended the war in Iraq. We are moving towards an end to the war in Afghanistan. After a decade of war, our troops are coming home. And this month, we'll begin to mark the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam war, a time when, to our shame, our veterans did not always receive the respect and the thanks they deserved, a mistake that must never be repeated. And that's where I want to begin today, because the story of this Medal of Honor reminds us of our sacred obligations to all who serve. <p>It was 1999, around Memorial Day, and a Vietnam vet from the 101st was at the National Archives. He was doing research for an article. And there, among the stacks, an archivist brought him a box. And he took off the lid. And inside, he found a file, marked with the name \\"Leslie H. Sabo, Jr.\\" And there it was, a proposed citation for the Medal of Honor. And so this Vietnam veteran set out to find answers. Who was Leslie Sabo? What did he do? And why did he never receive that medal? Today, four decades after Leslie's sacrifice, we can set the record straight. <p>I just spent some time with Rose and George and the Sabo family. Last week marked 42 years since Les gave his life. This soldier, this family, has a uniquely American story. Les was actually born in Europe, after World War II, to a family of Hungarian refugees. And as the Iron Curtain descended, they boarded a boat for America and arrived at Ellis Island, past the Statue of Liberty. They settled in the steel town of Ellwood City, Pennsylvania. Les's father worked hard, pulled his family into the middle class. And when Les was a teenager, the family went to the county courthouse together, raised their hands and became proud American citizens. <p>They say that Les was one of the nicest guys you'd ever want to meet. He loved a good joke. He loved to bowl. He could have given me some tips. [<i>Laughter</i>] Rose says he was pretty good-looking too. That's what I hear. <p>He'd do anything for anybody. And when George went to college, Les looked after their mom. When George went to night school, Les helped care for his three young sons. When Les fell in love with Rose&mdash;who couldn't wait to start a life together&mdash;he slipped the ring on her finger, right there in his car, while stopped at a red light. [<i>Laughter</i>] And as he headed out for Vietnam, he stopped at a shop and ordered some flowers for his mom, for Mother's Day, and for Rose, for her birthday. <p>For Les and Bravo Company, those early months of 1970 were a near constant battle, pushing through jungles and rice paddies in their heavy packs, enduring incredible heat and humidity, the monsoon rains that never seemed to stop, an enemy that could come out of nowhere and then vanish just as fast. For his bravery in battle, Les earned the respect of his comrades. And for his family, he wrote home every chance he could. <p>When American forces were sent into Cambodia, Bravo Company helped lead the way. They were moving up a jungle trail. They entered a clearing. And that's when it happened&mdash;an ambush. Some 50 American soldiers were nearly surrounded by some 100 North Vietnamese fighters. Said Les's comrades: \\"The enemy was everywhere\\"&mdash;in bunkers, behind trees, up in the trees, shooting down. And they opened up on them. <p>And Les was in the rear, and he could have stayed there. But those fighters were unloading on his brothers. So Les charged forward and took several of those fighters out. The enemy moved to outflank them. And Les attacked and drove them back. Ammo was running low. Les ran across a clearing to grab more. An enemy grenade landed near a wounded American. Les picked it up and he threw it back. And as that grenade exploded, he shielded that soldier with his own body. <p>Throughout history, those who have known the horror of war, and the love behind all great sacrifice, have tried to put those emotions into words. After the First World War, one soldier wrote this: \\"They are more to me than life, these voices, they are more than motherliness and more than fear; they are the strongest, most comforting thing there is anywhere: they are the voices of my comrades.\\" <p>Those were the voices Leslie Sabo heard that day: his comrades, pinned down, at risk of being overrun. And so, despite his wounds, despite the danger, Leslie did something extraordinary. He began to crawl straight toward an enemy bunker, its machine guns blazing. Those who were there said the enemy zeroed in with everything they had. But Les kept crawling, kept pulling himself along, closer to that bunker, even as the bullets hit the ground all around him. <p>And then, he grabbed a grenade and he pulled the pin. It's said he held that grenade and didn't throw it until the last possible moment, knowing it would take his own life, but knowing he could silence that bunker. And he did. He saved his comrades who meant more to him than life. <p>Leslie Sabo left behind a wife who adored him, a brother who loved him, parents who cherished him, and family and friends who admired him. But they never knew. For decades, they never knew their Les had died a hero. The fog of war, and paperwork that seemed to get lost in the shuffle, meant this story was almost lost to history. <p>And so today we thank that Vietnam vet who found Les's files in the Archives and who was determined to right this wrong&mdash;that's Tony Mabb, who joins us here today. Where's Tony? Tony, thank you. <p>We salute Les's buddy, George Koziol, who, wounded in his hospital bed, first drafted the citation we'll hear today and who spent the last years of his life fighting to get Les the recognition that he deserved. <p>And most of all, we salute the men who were there in that clearing in the jungle. More than two dozen were wounded. Along with Les, seven other soldiers gave their lives that day. And those who came home took on one last mission, and that was to make sure America would honor their fallen brothers. They had no idea how hard it would be or how long it would take. <p>Instead of being celebrated, our Vietnam veterans were often shunned. They were called many things, when there was only one thing that they deserved to be called, and that was American patriots. In 2 weeks, on Memorial Day, Michelle and I will join our Vietnam veterans and their families at the wall to mark the 50th anniversary of their service. It will be another chance for America to say to our Vietnam veterans what should have been said when you first came home: You did your job; you served with honor; you made us proud. And here today, as I think Les would have wanted it, I'd ask the members of Bravo Company to stand and accept the gratitude of our Nation. <p>So yes, this Medal of Honor is bestowed on a single soldier for his singular courage. But it speaks to the service of an entire generation and to the sacrifice of so many military families. Because, you see, there is one final chapter to this story. <p>You'll recall that as he shipped out to Vietnam, Les stopped at that flower shop. Well, the day he gave his life was Mother's Day. And on that day the flowers he had ordered arrived for his mom. And the day he was laid to rest was the day before Rose's birthday. And she received the bouquet he had sent her&mdash;a dozen red roses. That's the kind of guy&mdash;the soldier, the American&mdash;that we celebrate today. <p>Les's mother and father did not live to see this day. But in his story we see the shining values that keep our military strong and keep America great. We see the patriotism of families who give our Nation a piece of their heart: their husbands and wives, their sons and their daughters. And we see the devotion of citizens who put on the uniform, who kiss their families goodbye, who are willing to lay down their lives so that we can live ours in peace and in freedom. <p>No words will ever be truly worthy of their service. And no honor can ever fully repay their sacrifice. But on days such as this we can pay tribute. We can express our gratitude. And we can thank God that there are patriots and families such as these. So on behalf of the American people, please join me in welcoming Rose for the reading of the citation. <p>[<i>At this point, Maj. Gary Marlowe, USAF, Air Force Aide to the President, read the citation, and the President presented the medal. Following the presentation, Brig. Gen. Donald L. Rutherford, USA, Chief of Chaplains, said a prayer.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> I want to thank everybody for their attendance. Please give another round of applause to the Sabo family. I hope that everybody enjoys the reception. I hear the food is pretty good around here. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>God bless you. God bless our troops. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"124" "\"Please, have a seat. Thank you. Well, good morning, everybody. Thank you, Catherine Bertini and Dan Glickman and everyone at the Chicago Council. We were originally going to convene, along with the G-8, in Chicago. But since we're not doing this in my hometown, I wanted to bring a little bit of Chicago to Washington. [<i>Laughter</i>] It is wonderful to see all of you. It is great to see quite a few young people here as well. And I want to acknowledge a good friend. We were just talking backstage; he was my inspiration for singing at the Apollo. [<i>Laughter</i>] Bono is here, and it is good to see him. <p>Now, this weekend at the G-8, we'll be represented by many of the world's largest economies. We face urgent challenges: creating jobs, addressing the situation in the euro zone, sustaining the global economic recovery. But even as we deal with these issues, I felt it was also important, also critical to focus on the urgent challenge that confronts some 1 billion men, women, and children around the world: the injustice of chronic hunger, the need for long-term food security. <p>So tomorrow at the G-8, we're going to devote a special session to this challenge. We're launching a major new partnership to reduce hunger and lift tens of millions of people from poverty. And we'll be joined by leaders from across Africa, including the first three nations to undertake this effort and who join us here today. I want to acknowledge them: Prime Minister Meles of Ethiopia, President Mills of Ghana, and President Kikwete of Tanzania. Welcome. <p>I also want to acknowledge President Yayi of Benin, chair of the African Union, which has shown great leadership in this cause. And two of our leaders in this effort: USAID Administrator&mdash;every time I meet him, I realize that I was an underachiever in my thirties&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;Dr. Raj Shah is here; and the CEO of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, Daniel Yohannes. <p>Now, this partnership is possible because so many leaders in Africa and around the world have made food security a priority. And that's why, shortly after I took office, I called for the international community to do its part. And at the G-8 meeting 3 years ago in L'Aquila, in Italy, that's exactly what we did, mobilizing more than $22 billion for a global food security initiative. <p>After decades in which agriculture and nutrition didn't always get the attention they deserved, we put the fight against global hunger where it should be, which is at the forefront of global development. And this reflected the new approach to development that I called for when I visited Ghana, hosted by President Mills, and that I unveiled at the last summit on the Millennium Development Goals. <p>It's rooted in our conviction that true development involves not only delivering aid, but also promoting economic growth&mdash;broad-based, inclusive growth that actually helps nations develop and lift people out of poverty. The whole purpose of development is to create the conditions where assistance is no longer needed, where people have the dignity and the pride of being self-sufficient. <p>You see our new approach in our promotion of trade and investment, of building on the outstanding work of the African Growth and Opportunity Act. You see it in the global partnership to promote open government, which empowers citizens and helps to fuel development, creates the framework, the foundation for economic growth. <p>You see it in the international effort we're leading against corruption, including greater transparency so taxpayers receive every dollar they're due from the extraction of natural resources. You see it in our Global Health Initiative, which instead of just delivering medicine is also helping to build a stronger health system, delivering better care and saving lives. <p>And you see our new approach in our food security initiative, Feed the Future. Instead of simply handing out food, we've partnered with countries in pursuit of ambitious goals: better nutrition to prevent the stunting and the death of millions of children, and raising the incomes of millions of people, most of them farmers. And the good news is we're on track to meet our goals. <p>As President, I consider this a moral imperative. As the wealthiest nation on Earth, I believe the United States has a moral obligation to lead the fight against hunger and malnutrition and to partner with others. <p>So we take pride in the fact that, because of smart investments in nutrition and agriculture and safety nets, millions of people in Kenya and Ethiopia did not need emergency aid in the recent drought. <p>But when tens of thousands of children die from the agony of starvation, as in Somalia, that sends us a message we've still got a lot of work to do. It's unacceptable. It's an outrage. It's an affront to who we are. <p>So food security is a moral imperative, but it's also an economic imperative. History teaches us that one of the most effective ways to pull people and entire nations out of poverty is to invest in their agriculture. And as we've seen from Latin America to Africa to Asia, a growing middle class also means growing markets, including more customers for American exports that support American jobs. So we have a self-interest in this. <p>It's a moral imperative, it's an economic imperative, and it is a security imperative. For we've seen how spikes in food prices can plunge millions into poverty, which in turn can spark riots that cost lives and can lead to instability. And this danger will only grow if a surging global population isn't matched by surging food production. So reducing malnutrition and hunger around the world advances international peace and security, and that includes the national security of the United States. <p>Perhaps nowhere do we see this link more vividly than in Africa. On the one hand, we see Africa as an emerging market. African economies are some of the fastest growing in the world. We see a surge in foreign investment. We see a growing middle class, hundreds of millions of people connected by mobile phones, more young Africans online than ever before. There's hope and some optimism. And all of this has yielded impressive progress: for the first time ever, a decline in extreme poverty in Africa; an increase in crop yields; a dramatic drop in child deaths. That's the good news, and in part, it's due to some of the work of the people in this room. <p>On the other hand, we see an Africa that still faces huge hurdles: stark inequalities, most Africans still living on less than $2 a day, climate change that increases the risk of drought and famine. All of which perpetuates stubborn barriers in agriculture, in the agricultural sector, from the bottlenecks in infrastructure that prevent food from getting to market to the lack of credit, especially for small farmers, most of whom are women. <p>I've spoken before about relatives I have in Kenya who live in villages where hunger is sometimes a reality, despite the fact that African farmers can be some of the hardest working people on Earth. Most of the world's unused arable land is in Africa. Fifty years ago, Africa was an exporter of food. There is no reason why Africa should not be feeding itself and exporting food again. There is no reason for that. <p>So that's why we're here. In Africa and around the world, progress isn't coming fast enough. And economic growth can't just be for the lucky few at the top, it's got to be broad based, for everybody, and a good place to start is in the agricultural sector. So even as the world responds with food aid in a crisis&mdash;as we've done in the Horn of Africa&mdash;communities can't go back just to the way things were, vulnerable as before, waiting for the next crisis to happen. Development has to be sustainable, and as an international community, we have to do better. <p>So here at the G-8, we're going to build on the progress we've made so far. Today I can announce a new global effort we're calling a New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition. And to get the job done, we're bringing together all the key players around a shared commitment. Let me describe it. <p>Governments, like those in Africa, that are committed to agricultural development and food security, they agree to take the lead, building on their own plans by making tough reforms and attracting investment. Donor countries, including G-8 members and international organizations, agree to more closely align our assistance with these country plans. And the private sector&mdash;from large multinationals to small African cooperatives, your NGOs, and civil society groups&mdash;agree to make concrete and continuing commitments as well, so that there is an alignment between all these sectors. <p>And I know some have asked, in a time of austerity, whether this New Alliance is just a way for governments to shift the burden onto somebody else. I want to be clear: The answer is no. As President, I can assure you that the United States will continue to meet our responsibilities, so that even in these tough fiscal times, we will continue to make historic investments in development. And by the way, we're going to be working to end hunger right here in the United States as well. That's&mdash;that will continue to be a priority. <p>We'll continue to be the leader in times of crisis, as we've done as the single largest donor of aid in the Horn of Africa and as we focus on the drought in the Sahel. That's why I've proposed to continue increasing funds for food security. So I want to be clear: The United States will remain a global leader in development in partnership with you. And we will continue to make available food&mdash;or emergency aid. That will not change. But what we do want to partner with you on is a strategy so that emergency aid becomes less and less relevant as a consequence of greater and greater sustainability within these own countries. <p>That's how development is supposed to work. That's what I mean by a new approach that challenges more nations, more organizations, more companies, more NGOs, challenges individuals&mdash;some of the young people who are here&mdash;to step up and play a role. Because government cannot and should not do this alone. This has to be all hands on deck. <p>And that's the essence of this New Alliance. So G-8 nations will pledge to honor the commitments we made in L'Aquila. We must do what we say, no empty promises. And at the same time, we'll deliver the assistance to launch this new effort. Moreover, we're committing to replenish the very successful Global Agricultural and Food Security Program. That's an important part of this overall effort. <p>Next, we're going to mobilize more private capital. Today I can announce that 45 companies&mdash;from major international corporations to African companies and cooperatives&mdash;have pledged to invest more than $3 billion to kick off this effort. And we're also going to fast-track new agricultural projects so they reach those in need even quicker. <p>Third, we're going to speed up the development and delivery of innovation&mdash;better seeds, better storage&mdash;that unleash huge leaps in food production. And we're going to tap that mobile phone revolution in Africa so that more data on agriculture&mdash;whether it's satellite imagery or weather forecasts or market prices&mdash;are put in the hands of farmers so they know where to plant and when to plant and when to sell. <p>Fourth, we're joining with the World Bank and other partners to better understand and manage the risks that come with changing food prices and a changing climate, because a change in prices or a single bad season should not plunge a family, a community, or a region into crisis. <p>And finally, we're going to keep focusing on nutrition, especially for young children, because we know the effects of poor nutrition can last a lifetime: It's harder to learn, it's harder to earn a living. When there is good nutrition, especially in those thousand days during pregnancy up to the child's second birthday, it means healthier lives for that child and that mother. And it's the smart thing to do because better nutrition means lower health care costs and it means less need for assistance later on. <p>That's what we're going to do. We're going to sustain the commitments we made 3 years ago, and we're going to speed things up. And we're starting with these three countries&mdash;Tanzania, Ghana, and Ethiopia&mdash;precisely because of their record in improving agriculture and food security. <p>But this is just the beginning. In the coming months, we'll expand to six countries. We'll welcome other countries that are committed to making tough reforms. We'll welcome more companies that are willing to invest. We're going to hold ourselves accountable; we'll measure results. And we'll stay focused on clear goals: boosting farmers' incomes and, over the next decade, helping 50 million men, women, and children lift themselves out of poverty. <p>And I know there are going to be skeptics; there always are. We see heartbreaking images&mdash;fields turned to dust, babies with distended bellies&mdash;and we say it's hopeless and some places are condemned to perpetual poverty and hunger. But the people in this room disagree. I think most of the American people disagree. Anyone who claims great change is impossible, I say look at the extraordinary successes in development. <p>Look at the Green Revolution, which pulled hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. Look at microfinance, which has empowered so many rural poor, something my mother was involved with. Look at the huge expansion of education, especially for girls. Look at the progress we've made with vaccines&mdash;from smallpox to measles to pneumonia to diarrhea&mdash;which have saved the lives of hundreds of millions. And of course, look at the global fight against HIV/AIDS, which has brought us to the point where we can imagine what was once unthinkable, and that is the real possibility of an AIDS-free generation. <p>Moreover, we are already making progress in this area right now. In Rwanda, farmers are selling more coffee and lifting their families out of poverty. In Haiti, some farmers have more than doubled their yields. In Bangladesh, in the poorest region, they've had their first-ever surplus of rice. There are millions of farmers and families whose lives are being transformed right now because of some of the strategies that we're talking about. And that includes a farmer in Ethiopia who got a new loan, increased production, hired more workers. And he said: \\"This salary changed my life. My kids can now go to school.\\" <p>And we start getting the wheel turning in the direction of progress. We can do this. We're already doing it. We just need to bring it all together. We can unleash the change that reduces hunger and malnutrition. We can spark the kind of economic growth that lifts people and nations out of poverty. This is the new commitment that we're making. And I pledge to you today that this will remain a priority as long as I am United States President. Thank very much. God bless you. Thank you. God bless America.\" "
"125" "\"For the past 3&frac12; years, we've been fighting our way back from an historic economic crisis, one caused by breathtaking irresponsibility on the part of some on Wall Street who treated our financial system like a casino. Not only did that behavior nearly destroy the financial system, it cost our economy millions of jobs, hurt middle class families, and left taxpayers holding the bag. <p>Since then, we've recovered taxpayer dollars that were used to stabilize troubled banks. And we've put in place Wall Street reform with smarter, tougher, commonsense rules that serve one primary purpose: to prevent a crisis like that from ever happening again. And yet for the past 2 years, too many Republicans in Congress and an army of financial industry lobbyists actually have been waging an all-out battle to delay, defund, and dismantle Wall Street reform. <p>Recently, we've seen why we can't let that happen. We found out that a big mistake at one of our biggest banks resulted in a two-billion-dollar loss. While that bank can handle a loss of that size, other banks may not have been able to. And without Wall Street reform, we could have found ourselves with the taxpayers once again on the hook for Wall Street's mistakes. <p>That's why it's so important that Members of Congress stand on the side of reform, not against it, because we can't afford to go back to an era of weak regulation and little oversight, where excessive risk-taking on Wall Street and a lack of basic oversight in Washington nearly destroyed our economy. We can't afford to go back to that brand of you're-on-your-own economics. Not after the American people have worked so hard to come back from this crisis. <p>We've got to keep moving forward. We've got to finish the job of implementing this reform and putting these rules in place. <p>These new rules say that if you're a big bank or financial institution, you now have to hold more cash on hand so that if you make a bad decision, you pay for it, not the taxpayers. <p>You have to write out a living will that details how you'll be winding down if you do fail. The new law takes away big bonuses and paydays from failed CEOs, while giving shareholders a say on executive salaries. <p>And for the first time in our Nation's history, we have in place a consumer watchdog whose sole job is to look out for working families by protecting them from deceptive and unfair practices. <p>So unless you run a financial institution whose business model is built on cheating consumers or making risky bets that could damage the whole economy, you have nothing to fear from Wall Street reform. Yes, it discourages big banks and financial institutions from making risky bets with taxpayer-insured money. And it encourages them to do things that actually help the economy, like extending loans to entrepreneurs with good ideas, to middle class families who want to buy a home, to students who want to pursue a higher education. <p>That's what Wall Street reform is all about, making this economy stronger for you. And we're going to keep working to recover every job lost to the recession, to build an economy where hard work and responsibility are once again rewarded, to restore an America where everyone has a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same rules. <p>I believe the free market is one of the greatest forces for progress in human history, that businesses are the engine of growth, that risk takers and innovators should be celebrated. But I also believe that at its best, the free market has never been a license to take whatever you want, however you can get it. Alongside our entrepreneurial spirit and rugged individualism, America only prospers when we meet our obligations to one another and to future generations. <p>If you agree with me, let your Member of Congress know. Tell them to spend less time working to undermine rules that are there to protect the economy and spend more time actually working to strengthen the economy. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"126" "\"All right, everybody, listen up. First of all, I want to welcome all the leaders here. The press, you're welcome as long as you don't break anything. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>This is, by the way, the largest gathering ever of international leaders at Camp David, and I'm glad that we could arrange for good weather. Last night we had a chance to discuss some core issues that affect our common security. And I want to say that we are unified when it comes to our approach with Iran. I think all of us agree that Iran has the right to peaceful nuclear power, but that its continuing violations of international rules and norms and its inability thus far to convince the world community that it is not pursuing the weaponization of nuclear power is something of grave concern to all of us. <p>We are hopeful about the discussions that will be taking [place; White House correction] in Baghdad, but all of us are firmly committed to continuing with the approach of sanctions and pressure in combination with diplomatic discussions. And our hope is, is that we can resolve this issue in a peaceful fashion that respects Iran's sovereignty and its rights in the international community, but also recognizes its responsibilities. <p>We had a discussion about Syria. And we all believe that a peaceful resolution and political transition in Syria is preferable. We are all deeply concerned about the violence that's taking place there and the loss of life. We are supportive of the Annan plan, but we agreed&mdash;and I expect this will be reflected in our communique&mdash;that the Annan plan has to be fully implemented and that a political process has to move forward in a more timely fashion to resolve that issue. <p>We also had a chance to discuss the situation in North Korea. All of us agree that North Korea is violating its international obligations and that there is a path for them to rejoin the international community, but that path is not going to be&mdash;or that objective will not be achieved if they continue with the provocative actions that they have shown over the last several months. <p>And on a brighter note, we had the opportunity to discuss Burma, and all of us are hopeful that the political process and transition&mdash;transformation that is beginning to take place there takes root. Many of us have taken action to open up trade and investment with Burma for the first time in many years, and we have had discussions with the leadership there. Our hope is, is that this process will continue, and we're going to do everything that we can to encourage that process. <p>Finally, we had a brief discussion around the issue of women's empowerment, where we agreed that both when it comes to economic development and when it comes to peace and security issues, empowering women to have a seat at the table and get more engaged and more involved in these processes can be extraordinarily fruitful. And this is something that we will also be introducing during the G-20. <p>So I want to thank all the leaders, despite the fact that at least those coming from across the Atlantic ended up staying up, I guess, until six in the morning their time. The discussions were very fruitful. This morning we're going to be spending a lot of time on economic issues. Obviously, the euro zone will be one topic, and all of us are absolutely committed to making sure that both growth and stability, and fiscal consolidation, are part of a overall package that all of us have to pursue in order to achieve the kind of prosperity for our citizens that we're looking for. <p>We'll also be talking about uncertainty in the energy markets and how we can help to resolve some of those issues. And we'll be spending some time talking about development in the Middle East, North Africa, and our capacity to sustain economic development in Afghanistan. Obviously, in Chicago, during the NATO meeting, we'll spend more time talking about security matters, but here we want to make sure that we recognize the need for Afghanistan to be able to sustain a development agenda moving forward as we begin to transition out of war. <p>So again, I want to thank all the leaders for being here. So far, this has been a frank and useful conversation, and it gives me great optimism about our ability to meet these challenges in the future. <p>All right. Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"127" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. It has been a great pleasure to host the leaders of some of the world's largest economies here at Camp David. I think the surroundings gave us an opportunity to hold some intimate discussions and make some genuine progress. <p>For the past 3 years, our nations have worked together and with others first to rescue a global economy from freefall, then to wrestle it back to a path of recovery and growth. Our progress has been tested at times by shocks like the disaster in Japan, for example. Today, it's threatened once again by the serious situation in the euro zone. <p>As all the leaders here today agreed, growth and jobs must be our top priority. A stable, growing European economy is in everybody's best interests, including America's. Europe is our largest economic partner. Put simply, if a company is forced to cut back in Paris or Madrid, that might mean less business for manufacturers in Pittsburgh or Milwaukee. And that might mean a tougher time for families and communities that depend on that business. <p>And that's why, even as we've confronted our own economic challenges over the past few years, we've collaborated closely with our European allies and partners as they've confronted theirs. And today we discussed ways they can promote growth and job creation right now, while still carrying out reforms necessary to stabilize and strengthen their economies for the future. <p>We know it is possible in part based on our own experience here. In my earliest days in office, we took decisive steps to confront our own financial crisis, from making banks submit to stress tests to rebuilding their capital, and we put in place some of the strongest financial reforms since the Great Depression. <p>At the same time, we worked to get our own fiscal house in order in a responsible way. And through it all, even as we worked to stabilize the financial sector and bring down our deficits and debt over the longer term, we stayed focused on growing the economy and creating jobs in the immediate term. <p>Of course, we still have a lot of work to do. Too many of our people are still looking for jobs that pay the bills. Our deficits are still too high. But after shrinking by nearly 9 percent the quarter before I took office, America's economy has now grown for almost 3 consecutive years. After losing hundreds of thousands of jobs a month, our businesses have created more than 4 million jobs over the past 26 months. Exports have surged and manufacturers are investing in America again. <p>And this economic growth then gives us more room to take a balanced approach to reducing our deficit and debt, while preserving our investments in the drivers of growth and job creation over the long term: education, innovation, and infrastructure for the 21st century. <p>Europe's situation, of course, is more complicated. They've got a political and economic crisis facing Greece, slow growth and very high unemployment in several countries. And what's more, when they want to decide on a way to move forward, there are 17 countries in the euro zone that need to come to an agreement. We recognize that, and we respect that. <p>But the direction the debate has taken recently should give us confidence. Europe has taken significant steps to manage the crisis. Individual countries and the European Union as a whole have engaged in significant reforms that will increase the prospects of long-term growth. And there's now an emerging consensus that more must be done to promote growth and job creation right now in the context of these fiscal and structural reforms. That consensus for progress was strengthened here at Camp David. <p>Today we agreed that we must take steps to boost confidence and to promote growth and demand while getting our fiscal houses in order. We agreed upon the importance of a strong and cohesive euro zone and affirmed our interest in Greece staying in the euro zone while respecting its commitments. Of course, we also recognized the painful sacrifices that the Greek people are making at this difficult time, and I know that my European colleagues will carry forward these discussions as they prepare for meetings next week. <p>The leaders here understand the stakes. They know the magnitude of the choices they have to make and the enormous political, economic, and social costs if they don't. In addition to our G-8 meeting, it was&mdash;I was able to talk to them individually over the last 2 days, and I reaffirmed that Europe has the capacity to meet its challenges, and America is not only confident in their ability to meet their challenges, but we are supportive of their efforts. <p>This morning I updated you on the progress we made last night in our discussion of security issues. And today, following our discussion of the economy, we also made progress on a range of other important challenges. We discussed the importance of pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy for energy security in a safe and sustainable way. Leaders agreed to join a new U.S.-led coalition to address climate change, in part by reducing short-lived pollutants. And in the face of increasing disruptions in the supply of oil, we agreed that we must closely monitor global energy markets. Together, we stand ready to call upon the International Energy Agency to take action to ensure that the market remains fully and timely supplied. <p>We also announced a new alliance on food security with African leaders and the private sector as part of an effort to lift 50 million people out of poverty over the next decade. We discussed our support for a sustainable Afghan economy as we wind down the war, and we reaffirmed our support for the democratic transitions underway in the Middle East and North Africa. <p>So I'm very pleased that we were able to make some important progress here at Camp David, and we're going to keep at it. Tomorrow we begin our NATO summit in my hometown of Chicago, where we'll discuss our plans to responsibly end the war in Afghanistan. Next week, European leaders will gather to discuss their next steps on the euro zone. Next month, we'll all have the chance to continue this collaboration at the G-20 in Mexico. And I look forward to building on this progress in promoting economic recovery in the weeks and months to come. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. I hope you've enjoyed the great views and the great weather.\" "
"128" "\"Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary General Anders, I want to take this opportunity on behalf of all of us to thank you for your outstanding leadership over these past 3 years. And I want to begin by welcoming each and every one of you to my hometown. I hope everybody has enjoyed themselves. I understand some took a architectural boat tour, some have run along the lakefront. Chicago is a great place, and we look forward to having you back again. <p>As Anders mentioned, so many people here in Chicago trace their roots back to NATO countries. So it's especially fitting that Chicago is the first American city outside of Washington, DC, ever to host a NATO summit. Given the moment of silence we just observed, I also want to take the opportunity to salute Admiral Stavidris, General Abrial, General Allen, and all of our men and women who are serving in uniform on our behalf, and especially those who are serving today in Afghanistan. <p>For over 65 years, our alliance has been the bedrock of our common security, our freedom, and our prosperity. And though the times may have changed, the fundamental reason for our alliance has not. Our nations are stronger and more prosperous when we stand together. In good times and in bad, our alliance has endured; in fact, it has thrived, because we share an unbreakable commitment to the freedom and security of our citizens. <p>We've seen this from the cold war to the Balkans, from Afghanistan to Libya. And that's the spirit that we need to sustain here in Chicago, and with an alliance that is focused squarely on the future. <p>When we last met in Lisbon, we agreed to a bold plan of action to revitalize the alliance and ensure that we have the tools that are required to confront a changing and uncertain strategic landscape. Here, at this session, we can reaffirm our Article 5 commitment to our collective defense and to investing in the defense capabilities and new technologies that meet our collective security needs. <p>In these difficult economic times, we can work together and pull our resources. NATO is a force multiplier, and the initiatives we will endorse today will allow each of our nations to accomplish what none of us could achieve alone. We can all be proud that in Lisbon we committed, and now in Chicago we are delivering. <p>Over the next 2 days, we'll meet&mdash;first as allies and then with President Karzai and our international partners&mdash;to chart the next phase of the transition in Afghanistan. Just as we've sacrificed together for our common security, we will stand together, united, in our determination to complete this mission. <p>And finally, I look forward to our meeting with NATO's neighbors and our partners around the world who have been so critical to NATO operations, as in Afghanistan and Libya. It will be another reminder that NATO is truly a hub of a network of global security partners. There is nothing else like it on Earth. <p>So again, thank you, Mr. Secretary General, for your outstanding leadership. Thank you to all my fellow leaders and friends who are here. Welcome to Chicago. I'm confident that the next 2 days are going to help to sustain and strengthen the strongest and most successful alliance that the world has ever known.\" "
"129" "\"Well, good morning, everyone. And for those who are joining us for the first time, welcome to Chicago. I was just hearing from a few folks who are not NATO members that they had fun on the town last night. Hopefully, no stories in the press. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We come together as 50 nations&mdash;NATO allies and partners&mdash;that make up the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. I want to welcome the presence of President Karzai, as well as officials from central Asia and Russia, nations that have an important perspective and that continue to provide critical transit for ISAF supplies. <p>The presence of so many leaders and nations illustrates once again that this is a truly international mission, and that's because the region and the world have a profound interest in an Afghanistan that is stable, that is secure, and that is not a source of attacks on other nations. And today, as always, our thoughts are with our brave forces who are serving in this vital mission. <p>Two years ago, in Lisbon, our nations agreed on a framework for transition in Afghanistan that would allow us to responsibly wind down the war. We agreed that this transition to Afghan lead for security would begin in 2011 and that it would conclude in 2014. At the same time, we said that we would seek a long-term partnership with Afghanistan and the Afghan people. <p>Over the past 2 years, we've made important progress. Our forces broke the Taliban's momentum, more Afghans are reclaiming their communities, Afghan security forces have grown stronger, and the transition that we agreed to in Lisbon is well underway. <p>This past week, we saw more progress. We very much welcome President Karzai's announcement of the third group of areas to begin transition. This means that 75 percent of the Afghan people live in areas where Afghan forces will be moving into the lead. <p>Today we'll decide the next phase of the transition, the next milestone. We'll set a goal for Afghan forces to take the lead for combat operations across the country in 2013&mdash;next year&mdash;so that ISAF can move to a supporting role. This will be another step toward Afghans taking full lead for their security as agreed to by 2014, when the ISAF combat mission will end. <p>Today is also an opportunity to ensure our hard-worn&mdash;hard-won progress is preserved. The strategic partnership agreement that President Karzai and I signed in Kabul ensures that as Afghans stand up, they will not stand alone. Today we can agree on NATO's long-term relationship with Afghanistan beyond 2014, including our support of Afghan security forces. <p>So we have a lot of work to do. Again, I want to thank all of my fellow leaders and our partners for being here. Our nations and the world have a vital interest in the success of this mission. And I am confident, because of the leadership represented here as well as the leadership of our outstanding armed forces, that we can advance that goal today and responsibly bring this war to an end.\" "
"130" "\"Thank you, everybody. Please have a seat. A few people I want to acknowledge. First of all, you have an outstanding Governor in Jay Nixon, and we are proud of all the work that he's done. I want to acknowledge Senator Claire McCaskill, who is here; Representative Billy Long; your mayor, Melodee Colbert-Kean; somebody who doesn't get a lot of attention, but does amazing work all across the country, including here in Joplin, the head of FEMA, the Administrator, Craig Fugate, who spent an awful lot of time here helping to rebuild. <p>Superintendent Huff, Principal Sachetta, to the faculty, the parents, the family, friends, the people of Joplin, and most of all the class of 2012, congratulations on your graduation, and thank you for allowing me the honor of playing a small part in this special day. <p>Now, the job of a commencement speaker primarily is to keep it short. Chloe, they've given me more than 2 minutes. [<i>Laughter</i>] But the other job is to inspire. But as I look out at this class and across this city, what's clear is that you're the source of inspiration today, to me, to this State, to this country, and to people all over the world. <p>Last year, the road that led you here took a turn that no one could've imagined. Just hours after the class of 2011 walked across this stage, the most powerful tornado in six decades tore a path of devastation through Joplin that was nearly a mile wide and 13 long. In just 32 minutes, it took thousands of homes and hundreds of businesses and 161 of your neighbors, friends, and family. It took a classmate, Will Norton, who had just left this auditorium with a diploma in his hand. It took Lantz Hare, who should've received his diploma next year. <p>And by now, I expect that most of you have probably relived those 32 minutes again and again: where you were; what you saw; when you knew for sure that it was over; the first contact, the first phone call you had with somebody you loved; the first day that you woke up in a world that would never be the same. <p>And yet the story of Joplin isn't just what happened that day. It's the story of what happened the next day and the day after that and all the days and weeks and months that followed. As your city manager, Mark Rohr, has said, the people here chose to define the tragedy \\"not by what happened to us, but by how we responded.\\" <p>Class of 2012, that story is yours. It's part of you now. As others have mentioned, you've had to grow up quickly over the last year. You've learned at a younger age than most of us that we can't always predict what life has in store. No matter how we might try to avoid it, life surely can bring some heartache, and life involves struggles And at some point, life will bring loss. <p>But here in Joplin, you've also learned that we have the power to grow from these experiences. We can define our lives not by what happens to us, but by how we respond. We can choose to carry on. We can choose to make a difference in the world. And in doing so, we can make true what's written in Scripture, that \\"tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope.\\" <p>Of all that's come from this tragedy, let this be the central lesson that guides us, let it be the lesson that sustains you through whatever challenges lie ahead. <p>As you begin the next stage in your journey, wherever you're going, whatever you're doing, it's safe to say you will encounter greed and selfishness and ignorance and cruelty and sometimes just bad luck. You'll meet people who try to build themselves up by tearing others down. You'll meet people who believe that looking after others is only for suckers. <p>But you're from Joplin, so you will remember, you will know, just how many people there are who see life differently, those who are guided by kindness and generosity and quiet service. <p>You'll remember that in a town of 50,000 people, nearly 50,000 more came in to help the weeks after the tornado, perfect strangers who've never met you and didn't ask for anything in return. <p>One of them was Mark Carr, who drove 600 miles from Rocky Ford, Colorado, with a couple of chainsaws and his three little children. One man traveled all the way from Japan, because he remembered that Americans were there for his country after last year's tsunami, and he wanted the chance, he said, \\"to pay it forward.\\" There were AmeriCorps volunteers who have chosen to leave their homes and stay here in Joplin until the work is done. <p>And then there was the day that Mizzou's football team rolled into town with an 18-wheeler full of donated supplies. And of all places, they were assigned to help out on Kansas Avenue. [<i>Laughter</i>] I don't know who set that up. [<i>Laughter</i>] And while they hauled away washing machines and refrigerators from the debris, they met a woman named Carol Mann who had just lost the house she lived in for 18 years. And Carol didn't have a lot. She works part-time at McDonald's. She struggles with seizures, and she told the players that she had even lost the change purse that held her lunch money. So one of them, one of the players, went back to the house, dug through the rubble, and returned with the purse with $5 inside. <p>And Carol's sister said: \\"So much of the news that you hear is so negative. But these boys renewed my faith that there are so many good people in the world.\\" <p>That's what you'll remember, because you're from Joplin. <p>You will remember the half million dollar donation that came from Angelina Jolie and some up-and-coming actor named Brad Pitt. [<i>Laughter</i>] But you'll also remember the $360 that was delivered by a 9-year-old boy who organized his own car wash. You'll remember the school supplies donated by your neighboring towns, but maybe you'll also remember the brand new laptops that were sent from the United Arab Emirates, a tiny country on the other side of the world. <p>When it came time for your prom, make-up artist Melissa Blayton organized an effort that collected over a thousand donated prom dresses, FedEx kicked in for the corsages, Joplin's own Liz Easton, who had lost her home and her bakery in the tornado, made a hundred&mdash;or 1,500 cupcakes for the occasion. They were good cupcakes. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>There are so many good people in the world. There is such a decency, a bigness of spirit, in this country of ours. And so, class of 2012, you've got to remember that. Remember what people did here. And like that man who came all the way from Japan to Joplin, make sure in your own life that you pay it forward. <p>Now, just as you've learned the goodness of people, you've also learned the power of community. And you've heard from some of the other speakers how powerful that is. And as you take on the roles of coworker and business owner, neighbor, citizen, you'll encounter all kinds of divisions between groups, divisions of race and religion and ideology. You'll meet people who like to disagree just for the sake of being disagreeable. [<i>Laughter</i>] You'll meet people who prefer to play up their differences instead of focusing on what they have in common, where they can cooperate. <p>But you're from Joplin, so you will always know that it's always possible for a community to come together when it matters most. After all, a lot of you could've spent your senior year scattered throughout different schools, far from home. But Dr. Huff asked everybody to pitch in so that school started on time, right here in Joplin. He understood the power of this community, and he understood the power of place. <p>And so these teachers worked extra hours, coaches put in extra time. That mall was turned into a classroom. The food court became a cafeteria, which maybe some of you thought was an improvement. [<i>Laughter</i>] And yes, the arrangements might have been a little noisy and a little improvised, but you hunkered down. You made it work together. You made it work together. <p>That's the power of community. Together, you decided this city wasn't about to spend the next year arguing over every detail of the recovery effort. At the very first meeting, the first town meeting, every citizen was handed a Post-it note and asked to write down their goals and their hopes for Joplin's future. And more than a thousand notes covered an entire wall and became the blueprint that architects are following to this day. I'm thinking about trying this with Congress, give them some Post-it notes. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Together, the businesses that were destroyed in the tornado decided they weren't about to walk away from the community that made their success possible, even if it would've been easier, even if it would've been more profitable to go someplace else. And so today, more than half the stores that were damaged on the Range Line are up and running again. Eleven more are planning to join them. And every time a company reopens its doors, people cheer the cutting of a ribbon that bears the town's new slogan: \\"Remember, rejoice, and rebuild.\\" That's community. <p>I've been told, class of 2012, that before the tornado, many of you couldn't wait to leave here once high school was finally over. So student council president Julia Lewis&mdash;where is Julia? She's out here somewhere. [<i>Laughter</i>] She is too embarrassed to raise her hand. I'm quoting you, Julia. She said: \\"We never thought Joplin was anything special\\"&mdash;now that's typical with teenagers; they don't think their parents are all that special either&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;\\"but seeing how we responded to something that tore our community apart has brought us together. Everyone has a lot more pride in our town.\\" So it's no surprise then that many of you have decided to stick around and go to Missouri Southern or go to colleges or community colleges that aren't too far away from home. <p>That's the power of community. That's the power of shared effort and shared memory. Some of life's strongest bonds are the ones we forge when everything around us seems broken. And even though I expect that some of you will ultimately end up leaving Joplin, I'm pretty confident that Joplin will never leave you. The people who went through this with you, the people who you once thought of as simply neighbors or acquaintances, classmates, the people in this auditorium tonight, you're family now. They're your family. <p>And so my deepest hope for all of you is that as you begin this new chapter in your life, you'll bring that spirit of Joplin to every place you travel, to everything you do. You can serve as a reminder that we're not meant to walk this road alone, that we're not expected to face down adversity by ourselves. We need God. We need each other. We are important to each other, and we're stronger together than we are on our own. <p>And that's the spirit that has allowed all of you to rebuild this city, and that's the same spirit we need right now to help rebuild America. And you, class of 2012, you're going to help lead this effort. You're the ones who will help build an economy where every child can count on a good education. You're the one that's going to make sure this country is a place where everybody who is willing to put in the effort can find a job that supports a family. You're the ones that will make sure we're a country that controls our own energy future, where we lead the world in science and technology and innovation. America only succeeds when we all pitch in and pull together, and I'm counting on you to be leaders in that effort, because you're from Joplin, and you have already defied the odds. <p>Now, there are a lot of stories here in Joplin of unthinkable courage and resilience over the last year, but still there are some that stand out, especially on this day. And by now, most of you know Joplin High's senior Quinton Anderson; look, he is already looking embarrassed. Somebody is talking about him again. But, Quinton, I'm going to talk about you anyway, because in a lot of ways, Quinton's journey has been Joplin's journey. <p>When the tornado struck, Quinton was thrown across the street from his house. The young man who found Quinton couldn't imagine that Quinton would survive his injuries. Quinton woke up in a hospital bed 3 days later. And it was then that his sister Grace told him that both their parents had been lost in the storm. <p>So Quinton went on to face over 5 weeks of treatment, including emergency surgery. But he left that hospital determined to carry on, to live his life, to be there for his sister. And over the past year, he's been a football captain who cheered from the sidelines when he couldn't play. He worked that much harder so he could be ready for baseball in the spring. He won a national scholarship as a finalist for the high school football \\"Rudy\\" awards. He plans to study molecular biology at Harding University this fall. <p>Quinton has said that his motto in life is \\"always take that extra step.\\" And today, after a long and improbable journey for Quinton, and for Joplin and for the entire class of 2012, that extra step is about to take you towards whatever future you hope for and whatever dreams you hold in your hearts. <p>Yes, you will encounter obstacles along the way. I guarantee you will face setbacks and you will face disappointments. But you're from Joplin, and you're from America. And no matter how tough times get, you'll always be tougher. And no matter what life throws at you, you will be ready. You will not be defined by the difficulties you face, but by how you respond, with grace and strength and a commitment to others. <p>Langston Hughes, poet, civil rights activist who knew some tough times, he was born here in Joplin. In a poem called \\"Youth,\\" he wrote: <p>We have tomorrow <p>Bright before us <p>Like a flame. <p>Yesterday <p>A night-gone thing, <p>A sun-down name. <p>And dawn-today. Broad arc above the road we came. <p>We march. <p>To the people of Joplin and the class of 2012, the road has been hard and the day has been long, but we have tomorrow, so we march. We march together, and you're leading the way, because you're from Joplin. Congratulations. <p>May God bless you. May God bless the class of 2012. May God bless the United States of America.\" "
"131" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you so much. Please be seated. Good morning, everybody! <p><i>Audience members. </i>Good morning! <p><i>The President.</i> It is wonderful to be at the United States Air Force Academy on such a spectacular day, and it is a privilege to join you in honoring the class of 2012. [<i>Applause</i>] I want to thank Secretary Donley for his introduction, but more importantly, for his leadership. <p>Generals Gould, Clark, and Born; Academy faculty and staff; the Governor, Hickenlooper; Members of Congress; distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen&mdash;I especially want to acknowledge a graduate of this Academy who has kept our Air Force strong through a time of great challenge, a leader I've relied on and for whom today is his final commencement as Chief of Staff, General Norton Schwartz. Norty, Suzie, we could not be prouder of you, and we are grateful for 39 years of extraordinary service to our Nation. And although he is not with us today, I'm proud to have nominated another Academy graduate, General Mark Welsh, as the next Chief of Staff. <p>Now, this is my second visit to the Academy. I was here in the summer of 2008, and you were getting ready to head out to Jacks Valley. So I was proud to be here when you began this journey, and I thought I'd come back and help you celebrate at the end. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's great to be back at a school that has produced so many of the airmen I've known as President. <p>Every day, I rely on outstanding Academy graduates who serve at the White House. Some of you know that photo from the Situation Room on the day we delivered justice to bin Laden. You can see, right next to me, a great leader of our Special Operations forces, General Brad Webb. <p>Last month, I was able to present the Commander in Chief Trophy to Coach Calhoun and the Fighting Falcons for the 2d straight year, a record 18th time. And of course, every time I step on Air Force One, I count on Academy graduates like my pilot today, Colonel Scott Turner. Now, I was going to tell you a joke about Scott, but he's my ride home. So I'm going to have to keep it to myself. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Cadets, you distinguished yourselves as leaders before you ever stepped foot on the Terrazzo. And when you arrived, I know your upper classmen gave you quite a welcome. They let you experience the joy of the \\"Beast,\\" the pleasure of \\"Recognition.\\" They made you experts on filling out forms. I only ask that you resist the temptation to rate my speech: \\"fast, neat, average, friendly, good-good.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But you survived. In you, we see the values of integrity and service and excellence that will define your lives. And I know you couldn't have made it without the love and support of your moms and dads and brothers and sisters and grandmas, grandpas, aunts, uncles, cousins. So give them all a big round of applause. <p>This Academy is one of the most demanding academic institutions in America. And you have excelled. I'm told you have set at least three Academy records: the largest number of graduates ever to go directly on to graduate school; the largest number of female graduates in Academy history. [<i>Applause</i>] You will follow in the footsteps of General Janet Wolfenbarger, who I was proud to nominate as the first female four-star general in Air Force history. <p>And of course, your final and perhaps most impressive distinction: breaking the world's record for the largest game of dodgeball. Three thousand participants, 30 hours, I didn't know that was possible. [<i>Laughter</i>] Of course, you are also the class that snuck into the superintendent's office and moved all the furniture into your dorm rooms, which does bring me to some important business. In keeping with longstanding tradition, I hereby grant amnesty to all cadets serving restrictions and confinements for minor offenses. Of course, I leave it up to General Gould to define minor. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Cadets, this is the day you finally become officers in the finest Air Force in the world. Like generations before you, you'll be charged with the responsibility of leading those under your command. Like classes over the past 10 years, you graduate in a time of war, and you may find yourselves in harm's way. But you will also face a new test, and that's what I want to talk to you about today. <p>Four years ago, you arrived here at a time of extraordinary challenge for our Nation. Our forces were engaged in two wars. Al Qaida, which had attacked us on 9/11, was entrenched in their safe havens. Many of our alliances were strained, and our standing in the world had suffered. Our economy was in the worst recession since the Great Depression. Around the world and here at home, there were those that questioned whether the United States still had the capacity for global leadership. <p>Today, you step forward into a different world. You are the first class in 9 years that will graduate into a world where there are no Americans fighting in Iraq. For the first time in your lives, and thanks to Air Force personnel who did their part, bin&mdash;Usama bin Laden is no longer a threat to our country. We've put Al Qaida on the path to defeat. And you are the first graduates since 9/11 who can clearly see how we'll end the war in Afghanistan. <p>So what does all this mean? When you came here 4 years ago, there were some 180,000 American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. We've now cut that number by more than half. And as more Afghans step up, more of our troops will come home while achieving the objective that led us to war in the first place and that is defeating Al Qaida and denying them safe haven. So we aren't just ending these wars, we are doing so in a way that makes us safer and stronger. <p>Today we pay tribute to all our extraordinary men and women in uniform for their bravery, for their dedication. Those who gave their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan to make this progress possible, including 16 graduates of this Academy, we honor them. We will always honor them. <p>For a decade, we have labored under the dark cloud of war. And now, we can see a light, the light of a new day on the horizon. So the end of these wars will shape your service, and it will make our military stronger. Ten years of continuous military operations have stretched our forces and strained their families. Going forward, you'll face fewer deployments. You'll have more time to train and stay ready. That means you'll be better prepared for the full range of missions you face. <p>And ending these wars will also ensure that the burden of our security no longer falls so heavily on the shoulders of our men and women in uniform. As good as you are, you can't be expected to do it alone. There are many sources of American power: diplomatic, economic, and the power of our ideals. And we've got to use them all. And the good news is, today we are. <p>Around the world, the United States is leading once more. From Europe to Asia, our alliances are stronger than ever. Our ties with the Americas are deeper. We're setting the agenda in the region that will shape our long-term security and prosperity like no other: the Asia-Pacific. <p>We're leading on global security: reducing our nuclear arsenal with Russia, even as we maintain a strong nuclear deterrent; mobilizing dozens of nations to secure nuclear materials so they never fall into the hands of terrorists; rallying the world to put the strongest sanctions ever on Iran and North Korea, which cannot be allowed to threaten the world with nuclear weapons. <p>We are leading economically: forging trade pacts to create new markets for our goods; boosting our exports, stamped with three proud words: Made in America. We're expanding exchanges and collaborations in areas that people often admire most about America: our innovation, our science, our technology. <p>We're leading on behalf of human dignity and on behalf of freedom: standing with the people of the Middle East and North Africa as they seek their rights; preventing a massacre in Libya with an international mission in which the United States and our Air Force led from the front. <p>We're leading global efforts against hunger and disease. And we've shown our compassion, as so many airmen did, in delivering relief to our neighbors in Haiti when they were in need and to our Japanese allies after the earthquake and tsunami. <p>Because of this progress, around the world, there is a new feeling about America. I see it everywhere I go, from London and Prague to Tokyo and Seoul, to Rio and Jakarta. There's a new confidence in our leadership. And when people around the world are asked which country do you most admire, one nation comes out on top: the United States of America. <p>Of course, the world stage is not a popularity contest. As a nation, we have vital interests, and we will do what is necessary always to defend this country we love, even if it's unpopular. But make no mistake: How we're viewed in the world has consequences for our national security and for your lives. <p>See, when other countries and people see us as partners, they're more willing to work with us. It's why more countries joined us in Afghanistan and Libya. It's why nations like Australia are welcoming our forces who stand side by side with allies and partners in the South Pacific. It's why Uganda and its African neighbors have welcomed our trainers to help defeat a brutal army that slaughters its citizens. <p>I think of the Japanese man in the disaster zone who upon seeing our airmen delivering relief, said: \\"I never imagined they could help us so much.\\" I think of the Libyans who protected our airman when he ejected over their town because they knew America was there to protect them. And in a region where we've seen burning of American flags, I think of all the Libyans who were waving American flags. <p>Today, we can say with confidence and pride the United States is stronger and safer and more respected in the world, because even as we've done the work of ending these wars, we've laid the foundation for a new era of American leadership. And now, cadets, we have to build it. We have to build on it; you have to build on it. <p>Let's start by putting aside the tired notion that says our influence has waned or that America is in decline. We've heard that talk before. During the Great Depression, when millions were unemployed and some believed that other economic models offered a better way, there were those who predicted the end of American capitalism. Guess what: They were wrong. We fought our way back. We created the largest middle class in history and the most prosperous economy the world has ever known. <p>After Pearl Harbor, some said, the United States has been reduced to a third-rate power. Well, we rallied. We flew over the Hump and took island after island. We stormed the beaches and liberated nations. And we emerged from that war as the strongest power on the face of the Earth. <p>After Vietnam and the energy crisis of the 1970s, some said America had passed its high point. But the very next decade, because of our fidelity to the values we stand for, the Berlin Wall came tumbling down and liberty prevailed over the tyranny of the cold war. <p>As recently as the 1980s, with the rise of Japan and the Asian Tigers, there were those who said we had lost our economic edge. But we retooled. We invested in new technologies. We launched an information revolution that changed the world. <p>After all this, you would think folks understand a basic truth: Never bet against the United States of America. And one of the reasons is that the United States has been, and will always be, the one indispensable nation in world affairs. It's one of the many examples of why America is exceptional. It's why I firmly believe that if we rise to this moment in history, if we meet our responsibilities, then&mdash;just like the 20th century&mdash;the 21st century will be another great American Century. That's the future I see. That's the future you can build. <p>I see an American century because we have the resilience to make it through these tough economic times. We're going to put America back to work by investing in the things that keep us competitive: education and high-tech manufacturing, science and innovation. We'll pay down our deficits, reform our Tax Code, and keep reducing our dependence on foreign oil. We need to get on with nation-building here at home. And I know we can because we're still the largest, most dynamic, most innovative economy in the world. And no matter what challenges we may face, we wouldn't trade places with any other nation on Earth. <p>I see an American century because you are part of the finest, most capable military the world has ever known. No other nation even comes close. Yes, as today's wars end, our military and our Air Force will be leaner. But as Commander in Chief, I will not allow us to make the mistakes of the past. We still face very serious threats. As we've seen in recent weeks, with Al Qaida in Yemen, there are still terrorists who seek to kill our citizens. So we need you to be ready for the full range of threats. From the conventional to the unconventional, from nations seeking weapons of mass destruction to the cell of terrorists planning the next attack, from the old danger of piracy to the new threat of cyber, we must be vigilant. <p>And so, guided by our new defense strategy, we'll keep our military and our Air Force fast and flexible and versatile. We will maintain our military superiority in all areas: air, land, sea, space, and cyber. And we will keep faith with our forces and our military families. <p>And as our newest veterans rejoin civilian life, we will never stop working to give them the benefits and opportunities that they have earned, because our veterans have the skills to help us rebuild America, and we have to serve them as well as they have served us. <p>I see an American century because we have the strongest alliances of any nation. From Europe to Asia, our alliances are the foundation of global security. In Libya, all 28 NATO allies played a role, and we were joined by partners in the air from Sweden to the Gulf States. In Afghanistan, we're in a coalition of 50 allies and partners. Today, Air Force personnel are serving in 135 nations, partnering, training, building their capacity. This is how peace and security will be upheld in the 21st century: more nations bearing the costs and responsibilities of leadership. And that's good for America. It's good for the world. And we're at the hub of it, making it happen. <p>I see an American century because no other nation seeks the role that we play in global affairs and no other nation can play the role that we play in global affairs. That includes shaping the global institutions of the 20th century to meet the challenges of the 21st. As President, I've made it clear: The United States does not fear the rise of peaceful, responsible emerging powers. We welcome them, because when more nations step up and contribute to peace and security, that doesn't undermine American power, it enhances it. <p>And when other people in other countries see that we're rooting for their success, it builds trust and partnerships that can advance our interests for generations. It makes it easier to meet common challenges, from preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to combating climate change. And so we seek an international order where the rights and responsibilities of all nations and peoples are upheld and where countries thrive by meeting their obligations and they face consequences when they don't. <p>I see an American century because more and more people are reaching toward the freedoms and values that we share. No other nation has sacrificed more&mdash;in treasure, in the lives of our sons and daughters&mdash;so that these freedoms could take root and flourish around the world. And no other nation has made the advancement of human rights and dignity so central to its foreign policy. And that's because it's central to who we are as Americans. It's also in our self-interest because democracies become our closest allies and partners. <p>Sure, there will always be some governments that try to resist the tide of democracy, who claim theirs is a better way. But around the world, people know the difference between us. We welcome freedom to speak, to assemble, to worship, to choose your leaders. They don't. We welcome the chance to compete for jobs and markets freely and fairly. They don't. When fundamental human rights are threatened around the world, we stand up and speak out. And they don't. <p>We know that the sovereignty of nations cannot strangle the liberty of individuals. And so we stand with the student in the street who demands a life of dignity and opportunity. We stand with women everywhere who deserve the same rights as men. We stand with the activists unbowed in their prison cells and the leaders in parliament who's moving her country towards democracy. We stand with the dissident who seeks the freedom to say what he pleases and the entrepreneur who wants to start a business without paying a bribe and all those who strive for justice and dignity. For they know, as we do, that history is on the side of freedom. <p>And finally, I see an American century because of the character of our country, the spirit that has always made us exceptional. That simple yet revolutionary idea, there at our founding and in our hearts ever since, that we have it in our power to make the world anew, to make the future what we will. It is that fundamental faith, that American optimism, which says no challenge is too great, no mission is too hard. It's the spirit that guides your class: \\"Never falter, never fail.\\" <p>That is the essence of America, and there's nothing else like it anywhere in the world. It's what's inspired the oppressed in every corner of the world to demand the same freedoms for themselves. It's what's inspired generations to come to our shores, renewing us with their energy and their hopes. And that includes a fellow cadet, a cadet graduating today, who grew up in Venezuela, got on a plane with a one-way ticket to America, and today is closer to his dream of becoming an Air Force pilot: Edward Camacho. Edward said what we all know to be true: \\"I'm convinced that America is the land of opportunity.\\" <p>You're right, Edward. That is who we are. That's the America we love: always young, always looking ahead to that light of a new day on the horizon. And, cadets, as I look into your eyes as you join that long blue line, I know you will carry us even farther and even higher. And with your proud service, I'm absolutely confident that the United States of America will meet the tests of our time. We will remain the land of opportunity. And we will stay strong as the greatest force for freedom and human dignity that the world has ever known. <p>May God bless you. May God bless the class of 2012, and may God bless the United States of America.\" "
"132" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Iowa! How's it going, Des Moines? Well, it is good to be back in my home away from home. <p>Now, I've got to give a long speech in there, so I'm not going to give a long speech here. But what I do want to just say to all of you is&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> I love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. <p>You know, this journey started in Iowa, and that's why we're going to be spending a lot of time in Iowa this time round. Because when I go around the country and I talk about how decent folks are and responsible they are, and everybody wants a fair shot and everybody is willing to do their fair share and everybody is playing by the same set of rules, I'm talking about the people of Iowa as a great example of what America is all about. <p>So we're going to have a lot of work to do. We've gone through some tough times. The economy has been tough. We still have friends and neighbors who are out of work. We still have too many folks whose home values have dropped, small businesses that are still struggling. So we're going to have to keep on moving. We've got to push forward. We can't go backwards. <p>And these other folks, they want to go back to the same stuff that got us into this mess in the first place, and we're not going to do that. We want to move forward. We're not going backwards. <p>So how many of you are ready to work? Because it's going to take some work this time. This is going to take some work. This is going to be harder this time than it was the last time. But Iowa is full of hard-working folk. And there's something about Iowa: When I come here I want to work even harder. <p>So I just want to say thank you to all the team members, team leaders, everybody who's out there knocking on doors, making phone calls, talking to your neighbors, talking to your friends, talking to your uncle or aunt who somehow still thinks the other side knows what they're talking about&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and you've got to help them see the light. You just keep at it. <p>And the last thing I'll say is this. Even though all these folks are spending all this millions of dollars of money on negative ads&mdash;that's going to keep on because of these super PACs and all that stuff&mdash;nothing is more important than ordinary people standing up: standing up for our values, standing up for what America is all about. So don't think that these folks can beat us. If you're out there, you're going to beat them. And we're going to bring this country together and get things moving in the right direction. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"133" "\"Hello, Iowa! Well, it is good to be back in Newton! It's been a while. It's good to be back in Iowa. It's brought back memories of a lot of driving. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I just had a great tour of this facility. By the way, if people have chairs, feel free to sit down. [<i>Laughter</i>] Some of you may not have seats, but I want to make everybody comfortable. But don't worry, I'm not going to talk that long. I didn't want to give that impression. <p>I just had a wonderful tour of this facility. And I was telling some of the folks, we couldn't take the helicopter in because the winds were too strong, so you are definitely in the right business. [<i>Laughter</i>] Obviously, there's some wind power here in Iowa that we want to tap. <p>I want to thank Quinton for the terrific introduction, for sharing his story. Give Quinton a big round of applause. Quinton was telling my team, this is the first time he's ever spoken in public, but he looked like a pro to me. <p>I want to thank your mayor, Mayor Allen, for welcoming us here today. I also want to thank Representative Dave Loebsack for being here. Give Dave a big round of applause. And I know he had to leave early, but I just want to acknowledge somebody you know well, our outstanding Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack. Tom was instrumental in helping transform Newton, and he's still got your back. He is still fighting every single day for every single person in this town, but all across rural America. And so we're very proud of him. <p>Now, we all know how difficult these past few years have been for the country. Iowa has actually done a little better than some other States, but it's still been tough. And after the worst recession of our lifetimes, it's going to take some time for the economy to fully recover, more time than a lot of us would like. And we're still facing some headwinds, like the situation in Europe right now, which is having an impact on our economy. <p>But while there's certain economic developments we can't control, there are a bunch of things that we can control. There are plenty of steps that we can take right now&mdash;steps that we must take right now&mdash;to speed up this recovery and to create jobs and to restore some of the financial security that a lot of families have lost. It's within our control to do all of that right now. But here's the thing&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. It's true, we can make that difference. <p>The challenge we've got is that too many folks aren't on the same page. We've got too many of my dear Republican friends in Congress that have been standing in the way of some steps that we could take that would make a difference at the moment. Either they say they don't want to do anything at all or they don't want to do it before the election or they want to double down on some of the policies that didn't work and helped to get us into this mess in the first place. <p>And Newton knows something about that, because Newton lost manufacturing. Newton lost Maytag. A lot of the trends that we had seen even before the financial crisis hit, hit Newton first. And so when you hear somebody say we should cut more taxes, especially for the wealthiest Americans, well, Newton, you've been there, and you've done that. We did that&mdash;2000, 2001, 2003. When you hear people say that we should cut back more on the rules we put in place for banks and financial institutions to avoid another taxpayer bailout. Well, we tried that. When people say that we should just wait until the housing market hits bottom and hope that it comes back, hope for the best, well, that's not an answer for people. That doesn't make sense. <p>We've tried at lot of these ideas for nearly a decade. It did not work. We saw manufacturing moving offshore. We saw a few people do very well, but too many families struggling just to get by, all before the financial crisis hit. And the financial crisis made it worse. So we can't go backwards. We've got to move forward. We've got to build an economy where hard work and responsibility pay off, where you can find a good job and own your own home, maybe start your own businesses, give your kids a chance for a better future. That's the American way. That's who we are. <p>So I've been pushing Congress to help us get there by passing a few commonsense policies that would strengthen the economy and put more folks to work right now. We even made a handy to-do list that they can check off. It's just like the to-do list Michelle gives me, a honey-do list. [<i>Laughter</i>] There are only five things on it, on this to-do list, but these are all things we could get done before the election. We don't have to wait until then. There are some things that we should put ahead of politics and one of them is making sure that the economy is moving forward and the recovery is moving forward. <p>And like I said, I kept it simple. There are just five things. I didn't want to overload Congress with too much at once. [<i>Laughter</i>] But these are all ideas that will make a difference right now, and we shouldn't wait for an election to get them done. <p>So first up on the list, it makes no sense that we're actually still giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs and factories overseas. That doesn't make sense at all. That doesn't make any sense. So what I've asked Congress to do is end tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas, use that money to cover the moving expenses for companies that are bringing jobs back to the United States of America. That's a commonsense approach. <p>Second, we've asked Congress to give every responsible homeowner&mdash;folks who have been making their mortgage payments&mdash;the opportunity to save an average of $3,000 a year by refinancing their mortgage and taking advantage of these historically low rates. The problem is, a lot of folks are having trouble refinancing if their home is underwater, if it's less&mdash;worth less than their mortgage, and sometimes banks have been pulling back a little bit. We want to make it easier for people to refinance. So that's the second thing because that will create&mdash;that will put more money in the economy for everybody. And if you've got an extra $3,000 in your pocket, then you'll go shopping, you'll go out to a restaurant, suddenly, there's a lot more money circulating and the economy gets stronger. So that's the second thing. <p>Two weeks ago, I was in Reno, Nevada, with a family; they got a chance to refinance because of some steps that we had already taken administratively. And it's making a huge difference in their lives. And we want all families to have that same opportunity. <p>Third thing, instead of just talking about job creators&mdash;you always hear&mdash;every Member of Congress has said, we've got to help the job creators. Okay, let's help them. Congress should help small-business owners who create most of the new jobs in America&mdash;small-business owners. So what we want to do is give them a tax break for hiring more workers and for paying them higher wages. Give them an incentive to say, you know what, if on the margins maybe I'm thinking about hiring that extra person, if I get a tax break it makes that person a little bit cheaper to hire, and that can put more of our neighbors and friends back to work. So that's a commonsense idea. <p>Fourth thing, we have done a whole lot to make sure that those men and women who have served us in Iraq and Afghanistan, that we are serving them as well as they've served us, treating them with honor and respect that they have earned when they come home. So we put together the post-9/11 GI bill so they're able to go back and get some training and skills. We've mobilized the private sector to hire more veterans and given the private sector incentives to hire more veterans. <p>But there's another thing we can do. Congress should create what we're calling a veterans jobs corps, so that we can help communities across America put our returning heroes back to work as police officers and firefighters and park rangers. Nobody who fought for our country overseas should have to fight for a job when they come back home. We've still got too much unemployment among our veterans. <p>So those are four simple things. And the fifth thing is the reason why I'm here today. The fifth item on my to-do list: I'm calling on Congress to extend tax credits that are set to expire at the end of the year for clean-energy companies like TPI. Let's not wait. Let's do it now. <p>Many of you know the story of what's happening here better than I do, but I just want to remind you how far we've come. Shortly after I took office, I came to Newton&mdash;some of you remember&mdash;and we unveiled an all-of-the-above energy strategy for America. We said let's produce more oil and gas, but let's also produce more biofuels, let's produce more fuel-efficient cars, let's produce more solar and wind power and other sources of clean, renewable energy. And I came to Newton because Newton is helping to lead the way when it comes to building wind turbines. <p>And since then, our dependence on foreign oil has gone down every single year that I've been in office&mdash;every single year. America is now producing more domestic oil than any time in the last 8 years. But we're also producing more natural gas, and we're producing more biofuels than any time in our history. And that's good for the Iowa economy. We're laying the foundation for some of our Nation's first offshore wind farms. And since I became President, America has nearly doubled the use of renewable energy, like solar power and wind power. We've nearly doubled it. <p>So this country is on the path towards more energy independence. And that's good for everybody. It's good for people's pocketbooks, it's good for the environment, it's good for our national security. We don't want our economy dependent on something that happens on the other side of the world. We don't want every time there's a scare about war or some regime change in the Middle East that suddenly everybody here is getting socked and the whole economy is going down. <p>And the best thing is, in the process, we're also putting thousands of Americans back to work, because the more we rely on American-made energy, the less oil we buy from other countries, the more jobs we create here at home, the more jobs we create here in Iowa. <p>So let's look at the wind industry. It's so important to Iowa. This industry, thanks in large part to some very important tax credits, has now taken off. The State of Iowa now gets nearly 20 percent of all your electricity from wind&mdash;20 percent. Overall, America now has enough wind capacity to power 10 million homes. So this is an industry on the rise. And as you know, it's an industry that's putting people to work. You know this firsthand. There are more wind power jobs in Iowa than any other State. That's a big deal. <p>And one of these modern windmills has more than 8,000 different parts, everything from the towers and the blades to the gears, to the electrical switches. And it used to be that almost all these parts were imported. Today, more and more of these parts are being made here in America&mdash;right here. We used to have just a few dozen manufacturing facilities attached to the wind industry. Today, we have nearly 500 facilities, in 43 States, employing tens of thousands of American workers&mdash;tens of thousands. <p>So we're making progress. And you know it better than anybody. I mean, when I was talking to Quinton and Mark and a whole bunch of the other folks who are working here, they reminded me of the experience of working at Maytag and putting your heart and soul into a company and making a great product, and then suddenly having that company leave, and how hard that was for families and how hard it was for the community. But folks made the transition. <p>And now, when you look at what's happening here&mdash;700 to 800 jobs, over $30 million being put back into the community&mdash;this gives folks hope. It gives people opportunity. I met some folks who have been in manufacturing for 30 years, but I also met a couple of young folks who were just getting started. And that's what we're looking for. Nobody wants a handout. Nobody wants to get something for nothing. But if we've got a chance to create energy and create value and put people back to work, why wouldn't we do that? <p>So I'm here today because, as much progress as we've made, that progress is in jeopardy. If Congress doesn't act, those tax credits that I mentioned&mdash;the ones that helped build up the wind industry, the ones that helped to bring all these jobs to Newton&mdash;those tax credits will expire at the end of the year if Congress doesn't do anything. <p>If Congress doesn't act, companies like this one will take a hit. Jobs will be lost. That's not a guess, that's a fact. We can't let it happen. And keep in mind that&mdash;and this is something Congress needs to understand&mdash;Dave Loebsack understands it, but I want every Member of Congress to understand it. These companies that are putting in orders for these amazing blades, they're making plans now. They're making decisions now. So if they're cutting back on their orders, if they're not confident that the industry is going to be moving at a fast clip and they start reducing orders here, that affects you. You can't wait for 6 months. You can't wait for 8 months. You can't wait for a year to get this done. It's got to be done now. <p>So this is a simple thing on Congress's to-do list: extend these tax credits. Do it now. Every day they don't act, business grows more concerned that they will not be renewed. They're worried demand for their products is going down, so they start thinking twice about expanding, more cautious about making new investments. They start looking overseas. I was talking to your CEO. We got an opportunity to branch out, but we want to branch out by making the stuff here and then sending it there. We don't want to branch out by sending the jobs and the investments over there, and then shipping it back to America. That doesn't make sense. One company that had plans to invest a hundred million dollars to build a wind manufacturing plant in Arkansas&mdash;and create hundreds of jobs&mdash;put those plans on hold. <p>And by the way, this should not be a partisan issue. There are several Republican Governors&mdash;including the Governor of this State&mdash;who are calling on Congress to act. There are Members of Congress in both chambers and on both sides of the aisle&mdash;including your two Senators&mdash;who support these tax credits. And that doesn't happen much in Washington where Democrats and Republicans say they agree on something. So if you agree, why haven't we gotten it done yet? <p>This is not just an issue, by the way, for the wind industry. Some of America's most prominent companies&mdash;from Starbucks to Campbell's Soup&mdash;they're calling on Congress to act, because they use renewable energy. <p>Sometimes when I think about Washington and Congress&mdash;and I know some of you think the same way&mdash;I don't get it. I understand why we wouldn't get something done if we really disagree on something. And there are some big disagreements: They want to make big cuts to pay for more big tax cuts for the wealthy. I disagree with that. I think we should have a balanced approach: cut waste, but make sure that everybody is paying their fair share. An issue like that, maybe it can't get settled before an election, because they just have a different approach. I understand that. But this, everybody says they agree to or at least a lot of people agree to it. <p>So I'm going to need your help. I need you to get involved. I need you to help get this done. I need everybody here in Newton, and I mean everybody&mdash;I don't just mean folks who work at TPI&mdash;anybody who's watching, everybody here in Iowa, pick up the phone, send an e-mail, send a tweet, tell Congress, let's do the right thing. Tell Congress the story of Newton. Tell folks why it's so important to this community. Tell them we've come too far to turn back now. <p>It used to be Newton was known for building washers and dryers, used to be Newton was known for Maytag. And obviously, they were a big employer, thousands of people working in the area. But back in 2007 when they closed down the operations here, that was a major blow. And everybody here, if you don't&mdash;if you weren't affected personally by it, you were affected indirectly: your friends, your neighbors. Folks like Quinton were forced to start all over again, and he didn't give up. You didn't give up. You kept pushing ahead. Some of you had to retrain. Pretty soon after one industry had left, another showed up. Some of the facilities that Maytag closed were reopened. So a lot of folks who used to build washers and dryers, now they're part of the future, building an industry that's going to make America stronger. That's the story of Newton. That's the story of America. <p>So yes, we're facing tough times, but we're getting through them. We're getting through them together, because in this country, just like in Newton, we don't give up. We keep moving. We keep moving forward. And if we work together with a common purpose, we will get this economy back on track and remind everybody why America is the greatest country on Earth. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America. Thank you.\" "
"134" "\"This weekend, folks across the country are opening up the pool, firing up the grill, and taking a well-earned moment to relax. But Memorial Day is more than a 3-day weekend. In town squares and national cemeteries, in public services and moments of quiet reflection, we will honor those who loved their country enough to sacrifice their own lives for it. <p>This Memorial Day, Michelle and I will join Gold Star families, veterans, and their families at Arlington National Cemetery. We'll pay tribute to patriots of every generation who gave the last full measure of devotion, from Lexington and Concord to Iraq and Afghanistan. <p>Later that day, we'll join Vietnam veterans and their families at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial&mdash;the wall. We'll begin to mark the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam war. It's another chance to honor those we lost at places like Hue, Khe Sanh, Da Nang, and Hamburger Hill. And we'll be calling on you, the American people, to join us in thanking our Vietnam veterans in your communities. <p>Even as we honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice, we reaffirm our commitment to care for those who served alongside them, the veterans who came home. This includes our newest generation of veterans, from Iraq and Afghanistan. We have to serve them and their families as well as they have served us: by making sure that they get the health care and benefits they need, by caring for our wounded warriors and supporting our military families, and by giving veterans the chance to go to college, find a good job, and enjoy the freedom that they risked everything to protect. <p>Our men and women in uniform took an oath to defend our country at all costs, and today, as members of the finest military the world has ever known, they uphold that oath with dignity and courage. As President, I have no higher honor than serving as their Commander in Chief. But with that honor comes a solemn responsibility, one that gets driven home every time I sign a condolence letter or meet a family member whose life has been turned upside down. <p>No words can ever bring back a loved one who has been lost. No ceremony can do justice to their memory. No honor will ever fill their absence. <p>But on Memorial Day, we come together as Americans to let these families and veterans know they are not alone. We give thanks for those who sacrificed everything so that we could be free. And we commit ourselves to upholding the ideals for which so many patriots have fought and died. <p>Thank you, God bless you, and have a wonderful weekend.\" "
"135" "\"Thank you very much. Please be seated. Good morning, everybody. Thank you, Secretary Panetta, for your introduction and for your incredible service to our country. To General Dempsey, to Major General Linnington, Kathryn Condon, Chaplain Berry, all of you who are here today&mdash;active duty, veterans, family and friends of the fallen&mdash;thank you for allowing me the privilege of joining you in this sacred place to commemorate Memorial Day. <p>These 600 acres are home to Americans from every part of the country who gave their lives in every corner of the globe. When a revolution needed to be waged and a union needed to be saved, they left their homes and took up arms for the sake of an idea. From the jungles of Vietnam to the mountains of Afghanistan, they stepped forward and answered the call. They fought for a home they might never return to; they fought for buddies they would never forget. And while their stories may be separated by hundreds of years and thousands of miles, they rest here, together, side-by-side, row-by-row, because each of them loved this country, and everything it stands for, more than life itself. <p>Today we come together as Americans to pray, to reflect, and to remember these heroes. But tomorrow this hallowed place will once again belong to a smaller group of visitors who make their way through the gates and across these fields in the heat and in the cold, in the rain and the snow, following a well-worn path to a certain spot and kneeling in front of a familiar headstone. <p>You are the family and friends of the fallen, the parents and children, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters by birth and by sacrifice. And you too leave a piece of your hearts beneath these trees. You too call this sanctuary home. <p>Together, your footsteps trace the path of our history. And this Memorial Day, we mark another milestone. For the first time in 9 years, Americans are not fighting and dying in Iraq. We are winding down the war in Afghanistan, and our troops will continue to come home. After a decade under the dark cloud of war, we can see the light of a new day on the horizon. <p>Especially for those who've lost a loved one, this chapter will remain open long after the guns have fallen silent. Today, with the war in Iraq finally over, it is fitting to pay tribute to the sacrifice that spanned that conflict. <p>In March of 2003, on the first day of the invasion, one of our helicopters crashed near the Iraqi border with Kuwait. On it were four marines: Major Jay Aubin, Captain Ryan Beaupre, Corporal Brian Kennedy, and Staff Sergeant Kendall Waters-Bey. Together, they became the first American casualties of the Iraq war. Their families and friends barely had time to register the beginning of the conflict before being forced to confront its awesome costs. <p>Eight years, 7 months, and 25 days later, Army Specialist David Hickman was on patrol in Baghdad. That's when his vehicle struck a roadside bomb. He became the last of nearly 4,500 American patriots to give their lives in Iraq. A month after David's death&mdash;the days before the last American troops, including David, were scheduled to come home&mdash;I met with the Hickman family at Fort Bragg. Right now the Hickmans are beginning a very difficult journey that so many of your families have traveled before them, a journey that even more families will take in the months and years ahead. <p>To the families here today, I repeat what I said to the Hickmans: I cannot begin to fully understand your loss. As a father, I cannot begin to imagine what it's like to hear that knock on the door and learn that your worst fears have come true. But as Commander in Chief, I can tell you that sending our troops into harm's way is the most wrenching decision that I have to make. I can promise you, I will never do so unless it's absolutely necessary, and that when we do, we must give our troops a clear mission and the full support of a grateful nation. <p>And as a country, all of us can and should ask ourselves how we can help you shoulder a burden that nobody should have to bear alone. As we honor your mothers and fathers, your sons and daughters, we have given&mdash;who have given their last full measure of devotion to this country, we have to ask ourselves how can we support you and your families and give you some strength? <p>One thing we can do is remember these heroes as you remember them: not just as a rank or a number or a name on a headstone, but as Americans, often far too young, who were guided by a deep and abiding love for their families, for each other, and for this country. <p>We can remember Jay Aubin, the pilot, who met his wife on an aircraft carrier, and told his mother before shipping out, \\"If anything happens to me, just know I'm doing what I love.\\" <p>We can remember Ryan Beaupre, the former track star, running the leadoff leg, always the first one into action, who quit his job as an accountant and joined the Marines because he wanted to do something more meaningful with his life. <p>We can remember Brian Kennedy, the rock climber and lacrosse fanatic, who told his father 2 days before his helicopter went down that the marines he served alongside were some of the best men he'd ever dealt with, and they'd be his friends forever. <p>We can remember Kendall Waters-Bey, a proud father, a proud son of Baltimore, who was described by a fellow servicemember as \\"a light in a very dark world.\\" <p>And we can remember David Hickman, a freshman in high school when the war began, a fitness fanatic who half-jokingly called himself \\"Zeus,\\" a loyal friend with an infectious laugh. <p>We can remember them. And we can meet our obligations to those who did come home, and their families who are in the midst of a different, but very real battle of their own. <p>To all our men and women in uniform who are here today, know this: The patriots who rest beneath these hills were fighting for many things&mdash;for their families, for their flag&mdash;but above all, they were fighting for you. As long as I'm President, we will make sure you and your loved ones receive the benefits you've earned and the respect you deserve. America will be there for you. <p>And finally, for all of you who carry a special weight on your heart, we can strive to be a nation worthy of your sacrifice, a nation that is fair and equal, peaceful, and free, a nation that weighs the cost of every human life, a nation where all of us meet our obligations to one another and to this country that we love. That's what we can do. <p>As President, I have no higher honor and no greater responsibility than serving as Commander in Chief of the greatest military the world has ever known. And on days like this, I take pride in the fact that this country has always been home to men and women willing to give of themselves until they had nothing more to give. I take heart in the strength and resolve of those who still serve, both here at home and around the world. And I know that we must always strive to be worthy of your sacrifice. <p>God bless you. God bless the fallen. God bless our men and women in uniform, and may God bless the United States of America.\" "
"136" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. Chuck, thank you for your words and your friendship and your life of service. Veterans of the Vietnam war, families, friends, distinguished guests: I know it is hot, but you are here to honor your loved ones. And Michelle and I could not be more honored to be here with you. <p>It speaks to the complexity of America's time in Vietnam that, even now, historians cannot agree on precisely when the war began. American advisers had served there and died there as early as the mid-fifties. Major combat operations would not begin until the mid-sixties. But if any year in between illustrated the changing nature of our involvement, it was 1962. <p>It was January, in Saigon. Our Army pilots strapped on their helmets and boarded their helicopters. They lifted off, raced over treetops carrying South Vietnamese troops. It was a single raid against an enemy stronghold just a few miles into the jungle, but it was one of America's first major operations in that faraway land. <p>Fifty years later, we come to this wall, to this sacred place, to remember. We can step towards its granite wall, reach out, touch a name. Today is Memorial Day, when we recall all those who gave everything in the darkness of war so we could stand here in the glory of spring. And today begins the 50th commemoration of our war in Vietnam. We honor each of those names etched in stone: 58,282 American patriots. We salute all who served with them, and we stand with the families who love them still. <p>For years you've come here, to be with them once more. And in the simple things you've left behind&mdash;your offerings, your mementos, your gifts&mdash;we get a glimpse of the lives they led: the blanket that covered him as a baby; the baseball bat he swung as a boy; a wedding ring; the photo of the grandchild he never met; the boots he wore, still caked in mud; the medals she earned, still shining. And of course, some of the things left here have special meaning, known only to the veterans: a can of beer, a packet of M&Ms, a container of SPAM, an old field ration&mdash;still good, still awful. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>It's here we feel the depth of your sacrifice. And here we see a piece of our larger American story. Our Founders, in their genius, gave us a task. They set out to make a more perfect union. And so it falls to every generation to carry on that work: to keep moving forward, to overcome a sometimes painful past, to keep striving for our ideals. <p>And one of the most painful chapters in our history was Vietnam&mdash;most particularly, how we treated our troops who served there. You were often blamed for a war you didn't start, when you should have been commended for serving your country with valor. You were sometimes blamed for misdeeds of a few, when the honorable service of the many should have been praised. You came home and sometimes were denigrated, when you should have been celebrated. It was a national shame, a disgrace that should have never happened. That's why here today we resolve that it will not happen again. <p>And so a central part of this 50th anniversary will be to tell your story as it should have been told all along. It's another chance to set the record straight. That's one more way we keep perfecting our Union: setting the record straight. And it starts today. Because history will honor your service, and your names will join a story of service that stretches back two centuries. <p>Let us tell the story of a generation of servicemembers&mdash;every color, every creed, rich, poor, officer, and enlisted&mdash;who served with just as much patriotism and honor as any before you. Let's never forget that most of those who served in Vietnam did so by choice; so many of you volunteered. Your country was at war, and you said, \\"Send me.\\" That includes our women in Vietnam&mdash;every one of you a volunteer. Those who were drafted, they too went and carried their burden. You served; you did your duty. <p>You persevered though some of the most brutal conditions ever faced by Americans in war: the suffocating heat; the drenching monsoon rains; an enemy that could come out of nowhere and vanish just as quickly; some of the most intense urban combat in history and battles for a single hill that could rage for weeks. Let it be said&mdash;in those hellholes like Briarpatch and the Zoo and the Hanoi Hilton&mdash;our Vietnam POWs didn't simply endure; you wrote some of the most extraordinary stories of bravery and integrity in the annals of military history. <p>As a nation, we've long celebrated the courage of our forces at Normandy and Iwo Jima, the Pusan Perimeter and Heartbreak Ridge. So let us also speak of your courage at Hue and Khe Sanh, at Tan Son Nhut and Saigon, from Hamburger Hill to Rolling Thunder. All too often it's forgotten that you, our troops in Vietnam, won every major battle you fought in. <p>When you came home, I know many of you put your medals away, tucked them in a drawer or in a box in the closet. You went on with your lives, started families and pursued careers. A lot of you didn't talk too much about your service. As a consequence, this Nation has not always fully appreciated the chapter of your lives that came next. <p>So let us also tell a story of a generation that came home, and how, even though some Americans turned their back on you, you never turned your back on America. Like generations before you, you took off the uniform, but you never stopped serving. You became teachers and police officers and nurses, the folks we count on every single day. You became entrepreneurs, running companies and pioneering industries that changed the world. You became leaders and public servants, from town halls to Capitol Hill, lifting up our communities, our States, our Nation. <p>You reminded us what it was like to serve, what it meant to serve. Those of you who stayed in uniform, you rose through the ranks, became leaders in every service, learned from your experience in Vietnam, and rebuilt our military into the finest force that the world has ever known. And let's remember all those Vietnam veterans who came back and served again in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. You did not stop serving. <p>Even as you succeeded in all these endeavors, you did something more&mdash;maybe the most important thing you did&mdash;you looked after each other. When your Government didn't live up to its responsibilities, you spoke out, fighting for the care and benefits you had earned, over time, transforming the VA. And of course, one of these Vietnam veterans is now our outstanding Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Ric Shinseki. <p>You looked after one another. You cared for one another. People weren't always talking about PTSD at the time. You understood it, and you were there for each other. Just as importantly, you didn't just take care of your own; you cared for those that followed. You made it your mission to make sure today's troops get the respect and support that all too often you did not receive. <p>Because of you, because our Vietnam veterans led the charge, the post-9/11 GI bill is helping hundreds of thousands of today's veterans go to college and pursue their dreams. Because of you, because you didn't let us forget, at our airports, our returning troops get off the airplane, and you are there to shake their hands. Because of you, across America, communities have welcomed home our forces from Iraq. And when our troops return from Afghanistan, America will give this entire 9/11 generation the welcome home they deserve. That happened in part because of you. <p>This is the story of our Vietnam servicemembers, the story that needs to be told. This is what this 50th anniversary is all about. It's another opportunity to say to our Vietnam veterans what we should have been saying from the beginning: You did your job. You served with honor. You made us proud. You came home, and you helped build the America that we love and that we cherish. <p>So here today, it must be said, you have earned your place among the greatest generations. At this time, I would ask all our Vietnam veterans, those of you who can stand, to please stand, all those already standing, raise your hands, as we say those simple words which always greet our troops when they come home from here on out: Welcome home. Welcome home. Welcome home. Thank you. We appreciate you. Welcome home. <p>Today we're calling on all Americans and every segment of our society to join this effort. Everybody can do something. Five decades removed from a time of division among Americans, this anniversary can remind us of what we share as Americans. That includes honoring our Vietnam veterans by never forgetting the lessons of that war. <p>So let us resolve that when America sends our sons and daughters into harm's way, we will always give them a clear mission, we will always give them a sound strategy, we will give them the equipment they need to get the job done, we will have their backs. We will resolve that leaders will be candid about the risks and about progress and have a plan to bring our troops home with honor. <p>Let us resolve to never forget the costs of war, including the terrible loss of innocent civilians, not just in Vietnam, but in all wars. For we know that while your sacrifice and service is the very definition of glory, war itself is not glorious. We hate war. When we fight, we do so to protect ourselves because it's necessary. <p>Let's resolve that in our democracy, we can debate and disagree, even in a time of war. But let us never use patriotism as a political sword. Patriots can support a war; patriots can oppose a war. And whatever our view, let us always stand united in support of our troops, who we've placed in harm's way. That is our solemn obligation. <p>Let's resolve to take care of our veterans as well as they've taken care of us: not just talk, but actions. Not just in the first 5 years after a war, but the first five decades. For our Vietnam veterans, this means the disability benefits for diseases connected to Agent Orange. It means job opportunities and mental health care to help you stand tall again. It means ending the tragedy of veterans' homelessness, so that every veteran who has fought for America has a home in America. You shouldn't have to fight for a roof over your heads when you fought on behalf of the country that you love. <p>And when an American does not come back&mdash;including the 1,666 Americans still missing from the Vietnam war&mdash;let us resolve to do everything in our power to bring them home. This is our solemn promise to mothers like Sarah Shay, who joins us today&mdash;93 years old&mdash;who has honored her son, Major Donald Shay, Jr., missing in action for 42 years. There she is. Sarah, thank you for your courage. God bless you. <p>This is the promise we're fulfilling today to the Meroney family of Fayetteville, Arkansas. Forty-three years after he went missing, we can announce that Army Captain Virgil Meroney III is coming home, and he will finally rest in peace. <p>Some have called this war era a scar on our country, but here's what I say. As any wound heals, the tissue around it becomes tougher, becomes stronger than before. And in this sense, finally, we might begin to see the true legacy of Vietnam. Because of Vietnam and our veterans, we now use American power smarter, we honor our military more, we take care of our veterans better. Because of the hard lessons of Vietnam, because of you, America is stronger than before. <p>And finally, on this anniversary and all the years to come, let us remember what binds us as one people. This is important for all of us, whether you fought in the Vietnam war or fought against it, whether you were too young to be shaped by it. It is important that our children understand the sacrifices that were made by our troops in Vietnam, that for them, this is more than just a name in history books. It's important that we know the lesson of a gift once left at this memorial. <p>It was towards the end of the day, and most of the tourists and visitors had departed. And there it was: a football helmet, black with white stripes, and a wristband. And with them was a handwritten note. And it was from a young man, still in high school. And mind you, this was more than two decades after Vietnam. That high school student was born years after the war had already ended. But in that short, handwritten note he captured the reverence&mdash;the bonds between generations&mdash;that bring us here today. <p>The letter began, \\"Dear Vietnam Veterans, here are two things from me to you that I think you should have.\\" He explained that it was his helmet from midget football and his wristband from his senior year. So today I want to close with the words he wrote: <p>\\"In these two pieces of equipment, I was allowed to make mistakes, correct them, grow and mature as a person. However, that was on my battlefield. You didn't get the chance to do that on your battlefield. Some of you were forced to grow up too fast; all of you died too soon. We do have many things in common, though. We both have pride, heart and determination. I'm just sorry you guys had to learn those qualities too fast. That is why I'm giving you what I grew up with. You are true heroes and you will never be forgotten.\\" <p>That's from a high school kid, born decades after the end of the war. And that captures the spirit that this entire country should embrace. <p>Veterans, families of the Vietnam war, I know the wounds of war are slow to heal. You know that better than most. But today we take another step. The task of telling your story continues. The work of perfecting our Union goes on. And decades from now, I hope another young American will visit this place and reach out and touch a name. And she'll learn the story of servicemembers&mdash;people she never met, who fought a war she never knew&mdash;and in that moment of understanding and of gratitude and of grace, your legacy will endure. For you are all true heroes, and you will all be remembered. <p>May God bless you. May God bless your families. May God bless our men and women in uniform, and may God bless these United States of America.\" "
"137" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you very much. Everybody, please have a seat, and welcome to the White House. It is an extraordinary pleasure to be here with all of you to present this year's Medals of Freedom. And I have to say, just looking around the room, this is a packed house, which is a testament to how cool this group is. [<i>Laughter</i>] Everybody wanted to check them out. <p>This is the highest civilian honor this country can bestow, which is ironic, because nobody sets out to win it. No one ever picks up a guitar or fights a disease or starts a movement, thinking, \\"You know what, if I keep this up, in 2012, I could get a medal in the White House from a guy named Barack Obama.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] That wasn't in the plan. <p>But that's exactly what makes this award so special. Every one of today's honorees is blessed with an extraordinary amount of talent. All of them are driven. But we could fill this room many times over with people who are talented and driven. What sets these men and women apart is the incredible impact they have had on so many people, not in short, blinding bursts, but steadily, over the course of a lifetime. <p>Together, the honorees on this stage, and the ones who couldn't be here, have moved us with their words, they have inspired us with their actions, they've enriched our lives, and they've changed our lives for the better. Some of them are household names; others have labored quietly out of the public eye. Most of them may never fully appreciate the difference they've made or the influence that they've had, but that's where our job comes in. It's our job to help let them know how extraordinary their impact has been on our lives. And so today we present this amazing group with one more accolade for a life well led, and that's the Presidential Medal of Freedom. <p>So I'm going to take an opportunity&mdash;I hope you guys don't mind&mdash;to brag about each of you, starting with Madeleine Albright. <p>Usually, Madeleine does the talking. [<i>Laughter</i>] Once in a while, she lets her jewelry do the talking. [<i>Laughter</i>] When Saddam Hussein called her a \\"snake,\\" she wore a serpent on her lapel&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;the next time she visited Baghdad. When Slobodan Milosevic referred to her as a \\"goat,\\" a new pin appeared in her collection. <p>As the first woman to serve as America's top diplomat, Madeleine's courage and toughness helped bring peace to the Balkans and paved the way for progress in some of the most unstable corners of the world. And as an immigrant herself&mdash;the granddaughter of Holocaust victims who fled her native Czechoslovakia as a child&mdash;Madeleine brought a unique perspective to the job. This is one of my favorite stories. Once, at a naturalization ceremony, an Ethiopian man came up to her and said, \\"Only in America can a refugee meet the Secretary of State.\\" And she replied, \\"Only in America can a refugee become the Secretary of State.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] We're extraordinarily honored to have Madeleine here. And obviously, I think it's fair to say I speak for one of your successors who is so appreciative of the work you did and the path that you laid. <p>It was a scorching hot day in 1963, and Mississippi was on the verge of a massacre. The funeral procession for Medgar Evers had just disbanded, and a group of marchers was throwing rocks at a line of equally defiant and heavily-armed policemen. And suddenly, a white man in shirtsleeves, hands raised, walked towards the protestors and talked them into going home peacefully. And that man was John Doar. He was the face of the Justice Department in the South. He was proof that the Federal Government was listening. And over the years, John escorted James Meredith to the University of Mississippi. He walked alongside the Selma-to-Montgomery march. He laid the groundwork for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In the words of John Lewis, \\"He gave [civil rights workers] a reason not to give up on those in power.\\" And he did it by never giving up on them. And I think it's fair to say that I might not be here had it not been for his work. <p>Bob Dylan started out singing other people's songs. But, as he says, \\"There came a point where I had to write what I wanted to say, because what I wanted to say, nobody else was writing.\\" So, born in Hibbing, Minnesota&mdash;a town, he says, where \\"you couldn't be a rebel&mdash;it was too cold\\"&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;Bob moved to New York at age 19. By the time he was 23, Bob's voice, with its weight, its unique, gravelly power was redefining not just what music sounded like, but the message it carried and how it made people feel. Today, everybody from Bruce Springsteen to U2 owes Bob a debt of gratitude. There is not a bigger giant in the history of American music. All these years later, he's still chasing that sound, still searching for a little bit of truth. And I have to say that I am a really big fan. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>In the 1960s, more than 2 million people died from smallpox every year. Just over a decade later, that number was zero&mdash;2 million to zero, thanks, in part, to Dr. Bill Foege. As a young medical missionary working in Nigeria, Bill helped develop a vaccination strategy that would later be used to eliminate smallpox from the face of the Earth. And when that war was won, he moved on to other diseases, always trying to figure out what works. In one remote Nigerian village, after vaccinating 2,000 people in a single day, Bill asked the local chief how he had gotten so many people to show up. And the chief explained that he had told everyone to come see&mdash;to \\"come to the village and see the tallest man in the world.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Today, that world owes that really tall man a great debt of gratitude. <p>On the morning that John Glenn blasted off into space, America stood still. For half an hour, the phones stopped ringing in Chicago police headquarters, and New York subway drivers offered a play-by-play account over the loudspeakers. President Kennedy interrupted a breakfast with congressional leaders and joined 100 million TV viewers to hear the famous words, \\"Godspeed, John Glenn.\\" The first American to orbit the Earth, John Glenn became a hero in every sense of the word, but he didn't stop there serving his country. As a Senator, he found new ways to make a difference. And on his second trip into space at age 77, he defied the odds once again. But he reminds everybody, don't tell him he's lived a historic life. He says, \\"Are living.\\" He'll say, \\"Don't put it in the past tense.\\" He's still got a lot of stuff going on. <p>George Hirabayashi knew what it was like to stand alone. As a student at the University of Washington, Gordon was one of only three Japanese Americans to defy the Executive order that forced thousands of families to leave their homes, their jobs, and their civil rights behind and move to internment camps during World War II. He took his case all the way to the Supreme Court, and he lost. And it would be another 40 years before that decision was reversed, giving Asian Americans everywhere a small measure of justice. In Gordon's words, \\"It takes a crisis to tell us that unless citizens are willing to standup for the [Constitution], it's not worth the paper it's written on.\\" And this country is better off because of citizens like him who are willing to stand up. <p>Similarly, when Cesar Chavez sat Dolores Huerta down at his kitchen table and told her they should start a union, she thought he was joking. She was a single mother of seven children, so she obviously didn't have a lot of free time. But Dolores had been an elementary school teacher and remembered seeing children come to school hungry and without shoes. So in the end, she agreed, and workers everywhere are glad that she did. Without any negotiating experience, Dolores helped lead a worldwide grape boycott that forced growers to agree to some of the country's first farm worker contracts. And ever since, she has fought to give more people a seat at the table. \\"Don't wait to be invited,\\" she says, \\"step in there.\\" And on a personal note, Dolores was very gracious when I told her I had stolen her slogan, \\"<i>Si se puede</i>\\"&mdash;\\"Yes we can.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Knowing her, I'm pleased that she let me off easy because Dolores does not play. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>For years, Jan Karski's students at Georgetown University knew he was a great professor; what they didn't realize was he was also a hero. Fluent in four languages, possessed of a photographic memory, Jan served as a courier for the Polish resistance during the darkest days of World War II. Before one trip across enemy lines, resistance fighters told him that Jews were being murdered on a massive scale and smuggled him into the Warsaw Ghetto and a Polish death camp to see for himself. Jan took that information to President Franklin Roosevelt, giving one of the first accounts of the Holocaust and imploring to the world to take action. It was decades before Jan was ready to tell his story. By then, he said, \\"I don't need courage anymore. So I teach compassion.\\" <p>Growing up in Georgia in the late 1800s, Juliette Gordon Low was not exactly typical. She flew airplanes. She went swimming. She experimented with electricity for fun. And she recognized early on that in order to keep up with the changing times, women would have to be prepared. So at age 52, after meeting the founder of the Boy Scouts in England, Juliette came home and called her cousin and said, \\"I've got something for the girls of Savannah, and all of America, and all the world. And we're going to start it tonight!\\" A century later, almost 60 million Girl Scouts have gained leadership skills and self-confidence through the organization that she founded. They include CEOs, astronauts, my own Secretary of State. And from the very beginning, they have also included girls of different races and faiths and abilities, just the way that Juliette would have wanted it. <p>Toni Morrison, she is used to a little distraction. As a single mother working at a publishing company by day, she would carve out a little time in the evening to write, often with her two sons pulling on her hair and tugging at her earrings. Once, a baby spit up on her tablet so she wrote around it. [<i>Laughter</i>] Circumstances may not have been ideal, but the words that came out were magical. Toni Morrison's prose brings us that kind of moral and emotional intensity that few writers ever attempt. From \\"Song of Solomon\\" to \\"Beloved,\\" Toni reaches us deeply, using a tone that is lyrical, precise, distinct, and inclusive. She believes that language \\"arcs toward the place where meaning might lie.\\" The rest of us are lucky to be following along for the ride. <p>During oral argument, Justice John Paul Stevens often began his line of questioning with a polite, \\"May I interrupt?\\" or \\"May I ask a question?\\" You can imagine the lawyers would say, \\"okay\\"&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;after which he would, just as politely, force a lawyer to stop dancing around and focus on the most important issues in the case. That was his signature style: modest, insightful, well-prepared, razor-sharp. He is the third longest serving Justice in the history of the Court. And Justice Stevens applies&mdash;applied, throughout his career, his clear and graceful manner to the defense of individual rights and the rule of law, always favoring a pragmatic solution over an ideological one. Ever humble, he would happily comply when unsuspecting tourists asked him to take their picture in front of the Court. [<i>Laughter</i>] And at his vacation home in Florida, he was John from Arlington, better known for his world-class bridge game than his world-changing judicial opinions. Even in his final days on the bench, Justice Stevens insisted he was still \\"learning on the job.\\" But in the end, we are the ones who have learned from him. <p>When a doctor first told Pat Summitt she suffered from dementia, she almost punched him. When a second doctor advised her to retire, she responded, \\"Do you know who you're dealing with here?\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Obviously, they did not. As Pat says, \\"I can fix a tractor, mow hay, plow a field, chop tobacco, fire a barn, and call the cows. But what I'm really known for is winning.\\" In 38 years at Tennessee, she racked up 8 national championships, more than 1,000 wins; understand, this is more than any college coach, male or female, in the history of the NCAA. And more importantly, every player that went through her program has either graduated or is on her way to a degree. That's why anybody who feels sorry for Pat will find themselves on the receiving end of that famous glare, or she might punch you. [<i>Laughter</i>] She's still getting up every day and doing what she does best, which is teaching. \\"The players,\\" she says, \\"are my best medicine.\\" <p>Our final honoree is not here, Shimon Peres, the President of Israel, who has done more for the cause of peace in the Middle East than just about anybody alive. I'll be hosting President Peres for a dinner here at the White House next month, and we'll be presenting him with his medal and honoring his incredible contributions to the State of Israel and the world at that time. So I'm looking forward to welcoming him. And if it's all right with you, I will save my best lines about him for that occasion. <p>So these are the recipients of the 2012 Medals of Freedom. And just on a personal note, I had a chance to see everybody in the back. What's wonderful about these events for me is so many of these people are my heroes individually. I know how they impacted my life. <p>I remember reading \\"Song of Solomon\\" when I was a kid and not just trying to figure out how to write, but also how to be and how to think. And I remember in college listening to Bob Dylan and my world opening up because he captured something that&mdash;about this country that was so vital. And I think about Dolores Huerta, reading about her when I was starting off as an organizer. <p>Everybody on this stage has marked my life in profound ways. And I was telling, somebody like Pat Summitt, when I think about my two daughters, who are tall and gifted, and knowing that because of folks like Coach Summitt they're standing up straight and diving after loose balls and feeling confident and strong, then I understand that the impact that these people have had extends beyond me. It will continue for generations to come. What an extraordinary honor to be able to say thank you to all of them for the great work that they have done on behalf of this country and on behalf of the world. <p>So it is now my great honor to present them with a small token of our appreciation. <p>[<i>At this point, Lt. Cmdr. Tiffany Hill, USN, Navy Aide to the President, read the citations, and the President presented the medals.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Can everybody please stand and give a rousing applause to our Medal of Freedom winners? <p>Well, we could not be prouder of all of them. We could not be more grateful to all of them. You have had an impact on all of us, and I know that you will continue to have an impact on all of us. So thank you for being here. Thank you for putting yourself through White House ceremonies&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;which are always full of all kinds of protocol. <p>Fortunately, we also have a reception afterwards. I hear the food around here is pretty good. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I look forward to all of you having a chance to stay and mingle, and again, thank you again, to all of you.\" "
"138" "\"Thank you! Well, welcome to the White House, everybody. I hope you're having fun. [<i>Applause</i>] Excellent. <p>I want to recognize Ambassador Michael Oren, and thank him for his work representing our great friend, the State of Israel. I want to recognize and thank all the Members of Congress and the members of my administration who are here today. I want to thank our musical guests, Rak Shalom. I was just meeting with all of them back there, they said they did quite a few numbers. And they were outstanding, I know. <p>This year, we celebrate Jewish Heritage Month&mdash;Jewish American Heritage Month&mdash;and we're also commemorating an important anniversary. A hundred and fifty years ago, General Ulysses Grant issued an order known as General Orders No. 11 that would have expelled Jews \\"as a class\\" from what was then known as the military Department of the Tennessee. It was wrong. Even if it was 1862, even if official acts of anti-Semitism were all too common around the world, it was wrong and indicative of an ugly strain of thought. <p>But what happened next could have only taken place in America. Groups of American Jews protested General Grant's decision. A Jewish merchant from Kentucky traveled here, to the White House, and met with President Lincoln in person. After their meeting, President Lincoln revoked the order, one more reason why we like President Lincoln. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And to General Grant's credit, he recognized that he had made a serious mistake. So later in his life, he apologized for this order, and as President, he went out of his way to appoint Jews to public office and to condemn the persecution of Jews in Eastern Europe. <p>Today we have a few documents on display; maybe some of you saw them when you walked in. There are two letters of protest from Jewish organizations to President Lincoln. There is President Lincoln's handwritten reply saying that he had taken action. And there is a receipt for the donation that President Grant made to the Adas Israel synagogue here in Washington, when he attended a service there in 1876. <p>So together, these papers tell a story, a fundamentally American story. Like so many groups, Jews have had to fight for their piece of the American dream. But this country holds a special promise: that if we stand up for the traditions we believe in and in the values that we share, then our wrongs can be made right, our Union can be made more perfect, and our world can be repaired. <p>Today, it's our turn, our generation's turn, and you guys, your generation's turn. You're younger than us. [<i>Laughter</i>] We got some later generations here in the front. We're the ones who have to stand up for our shared values. Here at home, we have to rebuild an America where everybody gets a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same rules. <p>Beyond our borders, we have to stand alongside our friends who share our commitment to freedom and democracy and universal rights, and that includes, of course, our unwavering commitment to the State of Israel and its security and the pursuit of a just and lasting peace. <p>It's no secret that we've got a lot of work to do, but as your traditions teach us, while we are not obligated to finish the work, neither are we free to desist from that work. <p>So today we don't just celebrate all that American Jews have done for our country, we also look toward the future. And as we do, I know that those of you in this room, but folks all across this country will continue to help perfect our Union, and for that, I am extraordinarily grateful. <p>God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"139" "\"Thank you very much. Everybody, please have a seat. Have a seat. I want to begin by recognizing the Members of Congress who are here today. All of them did outstanding work on this legislation. I in particular want to thank Steny Hoyer, Congresswoman Mahoney, and&mdash;as well as Congressman Miller, who helped to make this day possible. Their leadership, their hard work made this bill a reality. <p>We've talked a lot recently about the fundamental choice that we face as a country. America can either settle for an economy where just a few are doing well and a lot of folks are struggling to get by, or we can build the kind of economy where everybody is getting a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same rules. <p>And part of building that broad-based economy with a strong middle class is making sure that we're not just known as a nation that consumes. We've got to be a nation that produces, a nation that sells. Our middle class was created by workers who made and sold the best products in the world. Our communities and our economy have always done better when we shipped more goods than anybody else, stamped with that phrase: Made in America. And I want us to be that nation again. I want us to be that nation in perpetuity. <p>Two years ago, I set a goal of doubling American exports over 5 years. Today, with the trade agreements that we've signed into law, with the help of some of these same Members of Congress, we're making historic progress. Soon, there are going to be millions of new customers for our goods and services in Korea, in Colombia, and Panama. That way, even though we got some Hyundais over here, we're also going to have some Chryslers and Fords and Chevys in Seoul that are imported from Detroit and Toledo and Chicago. <p>So I'm going to go anywhere I can in the world to create new markets for American goods. And we're also not going to stand by when our competitors aren't following the rules. We've brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate of the previous administration. We've set up a trade enforcement unit to investigate unfair trade practices that are taking place anyplace&mdash;anywhere in the world. Anytime other countries skirt the rules or put our workers and our businesses in an unfair position, we're going to take action. <p>We're also making sure that American businesses have better access to the 95 percent of the world's consumers who live beyond our shores. And that's why the bipartisan bill that I'm about to sign is so important. By reauthorizing support for the Export-Import Bank, we're helping thousands of businesses sell more of their products and services overseas, and in the process, we're helping them create jobs here at home. And we're doing that at no extra cost to the taxpayer. <p>Over the past few years, I've met with a lot of business leaders and a lot of workers across America, from companies like Boeing to Dow Chemical to smaller companies that are also interested in accessing foreign markets. And they've told me how critical support from the Ex-Im Bank has been in competing more effectively in the global marketplace. As the head of the bank, we owe our thanks to Fred Hochberg, who is here on stage, for doing such an outstanding job. <p>Just to give you a couple examples, Boeing relied on support from the Ex-Im Bank to strike a deal selling more than 200 planes to one of the fastest growing airlines in the world. And that translates into thousands of jobs here in the United States. As long as our global competitors are providing financing for their exports, we've got to do the same. So I'm glad that Congress got this done. I'm grateful to members of both parties who came together and put the interests of the American people first. <p>Now we've got to do more. Obviously, the world economy is still in a delicate place because of what's going on in Europe and the fact that some of the emerging countries have been slowing down. It is absolutely critical for us to make sure that we are full speed ahead. <p>I've been traveling around the country talking about a to-do list for Congress with some commonsense ideas that historically have had bipartisan support to help continue growth and job creation. And just like the bill I'm about to sign, those policies can help strengthen the economy and put more folks back to work. We shouldn't have to wait until an election to do some of this business. <p>A couple of points. Number one, it still makes no sense for us to be giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs and factories overseas. The great news is there are a lot of companies that are now thinking about insourcing and moving jobs back to the United States. We are more competitive than ever. Our workers are more productive than ever. We want to help provide incentives for folks to make those decisions. So it's time for Congress to take tax breaks away that allow for deductions moving jobs overseas and instead cover moving expenses for companies that are interested in bringing jobs back to America. <p>Number two, Congress should give every responsible homeowner the opportunity to save an average of $3,000 a year by refinancing their mortgage. We're starting to see a little bit of stabilizing in some of the housing markets around the country, but that continues to be a significant drag on our economy. But when families are able to take advantage of these historically low rates, it makes a difference. It puts money in their pockets or it may help them rebuild some of their equity. It gives them more confidence and the housing market stabilizes further. <p>We've done everything that we can do administratively to help some portion of homeowners around the country refinance. But every responsible homeowner in America should have this&mdash;a chance to save money. That's not just good, by the way, for the housing industry, that's good for all businesses, because it means consumers are going to be out there with a little extra money in their pockets. <p>Number three, Congress still has the opportunity to do more to help small-business owners, who create most of the new jobs in America. So we want to give them a tax break for hiring more workers and providing those workers higher wages. <p>Fourth, Congress should extend the tax credits for clean energy companies that are set to expire at the end of the year. This is something that a lot of Members, both Democrats and Republicans, should be able to appreciate, because wind power, solar power, biofuels, those aren't partisan issues, that's a job sector that is growing across the country. But right now, there is too much uncertainty because we haven't gone ahead and locked down some of these tax credits. <p>These companies are putting folks back to work and they're helping us break our dependence on foreign oil. There are members, again, of both parties that support these tax credits. And tens of thousands of jobs are at stake. So I think it's very important for us to make sure that we move forward on that. <p>Fifth&mdash;and I'm going to speak to this on Friday&mdash;Congress should create a veterans job corps so we can put our returning heroes back to work as cops and firefighters and park rangers. We just observed Memorial Day, an extraordinarily moving Memorial Day. We were down at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial commemorating 50 years since that difficult and challenging war. And one thing we learned from that was that we've got to treat our heroes with the respect and dignity that they have earned. <p>And our veterans are some of the most highly trained, highly educated, highly skilled workers we've got. These are Americans who want to keep serving now that they're back. So we've got to make sure when they come home, they come home to new jobs and new opportunities. So there are a number of things that my administration can do on our own, and we're going to keep on doing them, but it gets a whole lot easier if we get some help from Congress. And this is a great example, a great model of what can happen. <p>America has come through some tough times together, and it's going to take more time than any of us would like to get to a place where all of us have fully recovered from the worst recession in our lives. There will continue to be hurdles and there will continue to be some headwinds that we can't fully control. But there are plenty of things that we can control, and there's plenty of solutions within our reach. There are steps that we can take right now to speed up this recovery, to help create jobs, to restore some of the financial security that families have lost. It's within our control to do the right thing and do it now. <p>So my message to Congress is thank you and congratulations on authorizing Ex-Im Bank to continue on its extraordinary mission. We've got more work to do. I hope this ends up being a model for the kind of progress that we can make in the months to come and the years to come. So with that, it is my great pleasure to sign this bill into law.\" "
"140" "\"Well, good afternoon, everybody. Thank you, Fred, for that introduction. To President George H.W. Bush and Barbara, to all the members of the Bush family who are here, it is a great privilege to have you here today. And to President and Mrs. Bush, welcome back to the house that you called home for 8 years. <p>The White House is many things at once: It's a working office; it's a living museum; it's an enduring symbol of our democracy. But at the end of the day, when the visitors go home and the lights go down, a few of us are blessed with the tremendous honor to actually live here. <p>I think it's fair to say that every President is acutely aware that we are just temporary residents. We're renters here. We're charged with the upkeep until our lease runs out. But we also leave a piece of ourselves in this place. And today, with the unveiling of the portraits next to me, President and Mrs. Bush will take their place alongside men and women who built this country and those who worked to perfect it. <p>It's been said that no one can ever truly understand what it's like being President until they sit behind that desk and feel the weight and responsibility for the first time. And that is true. After 3&frac12;  years in office, and much more gray hair, I have a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by the Presidents who came before me, including my immediate predecessor, President Bush. <p>In this job, no decision that reaches your desk is easy. No choice you make is without costs. No matter how hard you try, you're not going to make everybody happy. I think that's something President Bush and I both learned pretty quickly. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And that's why, from time to time, those of us who have had the privilege to hold this office find ourselves turning to the only people on Earth who know the feeling. We may have our differences politically, but the Presidency transcends those differences. We all love this country. We all want America to succeed. We all believe that when it comes to moving this country forward, we have an obligation to pull together. And we all follow the humble, heroic example of our first President, George Washington, who knew that a true test of patriotism is the willingness to freely and graciously pass the reins of power on to somebody else. <p>That's certainly been true of President Bush. The months before I took the oath of office were a chaotic time. We knew our economy was in trouble, our fellow Americans were in pain, but we wouldn't know until later just how breathtaking the financial crisis had been. And still, over those 2&frac12;  months, in the midst of that crisis, President Bush, his Cabinet, his staff, many of you who are here today, went out of your ways&mdash;George, you went out of your way&mdash;to make sure that the transition to a new administration was as seamless as possible. <p>President Bush understood that rescuing our economy was not just a Democratic or a Republican issue, it was a American priority. I'll always be grateful for that. <p>The same is true for our national security. None of us will ever forget where we were on that terrible September day when our country was attacked. All of us will always remember the image of President Bush standing on that pile of rubble, bullhorn in hand, conveying extraordinary strength and resolve to the American people, but also representing the strength and resolve of the American people. <p>And last year, when we delivered justice to Usama bin Laden, I made it clear that our success was due to many people in many organizations working together over many years, across two administrations. That's why my first call, once American forces were safely out of harm's way, was to President Bush. Because protecting our country is neither the work of one person nor the task of one period of time. It's an ongoing obligation that we all share. <p>Finally, on a personal note, Michelle and I are grateful to the entire Bush family for their guidance and their example during our own transition. George, I will always remember the gathering you hosted for all the living former Presidents before I took office, your kind words of encouragement. Plus, you also left me a really good TV sports package. I was&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I use it. <p>Laura, you reminded us that the most rewarding thing about living in this house isn't the title or the power, but the chance to shine a spotlight on the issues that matter most. And the fact that you and George raised two smart, beautiful daughters&mdash;first, as girls visiting their grandparents and then as teenagers preparing to head out into the world&mdash;that obviously gives Michelle and I tremendous hope as we try to do the right thing by our own daughters in this slightly odd atmosphere that we've created. <p>Jenna and Barbara, we will never forget the advice you gave Sasha and Malia as they began their lives in Washington. They told them to surround themselves with loyal friends, never stop doing what they love, to slide down the banisters occasionally&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;to play sardines on the lawn, to meet new people and try new things, and to try to absorb everything and enjoy all of it. And I can tell you that Malia and Sasha took that advice to heart. It really meant a lot to them. <p>One of the greatest strengths of our democracy is our ability to peacefully and routinely go through transitions of power. It speaks to the fact that we've always had leaders who believe in America and everything it stands for above all else; leaders and their families who are willing to devote their lives to the country that they love. <p>This is what we'll think about every time we pass these portraits, just as millions of other visitors will do in the decades and, perhaps, even the centuries to come. I want to thank John Howard Sanden, the artist behind these beautiful works, for his efforts. And on behalf of the American people, I want to thank most sincerely President and Mrs. Bush for their extraordinary service to our country. <p>And now I'd like to invite them on stage to take part in the presentation.\" "
"141" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Golden Valley! It is good to be back in Minnesota. It is good to see your Governor, Mark Dayton, here. On the way over we were talking about making sure the Vikings were staying. Now, that's a hard thing for a Bears fan to do. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I was rooting for the Vikings sticking around here, and the Governor did a great job. <p><i>Audience member</i>. We were praying. <p><i>The President</i>. You were praying too, huh? [<i>Laughter</i>] Absolutely. Prayer never hurts. It helps. <p>You got two outstanding Senators, Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken. Your mayor, Shep Harris, is here. Outstanding congressional delegation in the house, give them a big round of applause. And I thought Ryan was really good, so give him a big round of applause. He's a natural. <p>Now, one of the last times I was here was last August. We took a bus tour around the State. I needed a little \\"Minnesota nice.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] I stopped for some pie in Zumbrota. I held a town hall in Cannon Falls. Amy and Al were there. I think Al ate my pie, in fact. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I spent a lot of time talking with folks who'd spent the past couple years making their way through a tough economy.<B> <p></B>And today, we're still fighting our way back from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The economy is growing again, but it's not growing as fast as we want it to grow. Our businesses have created almost 4.3 million new jobs over the last 27 months, but as we learned in today's jobs report, we're still not creating them as fast as we want. And just like this time last year, our economy is still facing some serious headwinds. We had high gas prices a month, 2 months ago, and they're starting to come down, and they were spiking, but they're still hitting people's wallets pretty hard. That has an impact. And then, most prominently, most recently, we've had a crisis in Europe's economy that is having an impact worldwide, and it's starting to cast a shadow on our own as well. So we've got a lot of work to do before we get to where we need to be. And all these factors have made it even more challenging to not just fully recover, but also lay the foundation for an economy that's built to last over the long term. <p>But that's our job. From the moment we first took action to prevent another depression, we knew the road to recovery would not be easy. We knew it would take time. We knew there would be ups and downs along the way. But we also knew if we were willing to act wisely and boldly, and if we were acting together, as Americans, if we were willing to keep at it, if we were willing to roll up our sleeves and never quit, then we wouldn't just come back, we'd come back stronger than ever. That was our belief. And that continues to be my belief. <p>We will come back stronger, we do have better days ahead, and that is because of all of you. That's because of all of you. I'd place my bets on American workers and American businesses any day of the week. You've been fighting through this tough economy with resilience and grit and innovation. Honeywell is a great example of a company that's doing outstanding work, and I want to acknowledge Dave Cote here who has been serving on my Jobs Council and doing a lot of great work. <p>That's why our auto industry has come roaring back. It's why manufacturing is consistently adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s. All that is happening because of you. Everybody here plays by the rules. You work hard. You meet your responsibilities. And you deserve leaders who do the same, leaders who will stand shoulder to shoulder with you and do everything possible to strengthen the middle class and move this economy forward. That's what you deserve. <p>Look, we can't fully control everything that happens in other parts of the world: disturbances in the Middle East, what's going on in Europe. But there are plenty of things we can control here at home. There are plenty of steps we can take right now to help create jobs and grow this economy. <p>Now, let me give you a couple examples. I sent Congress a jobs bill last September full of the kinds of bipartisan ideas that would have put our fellow Americans back to work and helped reinforce our economy against some of these outside shocks. I sent them a plan that would have reduced the deficit by $4 trillion in a way that is balanced, that pays for the job-creating investments we need by cutting unnecessary spending, but also by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more in taxes. <p>And I'll give them a little bit of credit: Congress has passed a few parts of that jobs bill, like a tax cut that's allowing working Americans to keep more of your paychecks every week. That was important. I appreciated it. But Congress has not acted on enough of the other ideas in that bill that would help make a difference and help create jobs right now. And there's no excuse for it. Not when there are so many people out there still looking for work. Not when there are still folks out there struggling to pay their bills. It's not lost on anybody that it's an election year. I understand that; I've noticed. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Four more years! Four more years! <p><i>The President. </i>[<i>Laughter</i>] But we've got responsibilities that are bigger than an election. We've got responsibilities to you. <p>So my message to Congress is: Now is not the time to play politics. Now is not the time to sit on your hands. The American people expect their leaders to work hard no matter what year it is. The economy still isn't where it needs to be. There are steps that could make a difference right now, steps that can also serve as a buffer in case the situation in Europe gets any worse. <p>So right now Congress should pass a bill to help States prevent more layoffs, so we can put thousands of teachers and firefighters and police officers back on the job. Layoffs at the State and local levels have been a chronic problem for our recovery, but it's a problem we can fix. <p>Congress should have passed a bill a long time ago to put thousands of construction workers back on the job rebuilding our roads and our bridges and our runways. Since the housing bubble burst, no sector has been hit harder than the construction industry, and we've got all this stuff that needs fixed. Remember that bridge here in Minnesota? So this is a problem we can fix. Let's do it right away. <p>Instead of just talking about job creators, Congress should give small-business owners a tax break for hiring more workers and paying them higher wages. We can get that done. We can get it done right now. Let's not wait. <p>Right now Congress should give every responsible homeowner the opportunity to save an average of $3,000 a year by refinancing their mortgage. We've got historically low rates right now. I was with a family in Reno, Nevada, a couple weeks ago. They got a chance to refinance&mdash;even though their home was underwater&mdash;put that money back in their pockets because we had taken some steps as an administration to make that available for those who have mortgages held by Government agencies like the FHA or a Government guarantee. But not everybody has those kinds of mortgages. I want everybody to have those same opportunities. <p>I assume there are some folks here who could use $3,000 a year. Let's get that done right now. That means there are going to be&mdash;if you have $3,000 a year extra, that helps you pay down your credit cards. That helps you go out and buy some things that your family needs, which is good for business. Maybe somebody will be replacing some thingamajig for their furnace. [<i>Laughter</i>] They've been putting that off. But if they've got that extra money, they might just go out there and buy that thing. Right? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Right now Congress needs to extend the tax credits for clean energy manufacturers that are set to expire at the end of this year. I was talking to Dave Cote. The issue of energy efficiency and everything we need to do to shift away from dependence on foreign oil, we're making huge progress. We're actually importing less oil than any time in the last 8 years. We're down under 50 percent, but we can do more. <p>And these clean energy companies, they're hiring folks. They're helping us break dependence on foreign oil. It's part of a package of stuff that Honeywell is doing a lot of work on. But almost 40,000 jobs are on the line if these tax credits expire. Why would anyone in Congress walk away from those jobs? We need to pass those tax credits right now. We need to pass them right now. <p>It's long past time we started encouraging what a lot of companies have been doing lately, which is bringing jobs back to this country. And some of them are coming to Minnesota. The Governor and I were talking in the car about some companies coming back&mdash;Red Bull, right? Coming back. But let's give more incentive. It's time for Congress to end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas. Let's use that money to cover moving expenses for companies that are bringing jobs back to America. That would make a difference right now. <p>So those are all steps that we could be taking to strengthen the economy, to provide us some insurance if the situation overseas starts getting worse so we can control our own destiny, keep this recovery moving forward. <p>Which brings me to the last thing Congress should do to help businesses create jobs&mdash;that's why I'm here at Honeywell today. I believe that no one who fights for this country should ever have to fight for a job when they come home. And for Congress, that means creating a veterans job corps so we can put our returning heroes back to work as cops and firefighters, on projects that protect our public lands and resources. And they should do it right now. They should do it right now. But if we're going to serve our veterans as well as they've served us, we've got to do even more. <p>We just observed Memorial Day, which makes us think about the extraordinary sacrifices so many make. But we've got to make sure we translate words into action. We can't just be in a parade, can't just march. We also have to deliver for our veterans. <p>Over the past three decades&mdash;over the past decades, rather, more than 3 million servicemembers have transitioned back to civilian life. And now that the war in Iraq is over and we're starting to wind down the war in Afghanistan, over a million more of those outstanding heroes, they're going to be joining this process of transition back into civilian life over the next few years. <p>Now, just think about the skills these veterans have acquired at an incredibly young age. Think about the leadership they've learned, 25-year-olds, 26-year-olds leading platoons into unbelievably dangerous situations, life-or-death situations. Think about the cutting-edge technologies they've mastered. Their ability to adapt to changing and unpredictable situations, you can't get that stuff from a classroom. <p>I mean, these kids, these men, these women, they've done incredible work, and that's exactly the kind of leadership and responsibility that every business in America should be wanting to attract, should be competing to attract. That's the kind of talent we need to compete for the jobs and the industries of the future. These are the kinds of Americans that every company should want to hire. <p>And that's why, here at Honeywell, you've made it a mission to hire more veterans. And let me say, Dave is incredibly patriotic, loves his veterans, but this&mdash;Honeywell is doing this not just because it feels good. They're doing it because it's good for business, because veterans make outstanding workers. So today I'm taking executive action that will make it easier for a lot of companies to do the same thing. <p>I've told the story before of a soldier in the 82d Airborne who served as a combat medic in Afghanistan; saved lives over there; earned a Bronze Star for his actions. But he came home, here to Minnesota&mdash;met him on our way to Cannon Falls. When he first came home, he couldn't even get a job as a first-responder. Think about it. This guy is out there taking care of troops who are wounded in action, couldn't initially get a job. So then he took classes through the post-9/11 GI bill&mdash;classes that he could have taught&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;just so he could qualify for the same duties at home that he had performed every day at the war. <p>Let me tell you something. If you can save a life on the battlefield, you can save a life in an ambulance. If you can oversee a convoy or millions of dollars of assets in Iraq, you can help manage a supply chain or balance its books here at home. If you can maintain the most advanced weapons in the world, if you're an electrician on a Navy ship, well, you can manufacture the next generation of advanced technology in our factories like this one. If you're working on complex machinery, you should be able to take those skills and find a manufacturing job right here, right here at home. <p>But unfortunately, a lot of returning heroes with advanced skills like these, they don't get hired simply because they don't have the civilian licenses or certifications that a lot of companies require. At the same time, I hear from business leaders all the time who say they can't find enough workers with the skills necessary to fill open positions. Eighty percent of manufacturers say this, according to one survey. So think about it. We got all these openings and all these skilled veterans looking for work, and somehow they're missing each other. That doesn't make any sense. So that's where executive action comes in. That's where we're going to fix it. <p>Today I'm proud to announce new partnerships between the military and manufacturing groups that will make it easier for companies to hire returning servicemembers who prove they've earned the skills our country needs. Soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen, coast guardsmen&mdash;if they've got skills in machining or welding or weapons maintenance, for example, you'll have a faster track to good-paying manufacturing jobs. Servicemembers with experience in logistics or maintenance on the frontlines, they'll have a faster track to jobs in those fields here at home. <p>I've also directed the Department of Defense to establish a new task force charged with finding new opportunities for servicemembers to use the skills they've learned in the military to gain the relevant industry credentials&mdash;the civilian certifications and licenses&mdash;so that it doesn't cost them and they don't necessarily have to go back to school for 3 years and take out a whole bunch of student loans when, potentially, they could do it quicker, more inexpensively, and get on the job faster. We're talking about jobs in manufacturing, in health care, in IT, in logistics, for first-responders, so that returning combat medic that I spoke about, he doesn't have to prove himself over and over again. <p>So this task force's first action is going to create opportunities for up to 126,000 servicemembers to gain the industry-recognized certifications for high-demand manufacturing jobs like the jobs right here at this plant at Honeywell. This builds on the Skills for America's Future partnership that we launched last year with the National Association of Manufacturers to provide 500,000 community college students with industry-recognized credentials that will help them secure good manufacturing jobs. <p>And all of this builds on the steps we've already taken to make sure our returning heroes come home able to share in the opportunities that they have defended. Because when our men and women sign up to become a soldier, a sailor, an airman, marine, coast guardsman, they don't stop being a citizen. When they take off that uniform, their service to this Nation doesn't stop. Think about previous generations. Well, today's veterans are the same. When they come home, they're looking to continue serving America however they can. And at a time when America needs all hands on deck, they've got the skills and the strength to help lead the way. <p>Our Government needs their patriotism and their sense of duty. That's why I ordered the hiring of more veterans by the Federal Government; we've hired more than 200,000 so far. <p>Our economy needs their outstanding talent. That's why I pushed hard last year for tax breaks for businesses that hire unemployed veterans and wounded warriors. And I'm proud to say that both parties in Congress came together to get that part done. <p>That's why we launched free personalized job services&mdash;job search services through the Veterans Gold Card program and an online Veterans Job Bank to help veterans find jobs that meet their talents. And by the way, if there are any veterans here who need those services, you can find that at whitehouse.gov/vets. And then, later this month, the VA will hold a jobs fair in Detroit where 12,000 more opportunities will be available to veterans. <p>And that's also why I challenged business leaders to hire 100,000 post-9/11 veterans and their spouses by the end of next year. Because don't forget our military families; they're serving alongside our veterans. Michelle and Jill Biden&mdash;that's Michelle Obama and Jill Biden&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;just in case you were curious. [<i>Laughter</i>] You might not know which Michelle I was talking about. [<i>Laughter</i>] They're leading this effort with respect to military families, nationally&mdash;it's called Joining Forces&mdash;to mobilize all of us to support today's military families and their veterans. <p>And so far, the good news is participating businesses have hired more than 70,000 veterans. And they've pledged to hire 175,000 more in the coming years. And I want to thank Honeywell not only for being an active partner in this initiative, but right here, Honeywell has hired 900 veterans over the past year, and for employing 65 veterans just here at Golden Valley. So give them a big round of applause. Proud of them. Proud of them. <p>Standing up for our veterans, this is not a Democratic responsibility, it's not a Republican responsibility; it's an American responsibility. It's an obligation of every citizen who enjoys the freedom that these heroes defended. So we've got to meet our obligations today just like folks here at Honeywell are doing. <p>And as Commander in Chief, I want all of our servicemembers and veterans to know we are forever grateful for your service and your sacrifice. Just like you fought for us, we'll keep fighting for you&mdash;for more jobs, more security, for the opportunity to keep your families strong&mdash;because you'll help us keep America on top in the 21st century. We're going to keep fighting, just as you did, to show just why it is that the United State of America is the greatest nation on Earth. <p>God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"142" "\"Today I'm at one of Honeywell's manufacturing facilities in Golden Valley, Minnesota, where I just announced a step that will make it easier for companies to hire returning servicemembers who have the skills our country needs right now. It's another part of our effort to make sure that no American who fights for this country abroad has to fight for a job when they come home. That's why businesses like Honeywell are answering our challenge to hire 100,000 post-9/11 veterans and their spouses by the end of next year; that's why I've directed the Government to hire over 200,000 veterans so far&mdash;because our economy needs their tremendous talent and because millions of Americans are still looking for a job. <p>Right now, this country is still fighting our way back from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The economy is growing again, but it's not growing as fast as we'd like. Our businesses have created almost 4.3 million new jobs over the last 27 months, but as we learned in this week's jobs report, we're not creating them fast enough. And just like last year at this time, our economy faces some serious headwinds. Gas prices are starting to come down again, but when they spiked over the last few months, it hit people's wallets pretty hard. The crisis in Europe's economy is casting a shadow on our own. And all of this makes it even more challenging to fully recover and lay the foundation for an economy that's built to last. <p>But from the moment we first took action to prevent another depression, we knew the road to recovery wouldn't be easy. We knew it would take time, that there would be ups and downs along the way. But we also knew that if we were willing to act wisely and boldly and together, if we were willing to keep at it and never quit, we'd come back stronger. <p>Nothing has shaken my faith in that belief. We will come back stronger; we do have better days ahead; and it's because of you. I'd place my bet on American workers and American businesses any day of the week. You're the reason our auto industry has come roaring back. You're the reason manufacturing is hiring at its fastest pace since the 1990s. You work hard. You play by the rules. And what you deserve are leaders who will do the same, who will do whatever it takes to fight for the middle class and grow this economy faster. Because while we can't fully control everything that happens in other parts of the world, there are plenty of things we can control here at home. There are plenty of steps we can take right now to continue to create jobs and grow this economy. <p>I sent Congress a jobs bill last September full of the kinds of bipartisan ideas that would have put our fellow Americans back to work and helped reinforce our economy against those outside shocks. I sent them a plan that would have reduced the deficit by $4 trillion in a way that's balanced, that pays for the job-creating investments we need by cutting unnecessary spending and asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more in taxes. <p>Since then, Congress has only passed a few parts of that jobs bill, like a tax cut that's allowing working Americans to keep more of your paycheck every week. And that's important, but Congress hasn't acted on enough of the other ideas in that bill that would make a difference and help create jobs right now. There's no excuse for that. Not when so many people are still looking for work. Not when so many people are still struggling to pay the bills. <p>So my message to Congress is, let's get to work. <p>Right now, Congress should pass a bill to help States prevent more layoffs so we can put thousands of teachers and firefighters and police officers back on the job. Congress should have passed a bill a long time ago to put thousands of construction workers back on the job rebuilding our roads and our bridges and our runways. Instead of just talking a good game about job creators, Congress should give small-business owners a tax break for hiring more workers and paying them higher wages. Let's get all that done. <p>Right now, Congress should give every responsible homeowner the opportunity to save an average of $3,000 a year by refinancing their mortgage. Next week, there's a vote in Congress on a bill that would give working women the tools they need to demand equal pay for equal work. Ensuring paycheck fairness for women should be a no-brainer, and they need to pass that bill. <p>Right now, Congress also needs to extend tax credits for clean energy manufacturers that are set to expire at the end of the year so that we don't walk away from 40,000 good jobs that are being created. And it's long past time for Congress to end the tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and use that money to cover moving expenses for companies that are bringing jobs back to America. <p>It's not lost on anybody that this is an election year. But we've got responsibilities that are bigger than an election. We've got responsibilities to you. With so many people struggling to get by, now is not the time to play politics. Now is not the time for Congress to sit on its hands. The American people expect their leaders to work hard, no matter what year it is. That's what I intend to do. And I expect Democrats and Republicans to join me.\" "
"143" "\"Hey, guys, thanks for joining the call. As Valerie just said, and I know everybody has been talking about, tomorrow Congress is going to have a chance to vote on the \\"Paycheck Fairness Act.\\" I don't have to tell you how much this matters to families across the country. All of you are working day in, day out, to support the basic principle, equal pay for equal work. <p>And we've made progress. But we've got a lot more to do. Women still earn just 70 [77; White House correction] cents for every dollar a man earns. It's worse for African American women and Latinas. Over the course of her career, a woman with a college degree is going to earn hundreds of thousands of dollars less than a man who is doing the same work. <p>So at a time when we're in a make-or-break moment for the middle class, Congress has to step up and do its job. If Congress passes the \\"Paycheck Fairness Act,\\" women are going to have access to more tools to claim equal pay for equal work. If they don't, if Congress doesn't act, then women are still going to have difficulty enforcing and pressing for this basic principle. <p>And we've got to understand, this is more than just about fairness. Women are the breadwinners for a lot of families, and if they're making less than men do for the same work, families are going to have to get by for less money for childcare and tuition and rent, small businesses have fewer customers. Everybody suffers. <p>So that's why we moved forward with the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. That's why I established a National Equal Pay Task Force to help crack down on violations of equal pay laws. Earlier this year, the Department of Labor announced the winners of a national competition for equal pay apps that give women interactive tools and key information to help them determine if they're getting paid fairly. <p>So we're going to be releasing this afternoon a formal administration policy message supporting the \\"Paycheck Fairness Act,\\" and we're going to call on Congress to do the right thing. But let's face it. Congress is not going to act because I said it's important; they're going to act because you guys are making your voices heard. So Senators have to know you're holding them accountable. Everything that they're going to be hearing over the next 24 hours can make a difference in terms of how they vote. <p>We've got a long way to go, but we can make this happen, and together, we can keep moving forward. So let's make sure hard work pays off, responsibility is rewarded. <p>I appreciate everything you guys do. And I'm going to turn over the call to Cecilia Munoz, who is going to describe the \\"Paycheck Fairness Act\\" in more detail. All right? <p>Thanks, everybody. Bye-bye.\" "
"144" "\"Your Majesty, on the historic occasion of your diamond jubilee, Michelle and I send you and all the British people and members of the Commonwealth the heartfelt congratulations of the American people. In war and in peace, in times of plenty and in times of hardship, the United States and the United Kingdom have shared a special relationship. We've stood tall and strong, and together we've faced some of the greatest challenges this world has known. And while many presidents and prime ministers have come and gone, Your Majesty's reign has endured. As I said last year at Buckingham Palace, that makes Your Majesty both a living witness to the power of our alliance and a chief source of its resilience. As a steadfast ally, loyal friend, and tireless leader, Your Majesty has set an example of resolve that will be long celebrated. As we work together to build a better future for he next generation, it is gratifying to know that the bonds between our nations remain indispensable to our two countries, and to the world.<p>In honor of your 60 extraordinary years on the throne, communities across the Commonwealth have lit thousands of jubilee beacons. May the light of Your Majesty's crown continue to reign supreme for many years to come.\" "
"145" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you so much. If you've got a chair, go ahead and sit down. You can make yourself comfortable. [<i>Laughter</i>] If you don't, you're out of luck, just stay there. It is great to be back in Nevada. I want everybody to give Gorge a big round of applause for that introduction. I want to thank all the students for coming out here on a nice summer afternoon; some of you might be at Capriotti's or someplace, you know&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but instead you're here with us. <p><i>Audience member.</i> You look great! <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. Thank you, I'll tell Michelle you said so. <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love her too! <p><i>The President.</i> And I love you back. Thank you. So I'm here today at UNLV, home of the Runnin' Rebels, to talk about what a lot of you folks are thinking about every day. Now, keep in mind we're in Vegas. So in Vegas, you can bet on just about anything. [<i>Laughter</i>] But what the students here have bet on is themselves. They've bet on themselves. By earning your degree, you've decided to make the best possible investment in your future and in the future of America. And I'm proud of all of you for making that investment, because it's never been more important. <p>In today's economy, the single best predictor of success, by far, is a good education. And the statistics prove it. The unemployment rate for Americans with a college degree or more is about half the national average. Their incomes are twice as high as those with only a high school diploma. A higher education is the clearest path to the middle class. <p>And rebuilding the middle class is what we've been all about. I don't have to tell folks in Nevada that we're recovering from a crisis that cost millions of middle class jobs. When that housing bubble burst, it hit people really hard. <p>But we're also fighting back from a long-term trend that has cost working families all across the country that sense of security. So our job is not just to get people back to work; our job is to build an economy where hard work pays off. <p>So I want more people to be able to make the investment you're making. I want to make it easier for more students like you to earn a degree without shouldering a mountain of debt, because even though education&mdash;a college education is still a great investment, the burden of debt is serious, and it's hard on folks just as they're starting off in life. I don't want to be a country where a shrinking number of people are doing really, really well and then a growing number are barely able to get by. <p>I want everybody in America to get a fair shot. I want everybody to do their fair share. I want everyone to play by the same rules. That's the America I know. That's the America I believe in. That's the America we're trying to build for you, for my children, for future generations. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Thank you, President Obama! <p><i>The President.</i> You're welcome. Now look, the fact is&mdash;again, I don't have to tell folks in Nevada&mdash;we're still going through this process of recovery from that crisis. And we've taken some tough steps together. And the good news is, our economy is growing again, but we need it to grow faster. Businesses have created almost 4.3 million new jobs over the last 27 months. But to recover all the jobs that were lost in that recession, we've got to have them come back faster. <p>The truth is, the recovery has seen stronger job growth than what happened during the last recession a decade ago. But the problem is, the hole we have to fill is a lot deeper. The global aftershocks are much greater. We're already seeing it. Just like last year around this time, our economy has been facing some serious headwinds. You've got the lingering effects of the spring spike in gas prices. You remember that. It's still tough on a lot of folks' wallets. You've got the situation in Europe. <p>But from the moment we first took action when I came into office to make sure that we did not go into a freefall depression, we knew that all&mdash;recovering all the jobs that were lost during the recession was going to take some time. And we knew there would be ups and downs along the way. What we also knew though was if we acted wisely and we acted together, if we didn't quit, we'd come back stronger. We would do more than just get back to where we were; we would build an economy that would last for the long term. <p>And, Las Vegas, I still believe that. I believe we will come back stronger. We have better days ahead, and it's because of people like you. It's because of folks like you. I'm inspired when I hear folks like Gorge putting in long hours working and taking summer classes. Some older students who are retaining&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;there you go. I don't know, you don't look that old to me. [<i>Laughter</i>] But folks deciding to go back to school&mdash;retrain yourself for a new job, the jobs of the future. <p>So you're working hard. You're playing by the rules. You deserve to have leaders who are going to do the same, leaders who will take action, leaders who will do whatever it requires to fight for the middle class and grow the economy faster. We may not fully control everything that happens in other parts of the world, but there are plenty of things we can do right here in the United States to strengthen the economy further. There are plenty of steps we can take right now to help create jobs and grow this economy faster. <p>So let me just give you some examples. Last September, I sent to Congress a jobs bill full of the kinds of ideas that, historically, Republicans and Democrats have supported. If they had taken all the steps I was pushing for back in September, we could have put even more Americans back to work. We could have sliced through these headwinds more easily. <p>Now since then, in fairness, Congress has passed a few parts of that jobs bill. They passed a payroll tax cut that's put more money in every working person's paycheck right now. That's good news. We thank them for it. But they haven't acted fast enough on the other ideas that economists, independent economists&mdash;not me, but folks who study this stuff for a living&mdash;say could have put over a million more people to work. Now, there's no excuse for that. When so many people are still out there pounding the pavement and sending out resumes, so many families are doing whatever it takes to pay the bills, Congress can't just sit on their hands. <p>So my message to Congress is let's get to work. Let's get to work. I know this is an election year. That's not lost on me. [<i>Laughter</i>] But at this make-or-break moment for America's middle class, we can't afford to have Congress take 5 months off. You've got to keep working. You're not suddenly just sitting around not doing anything. You should expect the same thing from your representatives in Washington, right? <p>So there are a bunch of things that Congress can do right now. Let me tick a few off. At a time when our businesses have created more than 4 million new jobs, unfortunately, State and local governments have lost 450,000 jobs. That's been one of the biggest problems in our economy is all the layoffs happening at the State and local level: cops, teachers, firefighters all being laid off. <p>Now, those folks provide vital services. They protect us. They're teaching our kids. Congress should pass a bill like I've asked them to do to help States like Nevada put Americans&mdash;those Americans who are doing outstanding service on behalf of our communities&mdash;put those folks back on the job right now. That's something we can do. <p>Number two, we know that the housing bubble burst. Here in Nevada, the construction industry got killed, right? So I told Congress months ago, let's pass a bill to put hundreds of thousands of construction workers and contractors back to work rebuilding America&mdash;rebuilding roads and bridges and new schools for rising populations and that's good for the economy now; it's good for the economy later. There's no excuse for Congress to just shrug its shoulders. Let's get it done. <p>The housing bubble that burst and helped cause this whole mess is still a major drag on the economy. Right now, Congress should pass the changes necessary to give every responsible homeowner the opportunity to save an average of $3,000 a year by refinancing their mortgage at today's historically low interest rates. <p>I mean, think about it. If you're a homeowner and you live here in this State, your house very well may be underwater and so it's hard for you to refinance. We did, through an Executive order, a plan that allows those of you whose mortgages are guaranteed by FHA to refinance, but we've got to have Congress to take additional steps to reach everybody, to reach even more homeowners. <p>These are folks who are paying their mortgage every month, but can't refinance because your home is underwater. And let me tell you, I was up in Reno last month, met a family. They had refinanced through the program that we set up, and they're getting an extra $250,000 a month. And that makes a difference. How many people here could use an extra $250 a month? And that's good for everybody; that's good for everybody's economy, because if you've got that extra money in your pocket, you might help&mdash;that might help rebuild some equity in your home or you might go spend it on textbooks or a new computer, and the entire economy gets stronger. So let's give every responsible family that chance. <p>Instead of&mdash;all right, here's another thing. Instead of just talking about job creators, Congress should put their money where their mouth is. Give small-business owners a tax break for hiring more workers and for paying higher wages. <p>And then, with all the veterans that are coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan, let's make some special efforts there. We should create what we're calling a veterans job corps, because no one who fights for this country should ever have to fight for a job when they come home. <p>Right now, Congress needs to extend the tax credits for clean energy manufacturers. Those tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year. Nearly 40,000 good jobs are at stake, making solar panels and wind turbines and lowering our dependence on foreign oil. So instead of giving tax breaks&mdash;billions of tax breaks to oil companies that are making a whole lot of money and don't need help&mdash;let's double down on a clean energy industry that's rarely been more promising. And you're seeing it right here in Nevada. There's a lot of sunshine out here. [<i>Laughter</i>] We can turn that into electricity and put people back to work in the process. Let's make that happen. <p>And while we're at it, it's past time for Congress to stop giving tax breaks that ship jobs overseas. Give tax breaks to companies that are bringing jobs back to the United States of America, that are investing right here. <p>All right, so these are all things we're pushing Congress to do before they go on vacation. [<i>Laughter</i>] But the number one thing Congress should do for you, UNLV, right now, is to stop interest rates on student loans from doubling at the end of the month. <p>The clock is running out. You know, in today's economy, higher education can't be a luxury. It's an economic necessity. Everybody should be able to afford it. But over the last 20 years, the cost of college has more than doubled. It's gone up faster than everything else, even faster than health care costs. We're at a point where the average student who borrows to pay for college graduates with $26,000 in student loan debt. And let's face it, some folks graduate with more than that&mdash;$50 [thousand; White House correction], $75 [thousand; White House correction],even $100 [thousand; White House correction]. Together, Americans owe more on their student loans than they do on their credit cards. <p>And all that debt, that means folks making really tough choices. It may mean waiting longer to buy a house or starting a family or taking that job that you really want, because it doesn't pay enough. And by the way, Michelle and I know something about this. We did not come from wealthy families. We graduated from college and law school, and we had a whole lot of debt. And when we got married, we got poorer together. [<i>Laughter</i>] We sort of added our liabilities together. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Of course&mdash;look, we were lucky enough to land good jobs. But even with those great jobs that we had, we only finished paying off our student loans about 8 years ago. Now, think about that. I'm the President of the United States&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;it was only about 8 years ago that I finished paying off my student loans. So I know what a lot of you are going through. I've been there. I have done that. When the girls were first born and we were starting to save up for their college education, we were still paying for our own college educations. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And we can do better than that. I don't want that future for young people. So that's why my administration has already taken a bunch of steps. We fixed a broken student loan system that was giving tens of billions of dollars to big banks and said, let's give that money directly to students&mdash;use that money to afford college. That's why we strengthened aid, like Pell grants for low-income students. That's why we set up a new consumer watchdog agency called the consumer finance protection bureau, and it's now working with the Department of Education to give students and their parents access to a simple fact sheet on student loans and financial aid, because everybody has got to be well informed. We call it \\"Know Before You Owe\\"&mdash;\\"Know Before You Owe.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Don't be surprised&mdash;2 weeks from graduation you look up, and whap! You just got hit upside the head. Know before you owe. <p>On Tuesday, college presidents from across the country came together. They agreed to provide clear information about costs, financial aid, and loan repayments to all incoming students starting next year. So that's good news, all right? <p>But we've got more to do. So today I've directed my Education Secretary and my Treasury Secretary to make it easier for millions of students with Federal loans to afford their loan payments. And that includes some of you. This is a program that more people need to know about. And we're going to start doing more advertising about this because this is really important. For those of you who are still in school, you're about to graduate, as long as you make your monthly payments on time&mdash;all right, so pay your bills on time&mdash;we will cap the payments you have to make on your student loans at 10 percent of your discretionary income once you graduate&mdash;10 percent. And this is a big deal, because no matter what career you choose&mdash;if you decide you're going to be a teacher or you're going to be a social worker or you're going to go into public service or the nonprofit sector&mdash;you'll still be able to stay current on your loans. <p>So these are all the things we've already done. But understand, this isn't going to make much of a difference if the costs&mdash;underlying costs of college keep going up faster than everything else. So everybody has got to do their part. Colleges and universities, they need to do their part. I've told Congress, let's steer Federal aid to schools that are doing a good job keeping tuition affordable and provide good value and serve their students well. If you're getting Federal student loans&mdash;colleges and universities&mdash;you shouldn't just be loading up a whole bunch of debt on your students. You've got to figure out how are you working to make sure that they can afford their education. <p>States have a role to play. I see some of my buddies from the State legislature here. Right now, the amount of money that State and local governments invest in their college students is at a 25-year low; spending a lot of money on prisons, spending a lot of money on other stuff, but we're not spending enough to make sure that tuition stays affordable. That's one of the reasons that tuition has gone up so fast. <p>If States can find smart new ways to keep costs down and make it easier for more students to graduate, then we're going to help them do it. So everybody has got to do their part&mdash;colleges, universities, the States, my administration, and yes, Congress. Congress has got to do their part. <p>I warned over a month ago&mdash;I even went on Jimmy Fallon to say this&mdash;if Congress doesn't act by the end of this month, by July 1, interest rates on Federal student loans will double overnight. That means the average student with those loans&mdash;including 8,000 students right here at UNLV&mdash;will rack up an additional $1,000 in debt. That's like a $1,000 tax hike for more than 7 million students. How many people can afford to pay an extra $1,000 if you're a student just because Congress can't get its act together? That makes no sense. This is a no-brainer. <p>So I just said to Congress, get this done. Get it done. Get it done. This is not complicated. Last month, Democrats in the Senate put forward a plan that would have kept these low rates in place, wouldn't have added a dime to the deficit. The Senate Republicans got together; they blocked it. They said, no. House Republicans voted to keep your rates down only if we agreed to cut things like preventive health care for women. So that's not a smart thing to do. <p>There are folks on the other side who are coming up with all sorts of reasons why we should just go ahead and let these rates double. One of them compared these student loans to a \\"stage three cancer of socialism.\\" I don't know what that means exactly. [<i>Laughter</i>] The idea&mdash;my grandfather went to school on the G.I. bill. There's a long tradition of us helping people get a good education, because they know&mdash;we know that it makes everybody richer. It makes our entire country more competitive and stronger. <p>Some of these folks in Congress, they were saying we're just talking about student loans to distract from the economy. I guess they don't get this is the economy. Helping you get the skills that businesses are looking for, that's one of the best things we can do for the economy. Making college affordable, that's one of the best things we can do for the economy. Putting opportunity within the reach of everybody, no matter what you look like or where you come from, that's what America is about. But these guys say that students like you should pay more, so we can bring down the deficit they say. <p>Now keep in mind, they ran up this deficit for over a decade. Now they want to cut loans to students while giving tax breaks to oil companies and folks like me who don't need tax breaks. They voted to let millionaires and billionaires keep paying lower taxes than middle class workers. They voted to give an average tax cut of at least $150,000 to every millionaire in America, but they want you to pay an extra $1,000 a year for college. It doesn't make any sense. It's wrong. It's wrong. <p>Look, here in America, we admire success. That's why a lot of you are going to school. We work and study for it. And if folks aren't willing to help themselves, we can't help them. But America is about more than just protecting folks who have already done well. It's about giving everybody a chance to do well. It's about hard work and responsibility being rewarded. It's about everybody having the chance to get ahead and then reach back and help somebody behind you so that everybody has a chance. That's what makes us strong. That's what makes us strong. <p>So if you agree with me, I need your help. Some of these folks in Congress are a little stubborn. So I need your help. You've got to tell Congress, don't double my rate. Call them up, e-mail them, post on their Facebook wall, tweet them. [<i>Laughter</i>] We've got a hashtag: \\"dontdoublemyrate.\\" Don't double my rate. <p>Never forget that your voice matters. I know sometimes it seems like Washington isn't listening. And frankly, Congress sometimes isn't. But we're talking about issues that have a real impact on your lives, real impact on your futures. Making education more affordable, that's real. Making homes more affordable, making it a little easier for you to make your mortgage payments, that's real. Building an economy that works for everybody, that's real. <p>So I need you all to stand up. I need you to be heard. Tell Congress now is not the time to double the interest rates on your student loans. Now is the time to double down on the middle class. Now is the time to build an America that lasts. Now is the time to work together, to put people back to work and strengthen our housing market and help our veterans. Let's get this done. <p>Let's remind the world why the United States of America is the greatest nation on earth. Thank you, Las Vegas. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"146" "\"Hello, everybody! Everybody, please have a seat. Welcome to the White House, and congratulations to the Super Bowl champion New York Giants. <p>We've got some Members of Congress and members of my administration who are here today and rabid Giants fans. I want to also recognize the Maras and the Tisches, as well as, of course, head coach Tom Coughlin and general manager Jerry Reese. They have built this team into one of the NFL's most outstanding franchises. So we are very proud of them. <p>Now, I know for some of you, this is just, welcome back. [<i>Laughter</i>] You guys have been through this drill before. The last time the Giants were here was in 2008. A lot of folks thought that team didn't have a chance to win a Super Bowl. They ended up winning with a circus catch in the fourth quarter, MVP performance by Eli Manning, a come-from-behind win over the Patriots. So this is all starting to sound kind of like deja vu all over again. <p>But every season's different, and last year's Giants were obviously a special bunch, not just because of where they ended up, but because of how they got there. Every team has to deal with injuries to the players. Not many teams have to deal with a late hit on the head coach. [<i>Laughter</i>] You saw that Jets game. <p>Now, Coach Coughlin reminds everybody, he did not go down. That's a tough guy, and you can see that toughness reflected in everybody else on this team. The Giants took a whole bunch of hits this season, but they never went down. From day one, they followed a simple motto&mdash;finish. Finish the play. Finish the game. Finish the season. <p>And after week 15, sitting at 7 and 7, they knew that every game was a playoff game. But the players, the coaches, the staff, the owners; they didn't quit. They believed in each other. And they kept winning, all the way to Indianapolis. <p>The night before the Super Bowl, they watched a highlight reel set to Justin Tuck's good-luck song, \\"In the Air Tonight.\\" I don't know about a little Phil Collins before a big game. [<i>Laughter</i>] I may try that before a big meeting with Congress. <p>But apparently it worked. Next night, Eli Manning led the way, earned his second Super Bowl MVP. So I would just advise the sportswriters out there, the next time Eli says he thinks he's a elite quarterback, you might just want to be quiet. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Eli wasn't alone, of course. Justin Tuck got to the QB, Victor Cruz scored and salsaed, Mario Manningham kept his feet in bounds for the biggest catch of his life. Nobody was perfect, but everybody did their job. And when the Patriots' Hail Mary hit the ground, the Giants were Super Bowl champions. Of course, the fans back home went crazy. <p>Now, people from New York and New Jersey don't fall for just anybody. It's a tough crowd, let's face it. You've got to earn their respect. They're never completely satisfied, and you've got to earn it both on and off the field. And that's exactly what the Giants did. From fighting childhood obesity&mdash;Michelle likes that&mdash;to wrapping up leftover food for homeless shelters to working with the Make-A-Wish Foundation to bring kids to practices and games, Big Blue supports the folks who support them. <p>They've certainly earned the respect of folks like Ray Odierno's here, who is obviously one of our greatest warriors and one of our greatest soldiers, because this team is always there for men and women in uniform. This is a New York Giants tradition that goes back to World War II. Back in World War II, Wellington Mara served in the United States Navy, so this is a long tradition here. <p>And these guys have made it clear that no matter who you root for on Sundays, if you're a veteran, the New York Giants are on your team. Whether it's setting up tickets to games or inviting folks to practices, the Giants never forget the men and women who risk everything to protect our freedom. And I especially want to thank and congratulate Coach Coughlin on receiving the Army's Outstanding Civilian Service Award. That's a great honor. <p>By the way, we've got some wounded warriors here today. Let's give them all a big round of applause. Having these folks here today, seeing how much the Giants means to them is a reminder of how important sports and football can be, but it's also a reminder that there are some things that are more important than football, and the Giants know that. They finished strong, they won six straight games with everything on the line, they made a difference in the lives of those around them. But most importantly, they did it not just on Sunday, but every week. <p>So again, I want to congratulate the New York Giants. Good luck this season. It looks like we've got somebody singing for you. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's how happy everybody is. <p>Give the New York Giants a big round of applause.\" "
"147" "\"This week I spent some time talking with college students about how we can make higher education more affordable. And one of the things I told them was how proud I was that they were making that investment in themselves, because in today's economy, the best predictor of success is a good education. <p>That's not just true for our individual success; it's also true for America's success. New jobs and new businesses will take root wherever they can find the most highly educated, highly skilled workers. And I want those workers to be American workers. I want those good paying, middle class jobs to take root right here. <p>So it should concern everybody that, right now, all across America, tens of thousands of teachers are getting laid off. In Pennsylvania alone, there are 9,000 fewer educators in our schools today than just a year ago. In Ohio, the number is close to 7,000. And nationwide, over the past 3 years, school districts have lost over 250,000 educators. Think about what that means for our country. When there are fewer teachers in our schools, class sizes start climbing up, our students start falling behind, and our economy takes a hit. <p>The point is: Teachers matter. One study found that a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over $250,000. A great teacher can change the course of a child's life. So the last thing our country needs is to have fewer teachers in our schools. <p>Now, I know States are still going through some tough times. I realize that every Governor is dealing with limited resources and many face stark choices when it comes to their budgets. <p>But that doesn't mean we should just stand by and do nothing. When States struggle, it's up to Congress to step in and help out. In 2009 and in 2010, we provided aid to States to keep hundreds of thousands of teachers in the classroom. But we need to do more. That's why a critical part of the jobs bill that I sent to Congress back in September was to help States prevent even more layoffs and rehire even more teachers who had lost their jobs. Of course, months later, we're still waiting on Congress to act. <p>When it comes to this recovery, we can't fully control everything that happens in other parts of the world. But there are plenty of things we can control. There are plenty of steps we can take right now to strengthen our economy. Putting teachers back in our kids' classrooms is one of those steps. There's no excuse for inaction. You work hard. Your leaders should too, especially at this make-or-break moment for the middle class. <p>I know this is an election year. But some things are bigger than an election. Some things are bigger than politics. So I hope you'll join me in telling Congress to do the right thing to get to work and to help our teachers back in the classroom. We can't afford to wait any longer. <p>Thanks and have a great weekend.\" "
"148" "\"Hello, everybody! Thank you. Thank you so much. Everybody, have a seat. Have a seat. Well, this is so exciting to have a chance to see all of you. Congratulations on your graduation. I know I kind of messed up graduation a little bit, but it turned out that it was beautiful yesterday. So we had this all planned out. [<i>Laughter</i>] We knew there was going to be sun yesterday; it's a little cloudier today. We wanted to make sure you guys looked good in your caps and gowns and didn't get too wet. <p>Listen, I just want to say to all of you how incredibly proud I am of the work that you guys have accomplished, because some of you may have heard&mdash;in between studying, you may have listened to a speech that I've given or remarks that I've made in the past&mdash;the nation that excels in science and math and technology, that's going to be the nation that rises to the top in the 21st century. Almost everything we do is based on our capacity to innovate. And America became a economic superpower because we were constantly able to tap into the incredible talents and ingenuity of young people like you who decided, why can't we fly? Why can't we cure diseases? Why can't we make sure that the energy that we use is able to make life a little bit better and a little bit easier for people? <p>And so throughout our history, we've constantly had innovators who have been able to not only excel in basic science and basic research, but have then been able to translate it into practical things that we now take for granted. And obviously, there was a pretty good scientist here in Philadelphia named Benjamin Franklin, who was able to tool around with kites and keys and all kinds of stuff before he helped to write our Constitution. So you've got a pretty good legacy, here in Philadelphia, of innovation. <p>And the fact that, as I look around this auditorium, we are tapping into the talents of everybody&mdash;women as well as men, folks from every ethnic group, every background&mdash;that's also this incredible strength for the United States, because innovation, brainpower does not discriminate by gender or race or faith or background. Everybody has got the capacity to create and improve our lives in so many ways. <p>So you guys are representative of the future. This is a great postcard for what America is all about. And as you take your next steps&mdash;I'm assuming that everybody here is going to some sort of post-high school education, everybody here is going to be going to college, and some of you are going to continue beyond college&mdash;I just want you to know that you are going to be succeeding not just for yourself&mdash;and that's important&mdash;your parents are going to want you to have a job, so they're very pleased about the fact that you're taking a path that is almost assured to provide you with extraordinary opportunities in the future, but you're also going to be making a difference for the country as a whole. <p>So my expectation is, is that somebody in this auditorium is going to figure out new sources of energy that help not only make us more energy independent, but also deals with problems like climate change. There is somebody in this room who's going to help make sure that we are defeating diseases like Alzheimer's or cancer. There is somebody in this room who is going to help revolutionize our agricultural sector or our transportation sectors or will invent some entire new industry that we don't even know about yet. <p>And the pace of change these days is so rapid&mdash;I'm reminded when I talk to Malia and Sasha that when Sasha was born, most people weren't on the Internet, and now she knows more about it than I do And so in many ways your youth, and the fact that you've come of age in this new information age, gives you an enormous advantage over old fogies like us. <p>So the bottom line is, we're proud of you. You are going to succeed. You're well on your way. The last thing I'd ask of you, even as you focus on your chosen field and you are moving forward, is to make sure that you also give back, that for a lot of you in your neighborhoods there may not be as many kids who are interested in math and science. And you need to make sure that wherever you have the opportunity, you're mentoring and serving as a good role model to the next generation coming up behind you. <p>For the women who are here, a lot of you know that historically we haven't had as many women in math and science and engineering fields. So as you succeed, hopefully, you're going to go back and mentor some people and encourage them to get involved in these fields as well. If you do that then I have extraordinary optimism for the future. And I think that not only will you succeed, but you're going to help your country succeed as well. <p>So thank you very much, everybody. Appreciate you. Thank you.\" "
"149" "\"Good evening, everybody. Please have a seat. On behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the White House on this beautiful summer evening. <p>The United States is fortunate to have many allies and partners around the world. Of course, one of our strongest allies, and one of our closest friends, is the State of Israel. And no individual has done so much over so many years to build our alliance and to bring our two nations closer as the leader that we honor tonight, our friend Shimon Peres. <p>Among many special guests this evening we are especially grateful for the presence of Shimon's children&mdash;Zvia, Yoni, and Chemi&mdash;and their families. Please rise so we can give you a big round of applause. <p>We have here someone representing a family that has given so much for peace, a voice for peace that carries on with the legacy of her father Yitzhak Rabin, and that's Dalia. We are grateful to have you here. Leaders who've helped ensure that the United States is a partner for peace&mdash;and in particular, I'm so pleased to see Secretary Madeleine Albright, who is here this evening; and one of the great moral voices of our time and an inspiration to us all, Professor Elie Wiesel. <p>The man, the life that we honor tonight is nothing short of extraordinary. Shimon took on his first assignment in Ben-Gurion's Haganah, during the struggle for Israeli independence in 1947, when he was still in his early twenties. He ran for President of Israel, and won, when he was 83. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>By the way, I should mention that I just learned that his son-in-law is also his doctor. And I asked for all his tips. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Shimon has been serving his nation, and strengthening the bonds between our two nations, for some 65 years, the entire life of the State of Israel. Ben-Gurion and Meir, Begin and Rabin, these giants of Israel's founding generation now belong to the ages. But tonight we have the rare privilege in history, and that's to be in the presence of a true founding father. <p>Shimon, you have never stopped serving. And in 2 months we'll join our Israeli friends in marking another milestone, your 89th birthday. <p>Now, I think Shimon would be the first to tell you that in the ups and downs of Israeli politics, he has been counted out more than once. But in him we see the essence of Israel itself, an indomitable spirit that will not be denied. He's persevered, serving in virtually every position: in dozens of cabinets, some two dozen ministerial posts, defense minister, finance minister, foreign minister three times&mdash;try that, Madeleine&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and now, the ninth President of Israel. And I think President Clinton would agree with me on this: Shimon Peres is the ultimate \\"comeback kid.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And he's still going&mdash;on Facebook, on YouTube&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;connecting with young people, looking to new technologies, always facing tomorrow. Recently, he was asked, \\"What do you want your legacy to be?\\" And Shimon replied, \\"Well, it's too early for me to think about it.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Shimon, you earned your place in history long ago. And I know your work is far from done. But tonight is another example of how it's never too early for the rest of us to celebrate your legendary life. <p>Shimon teaches us to never settle for the world as it is. We have a vision for the world as it ought to be, and we have to strive for it. Perhaps Shimon's spirit comes from what he calls the Jewish \\"dissatisfaction gene.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"A good Jew,\\" he says, \\"can never be satisfied.\\" There is a constant impulse to question, to do even better. So too with nations, we must keep challenging ourselves, keep striving for our ideals, for the future that we know is possible. <p>Shimon knows the necessity of strength. As Ben-Gurion said, \\"An Israel capable of defending herself, which cannot be destroyed, can bring peace nearer.\\" And so he's worked with every American President since John F. Kennedy. That's why I've worked with Prime Minister Netanyahu to ensure that the security cooperation between the United States and Israel is closer and stronger than it has ever been, because the security of the State of Israel is non-negotiable, and the bonds between us are unbreakable. <p>Of course, Shimon also knows that a nation's security depends not just on the strength of its arms, but upon the righteousness of its deeds, its moral compass. He knows, as Scripture teaches, that we must not only seek peace, but we must pursue peace. And so it has been the cause of his life: peace, security, and dignity for Israelis and Palestinians and all Israel's Arab neighbors. And even in the darkest moments, he's never lost hope in, as he puts it, \\"a Middle East that is not a killing field, but a field of creativity and growth.\\" <p>At times, some have seen his hope and called Shimon Peres a dreamer. And they are right. Just look at his life. The dream of generations, after 2,000 years, to return to Israel, the historic homeland of the Jewish people, Shimon lived it. The dream of independence, a Jewish State of Israel, he helped win it. The dream of an Israel strong enough to defend itself, by itself, against any threat, backed by an ironclad alliance with the United States of America, he helped build it. <p>The dream of making the desert bloom, he and his wife Sonya were part of the generation that achieved it. The dream of the high-tech Israel we see today, he helped spark it. That historic handshake on the White House lawn, he helped to create it. That awful night in Tel Aviv, when he and Yitzhak sang a song for peace, and the grief that followed, he guided his people through it. The dream of democracy in the Middle East and the hopes of a new generation, including so many young Arabs, he knows we must welcome it and nurture it. <p>So yes, Shimon Peres&mdash;born in a <i>shtetl</i> in what was then Poland, who rose to become President of Israel&mdash;he is a dreamer. And rightly so. For he knows what we must never forget: With faith in ourselves and courage in our hearts, no dream is too big, no vision is beyond our reach. <p>And so it falls on each of us&mdash;to all of us&mdash;to keep searching, to keep striving for that future that we know is possible, for the peace our children deserve. <p>And so it is a high honor for me to bestow this statesman, this warrior for peace, America's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And I'd ask you to please join me in welcoming President Peres to the presentation. <p>[<i>At this point, Lt. Cmdr. John F. McCarthy, USCG, Coast Guard Aide to the President, read the citation, and the President presented the medal.</i>] <p>Before inviting remarks from President Peres, I'd like to conclude by inviting you all to join me in a toast, with the words that Shimon spoke when he accepted the Peace Prize in Oslo: <p>\\"From my earliest youth, I have known that while one is obliged to plan with care the stages of one's journey, one is entitled to dream, and keep dreaming, of its destination. A man may feel as old as his years, yet as young as his dreams.\\" <p>Shimon, to all our friends here tonight and to our fellow citizens across America and Israel, may we never lose sight of our destination. Shalom, and may we always be as young as our dreams. <p><i>L'chaim</i>. Cheers. <p>I have one last order of business to attend to. Before I ask our recipient to come to the stage&mdash;while I began my remarks, I was not yet sure whether one more&mdash;or two more guests of honor had arrived. I think it would be entirely appropriate at this point for us also to acknowledge two people who have constantly sought to achieve peace, not only in the Middle East, but all around the world&mdash;one of them happens to be traveling a lot these days on my behalf&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and I am extraordinarily grateful to them. Shimon, I know that you're pleased to have two very dear friends to help celebrate this evening: President Bill Clinton and our outstanding Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. <p>Ladies and gentlemen, President Shimon Peres.\" "
"150" "\"[<i>The President's remarks were joined in progress.</i>] <p>&mdash;&mdash;these guys are also young fathers, and they're doing a great job. He's got four kids. He's got two. And Michelle and I have been working a lot with military families, trying to support them. When these guys are deployed, sometimes they're leaving the family behind, and we want to make sure they get support. <p>And then the reason the two older gentlemen are here is, as I was mentioning, barbershops are where a lot of men still come, and we want to work with them&mdash;we want to work with barbershops to figure out how we can get better information to fathers about resources that are available to them, where they can find job training programs, they can find support groups for fathers. Because the more information we're getting out there to folks about how they can take responsibility for their kids, make sure that they're in their child's lives, help support their mother even if they're not living with the mother&mdash;it makes a huge difference. <p>It turns out that with the father being involved, the kids are less likely to do drugs, they're less likely to&mdash;girls are less likely to have teen pregnancy. And so that message is something that we want to make sure gets out there. And barbershops are a good place to do it, so&mdash;because that's where everybody has to come, right? <p>So the&mdash;although I was teasing these guys, cutting their hair wouldn't be that complicated. [<i>Laughter</i>] You just take a&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. Isn't that right? I was just saying you got to give these guys a discount if they come in for a haircut, because that will only take 5 minutes. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So&mdash;all right, guys, thank you.

"151" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you! Thank you, everybody. Good afternoon, everybody. It is great to be back in Cleveland. It is great to be back here at Cuyahoga Community College. <p>I want to, first of all, thank Angela for her introduction and sharing her story.

Four more years! <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. <p>So, Ohio, over the next 5 months, this election will take many twists and many turns. Polls will go up, and polls will go down. There will be no shortage of gaffes and controversies that keep both campaigns busy and give the press something to write about. You may have heard, I recently made my own unique contribution to that process. It wasn't the first time; it won't be the last. <p>And in the coming weeks, Governor Romney and I will spend time debating our records and our experience, as we should. But though we will have many differences over the course of this campaign, there's one place where I stand in complete agreement with my opponent: This election is about our economic future. <p>Yes, foreign policy matters. Social issues matter. But more than anything else, this election presents a choice between two fundamentally different visions of how to create strong, sustained growth, how to pay down our long-term debt, and most of all, how to generate good, middle class jobs so people can have confidence that if they work hard, they can get ahead. <p>Now, this isn't some abstract debate. This is not another trivial Washington argument. I have said that this is the defining issue of our time, and I mean it. I said that this is a make-or-break moment for America's middle class, and I believe it. The decisions we make in the next few years on everything from debt and taxes to energy and education will have an enormous impact on this country and on the country we pass on to our children. <p>Now, these challenges are not new. We've been wrestling with these issues for a long time. The problems we're facing right now have been more than a decade in the making. And what is holding us back is not a lack of big ideas. It isn't a matter of finding the right technical solution. Both parties have laid out their policies on the table for all to see. What's holding us back is a stalemate in Washington between two fundamentally different views of which direction America should take. <p>And this election is your chance to break that stalemate. <p>At stake is not simply a choice between two candidates or two political parties, but between two paths for our country. And while there are many things to discuss in this campaign, nothing is more important than an honest debate about where these two paths would lead us. <p>Now, that debate starts with an understanding of where we are and how we got here. <p>Long before the economic crisis of 2008, the basic bargain at the heart of this country had begun to erode. For more than a decade, it had become harder to find a job that paid the bills, harder to save, harder to retire, harder to keep up with rising costs of gas and health care and college tuitions. You know that; you lived it. <p>During that decade, there was a specific theory in Washington about how to meet this challenge. We were told that huge tax cuts, especially for the wealthiest Americans, would lead to faster job growth. We were told that fewer regulations, especially for big financial institutions and corporations, would bring about widespread prosperity. We were told that it was okay to put two wars on the Nation's credit card, that tax cuts would create enough growth to pay for themselves. That's what we were told. So how did this economic theory work out? <p>For the wealthiest Americans, it worked out pretty well. Over the last few decades, the income of the top 1 percent grew by more than 275 percent to an average of $1.3 million a year. Big financial institutions, corporations saw their profits soar. But prosperity never trickled down to the middle class. <p>From 2001 to 2008, we had the slowest job growth in half a century. The typical family saw their incomes fall. The failure to pay for the tax cuts and the wars took us from record surpluses under President Bill Clinton to record deficits. And it left us unprepared to deal with the retirement of an aging population that's placing a greater strain on programs like Medicare and Social Security. <p>Without strong enough regulations, families were enticed, and sometimes tricked, into buying homes they couldn't afford. Banks and investors were allowed to package and sell risky mortgages. Huge, reckless bets were made with other people's money on the line. And too many from Wall Street to Washington simply looked the other way. <p>For a while, credit cards and home equity loans papered over the reality of this new economy, people borrowed money to keep up. But the growth that took place during this time period turned out to be a house of cards. And in the fall of 2008, it all came tumbling down with a financial crisis that plunged the world into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. <p>Here in America, families' wealth declined at a rate nearly seven times faster than when the market crashed in 1929. Millions of homes were foreclosed. Our deficit soared. And 9 million of our citizens lost their jobs: 9 million hard-working Americans who had met their responsibilities, but were forced to pay for the irresponsibility of others. <p>In other words, this was not your normal recession. Throughout history, it has typically taken countries up to 10 years to recover from financial crises of this magnitude. Today, the economies of many European countries still aren't growing, and their unemployment rate averages around 11 percent. <p>But here in the United States, Americans showed their grit and showed their determination. We acted fast. Our economy started growing again 6 months after I took office, and it has continued to grow for the last 3 years. <p>Our businesses have gone back to basics and created over 4 million jobs in the last 27 months&mdash;more private sector jobs than were created during the entire 7 years before this crisis&mdash;in a little over 2 years. <p>Manufacturers have started investing in America again&mdash;including right here in Ohio. And across America, we've seen them create almost 500,000 jobs in the last 27 months, the strongest period of manufacturing job growth since 1995. <p>And when my opponents and others were arguing that we should let Detroit go bankrupt, we made a bet on American workers and the ingenuity of American companies. And today, our auto industry is back on top of the world. <p>But let's be clear: Not only are we digging out of a hole that is 9 million jobs deep, we're digging out from an entire decade where 6 million manufacturing jobs left our shores; where costs rose, but incomes and wages didn't; and where the middle class fell further and further behind. <p>So recovering from the crisis of 2008 has always been the first and most urgent order of business, but it's not enough. Our economy won't be truly healthy until we reverse that much longer and profound erosion of middle class jobs and middle class incomes. <p>So the debate in this election is not about whether we need to grow faster or whether we need to create more jobs or whether we need to pay down our debt. Of course, the economy isn't where it needs to be. Of course, we have a lot more work to do. Everybody knows that. The debate in this election is about how we grow faster and how we create more jobs and how we pay down our debt. That's the question facing the American voter. And in this election, you have two very different visions to choose from. <p>Governor Romney and his allies in Congress believe deeply in the theory that we tried during the last decade: the theory that the best way to grow the economy is from the top down. So they maintain that if we eliminate most regulations, if we cut taxes by trillions of dollars, if we strip down Government to national security and a few other basic functions, then the power of businesses to create jobs and prosperity will be unleashed, and that will automatically benefit us all. <p>That's what they believe. This is their economic plan. It has been placed before Congress. Governor Romney has given speeches about it, and it's on his web site. So if they win the election, their agenda will be simple and straightforward. They have spelled it out: They promise to roll back regulations on banks and polluters, on insurance companies and oil companies. They'll roll back regulations designed to protect consumers and workers. They promise to not only keep all of the Bush tax cuts in place, but add another $5 trillion in tax cuts on top of that. <p>Now, an independent study says that about 70 percent of this new, five-trillion-dollar tax cut would go to folks making over $200,000 a year. And folks making over a million dollars a year would get an average tax cut of about 25 percent. <p>Now, this is not my opinion. This is not political spin. This is precisely what they have proposed. <p>Now, your next question may be, how do you spend $5 trillion on a tax cut and still bring down the deficit? Well, they tell us they'll start by cutting nearly a trillion dollars from the part of our budget that includes everything from education and job training to medical research and clean energy. <p>Now, I want to be very fair here. I want to be clear. They haven't specified exactly where the knife would fall. But here's some of what would happen if that cut that they've proposed was spread evenly across the budget: 10 million college students would lose an average of $1,000 each in financial aid; 200,000 children would lose the chance to get an early education in the Head Start program. There would be 1,600 fewer medical research grants for things like Alzheimer's and cancer and AIDS, 4,000 fewer scientific research grants, eliminating support for 48,000 researchers, students and teachers. <p>Now, again, they have not specified which of these cuts they choose from. But if they want to make smaller cuts to areas like science or medical research, then they'd have to cut things like financial aid or education even further. But either way, the cuts to this part of the budget would be deeper than anything we've ever seen in modern times. <p>Not only does their plan eliminate health insurance for 33 million Americans by repealing the Affordable Care Act, according to the independent Kaiser Family Foundation, it would also take away coverage from another 19 million Americans who rely on Medicaid, including millions of nursing home patients and families who have children with autism and other disabilities. And they proposed turning Medicare into a voucher program, which will shift more costs to seniors and eventually end the program as we know it. <p>But it doesn't stop there. Even if you make all the cuts that they've proposed, the math still doesn't allow you to pay for a new, five-trillion-dollar tax cut and bring down the deficit at the same time. So Mr. Romney and his allies have told us we can get the rest of the way there by reforming the Tax Code and taking away certain tax breaks and deductions that, again, they haven't specified. They haven't named them, but they said we can do it. <p>But here's the problem: The only tax breaks and deductions that get you anywhere close to $5 trillion are those that help middle class families afford health care and college and retirement and homeownership. Without those tax benefits, tens of millions of middle class families will end up paying higher taxes. Many of you would end up paying higher taxes to pay for this other tax cut. <p>And keep in mind that all of this is just to pay for their new five-trillion-dollar tax cut. If you want to close the deficit left by the Bush tax cuts, we'd have to make deeper cuts or raise middle class taxes even more. <p>This is not spin. This is not my opinion. These are facts. This is what they're presenting as their plan. This is their vision. There is nothing new, just what Bill Clinton has called the same ideas they've tried before, except on steroids. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, I understand I've got a lot of supporters here, but I want to speak to everybody who's watching who may not be a supporter, may be undecided, or thinking about voting the other way. If you agree with the approach I just described, if you want to give the policies of the last decade another try, then you should vote for Mr. Romney. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> Now, like I said, I know I've got supporters here. No, no, you should vote for his allies in Congress. <p><i>Audience members.</i> No! <p><i>The President.</i> You should take them at their word, and they will take America down this path. And Mr. Romney is qualified to deliver on that plan. [<i>Laughter</i>] No, he is. I'm giving you an honest presentation of what he's proposing. <p>Now, I'm looking forward to the press following up and making sure that you know I'm not exaggerating. <p>I believe their approach is wrong. And I'm not alone. I have not seen a single independent analysis that says my opponent's economic plan would actually reduce the deficit. Not one. Even analysts who may agree with parts of his economic theory don't believe that his plan would create more jobs in the short term. They don't claim his plan would help folks looking for work right now. <p>In fact, just the other week, one economist from Moody's said the following about Mr. Romney's plan&mdash;and I'm quoting here&mdash;\\"On net, all of these policies would do more harm in the short term. If we implemented all of his policies, it would push us deeper into recession and make the recovery slower.\\" <p>That's not my spin. That's not my opinion. That's what independent economic analysis says. <p>As for the long term, remember that the economic vision of Mr. Romney and his allies in Congress was tested just a few years ago. We tried this. Their policies did not grow the economy. They did not grow the middle class. They did not reduce our debt. Why would we think that they would work better this time? <p>We can't afford to jeopardize our future by repeating the mistakes of the past, not now, not when there's so much at stake. <p>I've got a different vision for America. I believe that you can't bring down the debt without a strong and growing economy. And I believe you can't have a strong and growing economy without a strong and growing middle class. <p>This has to be our north star: an economy that's built not from the top down, but from a growing middle class, that provides ladders of opportunity for folks who aren't yet in the middle class. <p>You see, we'll never be able to compete with some countries when it comes to paying workers lower wages or letting companies do more polluting. That's a race to the bottom that we should not want to win. Because those countries don't have a strong middle class; they don't have our standard of living. <p>The race I want us to win&mdash;the race I know we can win&mdash;is a race to the top. I see an America with the best educated, best trained workers in the world, an America with a commitment to research and development that is second to none, especially when it comes to new sources of energy and high-tech manufacturing. I see a country that offers businesses the fastest, most reliable transportation and communication systems of anywhere on Earth. <p>I see a future where we pay down our deficit in a way that is balanced, not by placing the entire burden on the middle class and the poor, but by cutting out programs we can't afford and asking the wealthiest Americans to contribute their fair share. <p>That's my vision for America: education, energy, innovation, infrastructure, and a Tax Code focused on American job creation and balanced deficit reduction. <p>This is the vision behind the jobs plan I sent Congress back in September, a bill filled with bipartisan ideas that, according to independent economists, would create up to 1 million additional jobs if passed today. <p>This is the vision behind the deficit plan I sent to Congress back in September, a detailed proposal that would reduce our deficit by $4 trillion through shared sacrifice and shared responsibility. <p>This is the vision I intend to pursue in my second term as President&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;because I believe&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience members. </i>Four more years! Four more years! <p><i>The President. </i>Because I believe if we do these things, if we do these things, more companies will start here and stay here and hire here and more Americans will be able to find jobs that support a middle class lifestyle. <p>Understand, despite what you hear from my opponent, this has never been a vision about how Government creates jobs or has the answers to all our problems. Over the last 3 years, I've cut taxes for the typical working family by $3,600. I've cut taxes for small businesses 18 times. I have approved fewer regulations in the first 3 years of my Presidency than my Republican predecessor did in his. And I'm implementing over 500 reforms to fix regulations that were costing folks too much for no reason. <p>I've asked Congress for the authority to reorganize the Federal Government that was built for the last century. I want to make it work for the 21st century, a Federal Government that is leaner and more efficient and more responsive to the American people. <p>I've signed a law that cuts spending and reduces our deficit by $2 trillion. My own deficit plan would strengthen Medicare and Medicaid for the long haul by slowing the growth of health care costs, not shifting them to seniors and vulnerable families. And my plan would reduce our yearly domestic spending to its lowest level as a share of the economy in nearly 60 years. <p>So no, I don't believe the Government is the answer to all our problems. I don't believe every regulation is smart or that every tax dollar is spent wisely. I don't believe that we should be in the business of helping people who refuse to help themselves. But I do share the belief of our first Republican President, from my home State&mdash;Abraham Lincoln&mdash;that through government, we should do together what we cannot do as well for ourselves. <p>That's how we built this country, together. We constructed railroads and highways, the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge. We did those things together. We sent my grandfather's generation to college on the GI bill, together. We instituted a minimum wage and rules that protected people's bank deposits, together. <p>Together, we touched the surface of the Moon, unlocked the mystery of the atom, connected the world through our own science and imagination. <p>We haven't done these things as Democrats or Republicans. We've done them as Americans. <p>As much as we might associate the GI bill with Franklin Roosevelt or Medicare with Lyndon Johnson, it was a Republican&mdash;Lincoln&mdash;who launched the transcontinental railroad, the National Academy of Sciences, land-grant colleges. It was a Republican&mdash;Eisenhower&mdash;who launched the Interstate Highway System and a new era of scientific research. It was Nixon who created the Environmental Protection Agency, Reagan who worked with Democrats to save Social Security, and who, by the way, raised taxes to help pay down an exploding deficit. <p>Yes, there have been fierce arguments throughout our history between both parties about the exact size and role of Government, some honest disagreements. But in the decades after World War II, there was a general consensus that the market couldn't solve all of our problems on its own; that we needed certain investments to give hard-working Americans skills they needed to get a good job and entrepreneurs the platforms they needed to create good jobs; that we needed consumer protections that made American products safe and American markets sound. <p>In the last century, this consensus, this shared vision, led to the strongest economic growth and the largest middle class that the world has ever known. It led to a shared prosperity. <p>It is this vision that has guided all my economic policies during my first term as President, whether in the design of a health care law that relies on private insurance or an approach to Wall Street reform that encourages financial innovation, but guards against reckless risk-taking. It's this vision that Democrats and Republicans used to share that Mr. Romney and the current Republican Congress have rejected in favor of a \\"no holds barred,\\" \\"government is the enemy,\\" \\"market is everything\\" approach. <p>And it is this shared vision that I intend to carry forward in this century as President, because it is a vision that has worked for the American middle class and everybody who's striving to get into the middle class.<B> <p></B>Let me be more specific. Think about it. In an age where we know good jobs depend on high skills, now is not the time to scale back our commitment to education. Now is the time to move forward and make sure we have the best educated, best trained workers in the world. <p>My plan for education doesn't just rely on more money or more dictates from Washington. We're challenging every State and school district to come up with their own innovative plans to raise student achievement. And they're doing just that. I want to give schools more flexibility so that they don't have to teach to the test and so they can remove teachers who just aren't helping our kids learn. <p>But look, if we want our country to be a magnet for middle class jobs in the 21st century, we also have to invest more in education and training. I want to recruit an army of new teachers and pay teachers better and train more of them in areas like math and science. <p>I have a plan to give 2 million more Americans the chance to go to community colleges just like this one and learn the skills that businesses are looking for right now. I have a plan to make it easier for people to afford a higher education that's essential in today's economy. <p>And if we truly want to make this country a destination for talent and ingenuity from all over the world, we won't deport hard-working, responsible young immigrants who have grown up here or received advanced degrees here. We'll let them earn the chance to become American citizens so they can grow our economy and start new businesses right here instead of someplace else. <p>Now is not the time to go back to a greater reliance on fossil fuels from foreign countries. Now is the time to invest more in the clean energy that we can make right here in America. <p>My plan for energy doesn't ignore the vast resources we already have in this country. We're producing more oil than we have in over a decade. But if we truly want to gain control of our energy future, we've got to recognize that pumping more oil isn't enough. <p>We have to encourage the unprecedented boom in American natural gas. We have to provide safe nuclear energy and the technology to help coal burn cleaner than before. We have to become the global leader in renewable energy: wind and solar, and the next generation of biofuels, in electric cars and energy-efficient buildings. <p>So my plan would end the Government subsidies to oil companies that have rarely been more profitable. Let's double down on a clean energy industry that has never been more promising. And I want to put in place a new clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation, an approach that would make clean energy the profitable kind of energy for every business in America. <p>With growing competition from countries like China and India, now is not the time for America to walk away from research and development. Now is the time to invest even more so that the great innovations of this century take place in the United States of America. So that the next Thomas Edison, the next Wright Brothers is happening here, in Ohio or Michigan or California. <p>My plan to encourage innovation isn't about throwing money at just any project or new idea. It's about supporting the work of our most promising scientists, our most promising researchers and entrepreneurs. <p>My plan would make the R&D tax credit permanent. But the private sector can't do it alone, especially when it comes to basic research. It's not always profitable in the short term. And in the last century, research that we funded together through our tax dollars helped lay the foundation for the Internet and GPS and Google and the countless companies and jobs that followed. The private sector came in and created these incredible companies, but we, together, made the initial investment to make it possible. <p>It's given rise to miraculous cures that have reduced suffering and saved lives. This has always been America's biggest economic advantage: our science and our innovation. Why would we reverse that commitment right now when it's never been more important? <p>At a time when we have so much deferred maintenance on our Nation's infrastructure&mdash;schools that are crumbling, roads that are broken, bridges that are buckling&mdash;now is not the time to saddle American businesses with crumbling roads and bridges. Now is the time to rebuild America. <p>So my plan would take half the money we're no longer spending on war, let's use it to do some nation-building here at home. Let's put some folks to work right here at home. <p>My plan would get rid of pet projects and Government boondoggles and bridges to nowhere. But if we want businesses to come here and to hire here, we have to provide the highways and the runways and the ports and the broadband access, all of which move goods and products and information across the globe. <p>My plan sets up an independent fund to attract private dollars and issue loans for new construction projects based on two criteria: how badly are they needed and how much good will they do for the economy. <p>And finally, I think it's time we took on our fiscal problems in an honest, balanced, responsible way. Everybody agrees that our deficits and debt are an issue that we've got to tackle. My plan to reform the Tax Code recognizes that Government can't bring back every job that's been outsourced or every factory that's closed its doors. But we sure can stop giving tax breaks to businesses that ship jobs overseas and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in the United States of America: in Ohio, in Cleveland, in Pennsylvania. <p>And if we want to get the deficit under control&mdash;really, not just pretending to during election time&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;not just saying you really care about it when somebody else is in charge, and then you don't care where you're in charge. If you want to really do something about it, if you really want to get the deficit under control without sacrificing all the investments that I've talked about, our Tax Code has to ask the wealthiest Americans to pay a little bit more, just like they did when Bill Clinton was President, just like they did when our economy created 23 million new jobs, the biggest budget surplus in history, and a lot of millionaires to boot. <p>And here's the good news: There are plenty of patriotic, very successful Americans who'd be willing to make this contribution again. <p>Look, we have no choice about whether we pay down our deficit. But we do have a choice about how we pay down our deficit. We do have a choice about what we can do without, and where our priorities lie. <p>I don't believe that giving someone like me a $250,000 tax cut is more valuable to our future than hiring transformative teachers or providing financial aid to the children of a middle class family. <p>I don't believe that tax cut is more likely to create jobs than providing loans to new entrepreneurs or tax credits to small-business owners who hire veterans. I don't believe it's more likely to spur economic growth than investments in clean energy technology and medical research, or in new roads and bridges and runways. <p>I don't believe that giving someone like Mr. Romney another huge tax cut is worth ending the guarantee of basic security we've always provided the elderly, and the sick, and those who are actively looking for work. <p>Those things don't make our economy weak. What makes our economy weak is when fewer and fewer people can afford to buy the goods and services our businesses sell. Businesses don't have customers if folks are having such a hard time. <p>What drags us all down is an economy in which there's an ever-widening gap between a few folks who are doing extraordinarily well and a growing number of people who, no matter how hard they work, can barely make ends meet. <p>So Governor Romney disagrees with my vision. His allies in Congress disagree with my vision. Neither of them will endorse any policy that asks the wealthiest Americans to pay even a nickel more in taxes. It's the reason we haven't reached a grand bargain to bring down our deficit, not with my plan, not with the Bowles-Simpson plan, not with the so-called Gang of Six plan. <p>Despite the fact that taxes are lower than they've been in decades, they won't work with us on any plan that would increase taxes on our wealthiest Americans. It's the reason a jobs bill that would put 1 million people back to work has been voted down time and time again. It's the biggest source of gridlock in Washington today. <p>And the only thing that can break the stalemate is you. You see, in our democracy, this remarkable system of government, you, the people, have the final say. <p>This November is your chance to render a verdict on the debate over how to grow the economy, how to create good jobs, how to pay down our deficit. Your vote will finally determine the path that we take as a nation, not just tomorrow, but for years to come. <p>When you strip everything else away, that's really what this election is about. That's what is at stake right now. Everything else is just noise. Everything else is just a distraction. <p>From now until then, both sides will spend tons of money on TV commercials. The other side will spend over a billion dollars on ads that tell you the economy is bad; that it's all my fault; that I can't fix it because I think government is always the answer; or because I didn't make a lot of money in the private sector and don't understand it; or because I'm in over my head; or because I think everything and everybody is doing just fine. That's what the scary voice in the ads will say. That's what Mr. Romney will say. That's what the Republicans in Congress will say. <p>Well, that may be their plan to win the election, but it's not a plan to create jobs. It's not a plan to grow the economy. It's not a plan to pay down the debt. And it's sure not a plan to revive the middle class and secure our future. <p>I think you deserve better than that. <p>At a moment this big&mdash;a moment when so many people are still struggling&mdash;I think you deserve a real debate about the economic plans we're proposing. <p>Governor Romney and the Republicans who run Congress believe that if you simply take away regulations and cut taxes by trillions of dollars, the market will solve all of our problems on its own. If you agree with that, you should vote for them. And I promise you they will take us in that direction. <p>I believe we need a plan for better education and training and for energy independence and for new research and innovation, for rebuilding our infrastructure, for a Tax Code that creates jobs in America and pays down our debt in a way that's balanced. I have that plan. They don't. <p>And if you agree with me&mdash;if you believe this economy grows best when everybody gets a fair shot, and everybody does their fair share, and everybody plays by the same set of rules&mdash;then I ask you to stand with me for a second term as President. <p>In fact, I'll take it a step further. I ask, you vote for anyone else&mdash;whether they're Democrats, Independents, or Republicans&mdash;who share your view about how America should grow. <p>I will work with anyone of any party who believes that we're in this together, who believes that we rise or fall as one nation and as one people. Because I'm convinced that there are actually a lot of Republicans out there who may not agree with every one of my policies, but who still believe in a balanced, responsible approach to economic growth and who remember the lessons of our history and who don't like the direction their leaders are taking them. <p>And let me leave you with one last thought. As you consider your choice in November, don't let anybody tell you that the challenges we face right now are beyond our ability to solve. <p>It's hard not to get cynical when times are tough. And I'm reminded every day of just how tough things are for too many Americans. Every day I hear from folks who are out of work or have lost their home. Across this country, I meet people who are struggling to pay their bills or older workers worried about retirement or young people who are underemployed and burdened with debt. I hear their voices when I wake up in the morning, and those voices ring in my head when I lay down to sleep. And in those voices, I hear the echo of my own family's struggles as I was growing up, and Michelle's family's struggles when she was growing up, and the fears and the dashed hopes that our parents and grandparents had to confront. <p>But you know what, in those voices I also hear a stubborn hope and a fierce pride and a determination to overcome whatever challenges we face. And in you, the American people, I'm reminded of all the things that tilt the future in our favor. <p>We remain the wealthiest nation on Earth. We have the best workers and entrepreneurs, the best scientists and researchers, the best colleges and universities. We are a young country with the greatest diversity of talent and ingenuity drawn from every corner of the globe. So yes, reforming our schools, rebuilding our infrastructure will take time. Yes, paying down our debt will require some tough choices and shared sacrifice. But it can be done. And we'll be stronger for it. <p>And what's lacking is not the capacity to meet our challenges. What is lacking is our politics. And that's something entirely within your power to solve. So this November, you can remind the world how a strong economy is built, not from the top down, but from a growing, thriving middle class. <p>This November, you can remind the world how it is that we've traveled this far as a country, not by telling everybody to fend for themselves, but by coming together as one American family, all of us pitching in, all of us pulling our own weight. <p>This November, you can provide a mandate for the change we need right now. You can move this nation forward. And you can remind the world once again why the United States of America is still the greatest nation on Earth. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you.\" "
"152" "\"Well, welcome to the White House, everybody. We are glad all of you could join us today. I want to thank the Members of Congress and the members of my administration who are here, including our friends, who are doing outstanding work every day: John Berry, Nancy Sutley, Fred Hochberg. <p>Now, each June since I took office, we've gathered to pay tribute to the generations of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans who devoted their lives to our most basic ideals: equality not just for some, but for all. Together, we've marked major milestones like the 40th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, when a group of brave citizens held their ground against brutal discrimination. Together, we've honored courageous pioneers who, decades ago, came out and spoke out, who challenged unjust laws and destructive prejudices. Together, we've stood resolute, unwavering in our commitment to advance this movement and to build a more perfect Union. <p>Now, I've said before that I would never counsel patience, that it wasn't right to tell you to be patient any more than it was right for others to tell women to be patient a century ago or African Americans to be patient a half century ago. After decades of inaction and indifference, you have every reason and right to push, loudly and forcefully, for equality. [<i>Applause</i>] But 3 years ago, I also promised you this: I said that even if it took more time than we would like, we would see progress, we would see success, we would see real and lasting change. And together, that's what we're witnessing. <p>For every person who lost a loved one at the hand of hate, we ended a decade of delay and finally made the Matthew Shepard Act the land of the law. For every person with HIV who was treated like an outcast, we lifted the HIV entry ban. And because of that important step, next month, for the first time in more than two decades, the International AIDS Conference will be held right here in the United States. <p>For every American diagnosed with HIV who couldn't get access to treatment, we put forward a National HIV/AIDS Strategy because who you are should never affect whether you get life-extending care. Marjorie Hill, the head of the Gay Men's Health Crisis, is here. GMHC has saved so many lives, and this year they are celebrating their 30th anniversary. So I want to give them and all these organizations who work to prevent and treat HIV a big round of applause. Give it up for Marjorie and everybody else. [<i>Applause</i>] <p>For every partner or spouse denied the chance to comfort a loved one in the hospital, to be by their side at their greatest hour of need, we said, enough. Hospitals that accept Medicare or Medicaid, and that is most of them, now have to treat LGBT patients just like any other patient. For every American denied insurance just for being lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender, we passed health insurance reform, which will ban that kind of discrimination. <p>We've expanded benefits for same-sex partners of Federal employees, prohibited discrimination on the basis of gender identity for workers in the Federal Government. We've supported efforts in Congress to end the so-called Defense of Marriage Act. And as we wait for that law to be cast aside, we've stopped defending its constitutionality in the courts. [<i>Applause</i>] <p>We've put forward a strategy to promote and protect the rights of LGBT communities all over the world, because, as Secretary Clinton said back in December, gay rights are human rights. <p>And of course, last year we finally put an end to \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" so that nobody&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;would ever have to ever again hide who they love in order to serve the country they love. And I know we've got some military members who are here today. I'm happy to see you with your partners here. We thank you for your service. We thank your families for their service, and we share your joy at being able to come with your spouses or partners here to the White House with your Commander in Chief. <p>Now, we know we've got more to do. Americans may feel more comfortable bringing their partners to the office barbecue, but we're still waiting for a fully inclusive employment nondiscrimination act. Congress needs to pass that legislation so that no American is ever fired simply for being gay or transgender. <p>Americans may be able to serve openly in the military, but many are still growing up alone and afraid, picked on, pushed around for being different. And that's why my administration has worked to raise awareness about bullying. And I know&mdash;I just had a chance to see Lee Hirsch, the director of \\"Bully,\\" who is here. And we thank him for his work on this issue. <p>I want to acknowledge all the young leaders here today who are making such a big difference in their classrooms and in their communities. And Americans may be still evolving when it comes to marriage equality, but&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;as I've indicated personally, Michelle and I have made up our minds on this issue. And we believe same sex&mdash;[<i>inaudible</i>]&mdash;should be treated equally. [<i>Applause</i>] <p>So we still have a long way to go, but we will get there. We'll get there because of all of you. We'll get there because of all of the ordinary Americans who, every day, show extraordinary courage. We'll get there because of every man and woman and activist and ally who is moving us forward by the force of their moral arguments, but more importantly, by the force of their example. <p>And as long as I have the privilege of being your President, I promise you: You won't just have a friend in the White House, you will have a fellow advocate for an America where&mdash;no matter what you look like or where you come from or who you love&mdash;you can dream big dreams and dream as openly as you want. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"153" "\"Over the last few weeks, I've been talking a lot about America's economic future. I've told you how I believe we should go about creating strong, sustained growth; how we should pay down our long-term debt in a balanced way; and most of all, what we should do right now to create good, middle class jobs so people who work hard can get ahead. <p>This isn't some abstract debate or trivial Washington argument. I've said that this is the defining issue of our time, and I mean it. I've said that this is a make-or-break moment for the middle class, and I believe it. The decisions we make over the next few years will have an enormous impact on the country we live in, and the one we pass on to our children. <p>Right now we're still fighting our way back from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The economy is growing again, but it's not growing fast enough. Our businesses have created 4.3 million new jobs over the last 27 months, but we're not creating them fast enough. And we're facing some pretty serious headwinds, the effects of the recent spike in gas prices to the financial crisis in Europe. <p>But here's the thing: We have the answers to these problems. We have plenty of big ideas and technical solutions from both sides of the aisle. That's not what's holding us back. What's holding us back is a stalemate in Washington. <p>Last September, I sent Congress a jobs bill full of the kinds of bipartisan ideas that could have put over a million Americans back to work and helped bolster our economy against outside shocks. I sent them a plan that would have reduced our deficit by $4 trillion in a balanced way that pays for the investments we need by cutting unnecessary spending and by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little bit more in taxes. <p>Since then, Congress has passed a few parts of that jobs bill, like a tax cut that's allowing working Americans to keep more of your paycheck every week. But on most of the ideas that would create jobs and grow our economy, Republicans in Congress have not lifted a finger. They'd rather wait until after the election in November. Just this past week, one of them said, \\"Why not wait for the reinforcements?\\" That's a quote, and you can bet plenty of his colleagues are thinking the same thing. <p>I think that's wrong. This isn't about who wins or loses in Washington. This is about your jobs and your paychecks and your children's future. There is no excuse for Congress to stand by and do nothing while so many families are struggling, no reason whatsoever. <p>And right now Congress should pass a bill to help States put thousands of teachers and firefighters and police officers back on the job. They should have passed a bill a long time ago to put thousands of construction workers back to work rebuilding our roads and bridges and runways. And instead of just talking about job creators, they should give small-business owners a tax break for hiring more workers and paying them higher wages. <p>Right now Congress should give every responsible homeowner the opportunity to save an average of $3,000 a year by refinancing their mortgage. They should extend tax credits for clean energy manufacturers so we don't walk away from 40,000 good jobs. And instead of giving tax breaks to companies who ship jobs overseas, Congress should take that money and use it to cover moving expenses for companies that are bringing jobs back to America. There is no reason to wait. <p>So you see, every problem we face is within our power to solve. What's lacking is our politics. I need you to remind your Members of Congress why you sent them to Washington in the first place. Tell them to stop worrying about the next election and start worrying about the next generation. I'm ready to work with anyone&mdash;Republican, Democrat, or Independent&mdash;who is serious about moving this country forward. And I hope Members of Congress will join me. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"154" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Everybody have a seat. Well, it is good to see all of you. <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you guys back. [<i>Laughter</i>] I have to say, the&mdash;I don't know about the choice of music coming in here, though. [<i>Laughter</i>] I love my Marine Band, but this is kind of a young demographic for the piano cocktail hour. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So some of the most fun I've had as President is when I get a chance to talk with you&mdash;college students&mdash;about the importance of earning a higher education in today's economy. And I'll admit that the East Room isn't as rowdy as Carmichael Arena at UNC or&mdash;we got any UNC folks here in the house? There we go. Coors Center at CU Boulder&mdash;any&mdash;no? Okay. [<i>Laughter</i>] I have to say that most of you are much more dressed up than usually when I see you in your own natural habitats. <p>But our message today is serious. Right now the unemployment rate for Americans with a college degree or more is about half the national average. They earn twice as much as those who don't have a high school diploma. So whether it's at a 4-year college, or a community college, or a technical program, some form of higher education, something beyond high school has never been more important. It's the surest path to finding a good job, earning a good salary, making it into the middle class. <p>And at the same time, over the last 2 decades, the cost of college has doubled&mdash;it's actually more than doubled. And that means&mdash;and I don't have to tell you, because you're probably tallying it up right now&mdash;the cost for you to take out loans has increased, and you are more likely to rack up more debt. The average student who borrows to pay for college now graduates with about $26,000 of debt from their student loans. Americans as a whole now owe more on student loans than they do on their credit cards. And that is wrong, because we cannot afford to price the middle class and folks who aspire to go into the middle class, we can't price them out of the college education market. We can't stand by when millions of young people are already saddled with debt just as you're starting off. <p>Your parents, your grandparents, oftentimes they were in a position where when they got that first job, the first thing they're thinking about is, how do I save to buy a home and start a family. And if you're already dealing with a big bunch of debt before you even get started, that's a problem. And it's mind-boggling that we've had this stalemate in Washington that threatens to make the situation even worse. <p>So the reason you're all here, the reason all these fine-looking young people behind me are here is that in just over a week the interest rates on Federal student loans are scheduled to double. I've been talking about this now for what&mdash;a month and a half, 2 months, 3 months, 5 months&mdash;I've lost track. We've been talking about it for a long time. If Congress does not get this done in a week, the average student with Federal student loans will rack up an additional $1,000 in debt over the coming year. If Congress fails to act, more than 7 million students will suddenly be hit with the equivalent of a $1,000 tax hike. And that's not something that you can afford right now. <p>Now, as I said, if this warning sounds familiar, we've been talking about this for months. Congress has had the time to fix this for months. It's part of the reason why everybody here looks impatient. This issue didn't come out of nowhere; it's been looming for months. But we've been stuck watching Congress play chicken with another deadline. So we're 9 days away from thousands of American workers having to walk off their job because Congress hasn't passed a transportation bill. We're 10 days away from nearly 7.5 million students seeing their loan rates double because Congress hasn't acted. This should be a no-brainer. It should not be difficult. It should've gotten done weeks ago. <p>Now, the good news is there are folks in Congress trying to do the right thing. Last month, Democrats in the Senate put forward a plan that would have kept these rates in place without adding a dime to the deficit. Unfortunately, Senate Republicans got together and blocked it. Over in the House, the Republicans said they'd keep these rates down only if we agreed to cut things like preventiveWomen's health issues health care for women, which obviously wouldn't fix the problem, but would create a new problem. <p>This is&mdash;even as they were voting in lockstep for an economic plan that would cut financial aid for nine million college students by an average of $1,000 and give a $150,000 tax cut to wealthy Americans. So I recognize that there's been some effort to change the subject from this rate hike. <p>One Congressman warned that this is all about giving college students \\"free college education\\"&mdash;which doesn't make much sense, because the definition of a loan is it's not free&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;you have to pay it back. Others have said we're just talking about student loans to distract from the economy. That doesn't make much sense because this is the economy. <p>This is all about the economy. This is all about whether or not we are going to have the best-trained, best educated workforce in the world. That improves our economy. And higher education cannot be a luxury reserved just for a privileged few. It's an economic necessity for every family, and every family should be able to afford it. <p>So you guys, during this period when you've been in college have been some of the toughest economic times since the 1930s, and there are still a lot of challenges ahead globally. And we can't control every economic headwind that we face, but this is something we can control. This is something we can do something about. Stopping student rates from doubling at the end of the month is something we can do right now to make a difference in the lives of all the American people. <p>There's still 10 days for Congress to do the right thing. I understand that members of both parties say they want to get this done, and there are conversations taking place, but they haven't done it yet. And we've got to keep the pressure on. <p>That's where all of you come in. Over the past few months, there are so many students and parents who have been working hard to shine a light on this issue. You've rallied on campuses, in your communities. You've called, you've e-mailed, you've tweeted your representatives in Washington. So you've played your part in making sure your voice is heard and your democracy is responsive. <p>My main message is, as you guys embark on this day of action, I want to make sure you keep this going. Don't stop until it's actually done. There is nothing more powerful than millions of voices that are calling for change, and all of your voices can make a difference. So keep telling Congress to do what's right, to get this done. Tell them now is not the time to double interest rates on your student loans. Tell them to double down on an investment in a strong and secure middle class, and that means your education. Tell them now is the time to double down on an America where everybody who works hard has a fair shot at success. <p>And for those who are not here and are watching, if you tweet, use the hashtag \\"dontdoublemyrate\\"&mdash;[l<i>aughter</i>]&mdash;don't double my rate. But I tell you, when I look out at this group right here, you give me confidence in America. You make me optimistic, not only because you're getting a great education, but also because all of you are participating and making sure that this democracy works the way it's supposed to. We need outstanding engineers, and we need outstanding nonprofit leaders, and we need outstanding entrepreneurs, but we also need outstanding citizens. And that's what you guys are displaying by your presence and your activities. <p>So keep it up. Let's get this done. Thanks, everybody.\" "
"155" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. <i>Gracias!</i> Thank you so much. Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat. Ah, it is good to be back at NALEO. <i>Que placer estar aqui con tantos amigos.</i> It is wonderful to see a lot of good friends from all across the country. It is nice to be at Disney World. This is now the second time I've come to Disney World without my daughters. They are not happy with me. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to thank Secretary Solis for the introduction and for her hard work. She is one of the best Labor Secretaries we have ever had, and she is thinking about you each and every day. I want to thank Sylvia and Arturo for their outstanding leadership. Arturo, happy early birthday. I will not sing&mdash;don't worry. [<i>Laughter</i>] Welcome to the other side of the hill. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And it is especially good to have Ambassador Mari Carmen Aponte here with us. We are very proud of her. When the Senate refused to confirm Mari, I sent her to El Salvador anyway&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;because I knew she was going to do an outstanding job. And she has. And I'm glad to see the Senate finally confirmed her last week. So she's now official. <p>Last but not least, I want to thank all of you. It's always nice to get out of Washington. It's nice to get a little Florida sunshine. But it's especially nice to see folks who have devoted themselves to serving their communities and their country, who've dedicated themselves to making people's lives just a little bit better each and every day, at every level: school board, State legislatures, county boards. You guys are where the rubber hits the road. And I've had a chance to see many of you in your local communities and hear the stories of all your efforts and all your hopes and all your dreams and also some of your frustrations and the hardships that are taking place. <p>Yesterday, your featured speaker came here and said that the election in November isn't about two people. It's not about being a Republican or a Democrat or an Independent. It is about the future of America. And while we've got a lot of differences, he and I, on this point I could not agree more. This is about America's future. The defining issue of our time is whether we carry forward the promise that has drawn generations of immigrants to our shores from every corner of the globe, sometimes at great risk, men and women drawn by the promise that no matter who you are, no matter what you look like, no matter where you come from, no matter what your last name, this is a place where you can make it if you try. This is a place where you can make it if you try. <p>And whether our ancestors arrived on the <i>Mayflower</i> or were brought here on slave ships, whether they signed in at Ellis Island or they crossed the Rio Grande, their diversity has not only enriched this country, it helped build the greatest economic engine the world has ever known. <p>Hungry people, striving people, dreamers, risk-takers. People don't come here looking for handouts. We are a nation of strivers and climbers and entrepreneurs, the hardest working people on Earth. And nobody personifies these American values, these American traits, more than the Latino community. That's the essence of who you are. <p>All we ask for is that hard work pays off, that responsibility is rewarded, so that if these men and women put in enough effort, they can find a good job, own their own home, send their kids to college, let their kids dream even bigger, put away a little bit for retirement, not go bankrupt when you get sick. <p>And I ran for this office because for more than a decade, that dream had been slipping away from too many Americans. Before I even took office, the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes pushed it even further from reach, particularly for a lot of Latino communities, which had already faced higher unemployment and higher poverty rates. <p>So the question is not whether we need to do better. Of course the economy isn't where it needs to be. Of course there's still too many who struggle. We've got so much more work to do. But the question is: How do we make the economy grow faster? How do we create more jobs? How do we create more opportunity? The question is: What vision are we going to stand up for? Who are we going to fight for? <p>That's what we have to decide right now. That's what this election's about. Who are we fighting for? What vision of America do we believe in? <p>If America is about anything, it's about passing on even greater opportunity to our children. It's about education. And that's why I expanded Pell grants, which will give an additional 150,000 children in the Latino community a chance to go to college. That's why I've invested in our community colleges, which are a gateway to a good job for so many Hispanic Americans&mdash;Americans of every stripe. <p>That's why schools in almost every State, some in the toughest neighborhoods around, have answered our challenge to raise their standards for teaching and learning&mdash;not by teaching to a test, but by expanding creativity and improving curriculums and focusing more on kids who are hardest to reach so that we give every child a fighting chance. That's part of the vision of America that we believe in. <p>In this country, we believe that if you want to take a risk on a new idea, you should have the chance to succeed. And you shouldn't have to have wealthy parents in order to be successful. Latino-owned businesses have been the fastest growing small businesses, and we've cut their taxes 18 times. We've expanded new loans and new credit so they can grow and they can hire. That's the vision we believe in. <p>In America, we believe you shouldn't go broke because you get sick. Hardworking people out there&mdash;sometimes two jobs, three jobs&mdash;still don't have health insurance. If you did have health insurance, insurance companies were able to discriminate against certain patients. That was wrong. It was wrong to let insurance companies just jack up premiums for no reason and to have millions of working Americans uninsured, with the Latino community having the highest rate of uninsured of any community in the country. <p>So after a century of trying, we finally passed reform that will make health care affordable and available for every American. That was the right thing to do. That was the right thing to do. That was the right thing to do. <p>Now, we're not done yet. We've got more to do. We need to put more good teachers in our classrooms. We need to get colleges and universities to bring down the cost of tuition to make it more affordable for more young people. <p>We need to invest in new research and innovation, especially new sources of energy and high-tech manufacturing. We need to put people back to work rebuilding our roads and our highways and our runways. Construction jobs can have a huge ripple effect in communities all across the country. And nobody knows it better than State and local officials. You know the difference it makes. And with the housing bubble bursting, we've got tens of thousands of construction workers just ready and eager to get to work. <p>We need to give families in hard-hit housing markets like Florida and Nevada the chance to refinance and save $3,000 a year on their mortgage. That's good for those families. It's good for the housing market. It's good for the surrounding community. There's no reason why Congress hasn't already done it. <p>Instead of just talking a big game about \\"job creators,\\" we should give small-business owners a tax break for hiring more workers or for paying higher wages. Instead of rewarding companies that ship jobs overseas, we should take that money and use it to cover moving expenses for companies who are bringing jobs back to America. <p>On almost every issue of concern to your community, to every community, what's holding us back isn't a lack of big ideas. It's not a lack of technical solutions. By now, just about every policy and proposal has been laid out on the table. What's holding us back is a stalemate, a stalemate in Washington between two fundamentally different views of which direction we should go. <p>The Republicans who run Congress, the man at the top of their ticket, they don't agree with any of the proposals I just talked about. They believe the best way to grow the economy is from the top down. So they want to roll back regulations and give insurance companies and credit card companies and mortgage lenders even more power to do as they please. They want to spend $5 trillion on new tax cuts, including a 25-percent tax cut for every millionaire in the country. And they want to pay for it by raising middle class taxes and gutting middle class priorities like education and training and health care and medical research. <p>And that's it. That's it. That's their economic plan. When they tell you they can do better, that's their idea of doing better. When they tell you they know how to fix the economy, that's exactly how they plan to do it. And I think they're wrong. I think they're wrong. <p>In this country, prosperity has never come from the top down. It comes from a strong and growing middle class and creating ladders of opportunity for all those who are striving to get into the middle class. It comes from successful, thriving small businesses that over time grow into medium-size and then large businesses. <p>We don't need more top-down economics. What we need is a better plan for education and training and energy independence and innovation and infrastructure that can rebuild America. What we need is a Tax Code that encourages companies to create jobs and manufacturing here in the United States and, yes, asks the wealthiest Americans to help pay down the deficit. That's what's needed. <p>And what's also needed is immigration reform that finally lives up to our heritage as a nation of laws and as a nation of immigrants and continues the American story of renewal and energy and dynamism that's made us who we are. <p>I mean, think about it. You and I both know one of America's greatest strengths has always been our ability to attract talented, hardworking people who believe in this country, who want to help make it stronger. That's what keeps us young. That's what keeps us dynamic and energized. That's what makes us who we are. <p>But our current immigration system doesn't reflect those values. It allows the best and brightest to study here, but then tells them to leave, start companies somewhere else. It punishes immigrants and businesses who play by the rules and fails to address the fact that there are too many who don't. It separates families, and it denies innocent young people the chance to earn an education or serve in the uniform of the country they love. <p>Now, once again, the problem is not the lack of technical solutions. We know what the solutions are to this challenge. Just 6 years ago, an unlikely trio&mdash;John McCain, Ted Kennedy, President Bush&mdash;came together to champion comprehensive immigration reform. I, along with a lot of Democrats, were proud to join 23 Senate Republicans in voting for it. Today, those same Republicans have been driven away from the table by a small faction of their own party. It's created the same kind of stalemate on immigration reform that we're seeing on a whole range of other economic issues. And it's given rise to a patchwork of State laws that cause more problems than they solve and are often doing more harm than good. <p>Now, this makes no sense. It's not good for America. And as long as I am President of the United States, I will not give up the fight to change it. <p>In the face of a Congress that refuses to do anything on immigration, I've said that I'll take action wherever I can. So my administration has been doing what we can, without the help in Congress, for more than the last&mdash;for more than 3 years now. And last week, we took another step. On Friday, we announced that we're lifting the shadow of deportation from deserving young people who were brought to this country as children. <p>We should have passed the \\"DREAM Act\\" a long time ago. It was written by members of both parties. When it came up for a vote a year and a half ago, Republicans in Congress blocked it. The bill hadn't changed. The need hadn't changed. The only thing that had changed was politics. The need had not changed. The bill hadn't changed&mdash;written with Republicans. The only thing that had changed was politics. And I refused to keep looking young people in the eye, deserving young people in the eye, and tell them, tough luck, the politics is too hard. <p>I've met these young people all across the country. They're studying in our schools. They're playing with our children, pledging allegiance to our flag, hoping to serve our country. They are Americans in their hearts, in their minds. They are Americans through and through, in every single way but on paper. And all they want is to go to college and give back to the country they love. So lifting the shadow of deportation and giving them a reason to hope&mdash;that was the right thing to do. It was the right thing to do. <p>It's not amnesty. It falls short of where we need to be; a path to citizenship. It's not a permanent fix. This is a temporary measure that lets us focus our resources wisely while offering some justice to these young people. But it's precisely because it's temporary, Congress still needs to come up with a long-term immigration solution, rather than argue that we did this the wrong way or for the wrong reasons. <p>So to those who are saying Congress should be the one to fix this&mdash;absolutely. For those who say we should do this in a bipartisan fashion&mdash;absolutely. My door has been open for 3&frac12; years. They know where to find me. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I've said time and again: Send me the \\"DREAM Act\\"; I will sign it right away. And I'm still waiting to work with anyone from either party who is committed to real reform. But in the meantime, the question we should consider is this: Was providing these young people with the opportunity for a temporary measure of relief the right thing to do? <p><i>Audience members</i>. Yes! <p><i>The President.</i> I think it was. It's long past time that we gave them a sense of hope. <p>Now, your speaker from yesterday has a different view. In his speech, he said that when he makes a promise to you, he'll keep it. Well, he has promised to veto the \\"DREAM Act,\\" and we should take him at his word. I'm just saying. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And I believe that would be a tragic mistake. You do too. <p>On all these issues&mdash;on the investments we need to grow the middle class and leave a better future for our kids, on deficit reduction that's fair and balanced, on immigration reform, on consumer financial protection so that people aren't exploited, whether at a payday loan shop or if they're sending remittances back to their families&mdash;on all these issues, Washington's got a long way to go to catch up with the rest of the country. <p>The whole idea behind the \\"DREAM Act,\\" after all, was inspired by a music teacher in Illinois. She decided to call her Senator, Dick Durbin, when she discovered that one of her own students was forced to live in the shadows. But even as that idea fell prey to gridlock and game-playing in Washington, it gained momentum in the rest of the country: from every student who marched and organized to keep their classmates from being deported; from every parent who discovered the truth about the child down the street and chose to stand up for them, because these are all our kids; for every American who stood up and spoke out across the country because they saw a wrong and wanted it to be righted, who put their shoulder to the wheel and moved us a little closer toward justice. <p>That's what's always moved us forward. It doesn't start in Washington. It starts with a million quiet heroes who love their country and believe they can change it. <p>We all have different backgrounds. We all have different political beliefs. The Latino community is not monolithic; the African American community is not all of one mind. This is a big country. And sometimes, in tough times, in a country this big and busy, especially during a political year, those differences are cast in a bright spotlight. <p>But I ran for this office because I am absolutely convinced that what binds us together has always proven stronger than what drives us apart. We are one people. We need one another. Our patriotism is rooted not in race, not in ethnicity, not in creed; it is based on a shared belief in the enduring and permanent promise of America. <p>That's the promise that draws so many talented, driven people to these shores. That's the promise that drew my own father here. That's the promise that drew your parents or grandparents or great grandparents, generations of people who dreamed of a place where knowledge and opportunity were available to anybody who was willing to work for it, anybody who was willing to seize it. A place where there was no limit to how far you could go, how high you could climb. <p>They took a chance. And America embraced their drive and embraced their courage&mdash;said, \\"Come, you're welcome.\\" This is who we are. <p>Every single day I walk into the Oval Office, every day that I have this extraordinary privilege of being your President, I will always remember that in no other nation on Earth could my story even be possible. That's something I celebrate. <p>That's what drives me, in every decision I make, to try and widen the circle of opportunity, to fight for that big and generous and optimistic country we inherited, to carry that dream forward for generations to come. Because when I meet these young people, all throughout communities, I see myself. Who knows what they might achieve? I see my daughters and my nieces and my nephews. Who knows what they might achieve if we just give them a chance? <p>That's what I'm fighting for. That's what I stand for. <p>This fight will not always be easy. It hasn't always been easy. It will not happen overnight. Our history has been one where that march towards justice and freedom and equality has taken time. There will always be plenty of stubborn opposition in the way that says: \\"No, you can't. No, you shouldn't. Don't even try.\\" <p>But America was built by people who said something different, who said, \\"Yes, we can,\\" who said, \\"<i>Si, se puede</i>.\\" And as long as I have the privilege of being your President, I will be alongside you, fighting for the country that we together dream of. <p>God bless you. Thank you, NALEO. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"156" "\"Over the past 3 years, we've been clawing our way back from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes. And we know it will take longer than any of us would like to fully recover all the jobs and savings that have been lost. But there are things we can do right now to help put people back to work and make life a little easier for middle-class families. <p>For months, I've been pushing Congress to help us along by passing commonsense policies that would make a difference. Democrats and Republicans have already done some important work together, like passing a tax cut that's allowing working Americans to keep more of their paychecks every week. But Congress has refused to act on most of the other ideas in my jobs plan that economists say could put a million more Americans back to work. <p>There's no excuse for this kind of inaction. Right now we are 7 days away from thousands of American workers having to walk off the job because Congress hasn't passed a transportation bill. We are 8 days away from nearly seven and a half million students seeing their loan rates double because Congress hasn't acted to stop it. <p>This makes no sense. We know that one of the most important things we can do for our economy is to make sure that all Americans get the best education possible. Right now the unemployment rate for Americans with a college degree or more is about half the national average. Their incomes are twice as high as those who don't have a high school diploma. So, if we know that a higher education is the clearest path to the middle class, why would we make it harder to achieve? <p>So much of America needs to be repaired right now. Bridges are deteriorating after years of neglect. Highways are choked with congestion. Transportation delays cost Americans and businesses billions of dollars every year. And there are hundreds of thousands of construction workers who have never been more eager to get back on the job. So why would we let our transportation funding run out? This is a time when we should be doing everything in our power&mdash;Democrats and Republicans&mdash;to keep this recovery moving forward. <p>My administration is doing its part. On Friday, Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood announced $500 million in competitive grants for States and communities that will create construction jobs on projects like road repair and port renovation. And that's an important step, but we can't do it all on our own. <p>The Senate did their part. They passed a bipartisan transportation bill back in March. It had the support of 52 Democrats and 22 Republicans. <p>Now it's up to the House to follow suit: to put aside partisan posturing, end the gridlock, and do what's right for the American people. <p>It's not lost on any of us that this is an election year, but we've got responsibilities that are bigger than an election. We answer to the American people, and they are demanding action. Let's make it easier for students to stay in college. Let's keep construction workers rebuilding our roads and bridges. And let's tell Congress to do their job. Tell them it's time to take steps that we know will create jobs now and help sustain our economy for years to come.\" "

They can play anything at any time. And we're so grateful for their service to our country. Obviously, that goes to all our men and women in uniform. And today is a great day for us to acknowledge everything they do to provide our liberty and way of life. <p>I want to say a special welcome not only to the Members of Congress, but most importantly to their families, because Michelle reminds me every day how difficult it is to be married to a politician&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and the sacrifices that all of you make.

"158" "\"Good afternoon. Earlier today the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act&mdash;the name of the health care reform we passed 2 years ago. In doing so, they've reaffirmed a fundamental principle that here in America, in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no illness or accident should lead to any family's financial ruin. <p>I know there will be a lot of discussion today about the politics of all this, about who won and who lost. That's how these things tend to be viewed here in Washington. But that discussion completely misses the point. Whatever the politics, today's decision was a victory for people all over this country whose lives will be more secure because of this law and the Supreme Court's decision to uphold it. <p>And because this law has a direct impact on so many Americans, I want to take this opportunity to talk about exactly what it means for you. <p>First, if you're one of the more than 250 million Americans who already have health insurance, you will keep your health insurance&mdash;this law will only make it more secure and more affordable. Insurance companies can no longer impose lifetime limits on the amount of care you receive. They can no longer discriminate against children with preexisting conditions. They can no longer drop your coverage if you get sick. They can no longer jack up your premiums without reason. They are required to provide free preventive care like check-ups and mammograms, a provision that's already helped 54 million Americans with private insurance. And by this August, nearly 13 million of you will receive a rebate from your insurance company because it spent too much on things like administrative costs and CEO bonuses, and not enough on your health care. <p>There's more: Because of the Affordable Care Act, young adults under the age of 26 are able to stay on their parent's health care plans, a provision that's already helped 6 million young Americans. And because of the Affordable Care Act, seniors receive a discount on their prescription drugs, a discount that's already saved more than 5 million seniors on Medicare about $600 each. <p>All of this is happening because of the Affordable Care Act. These provisions provide commonsense protections for middle class families, and they enjoy broad popular support. And thanks to today's decision, all of these benefits and protections will continue for Americans who already have health insurance. <p>Now, if you're one of the 30 million Americans who don't yet have health insurance, starting in 2014 this law will offer you an array of quality, affordable, private health insurance plans to choose from. Each State will take the lead in designing their own menu of options, and if States can come up with even better ways of covering more people at the same quality and cost, this law allows them to do that, too. And I've asked Congress to help speed up that process, and give States this flexibility in year one. <p>Once States set up these health insurance marketplaces, known as exchanges, insurance companies will no longer be able to discriminate against any American with a preexisting health condition. They won't be able to charge you more just because you're a woman. They won't be able to bill you into bankruptcy. If you're sick, you'll finally have the same chance to get quality, affordable health care as everyone else. And if you can't afford the premiums, you'll receive a credit that helps pay for it. <p>Today the Supreme Court also upheld the principle that people who can afford health insurance should take the responsibility to buy health insurance. This is important for two reasons: First, when uninsured people who can afford coverage get sick, and show up at the emergency room for care, the rest of us end up paying for their care in the form of higher premiums. And second, if you ask insurance companies to cover people with preexisting conditions, but don't require people who can afford it to buy their own insurance, some folks might wait until they're sick to buy the care they need, which would also drive up everybody else's premiums. <p>That's why, even though I knew it wouldn't be politically popular, and resisted the idea when I ran for this office, we ultimately included a provision in the Affordable Care Act that people who can afford to buy health insurance should take the responsibility to do so. In fact, this idea has enjoyed support from members of both parties, including the current Republican nominee for President. <p>Still, I know the debate over this law has been divisive. I respect the very real concerns that millions of Americans have shared. And I know a lot of coverage through this health care debate has focused on what it means politically. <p>Well, it should be pretty clear by now that I didn't do this because it was good politics. I did it because I believed it was good for the country. I did it because I believed it was good for the American people. <p>There's a framed letter that hangs in my office right now. It was sent to me during the health care debate by a woman named Natoma Canfield. For years and years, Natoma did everything right. She bought health insurance. She paid her premiums on time. But 18 years ago, Natoma was diagnosed with cancer. And even though she'd been cancer-free for more than a decade, her insurance company kept jacking up her rates, year after year. And despite her desire to keep her coverage&mdash;despite her fears that she would get sick again&mdash;she had to surrender her health insurance and was forced to hang her fortunes on chance. <p>I carried Natoma's story with me every day of the fight to pass this law. It reminded me of all the Americans, all across the country, who have had to worry not only about getting sick, but about the cost of getting well. <p>Natoma is well today. And because of this law, there are other Americans&mdash;other sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, fathers and mothers&mdash;who will not have to hang their fortunes on chance. These are the Americans for whom we passed this law. <p>The highest Court in the land has now spoken. We will continue to implement this law. And we'll work together to improve on it where we can. But what we won't do&mdash;what the country can't afford to do&mdash;is refight the political battles of 2 years ago or go back to the way things were. <p>With today's announcement, it's time for us to move forward, to implement and, where necessary, improve on this law. And now is the time to keep our focus on the most urgent challenge of our time: putting people back to work, paying down our debt, and building an economy where people can have confidence that if they work hard, they can get ahead. <p>But today, I'm as confident as ever that when we look back 5 years from now or 10 years from now or 20 years from now, we'll be better off because we had the courage to pass this law and keep moving forward. <p>Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America.\" "
"159" "\"Well, we just had a chance to tour some of the damage that's been done by this devastating fire. I've had a chance to thank Mayor Bach, as well as Governor Hickenlooper, and the entire congressional delegation; members of the fire service, the Forest Service, as well as local fire officials have gotten a full briefing. <p>I think what you see here is an example of outstanding coordination and cooperation between Federal, State, and local agencies. We have been putting everything we have into trying to deal with what's one of the worst fires that we've seen here in Colorado. And it's still early in the fire season, and we still got a lot more work to do. But because of the outstanding work that's been done, because of not only the coordination, but also some unprecedented arrangements that have been made with military resources combined with the civil resources, we're starting to see progress. <p>Obviously, as you saw in some of these subdivisions, the devastation is enormous. And our thoughts and prayers go out to all the families who have been affected. <p>One of the things that I've tried to emphasize is that whether it's fires in Colorado or flooding in the northern parts of Florida, when natural disasters like this hit, America comes together. And we all recognize that there, but for the grace of God, go I. We've got to make sure that we have each other's backs. And that spirit is what you're seeing in terms of volunteers, in terms of firefighters, in terms of Government officials. Everybody is pulling together to try to deal with this situation. <p>Now, as I said, we're not completely out of the woods yet. These folks, some of them have been working 18-hour days, 20-hour days, trying to make sure that these fires get put out. They're going to be carefully monitoring the situation; ultimately, they're going to need a little bit of help from Mother Nature in order to fully extinguish these fires. <p>In the meantime, some lessons are being learned about how we can mitigate some of these fires in the future, and I know that the mayor and Governor and other local officials are already in those conversations. It means that, hopefully, out of this tragedy, some long-term planning occurs, and it may be that we can curb some of the damage that happens the next time, even though you obviously can't fully control fires that are starting up in these mountains. <p>Last point I just want to make, and that is that we can provide all the resources, we can make sure that they're well coordinated, but as I just told these firefighters, what we can't do is to provide them with the courage and the determination and the professionalism, the heart that they show when they're out there battling these fires. <p>When we had a chance on site to see some guys who had just saved three homes in a community that had been devastated, for those families, the work and the sacrifice of those firefighters means the world to them, and they are genuine heroes. <p>And so we want to just say thank you to all the folks who have been involved in this. We're proud of you. We appreciate what you do each and every day. And so for folks all around the country, I hope you are reminded of how important our fire departments are, our Forest Service is. Sometimes they don't get the credit that they deserve until your house is burning down, or your community is being threatened. And you have to understand they're putting their lives at risk to save us and to help us. We've got to make sure that we remember that 365 days a year, not just when tragedies like this strike. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"160" "\"<i>The President.</i> First of all, I want to say to Mayor Bach, Governor Hickenlooper, and the congressional delegation, but most importantly, all the guys on the ground who have been fighting this fire: We are so grateful to see the extraordinary coordination that's taking place between the State, Federal, municipal&mdash;all the agencies&mdash;everybody tried to put everything they got into this thing. <p>This has been a devastating early fire season for Colorado. This community, obviously, is heartbroken by the loss of homes. We're lucky because of the quick action that's been taken, that we haven't seen a lot of loss of life. But for those families who have lost everything&mdash;their possessions, who have been displaced&mdash;our thoughts and prayers are with them. <p>What I've said is, is that the Federal Government is going to do everything we can to coordinate assistance, not just short term, but long term. In fact, one of the good things that we've been seeing is some innovative ways in which some military assets have been deployed alongside the traditional assets that are used in these fire fights. <p>So we're going to have a long way to go before all these fires are put out. We need a little bit of help from Mother Nature. But I hope that people all across the country recognize that when challenges like this happen, all of us come together as one American family. And we're seeing similar disasters, some of the flooding in Florida. Obviously, we've been seeing tornadoes and other natural threats. But what always is inspiring to me is whenever I come to these communities, the strength, the resilience, the degree to which people are willing to work together, it's a reminder of what is the most important aspect of this country, and that is its people and the way that we are willing to get each other's backs. <p>And so I just want say again, Mr. Mayor, you did an outstanding job. Governor, as always, you're on top of things. And I think I speak for the congressional delegation in saying the Federal Government will continue to do everything we can to help coordinate relief. But we've still got a ways to go before these fires are out. <p><i>Q.</i> What do you think when you see just this stuff right here? <p><i>The President.</i> Well, what's remarkable is obviously how devastating these fires are. Once they hit a house and they take root, it is very difficult for anybody to imagine the kind of devastation and how quickly it happens. <p>And obviously, what's also tragic is, is that the nature of these fires, you can have a house that is perfectly fine on one side and then another house that's completely destroyed on the other. But because of those outstanding firefighters that we just saw, three of those homes were saved. And for those three families, those folks are heroes. <p>And when you think about 18-hour days and the kind of effort that these guys are putting in, and the danger that they're putting themselves under, it's a testament to our Forest Service and our firefighters; and we just got to make sure that we are giving them the best equipment, all the resources that they need. But what we can't give them is their courage. They bring that to the table from the start.\" "
"161" "\"[<i>The President's remarks were joined in progress.</i>]<i> </i><p><i>&mdash;</i>&mdash;just to say thank you. I know that everybody here has been working nonstop. We just had a chance to see one of the subdivisions that have been obviously devastated by the course of this fire. But we also had a chance while we were there to thank some guys who were on the site who had just saved three homes. <p>And what I told the press earlier, in natural disasters like this, the Federal Government, our job is to provide all the resources possible. What we've been seeing is unprecedented coordination between Federal, State, and local resources and personnel. <p>I want to thank the mayor, Mayor Bach, as well as Governor Hickenlooper for the great work they've been doing. We've been doing some unusual stuff using military assets for the first time in a different kind of way to help leverage some of the resources that you guys already have. <p>But the main thing I said was no matter how much equipment you have, no matter how many resources are provided, we don't provide you with the courage and professionalism and stick-to-it-ness that all of you guys show every single day. So I want you to know that not only is this community grateful for your work, but the country is grateful for your work. And I want you to know that we're going to stay on it. The job is obviously not done yet, but the country has got your back. And just remember, each and every day, despite all the sacrifices&mdash;and what I got to assume is some pretty weary bodies&mdash;that you got a lot of people out there who are grateful and families whose lives are going to be better because of what you do every day. <p>So thank you very much. And with that, all I want to do is go shake some hands and say I appreciate you. <p>Thank you, guys.\" "
"162" "\"Hi, everybody. I'm here in Colorado Springs, visiting some of the devastating fires that have been taking place over the last several days. As many of you have been watching on television, entire communities are under threat. And we had a chance to tour some of the devastation that had been taking place in some of the subdivisions here. <p>Firefighters are working 18 hours a day, around the clock, trying to make sure that they get this blaze under control. We've got volunteers, who are out here, who are making sure that these firefighters have the food and the water and all the resources that they need. And we've been engaging in some unprecedented coordination between Federal, State, and local communities to try to bring this fire under control. <p>And one of the things I've done here, in addition to saying thank you to these firefighters, is to let them know that all of America has their back. One of the things that happens&mdash;whether it's a fire here in Colorado, or a tornado in Alabama or Missouri, or a flood or a hurricane in Florida&mdash;one of the things that happens here in America is when we see our fellow citizens in trouble and having difficulty, we come together as one American family, as one community. And you see that spirit and you see that strength here in Colorado Springs, where people are working together, promising each other to rebuild. We've got to make sure that we are there with them every step of the way, even after this fire is put out. <p>So for those of you who can provide some help, you should get on the online site of American Red Cross. They're very active in this community, and you can make your contributions there. We're going to continue to make sure that the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Forest Service, our military and National Guard, and all the resources that we have available at the Federal level are brought to bear in fighting this fire. <p>This is a good reminder of what makes us Americans. We don't just look out for ourselves: We look out for each other. And one of the things that I told these firefighters is that we can provide them all the resources they need. But only they provide the courage and the discipline to be able to actually fight these fires. And it's important that we appreciate what they do, not just when our own communities are struck by disaster. It's important that we remember what they do each and every single day and that we continue to provide support to our first responders, our emergency management folks, our firefighters, our military&mdash;everybody who helps secure our liberty and our security each and every day. <p>So, America, I hope you guys remember the folks during these times of need. I know this is a little bit unusual. We don't usually do weekly addresses like this, but I thought it was a good opportunity for us to actually focus attention on a problem that's going on here in Colorado Springs. We never know when it might be our community that's threatened, and it's important that we're there for them. <p>All right, thank you very much.\" "
"163" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. Good morning, everybody. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Good morning, Mr. President. <p><i>The President.</i> Secretary Napolitano, Director Mayorkas, distinguished guests, family and friends, welcome to the White House. Happy Fourth of July. What a perfect way to celebrate America's birthday: the world's oldest democracy, with some of our newest citizens. <p>I have to tell you, just personally, this is one of my favorite things to do. It brings me great joy and inspiration because it reminds us that we are a country that is bound together not simply by ethnicity or bloodlines, but by fidelity to a set of ideas. And as members of our military, you raised your hand and took an oath of service. It is an honor for me to serve as your Commander in Chief. Today you raised your hand and have taken an oath of citizenship. And I could not be prouder to be among the first to greet you as \\"my fellow Americans.\\" <p>Now, looking back, it was an act of extraordinary audacity: a few dozen delegates in that hall in Philadelphia, daring to defy the mightiest empire in the world, declaring \\"that these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States.\\" <p>Two hundred and thirty-six years later, we marvel at America's story: from a string of 13 Colonies to 50 States from sea to shining sea; from a fragile experiment in democracy to a beacon of freedom that still lights the world; from a society of farmers and merchants to the largest, most dynamic economy in the world; from a ragtag army of militias and regulars to you, the finest military that the world has ever known; from a population of some 3 million&mdash;free and slave&mdash;to more than 300 million Americans of every color and every creed. <p>With this ceremony today and ceremonies like it across our country, we affirm another truth: Our American journey, our success, would simply not be possible without the generations of immigrants who have come to our shores from every corner of the globe. We say it so often, we sometimes forget what it means: We are a nation of immigrants. Unless you are one of the first Americans, a Native American, we are all descended from folks who came from someplace else, whether they arrived on the <i>Mayflower</i> or on a slave ship, whether they came through Ellis Island or crossed the Rio Grande. <p>Immigrants signed their names to our Declaration and helped win our independence. Immigrants helped lay the railroads and build our cities, calloused hand by calloused hand. Immigrants took up arms to preserve our Union, to defeat fascism, and to win a cold war. Immigrants and their descendants helped pioneer new industries and fuel our Information Age, from Google to the iPhone. So the story of immigrants in America isn't a story of \\"them,\\" it's a story of \\"us.\\" It's who we are. And now all of you get to write the next chapter. <p>Each of you have traveled your own path to this moment, from Cameroon and the Philippines, Russia and Palau and places in between. Some of you came here as children, brought by parents who dreamed of giving you the opportunities that they had never had. Others of you came as adults, finding your way through a new country and a new culture and a new language. <p>All of you did something profound: You chose to serve. You put on the uniform of a country that was not yet fully your own. In a time of war, some of you deployed into harm's way. You displayed the values that we celebrate every Fourth of July: duty, responsibility, patriotism. <p>We salute a husband and father, originally from Mexico, now a United States marine, joined today by his wife Silvia and daughter Juliett. Becoming a citizen, he says, is \\"another step in the right direction for my family.\\" So today we congratulate Francisco Ballesteros de la Rosa. Where's Francisco? <p>We salute a young woman from El Salvador who came here when she was just 6, grew up in America, who says she \\"always had a desire to serve\\" and who dreamed of becoming&mdash;who dreams of becoming a&mdash;an Army medic. So we congratulate Luisa Childers. Luisa. <p>We salute a young man from Nigeria who came here as a child. \\"I left Nigeria,\\" he says, \\"with the dream that we all have a destiny in life and we are all born with the resources to make a difference.\\" We are confident he will make a difference. We congratulate Oluwatosin Akinduro. <p>We salute a young man from Bolivia who came to America, enlisted in our military, and has volunteered to help care for our veterans. He's becoming a citizen, he says, to be a \\"part of the freedom that everybody is looking for.\\" And so we congratulate Javier Beltran. <p>It has taken these men and women&mdash;these Americans&mdash;years, even decades, to realize their dream. And this too reminds us of a lesson of the Fourth. On that July day, our Founders declared their independence. But they only declared it; it would take another 7 years to win the war, 15 years to forge a Constitution and a Bill of Rights, nearly 90 years and a great civil war to abolish slavery, nearly 150 years for women to win the right to vote, nearly 190 years to enshrine voting rights. And even now we're still perfecting our Union, still extending the promise of America. <p>And that includes making sure the American Dream endures for all those&mdash;like these men and women&mdash;who are willing to work hard, play by the rules, and meet their responsibilities. For just as we remain a nation of laws, we have to remain a nation of immigrants. And that's why, as another step forward, we're lifting the shadow of deportation from serving&mdash;from deserving young people who were brought to this country as children. It's why we still need a \\"DREAM Act\\" to keep talented young people who want to contribute to our society and serve our country. It's why we need, why America's success demands, comprehensive immigration reform. <p>Because the lesson of these 236 years is clear: Immigration makes America stronger, immigration makes us more prosperous, and immigration positions America to lead in the 21st century. And these young men and women are testaments to that. No other nation in the world welcomes so many new arrivals. No other nation constantly renews itself, refreshes itself with the hopes and the drive and the optimism and the dynamism of each new generation of immigrants. You are all one of the reasons that America is exceptional. You're one of the reasons why, even after two centuries, America is always young, always looking to the future, always confident that our greatest days are still to come. <p>So to all of you, I want to wish you the happiest Fourth of July. God bless you all. God bless our men and women in uniform and your families. And God bless the United States of America. <p>And with that, I want you to join me in welcoming onto the stage one of America's newest citizens. Born in Guatemala, he enlisted in the Marine Corps, served with honor in Afghanistan. And I know he's especially proud because in a few days, his father Walter, who's also here today, will become a naturalized American citizen as well. Where's Walter? There he is over there. [<i>Laughter</i>] Good to see you, Walter. Please welcome Lance Corporal Byron Acevedo to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance. <p>Right here. <p><i>Lance Cpl. Byron O.</i> <i>Acevedo, USMC.</i> I'm nervous. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> You'll do great. <p>[<i>At this point, Lance Cpl. Acevedo led the Pledge of Allegiance.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you, everybody. Have a great Fourth of July. Congratulations to our newest citizens. Yay!\" "
"164" "\"How's it going, everybody? Are you hot? It's supposed to be hot. It's the fourth of July. Happy Fourth of July, everybody! On behalf of the entire Obama family, welcome to the White House. <p>Now, the last thing anybody wants to do is to ruin a nice backyard barbecue with a long speech, so I'm going to be quick. <p>It is always such an honor for us to spend this holiday with members of our military and your extraordinary families. All of you represent what is best in America. You serve under our proud flag. You and your families sacrifice more than most of us can ever know, all in defense of those God-given rights that were first put to paper 236 years ago: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. <p>So as your Commander in Chief, but also as an American, I want to invite all of you over to say one thing: Thank you. <p>Today, all across America&mdash;at schools, and beaches, in town squares&mdash;Americans are celebrating the freedoms that all of you and your families defend. Like many of them, we're grilling in the backyard. We've got some pretty good tunes for you. We've got the outstanding Marine Band. Give them a big round of applause. And we've got Brad Paisley and his band in the house for a little country. <p>We've also got all of you. We've got Army in the house. We've got Navy. We've got Air Force. You know we've got some marines here. And we've got Coast Guard. Today we salute all of you. <p>We salute our soldiers, like Sergeant Alan Ruehs, who, in the midst of an enemy ambush in Afghanistan, risked his own life to save the lives of four others. <p>We salute our sailors, like Petty Officer Taylor Morris, who suffered terrible wounds while serving in Afghanistan on an Explosive Ordnance Disposal Team, but who inspires us all through his incredible recovery. <p>We salute an airman, Colonel Charles Barnett, who led close to 200 combat missions in Afghanistan and still serves his country by volunteering to care for our fallen heroes at Arlington National Cemetery. <p>We salute a marine, Corporal Alex Nguyen, who sustained serious injuries when his vehicle struck an IED in Afghanistan, but who carries on stronger than ever. <p>We salute a \\"Coastie\\" from my hometown of Chicago, Lieutenant Commander Michelle Watson, who was one of the first African American women to graduate from the Coast Guard Academy, and went on to perform exceptional service in Operation Enduring Freedom. <p>All the men and women who stand with us here this afternoon are an example of this generation of heroes, this 9/11 generation, that has earned its place in history alongside the greatest generations. Because of your service and sacrifice, all of our troops are now out of Iraq. Because of your service&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;because of your service and sacrifice, we took the fight to al Qaida and we brought Usama bin Laden to justice. Because of your service and sacrifice, we're transitioning out of Afghanistan. We will remain ready for any threat. That is all because of you. <p>And as long as I have the honor of being your Commander in Chief, I want you all&mdash;our men and women in uniform, our veterans and their families&mdash;to know this: America will always remember. We will always be there for you, just as you've been there for us. That's my promise. That is America's promise. And that is one that we pledge to fulfill on this Independence Day. <p>So happy Fourth of July, everybody. Enjoy the fireworks. Get some hotdogs. God bless you. God bless your families. And God bless these United States of America. <p>And with that, let me turn it back over to the United States Marine Band.\" "
"165" "\"Hello, everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat. I apologize for keeping you waiting a little bit, and I hope everybody is staying hydrated&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;because it is hot. <p>Welcome to the White House. We wouldn't normally keep you this late on a Friday afternoon unless we had a good reason, and the bill that I'm about to sign is a pretty good reason. <p>I want to very much thank the Members of Congress who are here. We got a number in the front row, but in particular, I want to recognize Senator Boxer and Congressman Mica, whose leadership made this bill a reality. And although Barbara couldn't make it, we want to make sure that everybody acknowledges the hard work that John did on this on bill. <p>Now, we're doing this late on Friday afternoon because I just got back from spending the past 2 days talking with folks in Ohio and Pennsylvania about how our challenge as a country isn't just to reclaim all the jobs that were lost to the recession, although obviously that's job number one. It's also to reclaim the economic security that so many Americans have lost over the past decade. <p>And I believe with every fiber of my being that a strong economy comes not from the top down, but from a strong middle class. That means having a good job that pays a good wage, a home to call your own, health care, retirement savings that are there when you need them, a good education for your kids so that they can do even better than you did. <p>And that's why&mdash;for months&mdash;I've been calling on Congress to pass several commonsense ideas that will have an immediate impact on the economic security of American families. I'm pleased that they've finally acted. And the bill I'm about to sign will accomplish two ideas that are very important for the American people. <p>First of all, this bill will keep thousands of construction workers on the job rebuilding our Nation's infrastructure. Second, this bill will keep interest rates on Federal student loans from doubling this year, which would have hit nearly 7.5 million students with an average of a thousand dollars more on their loan payments. These steps will make a real difference in the lives of millions of Americans, some of whom are standing with us here today. But make no mistake, we've got a lot more to do. The construction industry, for example, was hit brutally hard when the housing bubble burst. So it's not enough just to keep construction workers on the job doing projects that were already underway. We've got Mayor Villaraigosa and Governor O'Malley here as representatives of organizations of mayors and Governors who know how desperate we need to do some of this work. <p>And for months, I've been calling on Congress to take half the money we're no longer spending on war and use it to do some nation-building here at home. There's work to be done building roads and bridges and wireless networks. There are hundreds of thousands of construction workers that are ready to do it. <p>The same thing is true for our students. The bill I'm about to sign is vital for millions of students and their families. But it's not enough just to keep interest rates from doubling. <p>I've asked Congress to reform and expand the financial aid that's offered to students. And I've been asking them to help us give 2 million Americans the opportunity to learn the skills that businesses in their areas are looking for right now through partnerships between community colleges and employers. <p>In today's economy, a higher education is the surest path to finding a good job and earning a good salary and making it into the middle class. So it can't be a luxury reserved for just a privileged few. It's an economic necessity that every American family should be able to afford. <p>So this is an outstanding piece of business. And I'm very appreciative of the hard work that Congress has done on it. My hope is, is that this bipartisan spirit spills over into the next phase, that we can start putting more construction workers back to work, not just those that were already on existing projects who were threatened to be laid off, but also getting some new projects done that are vitally important to communities all across the Nation and that will improve our economy, as well as making sure that now that we've prevented a doubling of student loan rates, we actually start doing more to reduce the debt burden that our young people are experiencing. <p>I want to thank all the Americans, the young or the young at heart, who took the time to sit down and write a letter or type out an email or make a phone call or send a tweet, hoping that your voice would be heard on these issues. I promise you, your voices have been heard. Any of you who believed your voice could make a difference, I want to reaffirm your belief. You made this happen. <p>So I'm very pleased that Congress got this done. I'm grateful to members of both parties who came together and put the interests of the American people first. And my message to Congress is what I've been saying for months now: Let's keep going. Let's keep moving forward. Let's keep finding ways to work together to grow the economy and to help put more folks back to work. There is no excuse for inaction when there are so many Americans still trying to get back on their feet. <p>With that, let me sign this bill. And let's make sure that we are keeping folks on the job and we're keeping our students in school. All right? <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"166" "\"Hi, everybody. I'm here in Ohio, where I've spent the past couple days talking with folks about our central challenge as a country: not just reclaiming all the jobs lost to the recession, but reclaiming the economic security that so many Americans have lost over the last decade. <p>Our mission isn't just to put people back to work, it's to rebuild an economy where that work pays, an economy in which everyone who works hard has the chance to get ahead. <p>For months, we've been pushing Congress to pass several commonsense ideas that will help us do that. And on Friday, I signed into law a bill that will do two things for the American people. First, it will keep thousands of construction workers on the job rebuilding our Nation's infrastructure.

It's an economic necessity that every American family should be able to afford. <p>Finally, I want to thank every American who took the time to sit down and write a letter, or type an e-mail, or make a phone call, or send a tweet hoping your voice would make a difference. I promise you, your voice made all the difference. And as long as I have the privilege of being your President, your voice will be heard in the White House. <p>So thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"167" "\"Thank you. Thank you very much. Everybody, have a seat. Have a seat. Well, good afternoon, everybody. I'm glad things have cooled off a little bit. I know folks were hot. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We're here today to talk about taxes, something that everybody obviously cares deeply about. And I've often said that our biggest challenge right now isn't just to reclaim all the jobs that we lost to the recession, it's to reclaim the security that so many middle class Americans have lost over the past decade. Our core mission as an administration and as a country has to be, yes, putting people back to work, but also rebuilding an economy where that work pays off, an economy in which everybody can have the confidence that if you work hard, you can get ahead. <p>Now, what's holding us back from meeting these challenges, it's not a lack of plans; it's not a lack of ideas. It is a stalemate in this town, in Washington, between two very different views about which direction we should go in as a country. And nowhere is that stalemate more pronounced than on the issue of taxes. <p>Many members of the other party believe that prosperity comes from the top down, so that if we spend trillions more on tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, that that will somehow unleash jobs and economic growth. <p>I disagree. I think they're wrong. I believe our prosperity has always come from an economy that's built on a strong and growing middle class, one that can afford to buy the products that our businesses sell, a middle class that can own homes and send their kids to college and save enough to retire on. That's why I've cut middle class taxes every year that I've been President: by $3,600 for the typical middle class family. Let me repeat: Since I've been in office, we've cut taxes for the typical middle class family by $3,600. <p>I wanted to repeat that because sometimes there's a little misinformation out there&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and folks get confused about it. <p>Moreover, we've tried it their way. It didn't work. At the beginning of the last decade, Congress passed trillions of dollars in tax cuts that benefited the wealthiest Americans more than anybody else. And we were told that it would lead to more jobs and higher incomes for everybody and that prosperity would start at the top but then trickle down. <p>And what happened? The wealthy got wealthier, but most Americans struggled. Instead of creating more jobs, we had the slowest job growth in half a century. Instead of widespread prosperity, the typical family saw its income fall. And in just a few years, we went from record surpluses under Bill Clinton to record deficits that we are now still struggling to pay off today. <p>So we don't need more top-down economics. We've tried that theory. We've seen what happens. We can't afford to go back to it. We need policies that grow and strengthen the middle class, policies that help create jobs, that make education and training more affordable, that encourage businesses to start up and create jobs right here in the United States. <p>So that's why I believe it's time to let the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans&mdash;folks like myself&mdash;to expire. And by the way, I might feel differently&mdash;because it's not like I like to pay taxes&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I might feel differently if we were still in surplus. But we've got this huge deficit, and everybody agrees that we need to do something about these deficits and these debts. So the money we're spending on these tax cuts for the wealthy is a major driver of our deficit, a major contributor to our deficit, costing us a trillion dollars over the next decade. <p>By the way, these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans are also the tax cuts that are least likely to promote growth. So we can't afford to keep that up, not right now. So I'm not proposing anything radical here. I just believe that anybody making over $250,000 a year should go back to the income tax rates we were paying under Bill Clinton, back when our economy created nearly 23 million new jobs, the biggest budget surplus in history, and plenty of millionaires to boot. <p>And this is not just my opinion. The American people are with me on this; poll after poll shows that's the case. And there are plenty of patriotic and very successful, very wealthy Americans who also agree, because they know that by making that kind of contribution, they're making the country as a whole stronger. <p>At the same time, most people agree that we should not raise taxes on middle class families or small businesses, not when so many folks are just trying to get by. Not when so many folks are still digging themselves out of the hole that was created by this great recession that we had and at a time when the recovery is still fragile. And that's why I'm calling on Congress to extend the tax cuts for the 98 percent of Americans who make less than $250,000 for another year. <p>If Congress doesn't do this, millions of American families&mdash;including these good-looking people behind me&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;could see their taxes go up by $2,200 starting on January 1 of next year. That'd be a big blow to working families, and it would be a drag on the entire economy. <p>Now, we can already anticipate&mdash;we know what those who are opposed to letting the high-end tax cuts expire will say. They'll say that we can't tax job creators. And they'll try to explain how this would be bad for small businesses. <p>Let me tell you, the folks who create most new jobs in America are America's small-business owners. And I've cut taxes for small-business owners 18 times since I've been in office. I've also asked Congress repeatedly to pass new tax cuts for entrepreneurs who've hired new workers and raised their workers' wages. <p>But here's the thing that you have to remember. The proposal I make today would extend these tax cuts for 97 percent of all small-business owners in America. In other words, 97 percent of small businesses fall under the $250,000 threshold. So this isn't about taxing job creators, this is about helping job creators. I want to give them relief. I want to give those 97 percent a sense of permanence. <p>I believe we should be able to come together and get this done. While I disagree on extending tax cuts for the wealthy, because we just can't afford them, I recognize that not everybody agrees with me on this. On the other hand, we all say we agree that we should extend the tax cuts for 98 percent of the American people. Right? Everybody says that. The Republicans say they don't want to raise taxes on the middle class. I don't want to raise taxes on the middle class. <p>So we should all agree to extend the tax cuts for the middle class. Let's agree to do what we agree on. Right? That's what compromise is all about. Let's not hold the vast majority of Americans and our entire economy hostage while we debate the merits of another tax cut for the wealthy. We can have that debate. [<i>Applause</i>] We can have that debate, but let's not hold up working on the thing that we already agree on. <p>In many ways, the fate of the tax cut for the wealthiest Americans will be decided by the outcome of the next election. My opponent will fight to keep them in place. I will fight to end them. But that argument shouldn't threaten you. It shouldn't threaten the 98 percent of Americans who just want to know that their taxes won't go up next year. <p>Middle class families and small-business owners, they deserve that guarantee. They deserve that certainty. It will be good for the economy, and it will be good for you. And we should give you that certainty now. We should do it now. It will be good for you. It will be good for the economy as a whole. <p>So my message to Congress is this: Pass a bill extending the tax cuts for the middle class; I will sign it tomorrow. Pass it next week, I'll sign it next week. Pass it next&mdash;well, you get the idea. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>As soon as that gets done, we can continue to have a debate about whether it's a good idea to also extend the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. I'll have one position. The other side will have another. And we'll have that debate, and the American people can listen to that debate. <p>And then next year, once the election is over, things have calmed down a little bit, based on what the American people have said and how they've spoken during that election, we'll be in a good position to decide how to reform our entire Tax Code in a simple way that lowers rates and helps our economy grow and brings down our deficit, because that's something that we're going to have to do for the long term. <p>But right now our top priority has to be giving middle class families and small businesses the security they deserve. You're the ones who are driving this recovery forward. [<i>Applause</i>] You're the ones who are driving this recovery forward, and I think it's time to widen the circle of opportunity and help more Americans who work hard to get ahead. It's time that we learned the lessons of our past and lay the foundation for a better future. That's what I'm focused on every day, and I hope Congress will join me in doing the right thing. <p>So thank you very much, all, for being here. Thank you.\" "
"168" "\"Over the past couple weeks, I've been talking with folks across the country about how we're going to rebuild an economy where if you work hard, you and your family can get ahead. And right now there's a big debate going on in Washington over two fundamentally different paths we can take as a country to do that. <p>One path, pushed by Republicans in Congress and their nominee for President, says that the best way to create prosperity is to let it trickle down from the top. They believe that if we spend trillions more on tax cuts for the wealthy, it'll somehow create jobs, even if we have to pay for it by gutting education and training and by raising middle class taxes. <p>I think they're wrong. We already tried it that way for most of the last decade, and it didn't work. We're still paying for trillions of dollars in tax cuts that benefited the wealthiest Americans more than anyone else, tax cuts that didn't lead to the rise in wages and middle class jobs that we were promised and that helped take us from record surpluses to record deficits. <p>The last thing we need right now is more top-down economics. What we need are policies that will grow and strengthen the middle class, that will help create jobs, make education and training more affordable, and encourage businesses to start up and stay right here in the United States. <p>Soon, we'll face a choice between these two different approaches. On January 1, taxes are set to go up for tens of millions of Americans. I think that would be a huge financial hit for middle class families. That's why I've cut middle class taxes every year that I've been President, by $3,600 for the typical family. And that's why, this week, I called on Congress to immediately stop the January 1 tax hike from hitting any American on the first $250,000 of their income. <p>Under my plan, 98 percent of American families won't see their income taxes go up at all. But the other 2 percent of Americans will have to pay a little more on taxes on anything they make over $250,000. In other words, the wealthiest few Americans will go back to the income tax rates they were paying under Bill Clinton. And if you remember, that was when our economy created nearly 23 million new jobs, the biggest budget surplus in history, and millionaires were doing pretty well to boot. <p>The folks in Congress and on the campaign trail who oppose this plan warn that it would somehow hurt small businesses and job creators. Well, they're completely ignoring the facts. <p>Under my plan, 97 percent of small business owners would avoid getting hit with any income tax hike whatsoever. In fact, I've cut taxes for small businesses 18 times since I've been President. And just this week, I ordered a series of new steps to help our small businesses grow and hire. <p>So, the only place Republicans and I disagree is whether we keep giving tax cuts to the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. Republicans in Washington want more of those tax cuts. With the deficit we have, I don't think we can afford them. <p>But even if we disagree on the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, we all agree that no American should pay more taxes on the first $250,000 of their income. So let's at least agree to do what we all agree on. That's what compromise is all about. Let's not hold the vast majority of Americans and our entire economy hostage while we debate the merits of another tax cut for the wealthy. Let's skip the unnecessary drama, the needless delays, and all the partisan posturing and let's just do the right thing for the people who sent us here to serve. <p>And I'm going to keep fighting to make sure we rebuild an economy that rewards work, grows the middle class, and gives new opportunity to those trying to earn their way into the middle class. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"169" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat. Welcome to the White House, everybody. And congratulations to the Baylor Lady Bears on their undefeated season and second national championship. <p>There are some proud Members of Congress who are here today. We've got a bunch of proud Texans in the house. <p>I want to thank all the outstanding young women who are behind me and the coach for making my bracket look good, at least on the women's side. [<i>Laughter</i>] I picked Baylor over Notre Dame, but I have to say, I wasn't the only one. It wasn't that hard. [<i>Laughter</i>] Because if there's one thing to describe this team, it was \\"dominant.\\" <p>Last season, the Lady Bears scored more points than any team in women's college basketball history. They became the first team ever&mdash;men's or women's&mdash;to win 40 games in a season. <p>Now, this is not to say that success came easily. After a tough loss to Texas A&M in the Elite Eight last year, the Lady Bears decided they weren't going to go through that again. So they buckled down, they spent all summer in the gym, and they have not lost since: not to the Aggies and not to anybody else. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So obviously, a lot of credit goes to Coach Kim Mulkey. This is Coach's fifth national championship&mdash;she just&mdash;she likes to win if you haven't noticed. [<i>Laughter</i>] She won two as a star player at Louisiana Tech, one as an assistant coach, and now two as head coach at Baylor. That's an incredible accomplishment. I want to point out, that's the first person in college basketball history to win titles in all three roles. I heard she plans to win her next one as mascot&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;so that she can&mdash;but I mean, she's got to figure out what else she can win at this point. But we want to congratulate Coach Kim for leading this team and being named Coach of the Year in women's basketball. Congratulations. <p>Now, obviously, a great winning team requires a great coach, but it's not as if on the court the players were slackers either. We can't say enough about Brittney Griner. And this young woman is the new face of women's basketball: she blocks shots; she rebounds; she's got the jump hook; she's got the dunk. <p>She won just about every award that you could win last season. And I have to say that there have been times in the past where I shot around a little bit with the visiting team, but this time I don't think I can get my shot off, so&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I'm not doing that this year. [<i>Applause</i>]Not doing that this year. <p>She's not the only one I'm scared of. You've got Odyssey Sims, who just owned the backcourt, earned her reputation as one of the premier perimeter defenders in the country. Senior Terran Condrey, or Big Shot T&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Team members.</i> Yes! <p><i>The President.</i> Where did she go? Right here? Knocking down jump shots. Three other seniors: Ashley Field, Lindsay Palmer, and Cherrish Wallace, who anchored this team for 4 of the most successful years in school history. <p>So we know that the Lady Bears are talented on the court. But when practice is over, they work just as hard. Some made the Big 12 Honor Roll with perfect GPAs. That's worth an applause right there. [<i>Applause</i>] They read with students at elementary schools in Waco and served meals to the homeless. They traveled around the world, caring for infants at an AIDS orphanage and building houses in Kenya. <p>The Lady Bears also made a difference in one little girl, who is so special to them that the team brought her along for today's visit. Haley Klepper, who is right here&mdash;hey, Haley. Haley is as brave as can be and has just gone through some struggles. But when the team found out about Haley and all the stuff that she goes through every day, and she's such a brave little girl, they immediately took her under their wing. So she has her own spot reserved in the Baylor locker room, and she's a pretty big fan. She cheers from the sidelines just about at every home game. Is that right? [<i>Laughter</i>] So we're thrilled to have Haley here. <p>So this team just sets a terrific example for girls everywhere: as athletes, as scholars, as leaders in their community. I could not be prouder of this team. And I've said&mdash;I was saying to them before we came out, as the father of two daughters who are tall and beautiful just like them, it is great to have role models who can show that women can be strong and athletic and competitive, but also play as a team. That's a terrific lesson for my daughters; that's a terrific lesson for girls everywhere. <p>And so we could not be prouder with them. And since they've got all five starters coming back, I suspect that they're the odds-on favorite for my bracket next year as well. [<i>Laughter</i>] So congratulations, everybody.\" "
"170" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Well, let me, first of all, say how grateful I am for all of you being here and how much we appreciate everything that you've done. I know that there are a lot of people here who have been so engaged in the campaign, have sacrificed so much, people who've been involved back since 2007. And so I want all of you to know how appreciative I am. <p>And I know many of you came here today for a campaign event. I was looking forward to having a fun conversation with you about some really important matters that we face as a country and the differences between myself and my opponent in this election. But this morning, we woke up to news of a tragedy that reminds us of all the ways that we are united as one American family. <p>By now, many of you know, many of you have heard that a few miles outside of Denver in a town called Aurora, at least 12 people were killed when a gunman opened fire in a movie theater and dozens more are being treated for injuries at a local hospital. Some of the victims are being treated at a children's hospital. <p>We're still gathering all the facts about what happened in Aurora, but what we do know is that the police have one suspect in custody. And the Federal Government stands ready to do whatever is necessary to bring whoever is responsible for this heinous crime to justice. And we will take every step possible to ensure the safety of all of our people. <p>We're going to stand by our neighbors in Colorado during this extraordinarily difficult time. And I had a chance to speak with the mayor of Aurora as well as the Governor of Colorado to express, not just on behalf of Michelle and myself, but the entire American family, how heartbroken we are. <p>Now, even as we learn how this happened and who's responsible, we may never understand what leads anybody to terrorize their fellow human beings like this. Such violence, such evil is senseless. It's beyond reason. But while we will never know fully what causes somebody to take the life of another, we do know what makes life worth living. The people we lost in Aurora loved, and they were loved. They were mothers and fathers. They were husbands and wives, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters, friends and neighbors. They had hopes for the future, and they had dreams that were not yet fulfilled. <p>And if there's anything to take away from this tragedy, it's the reminder that life is very fragile. Our time here is limited, and it is precious. And what matters at the end of the day is not the small things, it's not the trivial things, which so often consume us and our daily lives. Ultimately, it's how we choose to treat one another and how we love one another. <p>It's what we do on a daily basis to give our lives meaning and to give our lives purpose. That's what matters. At the end of the day, what we'll remember will be those we loved and what we did for others. That's why we're here. <p>I'm sure that many of you who are parents here had the same reaction that I did when I heard this news. My daughters go to the movies. What if Malia and Sasha had been at the theater, as so many of our kids do every day? Michelle and I will be fortunate enough to hug our girls a little tighter tonight, and I'm sure you will do the same with your children. But for those parents who may not be so lucky, we have to embrace them and let them know we will be there for them as a nation. <p>So again, I am so grateful that all of you are here. I am so moved by your support. But there are going to be other days for politics. This, I think, is a day for prayer and reflection. <p>For&mdash;[applause]&mdash;so what I'd ask everybody to do, I'd like us to pause in a moment of silence for the victims of this terrible tragedy, for the people who knew them and loved them, for those who are still struggling to recover, and for all the victims of less publicized acts of violence that plague our communities every single day. So if everybody can just take a moment. <p>[<i>At this point, the President led a moment of silence</i>.] <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you, everybody. I hope all of you will keep the people of Aurora in your hearts and minds today. May the Lord bring them comfort and healing in hard days to come. <p>I am grateful to all of you, and I hope that as a consequence of today's events, as you leave here, you spend a little time thinking about the incredible blessings that God has given us. <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you, Obama! <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "

"172" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. I want to begin by just thanking all the State, local, and Federal officials who have responded magnificently to this tragedy. <p>Governor Hickenlooper, who has already been dealing with a range of natural disasters here in the State, has been an extraordinary example of strength. The mayor, who has only been on the job 7 months and obviously has responded with great strength and leadership. The police chief, who&mdash;we had an opportunity to speak over the phone&mdash;Chief Oates has been dealing with as difficult a set of circumstances as any law enforcement officer deals with, and he and his officers have done everything right, by the book, with great courage and great determination. And so we are very proud of them. And I think I speak for the entire congressional delegation who is here as well. <p>Scripture says that: \\"He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more. Neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.\\" And when you have an opportunity to visit with families who have lost their loved ones&mdash;as I described to them, I come to them not so much as President as I do as a father and as a husband. And I think that the reason stories like this have such an impact on us is because we can all understand what it would be to have somebody that we love taken from us in this fashion: what it would be like and how it would impact us. <p>I had a chance to visit with each family, and most of the conversation was filled with memory. It was an opportunity for families to describe how wonderful their brother or their son or daughter was and the lives that they have touched and the dreams that they held for the future. I confessed to them that words are always inadequate in these kinds of situations, but that my main task was to serve as a representative of the entire country and let them know that we are thinking about them at this moment and will continue to think about them each and every day and that the awareness that not only all of America, but much of the world is thinking about them, might serve as some comfort. <p>I also tried to assure them that although the perpetrator of this evil act has received a lot of attention over the last couple of days, that attention will fade away. And in the end, after he has felt the full force of our justice system, what will be remembered are the good people who were impacted by this tragedy. <p>And I also had a chance to give folks some hugs and to shed some tears, but also to share some laughs as they remembered the wonderful lives that these men and women represented. <p>I also had a chance, fortunately, to visit some folks who are going to be okay, thanks to the extraordinary efforts of the staff at this hospital. And I just want to thank everybody who's worked tirelessly here to deal with this tragedy. <p>Some of the stories are remarkable. You see young people who've come in and just 2 days ago or 36 hours ago or even 24 hours ago, it wasn't certain whether they'd make it. And now suddenly, their eyes are open, they're alert, and they're talking. And it reminds you that even in the darkest of days, life continues and people are strong and people bounce back and people are resilient. And particularly, given the fact that so many of the victims were young, it is a great blessing to see how rapidly they're able to recover from some pretty devastating injuries. <p>There's one particular story I want to tell because this was the last visit that I had and I think it's representative of everything that I saw and heard today. I had a chance, just now, about 5 minutes ago, to visit with Allie Young&mdash;Allie is 19 years old&mdash;and I also had a chance to visit with Allie's best friend, Stephanie Davies, who's 21. Stephanie was actually downstairs with Allie as well as Allie's parents when I walked into the room. <p>And I don't think this story has been heard&mdash;at least I hadn't read it yet&mdash;but I wanted to share it with you. When the gunman initially came in and threw the canisters, he threw them only a few feet away from Allie and Stephanie, who were sitting there watching the film. Allie stood up, seeing that she might need to do something or at least warn the other people who were there. And she was immediately shot. And she was shot in the neck, and it punctured a vein, and immediately, she started spurting blood. <p>And apparently, as she dropped down on the floor, Stephanie&mdash;21 years old&mdash;had the presence of mind to drop down on the ground with her, pull her out of the aisle, place her fingers over where she&mdash;where Allie had been wounded and applied pressure the entire time while the gunman was still shooting. Allie told Stephanie she needed to run. Stephanie refused to go, instead, actually, with her other hand, called 911 on her cell phone. <p>Once the SWAT team came in, they were still trying to clear the theater. Stephanie then, with the help of several others, carries Allie across two parking lots to where the ambulance is waiting. And because of Stephanie's timely actions, I just had a conversation with Allie downstairs, and she is going to be fine. <p>I don't know how many people at any age would have the presence of mind that Stephanie did or the courage that Allie showed. And so, as tragic as the circumstances of what we've seen today are, as heartbreaking as it is for the families, it's worth us spending most of our time reflecting on young Americans like Allie and Stephanie, because they represent what's best in us and they assure us that out of this darkness a brighter day is going to come. <p>To the entire community of Aurora, the country is thinking of you. I know that there's going to be a vigil and an opportunity for everybody to come together. And I hope that all those who are in attendance understand that the entire country will be there in prayer and reflection today. <p>So thank you. God bless you. God bless all who helped to respond to this tragedy. And I hope that over the next several days, next several weeks, and next several months, we all reflect on how we can do something about some of the senseless violence that ends up marring this country, but also reflect on all the wonderful people who make this the greatest country on Earth. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "

And to Gwen Rankin, Leanne Lemley, and the entire Ladies Auxiliary, thank you for your patriotic service to America. <p>I stand before you as our hearts still ache over the tragedy in Aurora, Colorado. Yesterday I was in Aurora with families whose loss is hard to imagine; with the wounded, who are fighting to recover; with a community and a military base in the midst of their grief. And they told me of the loved ones they lost. <p>And here today it's fitting to recall those who wore our Nation's uniform: Staff Sergeant Jesse Childress, an Air Force reservist, 29 years old, a cyber specialist who loved sports, the kind of guy, said a friend, who'd help anybody; Petty Officer Third Class John Larimer, 27 years old, who, like his father and grandfather before him, joined the Navy, and who is remembered as an outstanding shipmate; Rebecca Wingo, 32 years old, a veteran of the Air Force, fluent in Chinese, who served as a translator, a mother whose life will be an inspiration to her two little girls; and Jonathan Blunk from Reno, just 26 years old, but a veteran of three Navy tours, whose family and friends will always know that in that theater he gave his own life to save another. <p>These young patriots were willing to serve in faraway lands, yet they were taken from us here at home. And yesterday I conveyed to their families a message on behalf of all Americans: We honor your loved ones. We salute their service. And as you summon the strength to carry on and keep bright their legacy, we stand with you as one united American family. <p>Veterans of Foreign Wars, in you I see the same shining values, the virtues that make America great. When our harbor was bombed and fascism was on the march, when the fighting raged in Korea and Vietnam, when our country was attacked on that clear September morning, when our forces were sent to Iraq, you answered your country's call. Because you know what Americans must always remember: Our Nation only endures because there are patriots who protect it. <p>In the crucible of battle, you were tested in ways the rest of us will never know. You carry in your hearts the memory of the comrades you lost. For you understand that we must honor our fallen heroes not just on Memorial Day, but all days. And when an American goes missing or is taken prisoner, we must do everything in our power to bring them home. <p>Even after you took off the uniform, you never stopped serving. You took care of each other, fighting for the benefits and care you had earned. And you've taken care of the generations that followed, including our newest veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. On behalf of all our men and women in uniform, and on behalf of the American people, I want to thank you, VFW. Thank you for your outstanding work. <p>Of course, some among you&mdash;our Vietnam veterans&mdash;didn't always receive that thanks, at least not on time. This past Memorial Day, I joined some of you at The Wall to begin the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam war. And it was another chance to say what should have been said all along: You did your duty, and you made us proud. And as this 50th anniversary continues, I'd ask all our Vietnam vets to stand or raise your hand as we say: Thank you, and welcome home. <p>Every generation among you served to keep us strong and free. And it falls to us, those that follow, to preserve what you won. Four years ago, I stood before you at a time of great challenge for our Nation. We were engaged in two wars. Al Qaida was entrenched in their safe havens in Pakistan. Many of our alliances were frayed. Our standing in the world had suffered. We were in the worst recession of our lifetimes. Around the world, some questioned whether the United States still had the capacity to lead. <p>So 4 years ago, I made you a promise. I pledged to take the fight to our enemies and renew our leadership in the world. As President, that's what I've done. And as you reflect on recent years, as we look ahead to the challenges we face as a nation and the leadership that's required, you don't just have my words, you have my deeds. You have my track record. You have the promises I've made and the promises that I've kept. <p>I pledged to end the war in Iraq honorably, and that's what we've done. After I took office, we removed nearly 150,000 U.S. troops from Iraq. And some said that bringing our troops home last year was a mistake. They would have kept tens of thousands of our forces in Iraq indefinitely, without a clear mission. Well, when you're Commander in Chief, you owe the troops a plan, you owe the country a plan, and that includes recognizing not just when to begin wars, but also how to end them. <p>So we brought our troops home responsibly. They left with their heads held high, knowing they gave Iraqis a chance to forge their own future. And today, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq, and we are proud of all the Americans who served there. <p>I pledged to make it a priority to take out the terrorists who had attacked us on 9/11. And as a candidate, I said that if we had Usama bin Laden in our sights, we would act to keep America safe, even if it meant going into Pakistan. Some of you remember, at the time, that comment drew quite a bit of criticism. But since I took office, we've worked with our allies and our partners to take out more top Al Qaida leaders than any time since 9/11. And thanks to the courage and the skill of our forces, Usama bin Laden will never threaten America again and Al Qaida is on the road to defeat. <p>I pledged to finish the job in Afghanistan. After years of drift, we had to break the momentum of the Taliban and build up the capacity and the capability of Afghans. And so working with our commanders, we came up with a new strategy, and we ordered additional forces to get the job done. This is still a tough fight. But thanks to the incredible services and sacrifices of our troops, we pushed the Taliban back, we're training Afghan forces, we've begun the transition to Afghan lead. <p>Again, there are those who argued against a timeline for ending this war&mdash;or against talking about it publicly. But you know what, that's not a plan for America's security either. After 10 years of war, and given the progress we've made, I felt it was important that the American people&mdash;and our men and women in uniform&mdash;know our plan to end this war responsibly. And so by the end of this summer, more than 30,000 of our troops will have come home. Next year, Afghans will take the lead for their own security. In 2014, the transition will be complete. And even as our troops come home, we'll have a strong partnership with the Afghan people, and we will stay vigilant so Afghanistan is never again a source for attacks against America. <p>We're not just ending these wars, we're doing it in a way that achieves our objectives. Moreover, it's allowed us to broaden our vision and begin a new era of American leadership. We're leading from Europe to the Asia-Pacific, with alliances that have never been stronger. We're leading the fight against nuclear dangers. We've applied the strongest sanctions ever on Iran and North Korea, nations that cannot be allowed to threaten the world with nuclear weapons. We're leading on behalf of freedom: standing with people in the Middle East and North Africa as they demand their rights, protecting the Libyan people as they rid the world of Muammar Qadhafi. <p>Today, we're also working for a transition so the Syrian people can have a better future, free of the Asad regime. And given the regime's stockpiles of chemical weapons, we will continue to make it clear to Asad and those around him that the world is watching and that they will be held accountable by the international community and the United States should they make the tragic mistake of using those weapons. And we will continue to work with our friends and our allies and the Syrian opposition on behalf of the day when the Syrian people have a government that respects their basic rights to live in peace and freedom and dignity. <p>Because we're leading around the world, people have a new attitude toward America. There's more confidence in our leadership. We see it everywhere we go. We saw it as grateful Libyans waved American flags. We see it across the globe. When people are asked, \\"Which country do you admire the most?\\" one nation comes out on top: the United States of America. <p>So this is the progress that we've made. Thanks to the extraordinary service of our men and women in uniform, we're winding down a decade of war, we're destroying the terrorist network that attacked us, we're strengthening the alliances that extend our values. And today, every American can be proud that the United States is safer and stronger and more respected in the world. <p>And all this allows us to fulfill another promise that I made to you 4 years ago: strengthening our military. After 10 years of operations, our soldiers will now have fewer and shorter deployments, which means more time on the home front to keep their families strong, more time to heal from the wounds of war, more time to improve readiness and prepare for future threats. <p>As President, I've continued to make historic investments to keep our Armed Forces strong. And guided by our new defense strategy, we will maintain our military superiority. It will be second to none as long as I am President and well into the future. We've got the best trained, best led, best equipped military in history. And as Commander in Chief, I am going to keep it that way. <p>And by the way, given all the rhetoric lately&mdash;it is political season&mdash;let's also set the record straight on the budget. Those big, across-the-board cuts, including defense, that Congress said would occur next year if they couldn't reach a deal to reduce the deficit? Let's understand, first of all, there's no reason that should happen, because people in Congress ought to be able to come together and agree on a plan, a balanced approach that reduces the deficit and keeps our military strong. It should be done. <p>And there are a number of Republicans in Congress who don't want you to know that most of them voted for these cuts. Now they're trying to wriggle out of what they agreed to. Instead of making tough choices to reduce the deficit, they'd rather protect tax cuts for some of the wealthiest Americans, even if it risks big cuts in our military. And I've got to tell you, VFW, I disagree. If the choice is between tax cuts that the wealthiest Americans don't need and funding our troops that they definitely need to keep our country strong, I will stand with our troops every single time. <p>So let's stop playing politics with our military. Let's get serious and reduce our deficit and keep our military strong. Let's take some of the money that we're saving because we're not fighting in Iraq and because we're winding down in Afghanistan, use half that money to pay down our deficit; let's use half of it to do some nation-building here in the United States of America. <p>Let's keep taking care of our extraordinary military families. For the first time ever, we've made military families and veterans a top priority not just at DOD, not just at the VA, but across the Government. As Richard mentioned, this has been a mission for my wife Michelle and Vice President Joe Biden's wife, Dr. Jill Biden. Today, more people across America in every segment of society are joining forces to give our military families the respect and the support that they deserve. <p>And there's another way we can honor those who serve. It may no longer be a crime for con artists to pass themselves off as heroes, but one thing is certain: It is contemptible. So this week we will launch a new web site, a living memorial, so the American people can see who's been awarded our Nation's highest honors. Because no American hero should ever have their valor stolen. <p>This leads me to another promise I made 4 years ago: upholding America's sacred trust with our veterans. I promised to strengthen the VA, and that promise has been kept. In my first year, we achieved the largest percentage increase in the VA budget in 30 years. And we're going to keep making historic investments in our veterans. When Richard came to the Oval Office, we talked about what those automatic budget cuts&mdash;sequestration&mdash;could mean for the VA. So my administration has made it clear: Your veterans' benefits are exempt from sequestration. They are exempt. And because advance appropriations is now the law of the land, veterans' health care is protected from the budget battles in Washington. <p>I promised you that I'd stand up for veterans' health care. As long as I'm President, I will not allow VA health care to be turned into a voucher system, subject to the whims of the insurance market. Some have argued for this plan. I could not disagree more. You don't need vouchers, you need the VA health care that you have earned and that you depend on. <p>So we've made dramatic investments to help care for our veterans. For our Vietnam veterans, we declared that more illnesses are now presumed connected to your exposure to agent orange. And as a result of our edecision, Vietnam-era vets and your families received nearly $4 billion in disability pay. You needed it, you fought for it, we heard you, and we got it done. <p>We've added mobile clinics for our rural veterans, more tailored care for our women veterans, unprecedented support for veterans with traumatic brain injury. All told, we've made VA health care available to nearly 800,000 veterans who didn't have it before. And we're now supporting caregivers and families with the skills and the stipends to help care for the veterans that they love. <p>Of course, more eveterans in the system means more claims. So we've hired thousands of claims processors. We're investing in paperless systems. To their credit, the dedicated folks at the VA are now completing 1 million claims a year. But there's been a tidal wave of new claims, and when I hear about veterans waiting months or years for your benefits, it is unacceptable. And we are doing something about it. <p>We're taking all those folks who processed your agent orange claims&mdash;more than 1,200 experts&mdash;and giving them a new mission: Attack the backlog. We're prioritizing veterans with the most serious disabilities. And the VA and DOD will work harder towards a seamless transition so new veterans aren't just piled on to the backlog. And we will not rest, I will not be satisfied until we get this right. And today I'm also calling on all those who help our vets complete their claims&mdash;State VAs, physicians, and veteran groups like the VFW&mdash;to join us. You know how this can work better, so let's get it done together. <p>We're also focused on the urgent needs of our veterans with PTSD. We've poured tremendous resources into this fight: thousands of more counselors and more clinicians, more care and more treatment. And we've made it easier for veterans with PTSD to qualify for VA benefits. But after a decade of war, it's now an epidemic. We're losing more troops to suicide&mdash;one every single day&mdash;than we are in combat. According to some estimates, about 18 veterans are taking their lives each day, more every year than all the troops killed in Iraq and Afghanistan combined. That's a tragedy. It's heartbreaking. It should not be happening in the United States of America. <p>So when I hear about servicemembers and veterans who had the courage to seek help but didn't get it, who died waiting, that's an outrage. And I've told Secretary Panetta, Chairman Dempsey, and Secretary Shinseki we've got to do better. This has to be all hands on deck. <p>So our message to everyone who's ever worn the uniform&mdash;if you're hurting, it's not a sign of weakness to seek help, it's a sign of strength. And when you do, we'll be there and do more to help, including more counselors and clinicians to help you heal. We need to end this tragedy, VFW. And we're going to work together to make it happen. <p>So too with our campaign to end homelessness among our veterans. We've now helped to bring tens of thousands of veterans off the streets and into permanent housing. This has to be a core mission, because every veteran who has fought for America ought to have a home in America. <p>And this brings me to the last promise I want to discuss with you. Four years ago, I said that I'd do everything I could to help our veterans realize the American Dream, to enlist you in building a stronger America. After all, our veterans have the skills that America needs. So today, our economy is growing and creating jobs, but it's still too hard for too many folks to find work, especially our younger veterans, our veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. And with a million more troops rejoining civilian life in the years ahead&mdash;and looking for work&mdash;we've got to step up our game, at every stage of their careers. <p>So today I'm announcing a major overhaul of our Transition Assistance Program. We're going to set up a kind of \\"reverse boot camp\\" for our departing servicemembers. Starting this year, they'll get more personalized assistance as they plan their careers. We'll provide the training they need to find that job or pursue that education or start that business. And just as they've maintained their military readiness, we'll have new standards of \\"career readiness.\\" <p>In addition, by making the post-9/11 GI bill a priority, we've helped more than 800,000 veterans and their families pursue their education. And I've issued an Executive order to help put a stop to schools that are ripping off our veterans. <p>I've directed the Federal Government to step up on jobs. Since I took office, we've hired more than 200,000 veterans into the Federal Government. We made it a priority. And we're keeping track, every agency, every department: What are you doing for our veterans? <p>I've challenged community health centers to hire thousands of veterans as physicians and nurses. And as we help local communities hire new police officers and firefighters and first-responders, we're giving a preference to veterans. <p>We're also fighting to get more vets hired in the private sector. With new tools like our online Veterans Jobs Bank, we're connecting veterans directly to jobs. We're helping thousands of veterans get certified for good-paying jobs in manufacturing. We succeeded in passing tax credits for businesses that hire our veterans and our wounded warriors. And this morning I signed into law the Veteran Skills to Jobs Act, making it easier for veterans to transfer their outstanding military skills into the licenses and credentials they need to get civilian jobs. <p>If you are a young man that is in charge of a platoon or millions of dollars of equipment and are taking responsibility or you're a medic out in the field who is saving lives every single day, when you come home, you need to be credentialed and certified quickly so you can get on the job. People should understand how skilled you are. And there shouldn't be bureaucrats or runarounds. We got to put those folks to work. <p>Last summer, I also challenged the private sector to hire or train a hundred thousand veterans or their spouses. Michelle and Jill Biden have been leading the effort through Joining Forces. And so far, thousands of patriotic businesses have hired or trained more than 90,000 veterans and spouses. And our message to companies is simple: If you want somebody who gets the job done, then hire a vet. Hire a vet. Hire a vet and they will make you proud just like they've made America proud. <p>And we're fighting for veterans who want to start their own businesses, including more training in entrepreneurship. It's one of the reasons we've cut taxes 18 times for small businesses, including veteran-owned businesses. And the effects ripple out, because vets are more likely to hire vets. <p>So today, we can point to progress. More veterans are finding jobs; the unemployment rate for veterans has come down. Yes, it's still too high, but it's coming down. And now we've got to sustain that momentum. It's one of the reasons I've proposed to Congress a veterans jobs corps to put our veterans back to work protecting and rebuilding America. And today I am again calling on Congress: Pass this veterans jobs corps and extend the tax credits for businesses that hire veterans so we can give these American heroes the jobs and opportunities that they deserve. <p>So, VFW, these are the promises that I made. These are the promises that I've kept. Where we still have more to do, we will not rest. That's my vow to you. I've got your back. I've got your six. Because we have a solemn obligation to all who serve, not just for the years you're in uniform, but for all the decades that follow, and because even though today's wars are ending, the hard work of taking care of our newest veterans has only just begun. <p>Just as you protected America, we're going to pass our country to the next generation stronger and safer and more respected in the world. So if anyone tries to tell you that our greatness has passed, that America is in decline, you tell them this: Just like the 20th century, the 21st century is going to be another great American century. For we are Americans, blessed with the greatest form of government ever devised by man, a democracy dedicated to freedom and committed to the ideals that still light the world. We will never apologize for our way of life; we will never waver in its defense. <p>We are a nation that freed millions and turned adversaries into allies. We are the Americans who defended the peace and turned back aggression. We are Americans who welcome our global responsibilities and our global leadership. The United States has been, and will remain, the one indispensable nation in world affairs. <p>And you, you are the soldiers, the sailors, the airmen, the marines and the coastguardsmen who have kept us strong. We will honor your legacy. And we will ensure that the military you served and the America that we love remains the greatest force for freedom that the world has ever known. <p>God bless you, God bless all of our veterans, and God bless the United States of America.\" "
"174" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Urban League! Thank you. It is good to be with the Urban League. And it's good to be in the Big Easy. <p>Now, I don't know if the fact that this is called the Morial Convention Center had anything to do with folks coming down to New Orleans&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but it is good to be with all of you. And I'm glad I caught you at the beginning of the conference, before Bourbon Street has a chance to take a toll on you. [<i>Laughter</i>] All right. You all stay out of trouble now. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Everybody, please have a seat. Have a seat, have a seat. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Four more years! <p><i>The President.</i> A couple of people that I want to acknowledge. Obviously, first of all, I want to acknowledge your outstanding president and CEO who has shown such extraordinary leadership for so many years, Marc Morial. Just like we've got an outstanding former mayor of New Orleans, we've also got the outstanding current mayor of New Orleans: Mitch Landrieu is in the house. Fine young Congressman from this area, Cedric Richmond is here. And one of the best mayors in the country, we're glad he came down from his hometown of Philadelphia, Mayor Michael Nutter is in the house. <p>And all of you are here, and I am grateful for it. And we love the young people who are in the house. Mitch, don't you&mdash;I wasn't referring to you, man, I was talking to those folks over there. [<i>Laughter</i>] Mitch is all waving, \\"thank you.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>For nearly a century, the National Urban League has been inspiring people of every race and every religion and every walk of life to reach for the dream that lies at the heart of our founding: the promise that no matter who you are, no matter what you look like, no matter where you come from, no matter how modest your beginnings, no matter what the circumstances of your birth, here in America, you can make it if you try. <p>Of course, this dream has never come easy. That's why the Urban League was formed. In the aftermath of the Civil War, with the South in the grips of Jim Crow, the waves of men and women who traveled north to urban centers discovered that even in their new homes, opportunity was not guaranteed. It was something you had to work for, something you had to fight for, not just on your own, but side by side with people who believed in that same dream. <p>And so the White widow of a railroad tycoon and a Black social worker from Arkansas founded what would become the Urban League, to strengthen our cities and our communities brick by brick and block by block and neighborhood by neighborhood, life by life. <p>Decades later, I arrived in one of those cities: my hometown of Chicago. [<i>Applause</i>] South Side! And I was driven by this same cause. Like many of my classmates, I felt, I understood, the pull of a hefty paycheck that might come from a more conventional job. But ultimately, the pull to serve was even stronger. <p>So I moved to the South Side of Chicago, and I took a job with a group of churches, mostly Catholic parishes, working to help families who had no place to turn when the local steel plants shut down, and when panic-peddling had led to enormous turnover in these communities. And we worked with laypeople and local leaders to rebuild neighborhoods and improve schools and, most of all, to broaden opportunity for young people, too many who were at risk. <p>And I confess that progress didn't come quickly and it did not come easily. Sometimes, it didn't come at all. There were times where I thought about giving up and moving on. But what kept me going, day in and day out, was the same thing that has sustained the Urban League all these years, the same thing that sustains all of you, and that is the belief that in America, change is always possible; that our Union may not be perfect, but it is perfectible; that we can strive over time through effort and sweat and blood and tears until it is the place we imagine. <p>It may come in fits and starts, at a pace that can be slow and frustrating. But if we are willing to push through all the doubt and the cynicism and the weariness, then, yes, we can form that more perfect Union. <p>Now, the people I worked with in those early days in Chicago, they were looking for the same thing that Americans everyplace aspire to. We're not a nation of people who are looking for handouts. We certainly don't like bailouts. [<i>Laughter</i>] We don't believe government should be in the business of helping people who refuse to help themselves, and we recognize not every government program works. But we do expect hard work to pay off. We do expect responsibility to be rewarded. We do expect that if you put in enough effort, you should be able to find a job that pays the bills. You should be able to own a home you call your own. You should be able to retire in dignity and respect. You should be able to afford the security of health care, and you should be able to give your kids the best education possible. <p>That idea that everybody should have a fair shot, not just some&mdash;that this country is special because it has grown this magnificent middle class and has provided ladders of access for those striving to get into the middle class&mdash;that's the idea that drove me. That's the idea that has driven the Urban League. That idea that everyone should have equal opportunity, that's what brought me to Chicago. That belief that this country works best when we are growing a strong middle class and prosperity is broad based, that's what led me into politics. And it is those values that have guided every decision that I have made as President of the United States. <p>Now, today, we're battling our way back from a once-in-a-lifetime economic crisis. And make no mistake, we've made progress in that fight. When I took office, we were losing hundreds of thousands of jobs a month. Our auto industry was on the brinks of collapse. Factories were boarding up their windows. We'd gone through almost a decade in which job growth had been sluggish, incomes had declined, costs were going up, all culminating in the financial system coming close to a breakdown. <p>Today, 3&frac12; years later, we've had 28 straight months of private sector job growth; 3&frac12; years later, the auto industry has come roaring back; 3&frac12; years later, companies are beginning to bring thousands of jobs back to American soil. <p>We still have much more work to do. There's still too many out of work, too many homes underwater, too many Americans struggling to stay afloat. So the greater challenge that faces us is not just going back to where we were back in 2007, not just settling to get back to where we were before the crisis hit. Our task is to return to an America that is thriving and growing out from our middle class, where hard work pays off, where you can make it if you try. <p>And, Urban League, I want you to know, what's holding us back from meeting these challenges is not a lack of ideas or solutions. I have no patience with people who say our best days are behind us, because the fact of the matter is we still have the best workers in the world, the best universities in the world, the best research facilities in the world, the most entrepreneurial culture in the world. We have all the ingredients to make the 21st century the American century just like the 20th. <p>What's holding us back is a stalemate in Washington between two fundamentally different views about which path we should take as a country. And it's up to the American people to decide what direction we should go. <p>Let me tell you what I believe. I believe that strong communities are places that attract the best jobs and the newest businesses. And you don't build that kind of community by giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas. You build it by giving tax breaks to companies that create jobs in Detroit and in Cleveland and in Chicago and right here in New Orleans, right here in America, using American workers, making American products that we sell around the world, stamped with three proud words: Made in America. <p>You build it by investing in America's manufacturing base and providing the dollars for research so that we have the most advanced products in the world. You do it by investing in small businesses, the way we've provided 18 tax breaks to small businesses since I've been in office. And if you're a company that wants to relocate in a community that's been particularly hard hit when a factory left town, I believe you should get help financing that new plant or equipment or training for your workers, because we can't leave anybody behind if we want to grow America the way it can grow. <p>We also believe that every entrepreneur should have the chance to start a business, no matter who you are, no matter what you look like. That's why we've supported financing and assistance and exporting to small businesses across the board. That's why we've helped African American businesses and minority-owned businesses and women-owned businesses gain access to more than $7 billion in contracts and financing that allowed them to grow and create jobs. <p>That's why we've emphasized helping our veterans create small businesses, because if they fought for us, they shouldn't have to fight to get financing when they get home. They shouldn't have to fight for a job when they come home. They shouldn't have to fight for a roof over their heads when they come home. We should honor them the way they've honored us with their service. <p>I believe strong communities are places where people can afford to buy what their local businesses sell. So I ran for President promising to cut taxes for the middle class, and regardless of what you hear during silly political season, I have kept that promise. Today, taxes are $3,600 lower for the typical family than they were when I came into office. <p>Just a few hours ago, the Senate moved forward a bill that we had promoted to keep middle class tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans next year. I will add that we didn't get a lot of Republican votes, but that's okay, they've got time. We passed it through the Senate, and now is the time for the House to do the same. They should not be holding middle class tax cuts hostage just to get more tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. At a time when so many people who have a job can barely keep up with their bills, we don't need another trillion-dollar tax cut for folks like me. We need tax cuts for working Americans, not for folks who don't need it and weren't even asking for it. <p>Millions of Americans&mdash;including more than 2 million African American families&mdash;are better off thanks to our extension of the child care tax credit and the earned-income tax credit, because nobody who works hard in America should be poor in America. That's how strong communities are built. And by the way when working folks have money in their pockets, businesses do well because they've got customers, and all of us grow. That's been the history of this country. <B> <p></B>I believe strong communities are built on strong schools. If this country is about anything, it's about passing on greater opportunity to the next generation. And we know that has to start before a child even walks into the classroom. It starts at home with parents who are willing to read to their children and spend time with their children and instill a sense of curiosity and love of learning and a belief in excellence that will last a lifetime. <p>But it also begins with an early childhood education, which is why we've invested more in child care, and in programs like Early Head Start and Head Start that help prepare our young people for success. It's the right thing to do for America. <p>Our education policy hasn't just been based on more money, we've also called for real reform. So we challenged every state in the country to raise their standards for teaching and for learning. And 3 years later, nearly every State has answered the call. We have seen the biggest transformation in terms of school reform in a generation, and we've helped some of the country's lowest performing schools make real gains in reading and math, including here in New Orleans. <p>We've made it our mission to make a higher education more affordable for every American who wants to go to school. That's why we fought to extend our college tuition tax credit for working families, saving millions of families thousands of dollars. <p>That's why we've fought to make college more affordable for an additional 200,000 African American students by increasing Pell grants. That's why we've strengthened this Nation's commitment to our community colleges and to our HBCUs. <p>That's why, tomorrow I'm establishing the first-ever White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African Americans, so that every child has greater access to a complete and competitive education from the time they're born all through the time they get a career. <p>And that's why we're pushing all colleges and universities to cut their costs, because we can't keep asking taxpayers to subsidize skyrocketing tuition. A higher education in the 21st century cannot be a luxury. It is a vital necessity that every American should be able to afford. I want all these young people to be getting a higher education, and I don't want them loaded up with tens of thousands of dollars of debt just to get an education. That's how we make America great. <p>Of course, that means all of you all have got to hit the books. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm just saying. Don't cheer, and then you didn't do your homework. [<i>Laughter</i>] Because that's part of the bargain, that's part of the bargain: America says we will give you opportunity, but you've got to earn your success. <p>You're competing against young people in Beijing and Bangalore. They're not hanging out. [<i>Laughter</i>] They're not getting over. They're not playing video games. They're not watching \\"Real Housewives.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm just saying. It's a two-way street. You've got to earn success. <p>That wasn't in my prepared remarks. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I'm just saying. <p>I believe strong communities are places where you and your family can work and save and buy your home. That's why we've helped more than a million responsible homeowners&mdash;these are folks who were making their payments&mdash;refinance their mortgages at these historically low rates, saving thousands of dollars every year. Because people who did everything right shouldn't pay the price for somebody else's irresponsibility. <p>So now we want to expand that refinancing opportunity to every homeowner who's making their payments on time. <p>And while we're at it, let's put construction workers back on the job, because they've been hit by the housing bubble bursting. Let's put them back on the job not only rebuilding roads and bridges and ports, but also rehabilitating homes in communities that have been hit by foreclosures, businesses that have been hit hardest by the housing crisis. That creates jobs. It raises property values, and it strengthens the economy of the entire nation. <p>Strong communities are healthy communities. Because we believe that in the richest nation on Earth, you shouldn't go broke when you get sick. And after a century of trying and a decision now from the highest court in the land, health care reform is here to stay. We're moving forward. <p>Insurance companies will no longer be able to discriminate against those who are sick. Prescription drug prices will be lower for our seniors. We're going to close that doughnut hole. Young people will be able to stay on their parent's insurance until they're 26 years old. Thirty million Americans without health insurance will finally know the security of affordable care. <p>We'll improve any aspect of this law&mdash;and any recommendations and suggestions that those who actually know the health care system and aren't just playing politics put forward. But we're going to implement this law and America is going to be better for it. <p>Now, I've got to say that I recognize we are in political season. But the Urban League understands that your mission transcends politics. Good jobs, quality schools, affordable health care, affordable housing&mdash;these are all the pillars upon which communities are built. And yet we've been reminded recently that all this matters little if these young people can't walk the streets of their neighborhood safely, if we can't send our kids to school without worrying they might get shot, if they can't go to the movies without fear of violence lurking in the shadows. <p>Our hearts break for the victims of the massacre in Aurora. We pray for those who were lost, and we pray for those who loved them. We pray for those who are recovering with courage and with hope. And we also pray for those who succumb to the less-publicized acts of violence that plague our communities in so many cities across the country every single day. We can't forget about that. <p>Every day&mdash;in fact, every day and a half, the number of young people we lose to violence is about the same as the number of people we lost in that movie theater. For every Columbine or Virginia Tech, there are dozens gunned down on the streets of Chicago and Atlanta, and here in New Orleans. For every Tucson or Aurora, there is daily heartbreak over young Americans shot in Milwaukee or Cleveland. Violence plagues the biggest cities, but it also plagues the smallest towns. It claims the lives of Americans of different ages and different races, and it's tied together by the fact that these young people had dreams and had futures that were cut tragically short. <p>And when there is an extraordinarily heartbreaking tragedy like the one we saw, there's always an outcry immediately after for action. And there's talk of new reforms, and there's talk of new legislation. And too often, those efforts are defeated by politics and by lobbying and eventually by the pull of our collective attention elsewhere. <p>But what I said in the wake of Tucson was we were going to stay on this persistently. So we've been able to take some actions on our own, recognizing that it's not always easy to get things through Congress these days. The background checks conducted on those looking to purchase firearms are now more thorough and more complete. Instead of just throwing more money at the problem of violence, the Federal Government is now in the trenches with communities and schools and law enforcement and faith-based institutions, with outstanding mayors like Mayor Nutter and Mayor Landrieu, recognizing that we are stronger when we work together. <p>So in cities like New Orleans, we're partnering with local officials to reduce crime, using best practices. And in places like Boston and Chicago, we've been able to help connect more young people to summer jobs so that they spend less time on the streets. In cities like Detroit and Salinas, we're helping communities set up youth prevention and intervention programs that steer young people away from a life of gang violence and towards the safety and promise of a classroom. <p>But even though we've taken these actions, they're not enough. Other steps to reduce violence have been met with opposition in Congress. This has been true for some time, particularly when it touches on the issues of guns. And I, like most Americans, believe that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual the right to bear arms. And we recognize the traditions of gun ownership that passed on from generation to generation, that hunting and shooting are part of a cherished national heritage. <p>But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals, that they belong on the battlefield of war, not on the streets of our cities. I believe the majority of gun owners would agree that we should do everything possible to prevent criminals and fugitives from purchasing weapons, that we should check someone's criminal record before they can check out a gun seller, that a mentally unbalanced individual should not be able to get his hands on a gun so easily. These steps shouldn't be controversial. They should be common sense. <p>So I'm going to continue to work with members of both parties, and with religious groups and with civic organizations, to arrive at a consensus around violence reduction, not just of gun violence, but violence at every level, on every step, looking at everything we can do to reduce violence and keep our children safe, from improving mental health services for troubled youth to instituting more effective community policing strategies. We should leave no stone unturned and recognize that we have no greater mission as a country than keeping our young people safe. <p>And as we do so, as we convene these conversations, let's be clear: Even as we debate government's role, we have to understand that when a child opens fire on another child, there's a hole in that child's heart that government alone can't fill. It's got to be up to us, as parents and as neighbors and as teachers and as mentors, to make sure our young people don't have that void inside them. <p>It's up to us to spend more time with them, to pay more attention to them, to show them more love so that they learn to love themselves, so that they learn to love one another, so that they grow up knowing what it is to walk a mile in somebody else's shoes and to view the world through somebody else's eyes. It's up to us to provide the path toward a life worth living, toward a future that holds greater possibility than taking offense because somebody stepped on your sneakers. <p>That's the difference that we can make in our children's lives and in the lives of our communities. That's the legacy we must leave for the next generation. <p>Now, this will not be easy. Even though it's called the Big Easy, this proud city and those who call it home, they know something about hardship. They've been battered again and again in this new century: one of the worst natural disasters in our history, the worst environmental disaster in our history, the worst economic crisis most of us have ever known. So sometimes being from the Big Easy means knowing hardship and heartbreak. <p>But what this city also knows is resilience and determination and heroism. That's one of the reasons it is one of America's jewels. It's quintessentially American because of its resilience. <p>There is no shortage of citizens in this city who's stepped up in the darkest of times. And one person I want to end with is somebody that many of you know, the superintendent of schools in St. Bernard's Parish, Doris Voitier. Now, when Katrina's waters rose, Doris and the faculty and staff of Chalmette High School saved the lives of hundreds of their neighbors, many of them old and sick, by moving them to shelter in the school's second floor. <p>Two days later, they led 1,200 people to safety. The day after that, with her community in ruins, the superintendent was on her way to Baton Rouge to make sure her schools would open that fall. \\"Failure is not an option\\" became her motto. When some government officials gave her the runaround, she plowed ahead on her own: secured loans, finding portable classrooms and books, and doing everything it took to make sure her kids&mdash;our kids&mdash;could return to some semblance of normalcy. <p>When an official told her a gas line wouldn't be repaired in time for school to reopen and that her kids might have to eat MREs, she hired a local restaurant owner to cook hot lunches on a barge and sent FEMA the bill. On the first day of school, less than three months after Katrina swept ashore, she heard a young child, who'd endured nearly 3 months of suffering and hardship, yell out loud: \\"Real food! Real food!\\" <p>Of that first night, she said: \\"There were no riots; there were no disruptions; there were just hundreds of people just like you and the person sitting next to you, in the blink of an eye, having lost everything they had worked for over their entire lifetimes, who now looked to us for rescue. And we accepted that responsibility because that's what school people do.\\" <p>Now, obviously, the superintendent is an exceptional educator and an exceptional citizen. But as I've traveled around the country, what I've discovered is that's not just what school people do. That's not&mdash;that's what Americans do. That's what Americans, at their best, do. When I traveled to Joplin, Missouri, that's what folks in Joplin do. When I go to Aurora, that's what people in Colorado do. In urban communities all across America, that's what you do. <p>For more than two centuries, our journey has never been easy, and our victories have never come quickly. And we have faced our share of struggles and setbacks and climbs that have seemed too steep, just like we do today. But we know what we're fighting for. We can see the America we believe in: a country where everybody gets a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share, where everybody is playing by the same set of rules. And if we don't keep fighting as hard as we know how for that America, if we don't keep fighting for better jobs and better schools and a better future, who will? <p>That's our challenge. We don't quit. Folks in New Orleans didn't quit. Americans don't quit. We accept responsibility. We keep on going. We keep marching. We keep moving forward. Failure is not an option. This is not a time for cynics. It is not a time for doubters. It is time for believers. It is time for folks who have faith in the future. <p>I still believe in you. And if you still believe in me, I ask you to stand with me, march with me, fight with me. And as I do, I promise we will finish what we started, turn this economy around, seize our future, and remind the world why the United States of America is the greatest nation on Earth. <p>Thank you, Urban League. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"175" "\"Hello, everybody. Hope you guys are all staying cool. Well, listen, I just wanted to welcome these outstanding leaders to the Oval Office. I want to in particular acknowledge Congressman Howard Berman and Senator Barbara Boxer, who have done outstanding work in shepherding through this bipartisan piece of legislation that underscores our unshakeable commitment to Israel. <p>As many of you know, I have made it a top priority for my administration to deepen cooperation with Israel across the whole spectrum of security issues: intelligence, military, technology. And in many ways, what this legislation does is bring together all the outstanding cooperation that we have seen, really, at an unprecedented level, between our two countries that underscore our unshakeable commitment to Israel's security. <p>I'm also very pleased that this week we are going to be able to announce $70 million in additional spending&mdash;$70 billion [<i>million</i>],* excuse me, in additional spending for Iron Dome. This is a program that has been critical in terms of providing security and safety for Israeli families. It is a program that has been tested and has prevented missile strikes inside of Israel. And it is testimony to the leadership of the folks sitting here that we're going to be able to lock in that funding to assure that that program continues and that we are standing by our friends in Israel when it comes to these kinds of attacks. <p>Let me just close by saying that the tragic events that we saw in Bulgaria emphasize the degree to which this continues to be a challenge not just for Israel, but for the entire world&mdash;preventing terrorist attacks and making sure that the people of Israel are not targeted. <p>And I hope that, as I sign as this bill, once again, everybody understands how committed all of us are, Republicans and Democrats, as Americans, to our friends in making sure that Israel is safe and secure. <p>And Leon Panetta, our Secretary of Defense, will be traveling to Israel to further consult and find additional ways that we can ensure such cooperation at a time when, quite frankly, the region is experiencing heightened tensions. <p>So with that, let me sign this bill. Again, I want to thank all who are standing beside me for their outstanding leadership and their outstanding work on this issue. Okay. <p>[<i>At this point, the President signed the bill.</i>] <p>Let me make sure I'm using enough pens, and everybody gets one. [<i>Laughter</i>] There you go. Thank you.\" "
"176" "\"This week, the Senate passed a plan that I proposed a few weeks ago to protect middle class Americans and virtually every small-business owner from getting hit with a big tax hike next year, a tax hike of $2,200 for the typical family. <p>Now it comes down to this: If 218 Members of the House vote the right way, 98 percent of American families and 97 percent of small-business owners will have the certainty of knowing that that their income taxes will not go up next year. That certainty means something to a middle class family who's already stretched the budget as far as it can go. It means something to a small-business owner who's trying to plan ahead. That's security at a time when folks could use some security. <p>And here's the thing: Everyone in Washington says they agree on this. Everyone says they agree that we should extend the tax cuts for the middle class. When Democrats and Republicans agree on something, it should be pretty easy to get it done. But right now that's not the case. Instead of doing what's right for middle class families and small-business owners, Republicans in Congress are holding these tax cuts hostage until we extend tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. <p>You see, Republicans in Congress and their nominee for President believe that the best way to create prosperity in America is to let it trickle down from the top. They believe that if our country spends trillions more on tax cuts for the wealthy, we'll somehow create jobs, even if we have to pay for it by gutting things like education and training and by raising middle class taxes. <p>They're wrong, and I know they're wrong because we already tried it that way for most of the last decade. It didn't work. We're still paying for trillions of dollars of tax cuts that benefited the wealthiest Americans more than anyone else, tax cuts that didn't lead to the middle class jobs or higher wages we were promised and that helped take us from record surpluses to record deficits. We can't afford more top-down economics. <p>What we need are policies that will grow and strengthen the middle class, that will help create jobs, make education and training more affordable, and encourage businesses to start up and stay right here in the United States. That's why I've cut middle class taxes every year that I've been President, by $3,600 for the typical family, that's why I've cut taxes for small businesses 18 times, and that's why I'm calling on 218 Members of the House to do their jobs and not raise taxes on the middle class. <p>As soon as they pass that bill, I'll sign it right away. And in the meantime, I'm going to keep fighting for an economy where we're not just putting folks back to work, but making sure that work pays off, an economy where every American&mdash;no matter who you are, what you look like, or where you come from&mdash;can have the confidence that if you work hard, you can get ahead. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"177" "\"Well, thank you, Lisa. And thanks, Elisa, for inviting me to speak today. And Michelle says hi. I know that at some point she'll have a chance to be with all of you. And I just want to congratulate everybody on what I hear is your biggest conference yet. <p>Even though I couldn't be with you in person, I wanted to say thank you. Because like every father, I think about the role models that are out there for my daughters, and I worry about what they'll run into online, honestly, so the fact that Sasha and Malia can go to places like BlogHer and find thousands of women who are writing about subjects from health to family and food and politics and careers, it means a lot to me and it means a lot to Michelle. <p>Now, some of you may have heard, there's an election coming up. And women's issues are front and center, as they should be. But I think the conversation has been oversimplified a little bit. I bet anyone who spends a little time at your conference would realize pretty fast that women are not a monolithic bloc, you're not an interest group. You make up more than half of our country and nearly half of our workforce, not to mention 80 percent of my household, if you count my mother-in-law. <p>So for me, any discussion of the issues women face begins with my own life story and the women in my own life. There was my mom, who was a single mother who put herself through school and made sure my sister and I earned our educations, too. There was my grandmother, who worked her way up from a secretary to vice president at her local bank, even though she hit a glass ceiling and watched men she once trained pass her by. <p>When Michelle and I got married and had our girls, we were giving it our all to balance raising a family and pursuing our careers, and we wished we had a machine that would let us be two places at one time. And of course, as a father, the highlight of my day is asking my girls about their days. <p>So when I think about what's been most important in my life, it's these amazing relationships that I've had with my mother and grandmother, my wife and my daughters. And what drives me when I step into the Oval Office, every decision that I make, is making sure that all of our daughters&mdash;just like all of our sons&mdash;are growing up in a country that gives them the chance to be anything they set their minds to and a country where more doors are open to them than were open to the previous generation. <p>That's why the first bill I signed was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, to help protect your right to equal pay for equal work. Now I want to strengthen those protections. And that's why we've extended more loans to women-owned businesses. That's why we've cut taxes for small-business owners 18 times. <p>I also want to keep small-business taxes low in the future. That's why we've enacted education reform that's helped more than 2.3 million more young women afford to pursue higher education. And now I want to make sure even more can afford to go. <p>And because of the new health care reform law, Obamacare&mdash;I happily accept the term&mdash;millions of young women are going to have coverage through their parent's plans. Children with preexisting conditions can't be denied insurance. Tens of millions of women with private insurance now have access to preventive care like mammograms and are beginning to gain access to contraception at no additional cost. And pretty soon, insurance companies will no longer be able to deny you coverage because of preexisting conditions like cancer or pregnancy or charge you higher premiums just for being a woman. I'm not going to give any ground to those who would deny women their own health care choices. <p>Behind every one of these policies is a pretty simple idea: You&mdash;women&mdash;should have control over the decisions that affect your health, your lives, your careers. And if you share that belief, then I think you'll agree that the choice women face right now in this election could not be bigger. On the one hand, you have folks who plan to turn back the clock. They promise to take away access to health care and contraception. They talk about getting rid of vital services like Planned Parenthood. They're planning to spend trillions of dollars on new tax cuts weighed towards millionaires and billionaires. <p>And just yesterday an independent, nonpartisan organization ran the numbers. They found that in order for my opponent to pay for his tax plan he'd have to cut tax breaks that middle class families depend on to pay for your home or your health care or to send your kids to college, which means the average middle class family with children would be hit with a tax increase of more than $2,000. <p>On top of that tax increase, my opponent plans to also gut education programs that help low-income mothers, student aid that disproportionately benefits young women. <p>So this, overall, is what I consider a wrong approach. It's not how we're going to grow this economy. It's not how we're going to build the middle class. We can't afford to refight the battles of the past few years or the past century, for that matter. <p>And that's why my plan would move us forward, by cutting taxes for the middle class, investing in education, protecting equal pay, and making sure your health care is there for you when you need it. And I pay for my plan by asking people like me to go back to the same tax rates we paid during the Clinton years. <p>So that's the choice we face as a country. And even though we're dealing with some big challenges right now, I've never been more confident that the ability to solve our problems is entirely within our grasp. If we choose the right path, I'm absolutely confident we're going to restore the sense of economic security that ought to be at the center of American life. <p>We'll create an economy that works for everybody. We'll open up new doors of opportunity for our daughters as well as our sons. We'll build our middle class. We'll grow this economy not from the top down, but from the middle out and from the bottom up. And that's not just good for women, that's good for all of us. <p>So thank you so much for the opportunity. We appreciate you. Michelle says hi. The girls say hi. Bo does too. I hope you guys have a wonderful conference that remains. <p>Bye-bye.\" "
"178" "\"Thank you, everybody. Good morning. Thank you. Thank you so much. Everybody, please have a seat, have a seat. Well, it is great to see all of you, and I hope you guys are having a wonderful summer. <p>I am joined here today by moms and dads, husbands and wives, middle class Americans who work hard every single day to provide for their families. And like most Americans, they work hard and they don't ask for much. They do expect, however, that their hard work is going to pay off. They want to know that if they put in enough effort, if they are acting responsibly, then they can afford to pay the bills, that they can afford to own a home that they call their own, that they can afford to secure their retirement, and most of all, that they can afford to give their kids greater opportunity, that their children and grandchildren can achieve things that they didn't even imagine. <p>Every single decision that I make is focused on giving them that chance, because if we want to keep moving this country forward, these are the folks who are going to get us there. <p>This morning we learned that our businesses created 172,000 new jobs in the month of July. That means that we've now created 4.5 million new jobs over the last 29 months and 1.1 million new jobs so far this year. Those are our neighbors and family members finding work and the security that comes with work. <p>But let's acknowledge, we've still got too many folks out there who are looking for work. We've got more work to do on their behalf, not only to reclaim all the jobs that were lost during the recession, but also to reclaim the kind of financial security that too many Americans have felt was slipping away from them for too long. <p>And we knew when I started in this job that this was going to take some time. We haven't had to come back from an economic crisis this deep or this painful since the 1930s. But we also knew that if we were persistent&mdash;if we kept at it and kept working&mdash;that we'd gradually get to where we need to be. <p>Here's the thing: We are not going to get there&mdash;we're not going to get to where we need to be&mdash;if we go back to the policies that helped to create this mess in the first place. And the last thing that we should be doing is asking middle class families who are still struggling to recover from this recession to pay more in taxes. <p>Rebuilding a strong economy begins with rebuilding our middle class. And what we should do right now is give middle class families and small-business owners a guarantee that their taxes will not go up next year. When families have the security of knowing that their taxes won't go up, they're more likely to spend and more likely to grow the economy. When small- business owners have certainty on taxes and can plan ahead, they're more likely to hire and create new jobs. And that benefits all of us. <p>And that's why, last week, I was pleasantly surprised&mdash;I was glad&mdash;to see the Senate come together and extend tax cuts on the first $250,000 of every family's income. That means 98 percent of Americans won't see their income taxes go up next year. That means that 97 percent of small businesses wouldn't see their income taxes go up next year, not a single dime. That would be important. <p>And that's why it's so disappointing that, so far at least, House Republicans have refused to follow the Senate's example and do the same thing. On Wednesday, they voted to hold these middle class tax cuts hostage, unless we also spend a trillion dollars over the next decade on tax breaks for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. In fact, it's a little worse than that because their plan would actually raise taxes on 25 million hard-working American families by about a thousand dollars each. <p>So at a time when too many working families are already struggling to make ends meet, they want to give millionaires and billionaires and folks like me tax cuts that we don't need and that the country can't afford, even if middle class families have to pick up the tab for it. Those are their priorities. <p>And this week, we learned that there are some in the Republican Party who don't want to stop there. An independent, nonpartisan study found that one plan, at least, would give more tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires, and they'd pay for those tax cuts by raising taxes on the middle class: an average tax hike of more than $2,000 for families with children. <p>Now, I just think we've got our priorities skewed if the notion is that we give tax breaks to folks who don't need them and to help pay for that, we tax folks who are already struggling to get by. That's not how you grow an economy. You grow an economy from the middle out and from the bottom up. And the kind of approach that the House Republicans are talking about is bad for our families and it's bad for our economy. <p>The people standing behind me should not have to pay more just so the wealthiest Americans can pay less. That's not just top-down economics, that's upside-down economics. <p>Instead of the middle class paying more, we should ask the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more, a modest amount, so that we can reduce our deficit and still make investments in things like education that help our economy grow. <p>And keep in mind, we're talking about folks like me going back to the tax rates that existed under Bill Clinton. If you remember, that was when we created 23 million new jobs, we went from deficits to surplus, and folks at the top did well too, because when middle class families have money in their pockets, they go out and buy that new car or that new appliance or the new computer for their kids, or they go out to a restaurant, or, heaven forbid, they take a vacation once in a while. And that money goes back into the economy, and businesses do well because they've got more customers. <p>And here's the thing, there are a lot of well-to-do Americans, patriotic Americans, who understand this and are willing to do the right thing&mdash;willing to do their part&mdash;to make this country strong. <p>So for those of you who are keeping score at home, here's where we stand: We might have a whole bunch of disagreements with folks in the other party on whether it's a good idea to spend more money giving tax breaks to millionaires or billionaires. And frankly, that issue is probably not going to be resolved until after November. In the meantime, though, we say we all agree on extending tax cuts for middle class families. The House says its&mdash;agrees. The Senate has already shown that it agrees. And I certainly agree. So let's at least work on what we agree on. <p>Let's keep taxes low for 98 percent of Americans, and we can argue about the other 2 percent. Let's keep taxes low for the 97 percent of small-business owners, and we can argue about the other 3 percent. If Congress sends me a clean bill extending the tax cuts on the first $250,000 of every family's income, I will sign it right away, and&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;I will sign it right away. <p>There's no reason to wait. There's no reason to make families and small businesses anxious just so one party can score political points. Let's go ahead and give them that guarantee now that their taxes won't go up next year. <p>And keep in mind&mdash;just one last point I want to make&mdash;we're saying nobody's income taxes go up on the first $250,000 of their income. So even somebody who makes more than 250 is still getting a tax break on their first 250. You understand? Even somebody who's worth $200 million, on that first 250, they're still paying lower taxes. <p>It's the right thing to do. It's the smart thing to do. It'd be good for the economy, and most importantly, it'd be good for your families. <p>So we're going to have plenty to argue about in the next 3 months and probably in the next 5 years. [<i>Laughter</i>] This shouldn't be one of those things we argue about. <p>Let's do what the American people sent us here to do. Let's work on those things we can agree on; let's make progress; let's do right by the people behind me and the millions of Americans that they represent. I'm going to be fighting every single day to make sure that you have opportunity. I expect and I hope that Congress will do the same. <p>So thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless America. And have a great weekend.\" "
"179" "\"Hi, everybody. Today I want to take a break from the back and forth of campaign season and talk about something that's brought us all together this week: the Summer Olympics. <p>These games remind us that for all our differences, we're Americans first. And we could not be prouder of the men and women representing our country in London in both the Olympics and in the Paralympics. <p>Last weekend, Michelle led the American delegation to London and reaffirmed the special relationship we share with our strongest ally, Great Britain. She met with the Queen and with Prime Minister Cameron's wife Samantha. She spent some time thanking our brave servicemembers and military families. And of course, she took in as many events as she could to cheer on our athletes. <p>Now, I've got to admit, I was a little jealous that she got to go. But like many of you, I caught as many events as I could, jumping off the couch for a close race or a perfect vault. I watched the wonderful young women of our gymnastics team recapture the team gold for America, and I was filled with pride watching Gabby Douglas win the all-around gold with incredible poise and grace. I watched our swimmers win a haul of medals and Michael Phelps become the most decorated Olympic athlete of all time. I saw our women's soccer team power through the competition. <p>And I'm just as proud of all our athletes in sports that don't always get as much attention. The U.S. women's eight continued its rowing dominance with another gold medal. Kayla Harrison won America's first-ever gold medal in judo, and Marti Malloy won a bronze. Kim Rhode became the first American to win individual medals in five straight Olympics with her gold in skeet shooting, and her teammate, Army Sergeant Vincent Hancock, won his second skeet gold. <p>I also thought of the truly difficult journeys that many of our athletes have made. Some have faced personal loss or beaten cancer. Some have worked long shifts at multiple jobs to feed their Olympic dream. And some have done the impossible. Less than 4 years ago, Bryshon Nellum was shot three times in his legs. But this week, he'll run the 400 meters. And as a boy, Lopez Lomong fled war and persecution and life as a refugee, one of the \\"lost boys\\" of Sudan. Today's he's an American and representing his country at the Olympics for the second time. <p>So it's no surprise America is vying for the top of the medal count. But it's not the medal count alone that inspires us; most of our athletes won't claim a medal at all. It's the character of the men and women who compete for those medals. It's their hard work and sacrifice: the countless hours in the gym, in the pool, on the track. It's their dogged perseverance and unyielding determination through disappointment and triumph alike. <p>It's that unconquerable spirit, that American spirit, that says even though we may have very different stories to tell, even though we may not all look alike or talk alike or be dealt the same hand in life, if we work hard, we can achieve our dreams. We can make it if we try. We are one people, with common values and ideals; we celebrate individual excellence, but recognize that only together can we accomplish great and important things we cannot accomplish alone. <p>That's why we watch. That's why we cheer. That's why we come together for 2 weeks in summer and swell with pride at the incredible things our fellow citizens can do. <p>And so to all our Olympic and Paralympic athletes, whether you've already competed or have yet to compete: Your country could not be prouder of you. Thank you for presenting the best of America to the rest of the world. And thank you for becoming new role models to our children, mine included, and inspiring them to believe that if they work hard and do their best, they can achieve great things too. <p>Go get them this week, Team U.S.A. We can't wait to welcome you home. <p>God bless you, and God bless America.\" "
"180" "\"<i>The President.</i> Well, I want to thank everybody who is here because they all did outstanding work in helping to get this legislation completed. <p>As you know, I think all Americans feel we have a moral, sacred duty towards our men and women in uniform. They protect our freedom, and it's our obligation to do right by them. This bill takes another important step in fulfilling that commitment. <p>I want to thank the Members of Congress who helped to make this happen. It is going to have immediate impact. It improves access to health care. It streamlines services in the VA. It expands support for veterans who are homeless. <p>There are two parts of the bill, though, that I especially want to highlight. First of all, this bill ends a decade-long struggle for those who serve at Camp Lejeune. Some of the veterans and their families who were based in Camp Lejeune in the years when the water was contaminated will now have access to expanded medical care. And, sadly, this act alone will not bring back those who've lost, including Janey Ensminger, but it will honor their memory by making a real difference for those who are still suffering. <p>The second part of this bill that I want to highlight prohibits protesting within 300 feet of military funerals during the 2 hours before and 2 hours after a service. I supported this step as a Senator. I am very pleased to be signing this bill into law. The graves of our veterans are hallowed ground. And obviously, we all defend our Constitution and the First Amendment and free speech, but we also believe that when men and women die in the service of their country and are laid to rest, it should be done with the utmost honor and respect. <p>So, I'm glad that Congress passed this bill and I hope that we can continue to do some more good bipartisan work in protecting our veterans. I've been advocating, for example, for a veterans job corps that could help provide additional opportunities for the men and women who are coming home as we're winding down our operations in Afghanistan and having ended the war in Iraq. And so this is a good sign of a bipartisan spirit that I'm sure is going to carry through all the way to election day and beyond. <p>With that, I'm going to sign the bill. Make sure I sign the right place, though. <p>[<i>At this point, the President signed the bill.</i>] <p>There you go. Congratulations, everybody. Good work. Thank you very much. <p><i>Shootings in Oak Creek, Wisconsin </i><p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, after the Wisconsin shooting, are you going to push for any further gun control measures? <p><i>The President.</i> Well, first of all, we're still awaiting the outcome of a full investigation. Yesterday I had the chance to speak to both the Governor and the mayor, as well as leaders of the Sikh community in Oak Creek. All of us are heartbroken by what's happened. And I offered the thoughts and prayers not only of myself and Michelle, but also for the country as a whole. <p>I think all of us recognize that these kinds of terrible, tragic events are happening with too much regularity for us not to do some soul searching and to examine additional ways that we can reduce violence. And as I've already said, I think there are a lot of elements involved in it, and what I want to do is to bring together law enforcement, community leaders, faith leaders, elected officials of every level to see how we can make continued progress. <p>We don't yet know fully what motivated this individual to carry out this terrible act. If it turns out, as some early reports indicate, that it may have been motivated in some way by the ethnicity of those who were attending the temple, I think the American people immediately recoil against those kinds of attitudes, and I think it will be very important for us to reaffirm, once again, that in this country, regardless of what we look like, where we come from, who we worship; we are all one people, and we look after one another, and we respect one another. <p>But as I said, the FBI is working with local officials, and they're still investigating what motivated this individual. And as we find out more, I suspect that not only the White House, but others in Congress and at the local level will have more to say. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"181" "\"Okay, good afternoon, everybody. I think all of you are aware that we are seeing devastating drought throughout the country. It is a historic drought, and it's having a profound impact on farmers and ranchers all across many States. <p>Now, at my direction, the Department of Agriculture, led by Secretary Vilsack, has been working with every other agency across the Federal Government to make sure that we are taking every single possible step to help farmers and ranchers to fight back and recover from this disaster. <p>We've already designated over a hundred&mdash;1,500 counties across 32 States as disaster areas, which gives qualified farmers access to low-interest emergency loans. We've also opened up more land for haying and grazing. And we've worked with crop insurance companies to give farmers a short grace period on unpaid insurance premiums, since some families will be struggling to make ends meet at the end of this crop year. <p>This has been an all-hands-on-deck response. I want to thank Tom for his leadership. But obviously, we've got a lot more to do, because a lot of folks are being affected by this. <p>So today the Department of Agriculture is announcing an additional $30 million to get more water to livestock and restore land impacted by drought. The National Credit Union Administration is allowing an additional thousand credit unions to increase lending to small businesses. The Department of Transportation is ready to help more commercial truck drivers to provide much-needed supplies to farmers and ranchers. And the SBA, the Small Business Administration, is working with other Government agencies to connect even more eligible farmers, ranchers, and businesses with low-interest emergency loans as well as counseling and workforce programs. <p>Now, those are the ideas that have already been presented and are in the process of being implemented, but my instructions to all the agencies is, we need to keep working and to see if there is more that we can do. And we're going to continue to solicit ideas from State and local organizations, faith-based organizations, non-for-profit groups, the private sector, and most of all, the farmers and ranchers that are directly impacted to find additional ways that we can help, because when there's a disaster like this, everybody needs to pull together. <p>Obviously, Congress has a role here. Congress needs to pass a farm bill that will not only provide important disaster relief tools, but also make necessary reforms and give farmers the certainty that they deserve. That's the single best way that we can help rural communities both in the short term, but also in the long term. And we've already seen some good bipartisan work done in the Senate. Now's the time for us to come together and go ahead and get this done. And my hope is, is that Congress, many of whom will be traveling back to their districts, in some cases in rural communities and see what's taking place there, will feel a greater sense of urgency and be prepared to get this done immediately upon their return. <p>In the meantime, my administration is going to use the full extent of our administrative powers to make sure that we're responding appropriately. <p>All right? Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"182" "\"Thank you, everybody. Please, please have a seat. Good evening, everyone. And welcome to the White House. <p>Of all the freedoms we cherish as Americans, of all the rights that we hold sacred, foremost among them is freedom of religion, the right to worship as we choose. It's enshrined in the First Amendment of our Constitution, the law of the land, always and forever. It beats in our heart, in the soul of the people, who know that our liberty and our equality is endowed by our Creator. And it runs through the history of this house, a place where Americans of many faiths can come together and celebrate their holiest of days, and that includes Ramadan. <p>As I've noted before, Thomas Jefferson once held a sunset dinner here with an envoy from Tunisia, perhaps the first Iftar at the White House, more than 200 years ago. And some of you, as you arrived tonight, may have seen our special display, courtesy of our friends at the Library of Congress, the Koran that belonged to Thomas Jefferson. And that's a reminder, along with the generations of patriotic Muslims in America, that Islam, like so many faiths, is part of our national story. <p>This evening, we're honored to be joined by members of our diplomatic corps; Members of Congress, including Muslim American Members of Congress Keith Ellison and Andre Carson; as well as leaders from across my administration. And to you, the millions of Muslim Americans across our country, and to the more than 1 billion Muslims around the world, <i>Ramadan Kareem</i>. <p>Now, every faith is unique. And yet during Ramadan, we see the traditions that are shared by many faiths: believers engaged in prayer and fasting, in humble devotion to God; families gathering together with love for each other; neighbors reaching out in compassion and charity to serve the less fortunate; people of different faiths coming together, mindful of our obligations to one another, to peace, justice, and dignity for all people, men and women. Indeed, you know that the Koran teaches, \\"Be it man or woman, each of you is equal to the other.\\" <p>And by the way, we've seen this in recent days. In fact, the Olympics is being called \\"the year of the woman.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Here in America, we're incredibly proud of Team U.S.A., all of them, but we should notice that a majority of the members are women. Also, for the very first time in Olympic history, every team now includes a woman athlete. And one of the reasons is that every team from a Muslim-majority country now includes women as well. <p>And more broadly&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;that's worth applauding, absolutely. More broadly, we've seen the extraordinary courage of Muslim women during the Arab Spring. Women, right alongside men, taking to the streets to claim their universal rights, marching for their freedom, blogging and tweeting and posting videos, determined to be heard. In some cases, facing down tanks and braving bullets, enduring detentions and unspeakable treatment, and at times, giving their very lives for the freedom that they seek, the liberty that we are lucky enough to enjoy here tonight. <p>These women have inspired their sisters and daughters, but also their brothers and their sons, and they've inspired us all. Even as we see women casting their ballots and seeking&mdash;standing for office in historic elections, we understand that their work is not done. They understand that any true democracy must uphold the freedom and rights of all people and all faiths. We know this too, for here in America, we're enriched by so many faiths, by men and women, including Muslim American women. <p>They're young people, like the student who wrote me a letter about what it's like to grow up Muslim in America. She's in college. She dreams of a career in international affairs to help deepen understanding between the United States and Muslim countries around the world. So if any of the diplomatic corps have tips for her&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. She says that \\"America has always been the land of opportunity for me, and I love this country with all my heart.\\" And so we're glad to have Hala Baig here today. <p>They are faith leaders like Sanaa Nadim, one of the first Muslim chaplains at an American college, a voice for interfaith dialogue who's had the opportunity to meet with the Pope to discuss these issues. We're very proud to have you here. <p>They are educators like Auysha Muhayya, born in Afghanistan, who fled with her family as refugees to America and now, as a language teacher, helps open her students to new cultures. So we're very pleased to have her here. <p>They are entrepreneurs and lawyers, community leaders, members of our military, and Muslim American women serving with distinction in government. And that includes a good friend, Huma Abedin, who has worked tirelessly in the White House, in the U.S. Senate, and most exhaustingly, at the State Department, where she has been nothing less than extraordinary in representing our country and the democratic values that we hold dear. Senator Clinton has relied on her expertise, and so have I. <p>The American people owe her a debt of gratitude because Huma is an American patriot and an example of what we need in this country: more public servants with her sense of decency, her grace, and her generosity of spirit. So, on behalf of all Americans, we thank you so much. <p>These are the faces of Islam in America. These are just a few of the Muslim Americans who strengthen our country every single day. This is the diversity that makes us Americans, the pluralism that we will never lose. <p>And at times, we have to admit that this spirit is threatened. We've seen instances of mosques and synagogues, churches and temples being targeted. Tonight our prayers, in particular, are with our friends and fellow Americans in the Sikh community. We mourn those who were senselessly murdered and injured in their place of worship. And while we may never fully understand what motivates such hatred, such violence, the perpetrators of such despicable acts must know that your twisted thinking is no match for the compassion and the goodness and the strength of our united American family. <p>So tonight we declare with one voice that such violence has no place in the United States of America. The attack on Americans of any faith is an attack on the freedom of all Americans. No American should ever have to fear for their safety in their place of worship. And every American has the right to practice their faith both openly and freely, and as they choose. <p>That is not just an American right; it is a universal human right. And we will defend the freedom of religion here at home and around the world. And as we do, we'll draw on the strength and example of our interfaith community, including the leaders who are here tonight. <p>So I want to thank all of you for honoring us with your presence, for the example of your lives, and for your commitment to the values that make us \\"one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\\" <p>God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you.\" "
"183" "\"Hi, everybody. Today I want to talk about something that most of you already know: It's hot outside. It's really hot. And if this feels worse than normal, that's because it is. We just found out that July was the warmest month on record, warmer than any other month since we began keeping track more than a century ago. <p>On top of all this heat, we're also experiencing one of the worst droughts in over 50 years. Almost a quarter of the continental United States is facing what we call \\"extreme\\" or \\"exceptional\\" drought, with States like Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Arkansas getting hit harder than most. <p>That's bad news for a lot of people, but it's especially tough on our farmers and ranchers. Right now almost half of the corn crop in America is in poor or very poor condition. Cattlemen are struggling to feed their animals. Many folks are seeing their livelihoods dry up in front of their eyes. And if we don't get relief soon, Americans everywhere will start to feel the pinch, because the food our farmers and ranchers produce ends up on grocery store shelves. <p>We can't let that happen. That's why, at my direction, the Department of Agriculture, led by Secretary Tom Vilsack, has been working with other agencies across the Federal Government to make sure we're doing everything we can to help farmers and ranchers fight back and recover from this disaster. Already, we've given farmers and small businesses across 32 States access to low-interest emergency loans. <p>We've opened up more Federal land for grazing. And we're working with crop insurance companies to give farmers a short grace period on their premiums, since some families will be struggling to make ends meet at the end of the year. <p>This past week, we went even further, announcing an additional $30 million to help get more water to livestock and restore land affected by the drought. We're making it easier for even more farmers, ranchers, and business owners to get emergency loans. And the Department of Transportation is helping more truck drivers deliver supplies to States that need them the most. <p>This is an all-hands-on-deck response, and we'll be doing even more in the coming weeks to help families and communities that are suffering. <p>But my administration can't do it alone. Congress needs to do its part too. They need to pass a farm bill that not only helps farmers and ranchers respond to these kinds of disasters, but also makes necessary reforms and gives them some certainty year round. That's the single best way we can help rural communities right now and also in the long term. <p>So call your Members of Congress, write them an e-mail, and tell them that now is the time to come together and get this done. Too many Americans are suffering right now to let politics get in the way. Let's help farmers, ranchers, and business owners recover. Let's make sure that families who already stretch their budgets to the limit don't have to pay more for groceries this fall. <p>In the meantime, I'll keep doing everything I can to help communities respond to this disaster. Because at times like these, it doesn't matter if you live in Des Moines or Detroit, we're Americans first. And if we look out for each other, we'll come out of this stronger than before. <p>Have a great weekend, everybody. And stay cool.\" "
"184" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody. <p><i>Jet Propulsion Laboratory Director Charles Elachi.</i> Good morning, Mr. President. <p><i>The President.</i> Who am I speaking with? <p><i>Dr. Elachi.</i> This is Charles Elachi, the director of JPL. And we have a room full of the mission operation personnel. This is <i>Curiosity</i> mission operation on Mars. <p><i>The President.</i> Well, it is great to talk to all of you. And I just want you to know that we could not be more excited about what you've been doing. <p>Somebody asked me the other day whether you've already found Martians. [<i>Laughter</i>] I told them we have to give you a little bit of time. But we know you're all hard at work and you're getting some well-deserved rest after a successful landing. And I just wanted to call and say congratulations to the entire Mars Science Laboratory team, and really all of JPL, on last Monday's incredible success. <p>Through your dedicated efforts, <i>Curiosity</i> stuck her landing and captured the attention and imagination of millions of people not just across our country, but people all around the world, including Times Square. And what you did on Mars was incredibly impressive. Those 76 pyrotechnics going off in perfect succession and the 500,000 lines of code working exactly the way you guys had ordered them, so it's really mind-boggling what you've been able to accomplish. And being able to get that whole landing sequence to work the way you did is a testimony to your team. <p>I especially want to congratulate Charles Elachi, the head of JPL; the entry descent and landing lead, Adam Steltzner, who helped devise the final step of this amazing descent, the Sky Crane System. What you've accomplished embodies the American spirit, and your passion and your commitment is making a difference. And your hard work is now paying dividends, because our expectation is that <i>Curiosity</i> is going to be telling us things that we did not know before and laying the groundwork for an even more audacious undertaking in the future, and that's a human mission to the Red Planet. <p>I understand there's a special Mohawk guy that's working on the mission. [<i>Laughter</i>] He's been one of the many stars of the show last Sunday night. And I, in the past, thought about getting a Mohawk myself&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but my team keeps on discouraging me. And now that he's received marriage proposals and thousands of new Twitter followers, I think that I'm going to go back to my team and see if it makes sense. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Dr. Elachi.</i> That's going to be the new fashion at JPL. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> It does sound like NASA has come a long way from the white shirt, black dark-rimmed glasses, and the pocket protectors. [<i>Laughter</i>] You guys are a little cooler than you used to be. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>As all of you know, my administration has put a big focus on improving science and technology, engineering and math education. And this is the kind of thing that inspires kids across the country. They're telling their moms and dads they want to be part of a Mars mission, maybe even the first person to walk on Mars. And that kind of inspiration is the byproduct of work of the sort that you guys have done. <p>So not only do I want to congratulate the team, I want to call out a few of the leaders of the group, including Adam, but also Peter Theisinger, Richard Cook, John Grotzinger, John Grunsfeld. And I'd like to congratulate and thank all of our international partners&mdash;Spain, Russia, Germany, France, Canada, Italy, Japan, Australia&mdash;all of them contributed, I know, to the instrumentation <i>Curiosity</i> landed on Martian surface&mdash;and all the scientists who are part of the JPL team. <p>So you guys have done an outstanding job. You made us all proud. You've made NASA proud. You guys are examples of American know how and ingenuity, and it's really an amazing accomplishment. So we can't wait to start hearing back from <i>Curiosity</i> and finding out what's going on. We're fortunate to be part of a society that can reach beyond our planet and explore frontiers that were only imagined by our ancestors. So it's inspiring to all of us. <p>I'm going to give you guys a personal commitment to protect these critical investments in science and technology. I thank you for devoting your lives to this cause. And if, in fact, you do make contact with Martians, please let me know right away. [<i>Laughter</i>] I've got a lot of other things on my plate, but I suspect that that will go to the top of the list. [<i>Laughter</i>] Even if they're just microbes, it will be pretty exciting. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Dr. Elachi.</i> Well, thank you, Mr. President. And on behalf of all us at NASA, we thank you for taking the time to give us a call. And hopefully, we inspired some of the millions of young people who were watching this landing. Thank you again. <p><i>The President.</i> Well, you've already inspired us, but I know that the photographs that are going to start coming back are going to be remarkable and amazing. And again, you guys should be remarkably proud. Really what makes us best as a species is this curiosity that we have and this yearning to discover and know more and push the boundaries of knowledge. And you are perfect examples of that, and we couldn't be more grateful to you. <p>So congratulations. Keep up the great work. <p><i>Dr. Elachi.</i> Thank you very much. And have a good day. <p><i>The President</i>. Okay. Bye-bye, guys.\" "
"185" "\"Today we are here at the McIntosh family farms, here in Missouri Valley, Iowa, and we just got a tour from Dean, Don, Richard, and Roger. And like a lot of families in this area and across America, the McIntoshes are suffering under one of the worst droughts in 50 years. <p>We've just been through the warmest 12-month period ever recorded, and right now more than 60 percent of the country is under drought conditions. It's hot, it's dry, and the summer is not over yet. <p>Things are especially tough for farmers and ranchers, like the McIntoshes, who depend on a good growing season to pay the bills and keep a roof over their heads. The McIntosh family has been farming in the Missouri Valley for 96 years, so they've seen just about everything, but this is the worst drought they can remember in decades. As a result, their corn yield is off by about a third, and some of their neighbors in surrounding areas are struggling even worse. <p>Here in Iowa, almost half of the corn crop and more than a third of the soybean crop is in poor or very poor condition. Livestock producers are having trouble feeding their herds. Crops and livestock are a $30 billion business in Iowa, and that's a huge chunk of the economy that's being put at risk. And States all across the heartland have it just as bad. <p>Now, the best way to help these States is for Congress to act. They need to pass a farm bill that not only helps farmers and ranchers respond to natural disasters, but also makes necessary reforms and gives them some long-term certainty. But the folks suffering from this drought can't wait for Congress to do its job. So in the meantime, I've made sure that my administration, under the leadership of Secretary Tom Vilsack, is doing everything we can to provide relief to those who need it. <p>I've directed the Department of Agriculture and the Small Business Administration to help give farmers and small businesses across 32 States access to low-interest emergency loans. We've opened up Federal land for grazing. We're working with insurance companies to give farmers a short grace period on their premiums, since money will be tight for a lot of families at the end of the crop year. And last week, we announced another $30 million to help get more water to livestock and restore land affected by the drought. <p>Today, we're going to go even further, and we're focusing on helping people who make their living by bringing cattle, pigs, sheep, and other animals to market. The way things work right now, farmers who raise crops are eligible for subsidized insurance to help cushion the blow if disaster strikes. But livestock producers don't have that option. So when grasslands dry up and they've got to sell their animals early, it's a huge financial blow and can affect markets all across the country. We can make a difference, though, and here's what we're going to do. <p>It turns out that the Federal Government buys a lot of meat for military bases, hospitals, colleges, food banks, and cafeterias. And because of the drought, there are a lot of folks out there that are trying to sell meat right now. So, just like you might buy more chicken when it's on sale and freeze it, we are going to stock up. Prices are low; farmers and ranchers need help, so it makes sense. It makes sense for farmers who get to sell more of their product, and it makes sense for taxpayers who will save money because we're getting food we would have bought anyway at a better price. <p>And we're not just talking about a few strips of bacon here. Today the Department of Agriculture announced that it will buy up to $100 million worth of pork products, $50 million worth of chicken, and $20 million worth of lamb and farm-raised catfish. And the Department of Defense, which bought about 94 million pounds of beef and 64 million pounds of pork last year, will encourage their vendors to buy more now and freeze it for later. <p>Understand this won't solve the problem. We can't make it rain. But this will help families like the McIntoshes in States across the country, including here in Iowa. And we're going to keep doing what we can to help because that's what we do. We are Americans. We take care of each other. And when our neighbors hit a rough patch, we step up and help out. <p>So my message to the McIntoshes and everybody who is suffering through the drought, we understand that we depend on you, America depends on you to put food on the table and feed our families, and as a consequence, we're going to make sure that we're there for you, not just today, but every day until this drought passes. That is a promise. And as President, I'll do everything in my power to make sure that you get the relief that you deserve. <p>So, thank you very much, everybody. God bless you, and God bless America.\" "
"186" "\"Well, I want to thank Jeff Heil and his father Richard for showing me around the farm. And I think it's remarkable to think that the Heil family has been farming this land since 1902, but they've got a relatively new addition in the wind turbines that you see in the background. They're part of the Laurel Wind Farm, 52 turbines that harvest enough wind power to power an estimated 30,000 Iowa homes in a way that's clean and renewable.<i> </i><p>And at a moment when we want to pursue every avenue for job creation, it's homegrown energy like wind that's creating good, new jobs in States like Iowa. Let me give you an example. Back when I was first running for this office and spending a lot of time in this State, I visited a town of Newton, about a half an hour down the road. The local Maytag plant was closing its doors, and nearly 2,000 jobs were on the line. So you had a once-thriving factory that was going dark and going quiet, and understandably, folks were worried about what would happen to the community. <p>Then wind energy offered a new opportunity. When I returned to Newton to visit that plant as President several months ago, some of the same folks who had lost their jobs at Maytag were back on the line building wind towers to support some of the most advanced wind turbines in the world. <p>Earlier this year, at a different plant about 5 minutes from there, I met workers building enormous blades for these wind turbines. And I'm proud of the fact that, while we used to have to import parts like those, today, they're made in Newton, made in Iowa, made in America by American workers. <p>Unfortunately, what we thought was a bipartisan consensus in supporting wind power has been fraying a little bit during election season. My opponent in this election says he wants to end tax credits for wind energy, wind energy producers that make all this possible. He's called these sources of energy \\"imaginary.\\" His new running mate has called them a \\"fad.\\" <p>I think a lot of folks in Iowa would disagree, because wind farms like this and the good jobs that are down in Newton, they're not a fad, and they're not imaginary. Seventy-five thousand jobs across this country depend on wind energy, 7,000 jobs in Iowa alone. That's more than in any other State. These are good, American jobs. And thanks to the hard work of the folks who have these jobs, Iowa generates about 20 percent of its electricity from wind, energy that powers homes and businesses and factories all across the State. <p>Over the past 4 years, we've doubled the amount of electricity America can generate from wind: from 25 gigawatts to 50 gigawatts. And to put that in perspective, that's like building 12 new Hoover Dams that are powering homes all across the country. We doubled the amount of electricity we generate from solar energy too. And combined, these energy sources are enough power to make sure that 13 million homes have reliable power and support the paychecks that help more than a hundred thousand Americans provide for their families. <p>That's not imaginary. That is real. And that's what's at stake in November. Thirty-seven thousand American jobs are on the line if the wind energy tax credit is allowed to expire like my opponent thinks they should. And unlike Governor Romney, I want to stop giving $4 billion in taxpayer subsidies to big oil companies that have rarely been more profitable so that we can keep investing in homegrown energy sources like wind that have never been more promising. That's part of the choice in this election. <p>We can listen to folks who want to take us backwards by doubling down on the same economic policies that got us into a fix several years ago and that we're still fighting out of. Or we can keep moving forward to a future with more good, American jobs, more sources of homegrown American energy, greater energy independence, and cleaner, safer environments for our kids. <p>And I think it was interesting talking to Jeff. He described how these wind farms got started, and what you had was all the neighboring farms coming together and essentially forming a cooperative. And folks who had these windmills on their land&mdash;on their property&mdash;recognized that, look, that was going to have an impact on folks who might not. And so everybody in this area, whether they've got a wind farm or not, helps benefit&mdash;or is benefiting from the economics of this wind energy. <p>And that's an example of what America is about. We believe in free enterprise; we believe in hard work. The Heil family is an example of that. But we also believe in neighborliness and working together for the common good. And as a consequence of their foresight and their creativity&mdash;and with the help of these wind energy tax credits&mdash;every farmer, every landowner, in this area is benefiting. And all of us are benefiting from clean, American energy. <p>So I hope we continue to promote this kind of energy. I know the Heil family does too. And my expectation is, is that over the next several years, in the same way that we've doubled wind energy in the past, we're going to keep on doubling it in the future. <p>Thanks very much, everybody.\" "
"187" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! So good to see you! I hear that there's a little school going on here. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I thought I'd stop by and just wish everybody luck. <p>Have a seat, have a seat. We were on our way by, and I just wanted to say that, first of all, I've been seeing a whole bunch of the kids as I've been traveling around the State, and they're really enthusiastic that the summer is over and that&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;so you're going to have some charged-up kids. <p>But the main thing I want to do is just say thank you for everything you guys do. I know how tough it is to be a teacher. My sister was a teacher; she's now actually teaching teachers through college education. But I remember stories of her bringing home stuff from work and putting together a lesson plan and staying up late and sometimes having to help parents as well as the kids. And we appreciate you for what you guys do every single day. <p>[<i>At this point, a bell rang.</i>] <p>Oh, did we set off a fire alarm? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So I just wanted to say thank you. I know that you get a lot of satisfaction. Obviously, you guys don't do this for the money. But to be able to, every single day, know that you're making a difference in a young person's life, at a time when education is more important than it's ever been, has to be pretty gratifying and pretty significant. So we appreciate you. <p>And I didn't want to interrupt any&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but what I was thinking was maybe I've got some time to take some questions or get some comments, ideas. I'd love to hear from you guys what's working and what's not, how we can be more helpful. What do you think, Principal, is that all right, spend a few minutes? [<i>Laughter</i>] It's not going to throw the whole schedule off? <p>Okay. Can I just say that if this guy had been a principal at my school I would have gotten in a lot less trouble. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm looking at him, and I'm thinking, I really wouldn't goof off much. [<i>Laughter</i>] He seems like a pretty serious guy. <p>So anybody have comments, ideas, thoughts, things you think I need to know? The only person I'm not going to call is the guy with the Packers shirt. [<i>Laughter</i>] I generally don't interact with Packers fans, except when I'm in Wisconsin. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So what do you think? Are people excited about the school year? <p><i>Q</i>. Yes. <p><i>The President.</i> Okay. What are the biggest challenges that you guys face? And what do you want me to know? Because I've got a little pull; I can talk to the Secretary of Education and tell him what I heard. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Yes, in the back. And introduce yourself, tell me what you teach. <p><i>Q.</i> I'm Judy Callahan, and I teach special ed. And with the No Child Left Behind laws, it's going to be very difficult for our students to meet the grade. How do we help them? <p><i>The President.</i> Well, I don't know how&mdash;what you guys have been following about what we've been doing at the Federal level, but we have been encouraging Congress to pass the new ESEA and had a whole series of reforms in it. Shockingly, Congress didn't get it done. And so what we did was, administratively, we have gone ahead and said to States and school districts that if they want to get a waiver from under No Child Left Behind, we will grant that waiver, the theory being that we don't want you guys teaching to the test. We want you to feel creative and empowered inside your classroom. <p>We do want high standards. And so what we say to States is, you guys show us how you are going to have high standards, strong accountability, are reaching low-performing schools and students, but we'll give you more flexibility in terms of how to meet those standards. <p>Now, we've already gotten a lot of States who've applied for these waivers; a number of them have been granted. Iowa, it has not yet obtained the waiver. And frankly, I don't yet know what the thinking of the Iowa school board&mdash;or Department of Education is at this point in terms of how they're approaching it. Maybe the superintendent has some awareness in terms of how statewide Iowa is thinking about this. <p>But our goal is to maintain the best spirit of No Child Left Behind, which is we want high standards, we want every kid learning, but we also want greater flexibility. And we don't want schools labeled failures just because you have a certain set of test scores that didn't take into account some of the challenges involved in, let's say, special ed, or what have you, where it might take a little bit longer to achieve these goals. <p>And as I said, I really don't want teachers to feel like they've got to be teaching to the test, because that's going to sap the interest of the kids inside the classroom. <p>But, Superintendent, have you guys been in conversations at a State level as to how folks are thinking about it right now? <p><i>Western Dubuque Community School District Superintendent Jeff Corkery. </i>We asked for a waiver for the State, yet it wasn't granted. They're still working on that. <p><i>The President.</i> Still working on it? <p><i>Mr. Corkery. </i>A quick comment, Mr. President, is that I really want to speak for educators that I really think the education in the United States and Iowa is probably as good as it's ever been. That sometimes gets lost in the political rhetoric. And I know there's a lot of talk about looking at all the other countries&mdash;Finland and Thailand and Singapore&mdash;however, we keep forgetting about all the kids we have in poverty in America. <p>And Title I is so important as we address that and those type of programs. And any chance to expand those? And we certainly hope that Congress can get together and come up with a budget that I know you're proposing there. But we're doing a great job out there. Could we do better? Absolutely. <p><i>The President.</i> Well, as you guys have heard from me, I'm a big booster of what you guys do. And you're right, there's no doubt that achieving high performance, standardized tests across the board in a country like Finland that is much more homogenous and smaller, and where you don't have the same child poverty rates that you have here, is a problem. And too often we expect the schools to solve every problem. So if you guys are expected to be not just teachers, but social workers, all kinds of other stuff. So we recognize that. <p>On the other hand, the reality is this is a competitive world right now and what happens to your kids in the classroom will probably have more to do with how our economy does over the next 20 years than just about anything we do. And businesses are going to be locating based on how skilled the workforce is. <p>The good news is you're starting to see companies actually coming back from places like China, partly because when you start factoring in transportation costs and energy costs, as well as product quality, America is as productive and competitive as we've ever been. But that's only going to be true if we continue to make sure that we've got the best workers in the world. And other folks are catching up. They're putting more money into education. <p>[<i>The discussion continued, but no transcript was provided.</i>]\" "
"188" "\"Hi, everybody. This week, I spent some time traveling across Iowa talking with folks about rebuilding an economy where if you work hard, you and your family can get ahead. <p>And along the way, I stopped in at Cascade High School to thank the teachers there for doing such a great job and wish them luck as they head back to the classroom for this school year. <p>There's nothing more important to our country's future than the education we give our kids. And there's no one more important to that education than the person in the front of the classroom. <p>Teachers matter. Most work tirelessly, with modest pay, sometimes digging into their own pocket for school supplies, just to make a difference. They give everything for our kids, and in return, we should invest in them. <p>But here's the thing: This year, several thousand fewer educators will be going back to school. Since 2009, we've lost more than 300,000 education jobs, in part because of budget cuts at the State and local level. <p>Think about what that means for our country. At a time when the rest of the world is racing to out-educate America, these cuts force our kids into crowded classrooms, cancel programs for preschoolers and kindergarteners, and shorten the school week and the school year. <p>That's the opposite of what we should be doing as a country. States should be making education a priority in their budgets, even in tough fiscal times. And Congress should be willing to help out because this affects all of us. <p>That's why part of the jobs bill that I sent to Congress last September included support for States to prevent further layoffs and to rehire teachers who'd lost their jobs. But here we are, a year later, with tens of thousands more educators laid off and Congress still hasn't done anything about it. <p>In fact, the economic plan that almost every Republican in Congress voted for would make the situation even worse. It would actually cut funding for education, which means fewer kids in Head Start, fewer teachers in our classrooms, and fewer college students with access to financial aid, all to pay for a massive new tax cut for millionaires and billionaires. <p>That's backwards. That's wrong. That plan doesn't invest in our future; it undercuts our future. <p>If we want America to lead in the 21st century, nothing is more important than giving everyone the best education possible, from the day they start preschool to the day they start their career. <p>That's why we launched a national competition to improve our schools. And for less than 1 percent of what our Nation spends on education each year, we've encouraged almost every State to raise their standards&mdash;the first time that's happened in a generation. <p>That's why we've invested in math and science education, and given States more flexibility on No Child Left Behind. <p>And that's why we've reformed the student loan program to put students before big banks, and increased financial aid for millions of young people, because in America, higher education can't be a luxury; it's an economic necessity every family should be able to afford. <p>This is a country where no matter what you look like or where you come from, if you're willing to study and work hard, you can go as far as your talents will take you. You can make it if you try. I am only the President of the United States today because of the chance my education gave me, and I want every child in America to have that chance. That's what I'm fighting for. And as long as I have the privilege of being your President, that's what I'm going to keep fighting for. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "

"190" "\"Hi, everybody. Over the last few weeks, there's been a lot of talk about Medicare, with a lot of accusations and misinformation flying around. So today I want to step back for a minute and share with you some actual facts and news about the program. <p>This week, we found out that thanks to the health care law we passed, nearly 5.4 million seniors with Medicare have saved over $4.1 billion on prescription drugs. That's an average of more than $700 per person. And this year alone, 18 million seniors with Medicare have taken advantage of preventive care benefits like mammograms or other cancer screenings that now come at no extra cost. <p>That's progress. It means that seniors everywhere are getting the care they need for less. And if you have questions about what benefits you're entitled to, you can go to www.medicare.gov to find out. <p>This news is also a reminder of what's really at stake when we talk about the future of Medicare. It's not about overheated rhetoric at election time. It's about a promise this country made to our seniors that says if you put in a lifetime of hard work, you shouldn't lose your home or your life savings just because you get sick. <p>Over the last 47 years, millions of Americans have worked for that promise. They've earned it. And for many seniors, the care they've gotten through Medicare has made all the difference in the world. <p>Growing up as the son of a single mom, I was raised with the help of my grandparents. So I saw how important things like Medicare and Social Security were in their lives. And I saw the peace of mind it gave them. <p>That's why, as President, my goal has been to strengthen these programs now and preserve them for future generations. Because today's seniors deserve that same peace of mind. And the millions of Americans who are working hard right now deserve to know that the care they need will be available when they need it. <p>That's why, as part of the Affordable Care Act, we gave seniors deeper discounts on prescription drugs and made sure preventive care like mammograms are free without a copay. We've extended the life of Medicare by almost a decade. And I've proposed reforms that will save Medicare money by getting rid of wasteful spending in the health care system and reining in insurance companies&mdash;reforms that won't touch your guaranteed Medicare benefits, not by a single dime. <p>Republicans in Congress have put forward a very different plan. They want to turn Medicare into a voucher program. That means that instead of being guaranteed Medicare, seniors would get a voucher to buy insurance, but it wouldn't keep up with costs. As a result, one plan would force seniors to pay an extra $6,400 a year for the same benefits they get right now. And it would effectively end Medicare as we know it. <p>I think our seniors deserve better. I'm willing to work with anyone to keep improving the current system, but I refuse to do anything that undermines the basic idea of Medicare as a guarantee for seniors who get sick. <p>Here in America, we believe in keeping our promises, especially to our seniors, who have put in a lifetime of hard work and deserve to enjoy their golden years. That's what Medicare is all about. That's why we need to strengthen and preserve it for future generations. And as long as I have the honor of serving as your President, that's exactly what I'll do. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"191" "\"Good morning, everybody. This morning I want to say a few words about tropical storm Isaac and the steps that we're taking to keep people safe and minimize the damage. <p>I just got an update from Secretary Napolitano, Administrator Fugate, the head of FEMA, and Dr. Rick Knabb, the Director of the National Hurricane Center, on preparations that are underway in the Gulf. This storm isn't scheduled to make landfall until later today, but at my direction, FEMA has been on the ground for over a week working with State and local officials in areas that could be affected, from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to Florida and, more recently, Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. <p>Yesterday I approved a disaster declaration for the State of Louisiana so they can get the help that they need right away, particularly around some of the evacuations that are taking place. And right now we already have response teams and supplies ready to help communities in the expected path of the storm. <p>As we prepare for Isaac to hit, I want to encourage all residents of the Gulf Coast to listen to your local officials and follow their directions, including if they tell you to evacuate. We're dealing with a big storm, and there could be significant flooding and other damage across a large area. Now is not the time to tempt fate. Now is not the time to dismiss official warnings. You need to take this seriously. <p>And finally, I want to thank everyone who has been working around the clock to get ready for Isaac. The hardest work, of course, is still ahead. And as President, I'll continue to make sure that the Federal Government is doing everything possible to help the American people prepare for and recover from this dangerous storm. And as we get additional updates from the Hurricane Center as well as from FEMA in terms of activities on the ground, we'll be providing continuous updates both at the local and the national level. <p>Thank you.\" "
"192" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Team Bliss! Hooah! Thank you so much, everybody. Hooah! <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> To General Lloyd Austin, thanks for the introduction and your leadership, leading our troops in Iraq and taking care of our soldiers now that they are at home. <p>And right at the top, let me say that our hearts are obviously with all the folks who are down in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast, who are dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Isaac. Our prayers are with those who've lost loved ones. And I've directed the Federal Government to keep doing everything that it can to help our partners at the State and local level. As a country, we stand united with our fellow Americans in their hour of need. <p>I want to thank General Pittard and all your great commanders for welcoming me here today. I want to give a shout-out to the Sergeant Major of the Army, Ray Chandler. And Commander&mdash;Command Sergeant Major Ronnie Kelley. These guys remind us that our noncommissioned officers are the backbone of our military, leading the finest enlisted force in the world. <p>It is great to be back at Fort Bliss, home to the Army Air and Missile Defense Command, \\"Swift and Sure.\\" We've got Guard and Reserve here. Of course, it's home to the legendary 1st Armored Division, \\"Old Ironsides.\\" We've got a lot of brigades here, including the \\"Iron Eagles,\\" \\"Iron Brigades,\\" \\"Bulldogs,\\" and \\"Ready First.\\" <p>And I also want to salute Lucille Pittard and Alice Kelley and all the extraordinary spouses and military families who are here. Give them a big round of applause. <p>I know that all of you are grateful for the incredible support you receive from your civilian neighbors. So I want to acknowledge two champions of Fort Bliss: we've got Congressman Silvestre Reyes, and we've got Mayor John Cook. And we've also got all the great folks in El Paso and New Mexico. Give them a big round of applause. <p>Now, I've come back to Bliss for a simple reason. Two years ago, I was here to mark a historic moment in the life of our Nation and our military: the end of major combat operations in Iraq. It was a chance for me to say on behalf of the American people to you and all who served there: Welcome home, and congratulations on a job well done. <p>In every major phase of that war, you were there, the \\"Iron Soldiers.\\" Because of your speed and strength, American troops toppled a dictator in less than a month. Because of your commitment, you stayed on extended tours and went back, tour after tour, year after year. Because of your determination to succeed, you turned back an insurgency. You stood firm against sectarian strife. You helped pull Iraq back from the abyss, and you trained Iraqis to take the lead. That was the progress you made possible with your service and your courage. <p>And so 2 years ago, I was able to come here to Bliss and mark the end of our combat mission. And that night I told the American people that all our troops would be out of Iraq by the end of the following year. At the time, I know some folks didn't believe me. They were skeptical. Some thought the end of combat was just word games and semantics, but I meant what I said. <p>So you kept training up those Iraqi forces. We removed nearly 150,000 troops, and this past December, under General Austin's leadership, the last American troops came home, including the 4th Brigade Combat Team from Bliss. <p>You left Iraq with honor, your mission complete, your heads held high. After nearly 9 years, our war in Iraq was over. And today, Iraq has a chance to forge its own destiny, and there are no American troops fighting and dying in Iraq. <p>On this anniversary, we honor the memory of all who gave their lives there: nearly 4,500 American patriots, including 198 fallen heroes from Fort Bliss and the 1st Armored Division. And we salute all who served there. <p>When I was here 2 years ago, I told you something else though: that we had more work to do, including taking the fight to Al Qaida. And there too, I meant what I said. With allies and partners, we've taken out more top Al Qaida terrorists than at any time since 9/11. And thanks to the courage of our forces, Al Qaida is on the road to defeat and bin Laden will never again threaten the United States of America. <p>Two years ago, I also told you that we'd keep up the fight in Afghanistan. And I know that some of you recently got back. On behalf of a grateful nation, welcome home. <p>Some of your buddies are in Afghanistan right now, and our thoughts and prayers are with all the troops from Bliss deployed around the world, including Afghanistan: the \\"War Eagles\\" and the \\"Highlanders.\\" <p>And I know that some of you will be deploying later this year. And I've got to tell you the truth: This is still a very tough fight. You know this. You carry in your hearts the memory of comrades who made that ultimate sacrifice, including six heroes from Bliss who gave their lives on that awful day last month. <p>I just had the opportunity to meet with some of our Gold Star families, and our message to them is this: Your loved ones live on in the soul of our Nation, and we will honor them always. <p>Because of their sacrifice, because of your service, we pushed the Taliban back. We're training Afghan forces. The transition to Afghan lead is underway, and as promised, more than 30,000 of our troops will have come home by next month. <p>Just as in Iraq, we are going to end this war responsibly. Next year, Afghans will take the lead for their own security. In 2014, the transition will be complete. And even as this war ends, we will stay vigilant so Afghanistan is never again a source for attacks against America. Never again. <p>So we're not just ending these wars, we're doing it in a way that keeps America safe and makes America stronger. And that includes our military. <p>Think about it. Just 4 years ago, there were some 180,000 American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. By next month we will have cut that number by nearly two-thirds. So most of our troops have come home. And as more Afghans step up, more of our troops will come home. <p>And what does that mean for you? Well, after 10 years of continuous operations, it means fewer deployments. It means more time for training. It means more time to improve readiness, more time to prepare for the future. And it means more time on the homefront with your families: your spouses and your kids. <p>So make no mistake, ending the wars responsibly makes us safer, and it makes our military even stronger. And ending these wars is letting us do something else: restore American leadership. <p>If you hear anyone trying to say that America is in decline or that our influence has waned, don't you believe it. Because here's the truth: Our alliances have never been stronger. We're leading on behalf of freedom, including standing with the people of Libya that are finally free from Muammar Qaddafi. <p>Around the world, there's a new attitude toward America, new confidence in our leadership. When people are asked, which country do you admire most, one nation always comes out on top: the United States of America. <p>And that's the progress that we've made thanks to your incredible service. We're winding down a decade of war. We're destroying terrorist networks that attacked us. And we've restored American leadership. And today, every American can be proud that the United States is safer, the United States is stronger, and the United States is more respected in the world. <p>Now, when I was here last, I made you a pledge. I said that, as President, I will insist that America serves you and your families as well as you've served us. And there again, I meant what I said. Because part of ending wars responsibly is caring for those who fought in it. And that's why I wanted to come back to Bliss on this anniversary to reaffirm our solemn obligations to you and your families. <p>You see, we may be turning a page on a decade of war, but America's responsibilities to you have only just begun. <p>[<i>At this point, a baby cried.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Hey! [<i>Laughter</i>] I hear you. <p>So here's my pledge to you. In a world of serious threats, I will never hesitate to use force to defend the United States of America or our interests. At the same time, I will only send you into harm's way when it is absolutely necessary. And when we do, we will give you the equipment and the clear mission and the smart strategy and the support back home that you need to get the job done. We owe you that. <p>With the end of the wars, our military will be leaner, but we'll keep making historic investments to keep you the absolute best military in the world, bar none. The United States will always maintain our military superiority. In you, we've got the best trained, best led, best equipped military in human history. And as Commander in Chief, I'm going to keep it that way. <p>And by the way, you've been hearing some folks out there trying to talk about the budget and trying to scare you. Last year, Congress pledged to find a plan to reduce the deficit, and they said if they couldn't agree, there would be big cuts across the board, including defense. But understand, nobody wants these cuts, and that's why Congress threatened them, to force themselves to make hard decisions. <p>Well, here's the thing. There's no reason those cuts should happen, because folks in Congress ought to come together and agree on a responsible plan that reduces the deficit and keeps our military strong. <p>That's what needs to happen. That's what you and your families deserve. And that's how we're going to keep America safe and strong and grow our economy all at the same time. That's a pledge that we need to make to you. <p>And just as we give you the best equipment and technology on the battlefield, we need to give you the best support and care when you come home. <p><i>Audience member.</i> I say hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> Hooah! <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> We just had a roundtable with some soldiers and their families, talking about how coming home can be its own struggle, especially for our wounded warriors. So we've poured tremendous resources into this effort, unprecedented support for our troops with traumatic brain injury, for our troops and veterans with PTSD: more counselors, more clinicians, more care, more treatment. <p>And I know you've been a leader on this here at Bliss, making it clear that everyone has a responsibility to help a comrade who's hurting. So today we're taking another step. I've signed a new Executive order to give our troops, our veterans, and our families better access to mental health care. <p>We're going increase the number of folks manning those crisis hotlines so help is there when you need it most. We're going to add even more counselors and mental health providers. We're launching a new awareness campaign, starting tomorrow, and I'm directing a new task force to find out what works best so we're doing everything we can to help those in need and save lives. And I know that you join me in saying to everyone who's ever worn the uniform: If you're hurting, it's not a sign of weakness to seek help, it's a sign of strength. <p>We are here to help you stay strong, \\"Army Strong.\\" That's a commitment I'm making to you. <p>And we're going to keep taking care of our remarkable military families too. This is something I care deeply about, but even if I didn't, I'd have no choice because Michelle would tell me what to do. [<i>Laughter</i>] And along with Michelle and Dr. Jill Biden, they have been doing everything they can to get civilians involved in this process, not just our Government. So today more people all across America are joining forces to give our military families the respect and the support that they deserve, and that's especially important right now. <p>Now, this may be a political season, and folks may be arguing about all sorts of things. But one thing that we Americans are united on is our support for you. Only 1 percent of Americans may wear the uniform&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President. &mdash;</i>&mdash;but 100 percent of Americans need to be supporting you and your families 100 percent. <p>And so this brings me to the final pledge I made here at Bliss 2 years ago. When you take off the uniform, we are going to help you fully participate in our economy. Every single one of you has defended the American Dream for the rest of us, and every single one of you deserves the chance to live the American Dream yourselves. And that includes jobs worthy of your incredible talents. <p>And by the way, it's not just good for you, it's good for the country, because after a decade of war, the nation we need to be rebuilding is the United States of America. And all of you have the skills that America needs. <p>So with a million more of you rejoining civilian life in the years ahead, we're upping our game at every stage of your careers. We've overhauled the Transition Assistance Program, creating a kind of reverse boot camp as you leave service, to help you find a job, and pursue that degree, or start that business. And hopefully, this will be one boot camp you actually like. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We'll keep helping you and your families pursue your education under the post-9/11 GI bill. And by the way, we're cracking down on those schools that have been trying to take your money and then rip you off by not giving you the education that you paid for. That needs to stop. We're going to bring an end to that. <p>We're going to keep hiring our newest veterans in the Federal Government and in communities as police officers and firefighters and first-responders. Because we passed tax credits, more businesses can hire our veterans and wounded warriors. <p>We're making it easier for you to transfer your outstanding military skills to the licenses and credentials that you need to get that civilian job. If you've been a medic in theater, you shouldn't have to start at Nursing 101 if you decide you want to go into the medical profession here in the United States. If you've been a mechanic on a multimillion-dollar piece of equipment, you shouldn't have to come back and start all over again in getting credentialed to work on a car here in the United States. <p>And maybe you've heard, last year, I challenged the private sector to hire or train 100,000 veterans or military spouses. Well, last week, Michelle was able to announce that patriotic companies across America have actually exceeded that goal ahead of schedule with 125,000 jobs. <p>But we've still got more work to do. So today I'm again calling on Congress to act. They've got some work they need to do: pass the veterans jobs corps so we can put more vets to work protecting and rebuilding America; extend tax credits to businesses that hire our veterans. And I say to every company in America: If you want somebody who knows how to get the job done, if you want somebody who is going to make you proud, just like they made America proud, then hire a vet. [<i>Applause</i>] Hire a vet. Because after fighting for America, you shouldn't have to fight for a job in America. <p>So, Team Bliss, these are America's commitments to you and all who serve, because we need to be there for you just like you were there for us, not just this year or next, but for all the years to come. <p>That's the lesson of a soldier I had the honor to meet the last time I was in Afghanistan, visiting some of our wounded warriors in the hospital at Bagram. Sergeant Chase Haag is 22 years old. This past spring, he was with his team when their vehicle got hit by an IED the day that I flew in. So when I arrived at his hospital room, he and his buddies were all in pretty bad shape. And he was certainly in bad shape: His leg was broken; his back was fractured. He was laying there on his bed. He was under a lot of medication, face was swollen, his eyes were shut. <p>And at first, my attitude was I didn't want to disturb him because I thought he was sleeping. And the doctor said, no, I think he can understand what you're saying even if he can't acknowledge it, and I think he'd appreciate knowing that you're by his side. So I leaned in, and I told Chase how proud I was of him and how proud the country was of him and how we'd be praying for his recovery. <p>And I was turning to leave, and then something happened. There was a rustling under his blanket. And Chase never opened his eyes, couldn't make a sound, but suddenly, you saw the blanket lift, and his arm came out. And he shook my hand: a firm Army handshake. And I don't think there was a dry eye in that room. <p>And then a few months later, I was visiting our wounded warriors at Walter Reed, and I walk around the corner, and who's there, but Chase. He had endured multiple surgeries. He was persevering through physical therapy. But this time, he was on his feet. He was walking again. And he had his dad next to him. And today, he's back where every soldier wants to be: back with his unit. <p>And it made me think, that's just one moment in the life of one American soldier. But it captured the spirit, the resilience, the tenacity, the discipline, the resolve, the patriotism of all of you. <p>For a decade, you have served under the dark cloud of war. You've endured great loss, and good men and women have given their last full measure of devotion. But we Americans are strong, and we are resilient, and we have resolve. And now we can see a light: the light of a new day on the horizon. And that's because of you. <p>The war in Iraq is over. The transition is underway in Afghanistan. Our troops will keep coming home. And we are keeping our military ready for whatever the future may hold. But know this, Bliss, we are moving forward stronger and more confident in knowing that when faced with great trials, we Americans do what we always do. We don't just endure, we emerge stronger than before. <p>And as we go forward as one Nation, if the American people ever need inspiration, they just have to look at Bliss. They need only to look at you. For in you, we see the best that our country has to offer: the virtues that have made America great for more than two centuries, and the values that will keep us great for centuries to come. <p>It's the belief that all men are created equal; that we are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, and that among these are life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It's the sense of duty that says our country and our freedoms are worth fighting for. It's the selflessness that says I don't care who gets the credit, but I'll do my part, and we'll get the job done. The trust in one another, knowing that when the chips are down, the person next to you has got your back and you've got theirs. The strength you draw from every part of our American family, every color, every creed, every background, every faith coming together, succeeding together, as one American team. <p>That's who you are. That's who we are. We are Americans. We pledge allegiance to the same proud flag. And we all love this country and all it represents to the world: the hope, the opportunity. And we stand united in support of our troops and your families. And when we stand together and when we work together, when we take care of each other, we remind ourselves, there's nothing we can't do, America's greatest days are yet to come, and that we remain the greatest force for freedom that the world has ever known. <p>So God bless you. God bless all our men and women in uniform. And God bless the United States of America.\" "
"193" "\"Hi, everybody. On Friday, I visited Fort Bliss in Texas, where I met with some of our extraordinary men and women in uniform to mark the second anniversary of the end of major combat in Iraq. <p>It was a chance to thank our troops for the outstanding work they've done over the last decade. Fort Bliss is home to soldiers who took part in every major phase of the Iraq war: from the initial assault on Baghdad, to the years of fighting block by block, to the partnership with the Iraqi people that helped give them a chance to forge their own destiny. <p>And while the war itself remains a source of controversy here at home, one thing will never be in doubt: The members of our Armed Forces are patriots in every sense of the word. They met every mission and performed every task that was asked of them with precision, commitment, and skill. And now, with no Americans fighting in Iraq, it's my privilege, on behalf of a grateful nation, to once again congratulate these men and women on a job well done. <p>This anniversary is a chance to appreciate how far we've come. But it's also a reminder that there is still difficult work ahead of us in Afghanistan. Some of the soldiers I met at Fort Bliss had just come home from the battlefield, and others are getting ready to ship out. <p>We've broken the Taliban's momentum in Afghanistan and begun the transition to an Afghan lead. Next month, the last of the troops I ordered as part of the surge against the Taliban will come home, and by 2014, the transition to Afghan lead will be complete. <p>But as long as we have a single American in harm's way, we will continue to do everything in our power to keep them safe and help them succeed. That means giving them a clear mission and the equipment they need on the frontlines. But it also means taking care of our veterans and their families. Because no one who fights for this country should have to fight for a job or a roof over their head when they come home. <p>I also told our soldiers at Bliss that part of honoring their service means strengthening the nation they fought so hard to protect. As we turn the page on a decade of war, it's time to do some nation-building here at home. <p>My grandfather's generation came back from World War II and helped form the backbone of the greatest middle class in history. They helped this country come back stronger than before. Today's veterans have the skills, the discipline, and the leadership skills to do the exact same thing, and it's our job to give them that chance. <p>It's time to build a nation that lives up to the ideals that so many Americans have fought for: a nation where they can realize the dream they sacrificed to protect. We need to rebuild our roads and runways and ports. We need to lay broadband lines across this country and put our veterans back to work as cops and firefighters in communities that need them. And we need to come together to make America a place where hard work is rewarded and anyone willing to put in the effort can make it if they try. <p>That's how we can honor our troops. That's the welcome home they've earned. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"194" "\"Well, good afternoon, everybody. I want to just say, first of all, how proud I am to be joined by Governor Jindal, Senator Mary Landrieu, Senator David Vitter, Representative Cedric Richmond. We've got Mayor Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans, Saint John the Baptist Parish President Natalie Robottom, and we've also got Saint John the Baptist Sheriff Mike Tregre. <p>As you can see, there has been enormous devastation in Saint John's Parish, and that's not the only place that's been hard hit. We've also seen enormous damage in Plaquemines Parish and in other parts of Louisiana and Mississippi. <p>I want to commend everybody who's here for the extraordinary work that they've done in making sure that lives were saved, that although there was tremendous property damage, people were in a position to get out quickly and, as you can see, folks are on the ground already clearing out the debris and making sure that they're able to recover as rapidly as possible. <p>I want to particularly thank FEMA and the State and local authorities, because sometimes in the past, we haven't seen the kind of coordination that is necessary in response to these kinds of disasters. This time we've seen it. We made sure that we had the disaster declarations happen quickly so that we weren't behind the eight ball. We've approved individual assistance for this area, which means that these folks, if they've suffered additional losses beyond what they're insured for, that they are potentially eligible for some help. We're going to be providing Saint John's the Baptist Parish with help in debris removal, in some of the other losses that have been suffered. <p>I particularly want to commend the sheriff and his team because they've been working around the clock saving lives. Some of the folks that we just walked by literally had to be saved by boat. They were in their homes, trapped. The waters came in so quickly. And this is an area that hadn't been flooded in 17 years, so as a consequence, folks just weren't anticipating and accustomed to the scale and scope of the destruction. But because of the great work of law enforcement, National Guard, Coast Guard, making sure that folks were out in rescue mode rapidly, even in some cases at risk to their own lives, no lives were lost. <p>And keep in mind that many of these folks who have been working so hard, they themselves suffered losses. So I've just been talking to the sheriff and his wife about the fact that they're having to do&mdash;actually, his wife is having to do exactly what these families are having to do while he's on the job. <p>A couple of final points I want to make. Obviously, right now we're still in recovery mode, and that means that our biggest priority is helping to house people who have been displaced, making sure that they've got the resources they need to reenroll their kids in school, make sure that they're able to get to their jobs, make sure that they can have the kind of support that they need to get restarted. That's in the short term. And I'm confident that with Craig Fugate and his team on the job, on the ground, that that's going to happen in a seamless fashion. <p>But we've got a larger issue involved here, and that is how do we anticipate these storms and how do we make sure that an area like Saint John's is protected when you have these kinds of disasters. The good news is, is that the Army Corps levees that were built around New Orleans and Jefferson Parish and some of these other areas worked very well and they were done expeditiously. And so what I've pledged to these folks is, we're going to make sure that at the Federal level we are getting on the case very quickly about figuring out what exactly happened here, what can we do to make sure that it doesn't happen again, and expediting some of the decisions that may need to be made to ensure that we've got the infrastructure in place to protect people's property and to protect people's lives. <p>So the final point I'll make is, one thing you know about folks in Louisiana, they are resilient. People in Mississippi, they are resilient. They know what tough times are like, but they know that they can bounce back. There is enormous faith here, enormous strength here. You could see it with these families. I mean, they were just devastated a few days ago, and they're already smiling and laughing and feeling confident about the future and pulling together. <p>We heard one story about one of these homes where a local church group came in and did all the work that was needed to strip out the damaged interior of the house. They did it not for any pay, weren't even asked. But they did it because they care about their neighbors and they care about their friends. <p>And that's what we do here in the United States of America, and that's what happens in Louisiana. When disasters like this happen, we set aside whatever petty disagreements we may have. Nobody is a Democrat or a Republican; we're all just Americans looking out for one another. And I couldn't be prouder of this group right here that's around me for the great work that they've done. <p>So thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"195" "\"Well, listen, everybody, thanks, first of all, for taking the time to join me on the call. And I just want to begin by saying how much I regret that we're not all gathering together in one place to deliver my acceptance speech tonight. <p>Obviously, I'm looking forward to laying out what are the stakes in this election and what my vision for the future is. And because of the nature of our campaign, we've always been about getting everybody involved: making sure everybody is participating and making sure everybody has got access. And that's why we took a chance in Denver 4 years ago, and that's why we wanted to take a chance when it came to North Carolina. <p>The problem was a safety issue. I could not ask you&mdash;our volunteers, our law enforcement, first-responders&mdash;to subject themselves to the risk of severe thunderstorms. And you guys can imagine, with all the magging that goes on and the security issues involved, getting 70,000 people into a place is tough; getting them out of there is even tougher. And if we had started seeing severe thunderstorms and lightning, in particular, it would have been a problem. And we would have had a situation where we were putting you guys at risk. <p>So I know it's disappointing. I've got to tell you, I saw some of my key staff who had come down here, and they've literally been working nonstop for months just getting the logistics of this all put together. And obviously, they were a little bit crestfallen. And I know it's especially disappointing for a lot of you who worked hard to get your tickets to the event or traveled or planned to travel a long way at your own expense to be here. <p>So all I can tell you is how much I appreciate everything that you've done. Some of you earned your tickets through the 9-3-1 program: 9 hours of volunteer work over 3 days for a community credential ticket. You've registered to vote. You've talked to your neighbors. You're doing unbelievable work that's making a difference in this close race. And you've also shown that there's plenty of enthusiasm out there. The issue in this election is not going to be enthusiasm, because I think about you all on buses and in carpools and airplanes traveling here to Charlotte. I know it's not just to see me, but it's also to see each other and to share common stories and hopes for this country, which is ultimately what this convention is really about. <p>So my main message is, we can't let a little thunder and lightning get us down. We're going to have to roll with it. And while we may not be able to be together in person, I hope you're still going to gather together at community watch parties that are happening not just here in Charlotte, but all across North Carolina, all across the rest of the country. I hope you tune in tonight, watch the speech together. Let me know what you think afterwards. <p>Obviously, so far, we've had an unbelievable convention. Michelle, what can I say? I'm a little biased, but she was unbelievable. And yesterday President Clinton, who I think broke down the issues as effectively as anybody could. To hear from ordinary Americans who tell the story of their lives from veterans to businesspeople to workers and to hear some of our great Governors and Members of Congress, I could not be prouder of the work that everybody has done. Mayor Castro from San Antonio is obviously just an incredible talent. <p>So I'm very proud of everybody and what they've been able to accomplish so far. And as I travel around the country over the next couple months, I hope we're going to be able to get together in your own towns, your own cities, and we're going to do everything we can to get you into events taking place near you. And our staffs are going to be in touch with you about that so that, hopefully, you'll have an even closer front row seat to the campaign, which won't be hard to do since you're part of the campaign. <p>And I'm so proud of the grassroots efforts all of you are doing, especially on voter registration. North Carolina, by the way, is exhibit A of the unbelievable work that's being done at the grassroots level. You guys are blowing it out when it comes to registering voters. <p>And we're going to have to work really hard over these next 2 months. I think, hopefully, at the end of this convention, people will say we accomplished what we needed to and have delivered our vision for the country and offered a clear contrast to what people saw in Tampa. But this is still going to be a really close election. And the other side is preparing to unleash just a barrage of negative ads. They're getting massive checks from wealthy donors. <p>The good thing is, I've got you. So I really need your help, guys. I need you to prove the cynics wrong one more time. I need you to remember that nothing is more powerful than the work that you guys do. Nothing is more powerful than voices calling for change. <p>I can't wait to share my vision for the future with all of you tonight, so I'm hoping you tune in. But most importantly, I just want you to know that this campaign has always been about you and what you guys can accomplish when you're working together. <p>And I hope that you have just a wonderful time with each other. It won't be as big a crowd, and it will be less fanfare and so forth than it would have been in a football stadium, but the spirit, that's the spirit that's in everybody's living rooms and small towns and big cities and suburbs all across the country. That's what got us here in the first place. That's what's going to keep us going and allow us to accomplish all the things we need to to strengthen the middle class. <p>So thank you, everybody. I'm proud of you. And I will be seeing you in your home States sometime soon.\" "
"196" "\"This week, we mark the 11th anniversary of the September 11 attacks. It's a time to remember the nearly 3,000 innocent men, women, and children we lost and the families that they left behind. It's a chance to honor the courage of the first-responders who risked their lives on that day and every day since. And it's an opportunity to give thanks for our men and women in uniform who have served and sacrificed&mdash;sometimes far from home&mdash;to keep our country safe. <p>This anniversary is about them. It's also a time to reflect on just how far we've come as a nation these past 11 years. <p>On that clear September morning, as America watched the towers fall and the Pentagon burn and the wreckage smoldering in a Pennsylvania field, we were filled with questions. Where had the attacks come from, and how would America respond? Would they fundamentally weaken the country we love? Would they change who we are? <p>The last decade has been a difficult one, but together, we have answered those questions and come back stronger as a nation. <p>We took the fight to Al Qaida, decimating their leadership, and put them on the path to defeat. And thanks to the courage and skill of our intelligence personnel and Armed Forces, Usama bin Laden will never threaten America again. <p>Instead of pulling back from the world, we've strengthened our alliances, while improving our security here at home. As Americans, we refuse to live in fear. Today, a new tower rises above the New York skyline. And our country is stronger, safer, and more respected in the world. <p>Instead of turning on each other, we resisted the temptation to give in to mistrust and suspicion. I've always said that America is at war with Al Qaida and its affiliates and we will never be at war with Islam or any other religion. We are the United States of America. Our freedom and diversity make us unique, and they will always be central to who we are as a nation. <p>Instead of changing who we are, the attacks have brought out the best in the American people. More than 5 million members of the 9/11 generation have worn America's uniform over the past decade, and we've seen an outpouring of good will towards our military, our veterans, and their families. Together, they've done everything we've asked of them. We've ended the war in Iraq and brought our troops home. We brought an end to the Taliban regime. We've trained Afghan security forces and forged a partnership with a new Afghan Government. And by the end of 2014, the transition in Afghanistan will be complete, and our war there will be over. <p>And finally, instead of turning inward with grief, we've honored the memory of those we lost by giving back to our communities, serving those in need, and reaffirming the values at the heart of who we are as a people. That's why we mark September 11 as a National Day of Service and Remembrance, because we are one American family. And we look out for each other, not just on the difficult days, but every day. <p>Eleven years later, that's the legacy of 9/11: the ability to say with confidence that no adversary and no act of terrorism can change who we are. We are Americans, and we will protect and preserve this country we love. On this solemn anniversary, let's remember those we lost, let us reaffirm the values they stood for, and let us keep moving forward as one Nation and one people.\" "
"197" "\"Secretary Panetta, General Dempsey, members of our Armed Forces, and most importantly, to the families&mdash;survivors and loved ones&mdash;of those we lost, Michelle and I are humbled to join you again on this solemn anniversary. <p>Today we remember a day that began like so many others. There were rides to school and commutes to work, early flights and familiar routines, quick hugs and quiet moments. It was a day like this one: a clear blue sky, but a sky that would soon be filled with clouds of smoke and prayers of a nation shaken to its core. <p>Even now, all these years later, it is easy for those of us who lived through that day to close our eyes and to find ourselves back there&mdash;and back here&mdash;back when grief crashed over us like an awful wave, when Americans everywhere held each other tight, seeking the reassurance that the world we knew wasn't crumbling under our feet. <p>Eleven times we have marked another September 11 come and gone. Eleven times, we have paused in remembrance, in reflection, in unity, and in purpose. <p>This is never an easy day. But it is especially difficult for all of you, the families of nearly 3,000 innocents who lost their lives: your mothers and fathers, your husbands and wives, your sons and your daughters. They were taken from us suddenly and far too soon. <p>To you and your families, the rest of us cannot begin to imagine the pain you've endured these many years. We will never fully understand how difficult it has been for you to carry on, to summon that strength, and to rebuild your lives. <p>But no matter how many years pass, no matter how many times we come together on this hallowed ground, know this: that you will never be alone. Your loved ones will never be forgotten. They will endure in the hearts of our Nation, because through their sacrifice, they helped us make the America we are today, an America that has emerged even stronger. <p>Most of the Americans we lost that day had never considered the possibility that a small band of terrorists halfway around the world could do us such harm. Most had never heard the name Al Qaida. And yet it's because of their sacrifice that we've come together and dealt a crippling blow to the organization that brought evil to our shores. Al Qaida's leadership has been devastated, and Usama bin Laden will never threaten us again. Our country is safer, and our people are resilient. <p>It's true that the majority of those who died on September 11 had never put on our country's uniform. And yet they inspired more than 5 million Americans&mdash;members of the 9/11 generation&mdash;to wear that uniform over the last decade. These men and women have done everything that we have asked. <p>Today, the war in Iraq is over. In Afghanistan, we're training Afghan security forces and forging a partnership with the Afghan people. And by the end of 2014, the longest war in our history will be over. Meanwhile, countless civilians have opened their hearts to our troops, our military families, and our veterans. <p>Eleven years ago, memorial services were held for Americans of different races and creeds, backgrounds and beliefs. And yet instead of turning us against each other, tragedy has brought us together. I've always said that our fight is with Al Qaida and its affiliates, not with Islam or any other religion. This country was built as a beacon of freedom and tolerance. That's what's made us strong, now and forever. <p>And finally, when those innocent souls were taken from us, they left behind an unfulfilled work and tasks that remain undone. And that's why, on a day when others sought to bring this country down, we choose to build it up with a National Day of Service and Remembrance. <p>Scripture tells us, \\"Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.\\" There's no better way to honor the best in those who died than by discovering the best in ourselves. <p>This anniversary allows us to renew our faith that even the darkest night gives way to a brighter dawn. Today we can come here to the Pentagon and touch these names and kneel beside a building where a single stone still bears the scars of that fire. We can visit the field of honor in Pennsylvania and remember the heroes who made it sacred. We can see water cascading into the footprints of the Twin Towers and gaze up at a new tower rising above the New York skyline. <p>And even though we may never be able to fully lift the burden carried by those left behind, we know that somewhere, a son is growing up with his father's eyes and a daughter has her mother's laugh, living reminders that those who died are with us still. <p>So as painful as this day is and always will be, it leaves us with a lesson: that no single event can ever destroy who we are. No act of terrorism can ever change what we stand for. Instead, we recommit ourselves to the values that we believe in, holding firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess. <p>That's the commitment that we reaffirm today. And that's why, when the history books are written, the true legacy of 9/11 will not be one of fear or hate or division. It will be a safer world, a stronger nation, and a people more united than ever before. <p>God bless the memories of those we lost, and God bless these United States of America.\" "
"198" "\"Good morning. Every day, all across the world, American diplomats and civilians work tirelessly to advance the interests and values of our Nation. Often, they are away from their families. Sometimes, they brave great danger. <p>Yesterday four of these extraordinary Americans were killed in an attack on our diplomatic post in Benghazi. Among those killed was our Ambassador, Chris Stevens, as well as Foreign Service Officer Sean Smith. We are still notifying the families of the others who were killed. And today the American people stand united in holding the families of the four Americans in our thoughts and in our prayers. <p>The United States condemns in the strongest terms this outrageous and shocking attack. We're working with the Government of Libya to secure our diplomats. I've also directed my administration to increase our security at diplomatic posts around the world. And make no mistake, we will work with the Libyan Government to bring to justice the killers who attacked our people. <p>Since our founding, the United States has been a nation that respects all faiths. We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. But there is absolutely no justification to this type of senseless violence. None. The world must stand together to unequivocally reject these brutal acts. <p>Already, many Libyans have joined us in doing so, and this attack will not break the bonds between the United States and Libya. Libyan security personnel fought back against the attackers alongside Americans. Libyans helped some of our diplomats find safety, and they carried Ambassador Stevens's body to the hospital, where we tragically learned that he had died. <p>It's especially tragic that Chris Stevens died in Benghazi because it is a city that he helped to save. At the height of the Libyan revolution, Chris led our diplomatic post in Benghazi. With characteristic skill, courage, and resolve, he built partnerships with Libyan revolutionaries and helped them as they planned to build a new Libya. When the Qaddafi regime came to an end, Chris was there to serve as our Ambassador to the new Libya, and he worked tirelessly to support this young democracy, and I think both Secretary Clinton and I relied deeply on his knowledge of the situation on the ground there. He was a role model to all who worked with him and to the young diplomats who aspire to walk in his footsteps. <p>Along with his colleagues, Chris died in a country that is still striving to emerge from the recent experience of war. And today the loss of these four Americans is fresh, but our memories of them linger on. I have no doubt that their legacy will live on through the work that they did far from our shores and in the hearts of those who love them back home. <p>Of course, yesterday was already a painful day for our Nation as we marked the solemn memory of the 9/11 attacks. We mourned with the families who were lost on that day. I visited the graves of troops who made the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan at the hallowed grounds of Arlington Cemetery and had the opportunity to say thank you and visit some of our wounded warriors at Walter Reed. And then last night we learned the news of this attack in Benghazi. <p>As Americans, let us never, ever forget that our freedom is only sustained because there are people who are willing to fight for it, to stand up for it, and in some cases, lay down their lives for it. Our country is only as strong as the character of our people and the service of those, both civilian and military, who represent us around the globe. <p>No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great Nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for. Today we mourn four more Americans who represent the very best of the United States of America. We will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act. And make no mistake, justice will be done. <p>But we also know that the lives these Americans led stand in stark contrast to those of their attackers. These four Americans stood up for freedom and human dignity. They should give every American great pride in the country that they served and the hope that our flag represents to people around the globe who also yearn to live in freedom and with dignity. <p>We grieve with their families, but let us carry on their memory, and let us continue their work of seeking a stronger America and a better world for all of our children. <p>Thank you. May God bless the memory of those we lost, and may God bless the United States of America.\" "
"199" "\"As we look forward to the beginning of the Jewish High Holidays Sunday night, I want to extend my warmest wishes to all those celebrating the New Year. <p>This is a joyful time for millions of people around the world. But Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are also opportunities for reflection. They represent a chance to take stock of our lives and look forward to the coming year with clear eyes and renewed purpose. <p>In that spirit, the Jewish tradition teaches us that one of the most important duties we have during this period is the act of reconciliation. We're called to seek each other out and make amends for those moments when we may not have lived up to our values as well as we should. <p>At a time when our public discourse can too often seem harsh; when society too often focuses on what divides us instead of what unites us; I hope that Americans of all faiths can take this opportunity to reach out to those who are less fortunate, to be tolerant of our neighbors, and to recognize ourselves in one another. And as a nation, let us be mindful of those who are suffering and renew the unbreakable bond we share with our friends and allies, including the State of Israel. <p>In that spirit, Michelle and I wish you and your families a sweet year full of health, happiness, and peace. <i>L'Shana Tovah</i>.\" "
"200" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hey! Thank you. I'm the Fan in Chief! [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>It is great to have Team U.S.A. here at the White House. And I want to thank Michelle for not teasing me too much, which is usually what she does in her introductions. It is true, I was pretty jealous of the fact that she had a chance to go to London. <p>But like millions of Americans, I had almost as much fun just following you guys from here and what you did. I usually work pretty late, but I've mastered the DVR&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;so I was able to catch a little bit of everything. It was a great way to end the day, watching you guys do things that I did not think were humanly possible. <p>So every morning when Michelle and I would work out, we'd talk about, did you see that thing? <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Yes, it was good. <p><i>The President.</i> That was unbelievable. [<i>Laughter</i>] And&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The First Lady.</i> It's true. <p><i>The President.</i>&mdash;&mdash;and then I'd jog on the treadmill. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I was inspired to watch you guys even though I couldn't do what you do. I was inspired a little: to run a little bit faster watching Tyson Gay and lift a little more after watching Holley Mangold or do a few more crunches after watching Michael Phelps and the other swimmers. [<i>Laughter</i>] Somehow, it didn't work quite on me, but&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. And wheelchair rugby, I'm just glad you guys aren't taking me out. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But most importantly, what you guys did was inspire us. You made us proud. And as President, you made me especially proud to see how you conducted yourself on a world stage. You could not have been better ambassadors and better representatives for the United States and what we stand for. <p>And one of the great things about watching our Olympics is we are a portrait of what this country is all about: people from every walk of life, every background, every race, every faith. It sends a message to the world about what makes America special. It speaks to the character of this group, how you guys carried yourselves. And it's even more impressive when you think about the obstacles that many of you have had to overcome not just to succeed at the Games, but to get there in the first place. <p>Thirteen years ago, Kari Miller was serving in the Army when her car was hit by a drunk driver. She lost both her legs. She went on to college and learned how to play sitting volleyball. Today she is the proud owner of two silver medals. <p>Lance Brooks is here. Leading up to the Olympic Games, he had a job pouring concrete for 12 hours a day and still managed to put in 2 more hours of training in the discus. <p>Katie Ledecky may have been swimming in London, but she still had to finish the summer reading assignments for her high school English class. [<i>Laughter</i>] Where's Katie? Yes, there she is. She brought some of her classmates here today. <p>And then there's Manteo Mitchell. Where is he? Now, this has to be one of my favorite stories of the whole Olympics&mdash;breaks his shin bone halfway through his lap on the 4 x 400 meter relay, but he finishes anyway in 46 seconds and helps the U.S. qualify for the final. Right here. Unbelievable. <p>So all of you have stories of determination and perseverance. All of you made incredible sacrifices to get here. <p>About a month ago, I was in Colorado Springs. We stopped by the Olympic Training Center, and I met a bunch of athletes, including some of the amazing Paralympians that were just about to head out. I got to meet some of the bobsledders who were working out together for the next Winter Olympics, and it was just amazing to see not only how hard people were training, but also to hear how much you guys get to eat during training&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;which I was very impressed with. <p>So I hope that all of you guys get some well-deserved time off over the next few months. But I know that pretty soon, many of you will be back in the gym or on the track or in the pool, thinking about Rio, because the Olympics is not just about what happens on the big stage in front of the cameras when the world is watching. It's about what's happening when nobody is watching. And that's what really counts. <p>As Olympians and Paralympians, you guys all find the strength to keep pushing on good days and bad days, because you believe that no matter where we come from or no matter what hand we've been dealt in life, with enough effort, there is no limit to how far we can go. <p>That's what sets all of you apart. That's what sets America apart. We celebrate individual effort, but we also know that together, we can do incredible things that we couldn't accomplish on our own. <p>So thank you for being such great role models, especially for our young people. We could not be prouder of you. You gave us a summer that we will never forget. It is a great honor to welcome you home. And I have told that&mdash;I've been told that I&mdash;because of my schedule, I'm not allowed to shake everybody's hands, but I am going to break the rule and try to shake as many as I can before I get dragged out of here. <p>So God bless you. Marine Band, let's hit the music! I love this!\" "
"201" "\"Scripture teaches us, \\"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\\" Glen Doherty never shied from adventure. He believed that, in his life, he could make a difference: a calling he fulfilled as a Navy SEAL. He served with distinction in Iraq and worked in Afghanistan. And there, in Benghazi, as he tended to others, he laid down his life, loyal as always, protecting his friends. Today Glen is home. <p>Tyrone Woods devoted 20 years of his life to the SEALs, the consummate \\"quiet professional.\\" At the Salty Frog bar, they might not have known, but Rone also served in Iraq and Afghanistan. And there, in Benghazi, he was far from Dorothy and Tyrone Jr., Hunter, and little Kai. And he laid down his life, as he would have for them, protecting his friends. And today Rone is home. <p>Sean Smith, it seems, lived to serve: first, in the Air Force, then, with you at the State Department. He knew the perils of this calling from his time in Baghdad. And there, in Benghazi, far from home, he surely thought of Heather and Samantha and Nathan. And he laid down his life in service to us all. Today Sean is home. <p>Chris Stevens was everything America could want in an Ambassador, as the whole country has come to see: how he first went to the region as a young man in the Peace Corps; how during the revolution, he arrived in Libya on that cargo ship; how he believed in Libya and its people and how they loved him back. And there, in Benghazi, he laid down his life for his friends&mdash;Libyan and American&mdash;and for us all. Today Chris is home. <p>Four Americans, four patriots&mdash;they loved this country, and they chose to serve it and served it well. They had a mission, and they believed in it. They knew the danger, and they accepted it. They didn't simply embrace the American ideal, they lived it. They embodied it: the courage, the hope, and yes, the idealism, that fundamental American belief that we can leave this world a little better than before. That's who they were, and that's who we are. If we want to truly honor their memory, that's who we must always be. <p>I know that this awful loss, the terrible images of recent days, the pictures we're seeing again today, have caused some to question this work. And there is no doubt, these are difficult days. In moments such as this&mdash;so much anger and violence&mdash;even the most hopeful among us must wonder. <p>But amid all the images of this week, I also think of the Libyans who took to the streets with homemade signs expressing their gratitude to an American who believed in what we could achieve together. I think of the man in Benghazi with his sign in English, a message he wanted all of us to hear. It said: \\"Chris Stevens was a friend to all Libyans. Chris Stevens was a friend.\\" <p>That's the message these four patriots sent. That's the message that each of you sends every day&mdash;civilians, military&mdash;to people in every corner of the world, that America is a friend and that we care not just about our own country, not just about our own interests, but about theirs; that even as voices of suspicion and mistrust seek to divide countries and cultures from one another, the United States of America will never retreat from the world. We will never stop working for the dignity and freedom that every person deserves, whatever their creed, whatever their faith. <p>That's the essence of American leadership. That's the spirit that sets us apart from other nations. This was their work in Benghazi, and this is the work we will carry on. <p>To you&mdash;their families and colleagues&mdash;to all Americans, know this: Their sacrifice will never be forgotten. We will bring to justice those who took them from us. We will stand fast against the violence on our diplomatic missions. We will continue to do everything in our power to protect Americans serving overseas, whether that means increasing security at our diplomatic posts, working with host countries, which have an obligation to provide security, and making it clear that justice will come to those who harm Americans. <p>Most of all, even in our grief, we will be resolute. For we are Americans, and we hold our head high knowing that because of these patriots&mdash;because of you&mdash;this country that we love will always shine as a light unto the world. <p>\\"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\\" <p>The flag they served under now carries them home. May God bless the memory of these men who laid down their lives for us all, may God watch over your families and all who loved them, and may God bless these United States of America.\" "
"202" "\"This week in Libya, we lost four of our fellow Americans. Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods, Sean Smith, and Chris Stevens were all killed in an outrageous attack on our diplomatic post in Benghazi. <p>These four Americans represented the very best of our country. <p>Glen and Tyrone had each served America as Navy SEALs for many years, before continuing their service providing security for our diplomats in Libya. They died as they lived their lives: defending their fellow Americans and advancing the values that all of us hold dear. <p>Sean also started his service in uniform, in the Air Force. He then spent years at the State Department, on several continents, always answering his country's call. And Ambassador Chris Stevens died a hero in two countries: here in the United States, where he inspired those of us who knew him, and in Libya, a country that he helped to save, where he ultimately laid down his life. <p>On Friday, I was able to tell their families how much the American people appreciated their service. Without people like them, America could not sustain the freedoms we enjoy, the security we demand, and the leadership that the entire world counts on. <p>As we mourn their loss, we must also send a clear and resolute message to the world: Those who attack our people will find no escape from justice. We will not waver in their pursuit. And we will never allow anyone to shake the resolve of the United States of America. <p>This tragic attack takes place at a time of turmoil and protest in many different countries. I have made it clear that the United States has a profound respect for people of all faiths. We stand for religious freedom. And we reject the denigration of any religion, including Islam. <p>But there is never any justification for violence. There is no religion that condones the targeting of innocent men and women. There is no excuse for attacks on our Embassies and consulates. And so long as I am Commander in Chief, the United States will never tolerate efforts to harm our fellow Americans. <p>Right now we are doing whatever we can to protect Americans who are serving abroad. We are in contact with the governments around the globe to strengthen our cooperation and underscore that every nation has a responsibility to help us protect our people. We have moved forward with an effort to see that justice is done for those we lost, and we will not rest until that work is done. <p>Most of all, we must reaffirm that we will carry on the work of our fallen heroes. <p>I know the images on our televisions are disturbing. But let us never forget that for every angry mob, there are millions who yearn for the freedom and dignity and hope that our flag represents. That is the cause of America: the ideals that took root in our founding, the opportunity that drew so many to our shores, and the awesome progress that we have promoted all across the globe. <p>We are Americans. We know that our spirit cannot be broken and the foundation of our leadership cannot be shaken. That is the legacy of the four Americans we lost, men who will live on in the hearts of those they loved and the strength of the country they served. <p>So with their memory to guide us, we will carry forward the work of making our country stronger, our citizens safer, and the world a better and more hopeful place. Thank you.\" "
"203" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, AFL-CIO! It is good to be back in Ohio. Good to see my brothers and sisters in labor. <p>I want to start off by saying you've got an outstanding leader in Tim. Give him a big round of applause. Love what he's doing. But you are also&mdash;I was going to say lucky, but you're also wise to have somebody who fights on your behalf every single day in the halls of Capitol Hill, and that is your outstanding Senator, Sherrod Brown. <p>Now, you guys have a seat, have a seat, have a seat. I am not going to be long, but I'll admit, we didn't necessarily know what you guys were up to until, kind of, the last minute. And I said, well, I can't leave Ohio without seeing my friends at the AFL-CIO. <p>And it's pretty&mdash;it's timely to be able to see you, because I was in Cincinnati today, came up to Columbus this afternoon, and in both places, we announced the work that we've done, in conjunction with Sherrod, to make sure that we're filing a new WTO case challenging China's illegal trade and subsidies in autos and auto parts. <p>My attitude is, when other countries don't play by the rules, we're going to stand up to them, which is why we've actually filed twice as many cases as the previous administration; won every case that has been decided. So we were able to stop some of these cheap tire imports that were coming into this country unfairly; make sure that a thousand jobs right here in the United States were maintained. It's the reason that we are going to keep on pressing to make sure that they are playing by the rules, because my attitude is the United States of America has the best workers on Earth, we've got the best businesses on Earth, and if they are competing fairly, we will win every single time. That's what I believe. <p>You may have noticed the guy who's running against me&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> Don't boo, vote. Vote. <p>He has been running around, talking about how he's going to get tough with China. Now, this is a guy who started off investing in companies that are called \\"pioneers\\" in the business of outsourcing jobs to countries like China. So I don't think that we can have a lot of confidence if 7 weeks before an election, he suddenly says he wants to get tough on China, when his entire history has been feeling pretty comfortable with seeing jobs shipped to China. In fact, on that tire case, he complained that I was being protectionist. <p>And so now, all of a sudden, he is going to go around trying to claim the mantle of fighting for the American working man and woman. This gives you some sense of what is at stake in this election. And we've got two fundamentally different visions about how we move this country forward. <p>They are peddling the same top-down economics that got us into this mess in the first place. You ask them, what's your ideas to build this economy, they'll tell you, well, we've got tax cuts in the morning and tax cuts at night&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;tax cuts when there's peace and tax cuts when there's war. In between, we'll roll back some regulations and try to bust some unions, and then we'll go back to some more tax cuts. That's their entire agenda. <p>Well, we've got a different vision. We want to restore that basic bargain in America that says if you work hard, you can make it; that says if you're acting responsibly and looking after your family and willing to put in the effort, you can afford a home that you can call your own, you have a job that pays the bills; that you won't have to worry about going bankrupt if you get sick; that you'll be able to retire with some dignity and some respect. And you'll be able to save up enough to help your kids do even better than you did. <p>That's what the union movement's been about. That's what America has been about. That's what built the middle class. That's what built our economy. That's what we're fighting for. And we're not going backwards. We're going forward. That's what this election is about. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! <p><i>The President.</i> And the nice thing is when you make this choice, you've got a track record to look at. When I came into office, the first thing I did was overturn bans on project labor agreements on Federal&mdash;in Federally funded construction, expanded Davis-Bacon coverage in the Recovery Act, appointed folks to the NLRB who actually recognize that their jobs is to be fair and decent brokers and to understand that you should be thinking a little bit about labor if you're a member of the NLRB. <p>We made fair pay protections the law of the land, because my attitude is, if a woman is in there working just as hard on that assembly line or on that construction site, she should get paid just like a man does. <p>We committed to doubling our Nation's exports so we're not just sending jobs overseas; we should be sending products overseas, keeping those jobs right here in the United States of America. <p>When some folks said let's let Detroit go bankrupt, I said we've got a million jobs on the line, a whole bunch of them right here in Ohio. And so we placed our bet on American workers, and now the American auto industry has come roaring back, hiring 250,000 folks back on the job all throughout the Midwest. <p>We're making investments in entire new industries: in clean energy, folks making wind turbines, building long-lasting batteries. We are investing in our community colleges to make sure that folks are trained for the jobs of the future. That's the vision that we've got. We believe that America grows best when everybody has got a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share and everybody is playing by the same rules, from Main Street to Wall Street to Washington, DC. <p>That's what we're fighting for. That's why I'm running for a second term. That's why I intend to win Ohio. That's why I intend to win this election. I'm going to need your help. I hope you are ready, because I'm just getting started. And if we win Ohio, we win this election. If we win this election, we'll finish what we started, and we will work on behalf of the working men and women of this country, and we'll remind the world by the United States of America is the greatest nation on Earth. <p>Let's get to work. Seven more weeks. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"204" "\"Hello, everybody! Hello! Please, everybody, have a seat. Have a seat. <p>Welcome to the White House, and congratulations to the Minnesota Lynx on winning their first-ever WNBA championship. These women have brought glory back to the Twin Cities. I know there are a lot of fans at home who are happy to have a professional title back in Minnesota. <p>This team has come a long way to get here. Just 2 years ago, the Lynx had the worst record in the WNBA. I'm just saying. [<i>Laughter</i>] But they didn't let it get them down. They got to work. GM Roger Griffith is here, and he'll tell you that it was hard work for him too. <p>It helped that the team drafted UConn standout Maya Moore&mdash;she is becoming a regular here; I mean, this is like the fourth time she's shown up at the White House; she just somehow likes to attract hardware&mdash;picked up veterans like Rebekkah Brunson and Lindsay Whalen, and Cheryl Reeve took over as head coach and has done an extraordinary job. <p>Apparently, that was the recipe to go from worst to first. By the end of the season, Maya was Rookie of the Year; Lindsay led the league in assists; Cheryl was Coach of the Year. The team had the best record in the league. They made their home games the hottest ticket in town. Then, just in case anyone doubted their dominance, they marched through the playoffs, losing only one game and sweeping their final two series. That is one heck of a turnaround. <p>In the championship series, the Lynx faced a very tough Atlanta Dream, but they were ready. I hear they brought in a bunch of men who played in college to imitate the Dream in practice so they could get an extra edge. And those were some brave guys, because I wouldn't want to take any of these ladies on. [<i>Laughter</i>] I've had the pleasure of playing with Maya, and she lit everybody up. It is not fun when she's raining down jumpers on you. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But obviously, it worked. And in the finals, the Lynx came back from three consecutive first-half deficits and took home the championship trophy. They won it on the shooting of Seimone Augustus, who averaged nearly 25 points a game and, after leading the scoring charge in the final game, was named, not surprisingly, Finals MVP. And they won it on the heart and grit of Taj McWilliams-Franklin. \\"Mama\\" Taj played the final game on a sprained knee and still managed to secure the paint and pull down four rebounds. <p>So there's no question that these are some outstanding basketball players. But they also find the time to raise money for breast cancer research, help local students with reading. I hear they clean up pretty well for their Catwalk for a Cure fashion show. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So this team does it all, and they do it in style. And I appreciate the Lynx taking time to stop by today, because they're in the middle of their season right now. And they've picked up right where they left off: on top of the Western Conference by a wide margin. Coach just told me that they've now secured home court advantage throughout the playoffs. With three games to go, best record in the league, they're leading the league in points, rebounds, assists. So you've got the idea: They're pretty good. And I have a feeling that we might end up seeing them back here before long. <p>And finally, I was saying to these folks as I was backstage, as the husband of a tall good-looking woman, and as the father of two tall fabulous girls, it is just wonderful to have these young ladies as role models. There's something about women's athletics. We know for a fact that when girls are involved in athletics, they do better across the board: They're more confident; they do better in school; they have less social problems. We know all the statistics, but what's also true is that our women athletes just present themselves so well and are such great ambassadors for the game. And as I was pointing out, you don't see them on SportsCenter doing stupid stuff. [<i>Laughter</i>] They play the game the right way. They compete fiercely, but they're good&mdash;great sportswomen. And so they're just wonderful examples for my daughters and my niece and for so many parents. I think we all feel really, really great about what the WNBA has accomplished, but what this team in particular has accomplished. <p>So I want to say thank you to all of you, congratulations. I'm going to invite Coach to come up and just say a few words.\" "
"205" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you, Jane. Thank you, AARP. I want to thank Barry and the entire AARP for everything you do on behalf of America's seniors. <p>And today is especially poignant for me I think because I can't help to think about my grandmother Madelyn Dunham. During World War II, she worked on a bomber assembly line, with a baby at home, while her husband was off serving his country. And in the postwar years, she worked her way from a secretary to vice president at her local bank. And later, she helped raise my mother and then obviously helped raise me and my sister. <p>She was a great citizen who lived up to her responsibilities. And after a lifetime of hard work, what she hoped for in return was to be able to live out her golden years with dignity and security and to see her grandchildren and her great-grandchildren have a better life. <p>And she was fiercely independent, so she didn't want a lot of help from me or anybody else. She just wanted to make sure that the work she had put in was going to pay off. And I'm thinking a lot about her these days because we lost my grandmother 3 days before I was elected to this office, back in 2008. But rewarding those hopes that she and so many other Americans shared&mdash;restoring the basic bargain that says if you work hard, that work will pay off&mdash;is one of the reasons I ran for this office in the first place. The values that she taught me are part of what has driven me over the last 4 years <p>Now, we've come a long way, but we're not there yet. And that's why I'm asking you for a second term as President. <p>There's been a lot of talk about Medicare and Social Security in this campaign, as there should be. And these are bedrock commitments that America makes to its seniors, and I consider those commitments unshakeable. But given the conversations that have been out there in the political arena lately, I want to emphasize Medicare and Social Security are not handouts. You've paid into these programs your whole lives. You've earned them. And as President, it's my job to make sure that Medicare and Social Security remain strong for today's seniors and for future generations. <p>It probably won't surprise you, though, that there's a lot of talk about Medicare and Social Security that hasn't been completely on the level over the last several months. So here's what you need to know: <p>I have strengthened Medicare as President. We've added years to the life of the program by getting rid of taxpayer subsidies to insurance companies that weren't making people healthier. And we used those savings to lower prescription drug costs, and to offer seniors on Medicare new preventive services like cancer screenings and wellness services. <p>In fact, the health reform law we passed has already saved more than 5.5 million seniors and people with disabilities nearly $4.5 billion on their prescription drugs. Seniors who received a discount have saved an average of more than $600 this year alone. And over the next 10 years, we expect the average Medicare beneficiary to save nearly $5,000 as a result of this law. <p>Now, my opponents have pledged to repeal these savings and benefits in their first day on the job, which means billions in new profits for insurance companies, but also would mean immediately increased costs for seniors and would bankrupt the Medicare trust fund in just 4 years. And what would they replace it with? Their plan replaces guaranteed Medicare benefits with a voucher that wouldn't keep up with costs. <p>And when they tell you that their plan lets you keep your doctor, they're leaving out one thing, and that's the facts. A new study says that under their plan, if just 5 percent of seniors switch to private plans, 40 percent of doctors who currently take Medicare would stop accepting it. So think about that. Millions of seniors would be forced to change doctors. <p>I don't consider this approach bold or particularly courageous; I just think it's a bad idea. No American should ever spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies. They should retire with the care and the dignity that they have earned. <p>Now, we do have to reform and strengthen Medicare for the long haul, but we're going to do it by reducing the costs of care, not by asking seniors to pay thousands of dollars more while we're giving millionaires and billionaires a massive new tax cut. <p>And when it comes to Social Security, we've got to keep the promise of Social Security by taking responsible steps to strengthen it, not by turning it over to Wall Street. Now, the last time the other side was in charge, my opponent's running mate wrote a bill that would have privatized Social Security. And after what happened on Wall Street just 4 years ago, does anybody actually think that's a good idea? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Most seniors rely on Social Security for most of their income. It keeps 20 million Americans out of poverty each and every year. And while it's not the cause of today's deficits, we do need to strengthen the program for the coming decades. And that means folks on both sides need to come together around a balanced plan. <p>My opponent claims that to pay for a new $5 trillion tax cut skewed towards the very top, he'd just close tax loopholes for the very wealthy. But independent experts say there's no way to do that without also cutting deductions that the middle class relies on, and that includes taxing things like Social Security benefits. And this could mean higher taxes for seniors on Social Security, including taxing benefits for seniors who make less than $32,000 a year for the first time ever. Nearly 30 million seniors could see their taxes go up by hundreds of dollars. <p>So I want you all to know at AARP, I'm not going to let that happen. My plan calls for both parties to come together and take responsible steps to preserve Social Security for the long run. And we'll do it in a way that ensures a lifetime of hard work is rewarded with dignity and security for generations to come. <p>So you guys have a big choice in this election, and these are the paths&mdash;the two paths our country can take. We can spend trillions of dollars on tax cuts targeted towards the wealthiest Americans, which could result in cuts to benefits that you've worked a lifetime to earn. Or we can take a balanced approach to invest in the middle class and strengthen Medicare and Social Security for you and your children and your grandchildren. That's the choice in this election, and that's why I'm asking for your vote. <p>So thanks so much, AARP, for having me. And with that, Jane, I'm ready to take some questions. <p><i>AARP Moderator Jane Pauley. </i>Mr. President, Jane Pauley here again. I'm back in the hall with our members, and they do have some questions for you. I'd like to explain here in the hall that&mdash;what a satellite delay is. When I ask a question, it goes up there, and then it comes down. There's about a second-and-a-half delay between my delivering a question and the President hearing it. Just so you know the drill and a little inside stuff on television. <p>Mr. President, we are so grateful that you can stay with us a few minutes longer. <p>Mike, from Brier, Washington, asks, \\"How will you reduce the Federal debt and not gut Social Security and Medicare?\\" <p><i>The President.</i> Well, it's a great question, Mike, and I appreciate it. We have a genuine challenge in bringing our deficit down and reducing our debt, and I think it's important for folks to know that 90 percent of the debt and deficits that we're seeing right now are the result of choices that were made over the course of the last decade: two wars that weren't paid for, tax cuts skewed towards the wealthy that were not paid for. So we made some decisions, and then when the great recession hit, that meant more money was going out and not as much money was coming in, and that has blown up our deficit and our debt. <p>The key to reducing it is to do it in a balanced, responsible way. So I've put forward a $4 trillion, deficit-reduction plan which would bring our deficits down to a manageable level and begin the work of bringing our debt down, and it involves making some tough choices. So I've already signed a trillion dollars' worth of cuts, programs that we don't need, programs that, frankly, are not helping people get more opportunity or creating pathways for success for middle class families or those who are striving to get into the middle class. <p>But after those cuts are made and some additional cuts are made, the only way to reach that $4 trillion target is to also ask the wealthiest among us to do a little bit more. So what I've suggested is, is that we go back for people whose incomes are above $250,000 to go back to the tax rates that existed when Bill Clinton was President, which, by the way, was a time when we created 23 million new jobs, went from a deficit to a surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot. <p>Now, this contrasts with the plan that my opponent is putting forward for deficit reduction. And some of you may have seen President Clinton speak at the convention: What's missing from it is arithmetic, because what they're proposing is not only to extend the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, but then they want to add another $5 trillion tax cut on top of that, and $2 trillion in additional defense spending that our Joint Chiefs of Staff say doesn't make sense at a time when we're winding down two wars. <p>So before they even start digging us out of the hole that we're in, they've just added to the hole with $7 trillion in additional spending on tax cuts or on defense. Now, they haven't explained how they would pay for that, but independent analysts who have looked at it have said the only way you pay for this is not only to gut investments in education, in basic research that could help find cures for cancer or Alzheimer's, to not invest in our infrastructure, but it also means that you're going to have to impose a higher tax burden on middle class families: up to $2,000 a year for families with children. <p>And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, if you're looking at figuring out how to pay for that $5 trillion tax cut, part of what you'd also start looking at is taxing Social Security benefits, or turning Medicare into a voucher program. And that is not the right approach to take. <p>My attitude is that if we're going to work together to bring down our deficit, everybody has got to do their fair share, everybody has got to do their part. And for us to have new tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires to pay for cuts in Social Security or Medicare or education is just not the right way to go. <p><i>Ms. Pauley. </i>Mr. President, from Washington DC, Paulette asks a question. She says: \\"If one makes $106 [thousand; White House correction.] "
"206" "\"Hi, everybody. Last week, without much fanfare, Members of the House of Representatives banged a gavel, turned out the lights, and rushed home, declaring their work finished for now. <p>If that frustrates you, it should, because their work isn't finished. <p>See, when they skipped town, Members of Congress left a whole bunch of proposals sitting on the table: actions that would create jobs, boost our economy, and strengthen middle class security. These ideas have been around for months. The American people want to see them passed. But apparently, some Members of Congress are more worried about their jobs and their paychecks this campaign season than they are about yours. <p>Right now if Congress had done the right thing, we could be on our way to having a veterans jobs corps that helps returning heroes find work as cops and firefighters in communities all across the country. These men and women have made incredible sacrifices for our country. They shouldn't have to worry about finding a job when they get home. But last week, Republicans in Congress voted it down. And then they left. <p>Right now if Congress had gotten its act together, we would have a farm bill to help farmers and ranchers respond to natural disasters like the drought we had this summer. And we'd have made necessary reforms to give our rural communities some long-term certainty. But so far, Republicans in Congress have dragged their feet. And now they're gone. <p>Right now if Congress had acted, thousands of responsible homeowners could be saving an extra $3,000 a year on their mortgages by refinancing at historically low rates. But instead, Republicans in Congress decided that working families could wait. And now they'll have to wait a little longer. <p>And finally, if Congress had listened to you, they could have given 98 percent of Americans and 97 percent of small-business owners a guarantee that your taxes won't go up next year by a single dime. This is something we all agree on. It should have gotten done a long time ago. But Republicans in Congress have refused to budge. They're holding tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans hostage until we pass tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. And now middle class families and small-business owners are left wondering what their tax bill will look like next year. <p>All of these ideas would strengthen our economy and help the middle class right now. All of them are supported by Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. There's no reason to wait. <p>That's why, after going home and listening to their constituents for a few weeks, Members of Congress should come back in November and do this work. They should do the right thing for veterans and farmers, for responsible homeowners and small businesses, for Americans everywhere who are just trying to get ahead. <p>And if you agree with me, I need your help. Tell your Members of Congress you can't afford to wait any longer. If you get an answering machine, leave a message. If you see them campaigning back home, tell them in person. Because there's been enough talk. It's time for action. That's what you deserve, and that's what it's going to take to move this country forward. <p>Thanks, and have a wonderful weekend.\" "
"207" "\"Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, fellow delegates, ladies and gentleman: I would like to begin today by telling you about an American named Chris Stevens. <p>Chris was born in a town called Grass Valley, California, the son of a lawyer and a musician. As a young man, Chris joined the Peace Corps and taught English in Morocco. And he came to love and respect the people of North Africa and the Middle East. He would carry that commitment throughout his life. As a diplomat, he worked from Egypt to Syria, from Saudi Arabia to Libya. He was known for walking the streets of the cities where he worked, tasting the local food, meeting as many people as he could, speaking Arabic, listening with a broad smile. <p>Chris went to Benghazi in the early days of the Libyan revolution, arriving on a cargo ship. As America's representative, he helped the Libyan people as they coped with violent conflict, cared for the wounded, and crafted a vision for the future in which the rights of all Libyans would be respected. And after the revolution, he supported the birth of a new democracy, as Libyans held elections and built new institutions and began to move forward after decades of dictatorship. <p>Chris Stevens loved his work. He took pride in the country he served, and he saw dignity in the people that he met. And 2 weeks ago, he traveled to Benghazi to review plans to establish a new cultural center and modernize a hospital. That's when America's compound came under attack. Along with three of his colleagues, Chris was killed in the city that he helped to save. He was 52 years old. <p>I tell you this story because Chris Stevens embodied the best of America. Like his fellow Foreign Service officers, he built bridges across oceans and cultures and was deeply invested in the international cooperation that the United Nations represents. He acted with humility, but he also stood up for a set of principles, a belief that individuals should be free to determine their own destiny and live with liberty, dignity, justice, and opportunity. <p>The attacks on the civilians in Benghazi were attacks on America. We are grateful for the assistance we received from the Libyan Government and from the Libyan people. There should be no doubt that we will be relentless in tracking down the killers and bringing them to justice. And I also appreciate that in recent days, the leaders of other countries in the region, including Egypt, Tunisia, and Yemen, have taken steps to secure our diplomatic facilities and called for calm. And so have religious authorities around the globe. <p>But understand, the attacks of the last 2 weeks are not simply an assault on America. They are also an assault on the very ideals upon which the United Nations was founded: the notion that people can resolve their differences peacefully; that diplomacy can take the place of war; that in an interdependent world, all of us have a stake in working towards greater opportunity and security for our citizens. <p>If we are serious about upholding these ideals, it will not be enough to put more guards in front of an embassy or to put out statements of regret and wait for the outrage to pass. If we are serious about these ideals, we must speak honestly about the deeper causes of the crisis, because we face a choice between the forces that would drive us apart and the hopes that we hold in common. <p>Today, we must reaffirm that our future will be determined by people like Chris Stevens, and not by his killers. Today, we must declare that this violence and intolerance has no place among our United Nations. <p>It has been less than 2 years since a vendor in Tunisia set himself on fire to protest the oppressive corruption in his country and sparked what became known as the Arab Spring. And since then, the world has been captivated by the transformation that's taken place, and the United States has supported the forces of change. <p>We were inspired by the Tunisian protests that toppled a , dictator, because we recognized our own beliefs in the aspiration of men and women who took to the streets. <p>We insisted on change in Egypt, because our support for democracy ultimately put us on the side of the people. <p>We supported a transition of leadership in Yemen, because the interests of the people were no longer being served by a corrupt status quo. <p>We intervened in Libya alongside a broad coalition, and with the mandate of the United Nations Security Council, because we had the ability to stop the slaughter of innocents, and because we believed that the aspirations of the people were more powerful than a tyrant. <p>And as we meet here, we again declare that the regime of Bashar al-Asad must come to an end so that the suffering of the Syrian people can stop and a new dawn can begin. <p>We have taken these positions because we believe that freedom and self-determination are not unique to one culture. These are not simply American values or Western values, they are universal values. And even as there will be huge challenges to come with a transition to democracy, I am convinced that ultimately government of the people, by the people, and for the people is more likely to bring about the stability, prosperity, and individual opportunity that serve as a basis for peace in our world. <p>So let us remember that this is a season of progress. For the first time in decades, Tunisians, Egyptians, and Libyans voted for new leaders in elections that were credible, competitive, and fair. This democratic spirit has not been restricted to the Arab world. Over the past year, we've seen peaceful transitions of power in Malawi and Senegal, and a new President in Somalia. In Burma, a President has freed political prisoners and opened a closed society, a courageous dissident has been elected to Parliament, and people look forward to further reform. Around the globe, people are making their voices heard, insisting on their innate dignity and the right to determine their future. <p>And yet the turmoil of recent weeks reminds us that the path to democracy does not end with the casting of a ballot. Nelson Mandela once said: \\"To be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.\\" <p>True democracy demands that citizens cannot be thrown in jail because of what they believe and that businesses can be opened without paying a bribe. It depends on the freedom of citizens to speak their minds and assemble without fear and on the rule of law and due process that guarantees the rights of all people. <p>In other words, true democracy&mdash;real freedom&mdash;is hard work. Those in power have to resist the temptation to crack down on dissidents. In hard economic times, countries must be tempted&mdash;may be tempted to rally the people around perceived enemies, at home and abroad, rather than focusing on the painstaking work of reform. <p>Moreover, there will always be those that reject human progress: dictators who cling to power, corrupt interests that depend on the status quo, and extremists who fan the flames of hate and division. From Northern Ireland to South Asia, from Africa to the Americas, from the Balkans to the Pacific rim, we've witnessed convulsions that can accompany transitions to a new political order. <p>At time, the conflicts arise along the fault lines of race or tribe. And often they arise from the difficulties of reconciling tradition and faith with the diversity and interdependence of the modern world. In every country, there are those who find different religious beliefs threatening; in every culture, those who love freedom for themselves must ask themselves how much they're willing to tolerate freedom for others. <p>That is what we saw play out in the last 2 weeks, as a crude and disgusting video sparked outrage throughout the Muslim world. Now, I have made it clear that the United States Government had nothing to do with this video, and I believe its message must be rejected by all who respect our common humanity. <p>It is an insult not only to Muslims, but to America as well, for as the city outside these walls makes clear, we are a country that has welcomed people of every race and every faith. We are home to Muslims who worship across our country. We not only respect the freedom of religion, we have laws that protect individuals from being harmed because of how they look or what they believe. We understand why people take offense to this video, because millions of our citizens are among them. <p>I know there are some who ask why we don't just ban such a video. And the answer is enshrined in our laws: Our Constitution protects the right to practice free speech. <p>Here in the United States, countless publications provoke offense. Like me, the majority of Americans are Christian, and yet we do not ban blasphemy against our most sacred beliefs. As President of our country and Commander in Chief of our military, I accept that people are going to call me awful things every day&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and I will always defend their right to do so. <p>Americans have fought and died around the globe to protect the right of all people to express their views, even views that we profoundly disagree with. We do not do so because we support hateful speech, but because our Founders understood that without such protections, the capacity of each individual to express their own views and practice their own faith may be threatened. We do so because in a diverse society, efforts to restrict speech can quickly become a tool to silence critics and oppress minorities. <p>We do so because given the power of faith in our lives, and the passion that religious differences can inflame, the strongest weapon against hateful speech is not repression, it is more speech, the voices of tolerance that rally against bigotry and blasphemy and lift up the values of understanding and mutual respect. <p>Now, I know that not all countries in this body share this particular understanding of the protection of free speech. We recognize that. But in 2012, at a time when anyone with a cell phone can spread offensive views around the world with the click of a button, the notion that we can control the flow of information is obsolete. The question, then, is how do we respond? <p>And on this we must agree: There is no speech that justifies mindless violence. There are no words that excuse the killing of innocents. There's no video that justifies an attack on an embassy. There's no slander that provides an excuse for people to burn a restaurant in Lebanon or destroy a school in Tunis or cause death and destruction in Pakistan. <p>In this modern world, with modern technologies, for us to respond in that way to hateful speech empowers any individual who engages in such speech to create chaos around the world. We empower the worst of us if that's how we respond. <p>More broadly, the events of the last 2 weeks also speak to the need for all of us to honestly address the tensions between the West and the Arab world that is moving towards democracy. <p>Now, let me be clear: Just as we cannot solve every problem in the world, the United States has not and will not seek to dictate the outcome of democratic transitions abroad. We do not expect other nations to agree with us on every issue, nor do we assume that the violence of the past weeks or the hateful speech by some individuals represent the views of the overwhelming majority of Muslims, any more than the views of the people who produced this video represents those of Americans. However, I do believe that it is the obligation of all leaders in all countries to speak out forcefully against violence and extremism. <p>It is time to marginalize those who, even when not directly resorting to violence, use hatred of America or the West or Israel as the central organizing principle of politics. For that only gives cover, and sometimes makes an excuse, for those who do resort to violence. <p>That brand of politics&mdash;one that pits East against West and South against North, Muslims against Christians and Hindu and Jews&mdash;can't deliver on the promise of freedom. To the youth, it offers only false hope. Burning an American flag does nothing to provide a child an education. Smashing apart a restaurant does not fill an empty stomach. Attacking an embassy won't create a single job. That brand of politics only makes it harder to achieve what we must do together: educating our children and creating the opportunities that they deserve, protecting human rights and extending democracy's promise. <p>Understand, America will never retreat from the world. We will bring justice to those who harm our citizens and our friends, and we will stand with our allies. We are willing to partner with countries around the world to deepen ties of trade and investment and science and technology, energy and development&mdash;all efforts that can spark economic growth for all our people and stabilize democratic change. <p>But such efforts depend on a spirit of mutual interest and mutual respect. No government or company, no school or NGO will be confident working in a country where its people are endangered. For partnerships to be effective, our citizens must be secure and our efforts must be welcomed. <p>A politics based only on anger&mdash;one based on dividing the world between \\"us\\" and \\"them\\"&mdash;not only sets back international cooperation, it ultimately undermines those who tolerate it. All of us have an interest in standing up to these forces. <p>Let us remember that Muslims have suffered the most at the hands of extremism. On the same day our civilians were killed in Benghazi, a Turkish police officer was murdered in Istanbul only days before his wedding; more than 10 Yemenis were killed in a car bomb in Sana'a; several Afghan children were mourned by their parents just days after they were killed by a suicide bomber in Kabul. <p>The impulse towards intolerance and violence may initially be focused on the West, but over time, it cannot be contained. The same impulses towards extremism are used to justify war between Sunni and Shi'a, between tribes and clans. It leads not to strength and prosperity, but to chaos. In less than 2 years, we have seen largely peaceful protests bring more change to Muslim-majority countries than a decade of violence. And extremists understand this. Because they have nothing to offer to improve the lives of people, violence is their only way to stay relevant. They don't build; they only destroy. <p>It is time to leave the call of violence and the politics of division behind. On so many issues, we face a choice between the promise of the future or the prisons of the past. And we cannot afford to get it wrong. We must seize this moment. And America stands ready to work with all who are willing to embrace a better future. <p>The future must not belong to those who target Coptic Christians in Egypt, it must be claimed by those in Tahrir Square who chanted, \\"Muslims, Christians, we are one.\\" The future must not belong to those who bully women, it must be shaped by girls who go to school and those who stand for a world where our daughters can live their dreams just like our sons. <p>The future must not belong to those corrupt few who steal a country's resources, it must be won by the students and entrepreneurs, the workers and business owners who seek a broader prosperity for all people. Those are the women and men that America stands with; theirs is the vision we will support. <p>The future must not belong to those who slander the Prophet of Islam. But to be credible, those who condemn that slander must also condemn the hate we see in the images of Jesus Christ that are desecrated or churches that are destroyed or the Holocaust that is denied. <p>Let us condemn incitement against Sufi Muslims and Shi'a pilgrims. It's time to heed the words of Gandhi: \\"Intolerance is itself a form of violence and an obstacle to the growth of a true democratic spirit.\\" Together, we must work towards a world where we are strengthened by our differences and not defined by them. That is what America embodies; that's the vision we will support. <p>Among Israelis and Palestinians, the future must not belong to those who turn their backs on the prospect of peace. Let us leave behind those who thrive on conflict, those who reject the right of Israel to exist. The road is hard, but the destination is clear: a secure, Jewish State of Israel and an independent, prosperous Palestine. Understanding that such a peace must come through a just agreement between the parties, America will walk alongside all who are prepared to make that journey. <p>In Syria, the future must not belong to a dictator who massacres his people. If there is a cause that cries out for protest in the world today, peaceful protest, it is a regime that tortures children and shoots rockets at apartment buildings. And we must remain engaged to assure that what began with citizens demanding their rights does not end in a cycle of sectarian violence. <p>Together, we must stand with those Syrians who believe in a different vision: a Syria that is united and inclusive, where children don't need to fear their own government, and all Syrians have a say in how they are governed&mdash;Sunnis and Alawites, Kurds and Christians. That's what America stands for. That is the outcome that we will work for, with sanctions and consequences for those who persecute, and assistance and support for those who work for this common good. Because we believe that the Syrians who embrace this vision will have the strength and the legitimacy to lead. <p>In Iran, we see where the path of a violent and unaccountable ideology leads. The Iranian people have a remarkable and ancient history, and many Iranians wish to enjoy peace and prosperity alongside their neighbors. But just as it restricts the rights of its own people, the Iranian Government continues to prop up a dictator in Damascus and supports terrorist groups abroad. Time and again, it has failed to take the opportunity to demonstrate that its nuclear program is peaceful and to meet its obligations to the United Nations. <p>So let me be clear. America wants to resolve this issue through diplomacy, and we believe that there is still time and space to do so. But that time is not unlimited. We respect the right of nations to access peaceful nuclear power, but one of the purposes of the United Nations is to see that we harness that power for peace. And make no mistake, a nuclear-armed Iran is not a challenge that can be contained. It would threaten the elimination of Israel, the security of Gulf nations, and the stability of the global economy. It risks triggering a nuclear arms race in the region and the unraveling of the nonproliferation treaty. That's why a coalition of countries is holding the Iranian Government accountable. And that's why the United States will do what we must to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. <p>We know from painful experience that the path to security and prosperity does not lie outside the boundaries of international law and respect for human rights. That's why this institution was established from the rubble of conflict. That is why liberty triumphed over tyranny in the cold war. And that is the lesson of the last two decades as well. <p>History shows that peace and progress come to those who make the right choices. Nations in every part of the world have traveled this difficult path. Europe, the bloodiest battlefield of the 20th century, is united, free, and at peace. From Brazil to South Africa, from Turkey to South Korea, from India to Indonesia, people of different races, religions, and traditions have lifted millions out of poverty, while respecting the rights of their citizens and meeting their responsibilities as nations. <p>And it is because of the progress that I've witnessed in my own lifetime, the progress that I've witnessed after nearly 4 years as President, that I remain ever hopeful about the world that we live in. The war in Iraq is over; American troops have come home. We've begun a transition in Afghanistan, and America and our allies will end our war on schedule in 2014. Al Qaida has been weakened, and Usama bin Laden is no more. Nations have come together to lock down nuclear materials, and America and Russia are reducing our arsenals. We have seen hard choices made&mdash;from Nay Pyi Taw to Cairo to Abidjan&mdash;to put more power in the hands of citizens. <p>At a time of economic challenge, the world has come together to broaden prosperity. Through the G-20, we have partnered with emerging countries to keep the world on the path of recovery. America has pursued a development agenda that fuels growth and breaks dependency and worked with African leaders to help them feed their nations. New partnerships have been forged to combat corruption and promote government that is open and transparent, and new commitments have been made through the Equal Futures Partnership to ensure that women and girls can fully participate in politics and pursue opportunity. And later today I will discuss our efforts to combat the scourge of human trafficking. <p>All these things give me hope. But what gives me the most hope is not the actions of us, not the actions of leaders; it is the people that I've seen. The American troops who have risked their lives and sacrificed their limbs for strangers half a world away; the students in Jakarta or Seoul who are eager to use their knowledge to benefit mankind; the faces in the square in Prague or a parliament in Ghana who see democracy giving voice to their aspirations; the young people in the <i>favelas</i> of Rio and the schools of Mumbai whose eyes shine with promise. These men, women, and children of every race and every faith remind me that for every angry mob that gets shown on television, there are billions around the world who share similar hopes and dreams. They tell us that there is a common heartbeat to humanity. <p>So much attention in our world turns to what divides us. That's what we see on the news. That's what consumes our political debates. But when you strip all away, people everywhere long for the freedom to determine their destiny, the dignity that comes with work, the comfort that comes with faith, and the justice that exists when governments serve their people and not the other way around. <p>The United States of America will always stand up for these aspirations, for our own people and for people all across the world. That was our founding purpose. That is what our history shows. That is what Chris Stevens worked for throughout his life. <p>And I promise you this: Long after the killers are brought to justice, Chris Stevens's legacy will live on in the lives that he touched: in the tens of thousands who marched against violence through the streets of Benghazi; in the Libyans who changed their Facebook photo to one of Chris; in the signs that read, simply, \\"Chris Stevens was a friend to all Libyans.\\" <p>They should give us hope. They should remind us that so long as we work for it, justice will be done, that history is on our side, and that a rising tide of liberty will never be reversed. <p>Thank you very much.\" "
"208" "\"Thank you very much. Thank you. Appreciate it. Please, please, everybody have a seat. <p>Well, good afternoon, everybody. And, President Clinton, thank you for your very kind introduction. Although I have to admit, I really did like the speech a few weeks ago a little bit better. [<i>Laughter</i>] Afterwards, somebody tweeted that somebody needs to make him secretary of explaining things. [<i>Laughter</i>] Although they didn't use the word \\"things.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>President Clinton, you are a tireless, passionate advocate on behalf of what's best in our country. You have helped to improve and save the lives of millions of people around the world. I am grateful for your friendship and your extraordinary leadership. And I think I speak for the entire country when we say that you continue to be a great treasure for all of us. <p>Now, as always, I also have to thank President Clinton for being so understanding with the record-breaking number of countries visited by our Secretary of State. [<i>Laughter</i>] As we've seen again in recent days, Hillary Clinton is a leader of grace and grit, and I believe she will go down as one of the finest Secretaries of State in American history. So we are grateful to her. <p>To the dedicated CGI staff and every organization that's made commitments and touched the lives of hundreds of millions of people, thank you for being an example of what we need more of in the world, especially in Washington: working together to actually solve problems. <p>And that's why I'm here. As Bill mentioned, I've come to CGI every year that I've been President, and I've talked with you about how we need to sustain the economic recovery, how we need to create more jobs. I've talked about the importance of development, from global health to our fight against HIV/AIDS to the growth that lifts nations to prosperity. We've talked about development and how it has to include women and girls, because by every benchmark, nations that educate their women and girls end up being more successful. <p>And today I want to discuss an issue that relates to each of these challenges. It ought to concern every person, because it is a debasement of our common humanity. It ought to concern every community, because it tears at our social fabric. It ought to concern every business, because it distorts markets. It ought to concern every nation, because it endangers public health and fuels violence and organized crime. I'm talking about the injustice, the outrage, of human trafficking, which must be called by its true name: modern slavery. <p>Now, I do not use that word \\"slavery\\" lightly. It evokes obviously one of the most painful chapters in our Nation's history. But around the world, there's no denying the awful reality. When a man, desperate for work, finds himself in a factory or on a fishing boat or in a field working, toiling, for little or no pay, and beaten if he tries to escape, that is slavery. When a woman is locked in a sweatshop or trapped in a home as a domestic servant, alone and abused and incapable of leaving, that's slavery. <p>When a little boy is kidnaped, turned into a child soldier, forced to kill or be killed, that's slavery. When a little girl is sold by her impoverished family&mdash;girls my daughters' age&mdash;runs away from home or is lured by the false promise of a better life, and then imprisoned in a brothel and tortured if she resists, that's slavery. It is barbaric, and it is evil, and it has no place in a civilized world. <p>Now, as a nation, we've long rejected such cruelty. Just a few days ago, we marked the 150th anniversary of a document that I have hanging in the Oval Office, the Emancipation Proclamation. With the advance of Union forces, it brought a new day, that \\"all persons held as slaves\\" would thenceforth be \\"forever free.\\" We wrote that promise into our Constitution. We spent decades struggling to make it real. We joined with other nations in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights so that \\"slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.\\" <p>A global movement was sparked with the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, signed by President Clinton and carried on by President Bush. <p>And here at CGI, you've made impressive commitments in this fight. We are especially honored to be joined today by advocates who dedicate their lives&mdash;and at times, risk their lives&mdash;to liberate victims and help them recover. This includes men and women of faith, who, like the great abolitionists before them, are truly doing the Lord's work: evangelicals, the Catholic Church, International Justice Mission, and World Relief, even individual congregations, like Passion City Church in Atlanta, and so many young people of faith who've decided that their conscience compels them to act in the face of injustice. And groups like these are answering the Bible's call to \\"seek justice\\" and \\"rescue the oppressed.\\" Some of them join us today, and we are grateful for your leadership. <p>Now, as President, I've made it clear that the United States will continue to be a leader in this global movement. We've got a comprehensive strategy. We're shining a spotlight on the dark corners where it persists. Under Hillary's leadership, we're doing more than ever&mdash;with our annual trafficking report, with new outreach and partnerships&mdash;to give countries incentives to meet their responsibilities and calling them out when they don't. <p>I recently renewed sanctions on some of the worst abusers, including North Korea and Eritrea. We're partnering with groups that help women and children escape from the grip of their abusers. We're helping other countries step up their own efforts. And we're seeing results. More nations have passed and more are enforcing modern antitrafficking laws. <p>Now, last week, I was proud to welcome to the Oval Office not only a great champion of democracy, but a fierce advocate against the use of forced labor and child soldiers: Aung San Suu Kyi. And as part of our engagement, we'll encourage Burma to keep taking steps to reform, because nations must speak with one voice: Our people and our children are not for sale. <p>But for all the progress that we've made, the bitter truth is that trafficking also goes on right here in the United States. It's the migrant worker unable to pay off the debt to his trafficker; the man lured here with the promise of a job, his documents then taken, and forced to work endless hours in a kitchen; the teenage girl beaten, forced to walk the streets. This should not be happening in the United States of America. <p>As President, I directed my administration to step up our efforts, and we have. For the first time, at Hillary's direction, our annual trafficking report now includes the United States, because we can't ask other nations to do what we are not doing ourselves. We've expanded our interagency task force to include more Federal partners, including the FBI. The intelligence community is devoting more resources to identifying trafficking networks. We've strengthened protections so that foreign-born workers know their rights. <p>And most of all, we're going after the traffickers. New antitrafficking teams are dismantling their networks. Last year, we charged a record number of these predators with human trafficking. We're putting them where they belong: behind bars. <p>But with more than 20 million victims of human trafficking around the world&mdash;think about that, more than 20 million&mdash;we've got a lot more to do. And that's why earlier this year, I directed my administration to increase our efforts. And today I can announce a series of additional steps that we're going to take. <p>First, we're going to do more to spot it and stop it. We'll prepare a new assessment of human trafficking in the United States so we better understand the scope and scale of the problem. We'll strengthen training so investigators and law enforcement are even better equipped to take action and treat victims as victims, not as criminals. We're going to work with Amtrak and bus and truck inspectors so that they're on the lookout. We'll help teachers and educators spot the signs as well and better serve those who are vulnerable, especially our young people. <p>Second, we're turning the tables on the traffickers. Just as they are now using technology and the Internet to exploit their victims, we're going to harness technology to stop them. We're encouraging tech companies and advocates and law enforcement&mdash;and we're also challenging college students&mdash;to develop tools that our young people can use to stay safe online and on their smartphones. <p>Third, we'll do even more to help victims recover and rebuild their lives. We'll develop a new action plan to improve coordination across the Federal Government. We're increasing access to services to help survivors become self-sufficient. We're working to simplify visa procedures for T visas so that innocent victims from other countries can stay here as they help us prosecute their traffickers. <p>This coming year, my Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships will make the fight against human trafficking a focus of its work. And I'm also proud&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;they're doing great work. And I'm also proud to announce a new partnership with Humanity United, which is a leader in antitrafficking: a multimillion dollar challenge to local communities to find new ways to care for trafficking victims. And I want to thank Johns Hopkins University, which will be focusing on how to best care for child victims. <p>Now, finally, as one of the largest purchasers of goods and services in the world, the United States Government will lead by example. We've already taken steps to make sure our contractors do not engage in forced labor. And today we're going to go further. I've signed a new Executive order that raises the bar. It's specific about the prohibitions. It does more to protect workers. It ensures stronger compliance. In short, we're making clear that American tax dollars must never, ever be used to support the trafficking of human beings. We will have zero tolerance. We mean what we say. We will enforce it. <p>Of course, no government, no nation, can meet this challenge alone. Everybody has a responsibility. Every nation can take action. Modern antitrafficking laws must be passed and enforced, and justice systems must be strengthened. Victims must be cared for. So here in the United States, Congress should renew the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. Whether you are conservative or liberal, Democrat or Republican, this is a no-brainer. This is something we should all agree on. We need to get that done. <p>And more broadly, as nations, let's recommit to addressing the underlying forces that push so many into bondage in the first place. With development and economic growth that creates legitimate jobs, there's less likelihood of indentured servitude around the globe. A sense of justice that says no child should ever be exploited, that has to be burned into the cultures of every country. A commitment to equality&mdash;as in the Equal Futures Partnership that we launched with other nations yesterday&mdash;so societies empower our sisters and our daughters just as much as our brothers and sons. <p>And every business can take action. All the business leaders who are here, in our global economy companies have a responsibility to make sure that their supply chains, stretching into the far corners of the globe, are free of forced labor. The good news is more and more responsible companies are holding themselves to higher standards. And today I want to salute the new commitments that are being made. That includes the new Global Business Coalition Against Trafficking, companies that are sending a message: Human trafficking is not a business model; it is a crime, and we are going to stop it. We're proud of them. <p>Every faith community can take action as well, by educating their congregations, by joining in coalitions that are bound by a love of God and a concern for the oppressed. And like that Good Samaritan on the road to Jericho, we can't just pass by, indifferent. We've got to be moved by compassion. We've got to bind up the wounds. Let's come together around a simple truth, that we are our brother's keepers and we are our sister's keepers. <p>And finally, every citizen can take action: by learning more; by going to the web site that we helped create, slaveryfootprint.org; by speaking up and insisting that the clothes we wear, the food we eat, the products we buy are made free of forced labor; by standing up against the degradation and abuse of women. <p>That's how real change happens: from the bottom up. And if you doubt that, ask Marie Godet Niyonyota, from the Congo. Think about Marie's story. She was kidnaped by rebels, turned into a slave. She was abused, physically and sexually. They got her pregnant five times. In one awful battle, her children were killed, all five of them. Miraculously, she survived and escaped. And with care and support, she began to heal. And she learned to read and write and sew, and today, Marie is back home, working toward a new future. <p>Or ask Ima Matul. She grew up in Indonesia and at 17 was given the opportunity to work as a nanny here in the United States. But when she arrived, it turned out to be a nightmare. Cooking, cleaning, 18-hour days, 7 days a week. One beating was so bad it sent her to the emergency room. And finally, she escaped. And with the help from a group that cared, today Ima has a stable job. She is an advocate. She's even testified before Congress. <p>Or ask Sheila White, who grew up in the Bronx. Fleeing an abusive home, she fell in with a guy who said he'd protect her. Instead, he sold her, just 15 years old&mdash;15&mdash;to men who raped her and beat her and burned her with irons. And finally, after years, with the help of a nonprofit led by other survivors, she found the courage to break free and get the services she needed. Sheila earned her GED. Today, she is a powerful, fierce advocate who helped to pass a new antitrafficking law right here in New York. <p>These women endured unspeakable horror. But in their unbreakable will, in their courage, in their resilience, they remind us that this cycle can be broken; victims can become not only survivors, they can become leaders and advocates and bring about change. <p>And I just met Ima and Sheila and several of their fellow advocates, and I have to tell you, they are an incredible inspiration. They are here; they've chosen to tell their stories. I want them to stand and be recognized because they are inspiring all of us. Please&mdash;Sheila, Ima. <p>To Ima and Sheila and each of you, in the darkest hours of your lives, you may have felt utterly alone, and it seemed like nobody cared. And the important thing for us to understand is there are millions around the world who are feeling that same way at this very moment. <p>Right now there is a man on a boat, casting the net with his bleeding hands, knowing he deserves a better life, a life of dignity, but doesn't know if anybody's paying attention. Right now there's a woman hunched over a sewing machine, glancing beyond the bars on the window, knowing if just given the chance, she might some day sell her own wares, but she doesn't think anybody's paying attention. Right now there's a young boy in a brick factory, covered in dust, hauling his heavy load under a blazing sun, thinking if he could just go to school, he might know a different future, but he doesn't think anybody's paying attention. Right now there is a girl somewhere trapped in a brothel, crying herself to sleep again and maybe daring to imagine that some day, just maybe, she might be treated not like a piece of property, but as a human being. <p>And so our message today to them is&mdash;to the millions around the world&mdash;we see you. We hear you. We insist on your dignity. And we share your belief that if just given the chance, you will forge a life equal to your talents and worthy of your dreams. <p>And our fight against human trafficking is one of the great human rights causes of our time, and the United States will continue to lead it, in partnership with you. The change we seek will not come easy, but we can draw strength from the movements of the past. For we know that every life saved, in the words of that great Proclamation, is \\"an act of justice,\\" worthy of \\"the considerate judgment of mankind, and the gracious favor of Almighty God.\\" <p>That's what we believe. That's what we're fighting for. And I'm so proud to be in partnership with CGI to make this happen. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"209" "\"Hi, everybody. Four years ago this month, a crisis that started out on Wall Street almost brought down our entire economy. The Nation's biggest banks were days away from failing. The stock market and millions of American retirement accounts were in free fall. Credit froze, lending stopped, and businesses, large and small, didn't even know if they'd be able to make payroll. It was a moment the likes of which few Americans had seen before. <p>Today, we know the biggest cause of that crisis was reckless behavior in the housing market. Millions of Americans who did the right and responsible thing&mdash;who shopped for a home, secured a mortgage they could afford, and made their payments on time&mdash;were badly hurt by the irresponsible actions of others: by lenders who sold loans to families who couldn't afford them and buyers who knew they couldn't afford them, by speculators who were looking just to make a quick buck, and by banks that packaged and sold those risky mortgages for phony profits. When the party stopped and the housing bubble burst, it pushed our entire economy into a historic recession and left middle class families holding the bag. <p>Four years later, the housing market is healing. Home sales and construction are up. Prices are beginning to rise. And more than a million families who began this year owing more on their mortgages than their homes are worth are now back above water. <p>So we're moving in the right direction. But we're not there yet. There are still millions of Americans who are struggling with their mortgages, even at a time of historically low rates. <p>Now, I know there are some who think that the only option for homeowners is to just stand by and hope that the market has hit bottom. I don't agree with that. That's why my administration teamed up with State attorneys general to investigate the terrible way many homeowners were treated and secured a settlement from the Nation's biggest banks&mdash;banks that were bailed out with taxpayer dollars&mdash;to help families stay in their homes. <p>And that's why we announced new steps to help responsible homeowners refinance their mortgages. Already, hundreds of thousands of Americans who were stuck in high interest rate loans have been able to take advantage of lower rates and save thousands of dollars every year. That's not only good for those families, it's also good for our economy. When folks are spending less on mortgage payments, they're spending more at local businesses. And when those businesses have more customers, they start hiring more workers. <p>But we can do even more if Congress is willing to do their part. Back in February, I sent Congress a plan to give every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgages by refinancing at lower rates. It's a plan that has the support of independent, nonpartisan economists and leaders across the housing industry. But Republicans in Congress worked to keep it from even getting to a vote. And here we are, 7 months later, still waiting on Congress to act. <p>This makes no sense. Last week, mortgage rates were at historic lows. But instead of helping more and more hard-working families take advantage of those rates, Congress was away on break. Instead of worrying about you, they'd already gone home to worry about their campaigns. <p>The truth is, it's going to take a while for our housing market to fully recover. But it's going to take a lot more time and cause a lot more hurt if Congress keeps standing in the way. If you agree with me, I hope you'll make your voices heard. Call your Representative, send them an e-mail, show up in their town hall, and tell them that when Congress comes back to Washington, they better come back ready to work. All of you are doing everything you can to meet your responsibilities. I think it's time Congress did the same. <p>Thanks and have a great weekend.\" "
"210" "\"Hi, everybody. Four years after the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes, we're seeing signs that, as a nation, we're moving forward again. <p>After losing about 800,000 jobs a month when I took office, our businesses have now added 5.2 million new jobs over the past 2&frac12; years. And on Friday, we learned that the unemployment rate is now at its lowest level since I took office. More Americans are entering the workforce. More Americans are getting jobs. <p>But too many of our friends and neighbors are still looking for work or struggling to pay the bills, many of them since long before this crisis hit. <p>We owe it to them to keep moving forward. We've come too far to turn back now. We've made too much progress to return to the policies that got us into this mess in the first place. <p>For example, 2 years ago, we put in place tougher, commonsense rules of the road for Wall Street to make sure that the kind of crisis we've been fighting back from never happens again. <p>These rules mean that big banks are no longer going to be able to make risky bets with your deposits. And if a big bank does make a bad decision, they pay for it, not taxpayers. <p>And we also put in place the strongest consumer protections in our history to crack down on the worst practices of credit card companies and mortgage lenders. <p>But for some reason, some Republicans in Congress are still waging an all-out battle to delay, defund, and dismantle these commonsense new rules. <p>Why? Do they think that undoing rules that protect families from the worst practices of credit card companies and mortgage lenders will make the middle class stronger? Do they think getting rid of rules to prevent another crisis on Wall Street will make Main Street any safer? <p>Republicans in Congress need to stop trying to refight the battles of the past few years and finally start doing something to actually help the middle class get ahead. <p>And here, are three things they can do right now. <p>First, Congress needs to step up and guarantee that 98 percent of Americans and 97 percent of small-business owners won't see their taxes go up next year. This is something that everyone says they agree on. It should have gotten done months ago, but Republicans in Congress are standing in the way. They're holding tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans hostage until we pass tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. Ask them how that helps the middle class. <p>Second, Congress needs to step up and provide every responsible homeowner a chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage by refinancing at lower rates. I gave them a plan to do that back in February. It's a plan that has the support of independent, nonpartisan economists and leaders across the housing industry. But Republicans won't even let that plan come to a vote. Ask them how that helps homeowners. <p>Third, Congress needs to step up and pass my plan to create a veterans jobs corps to help our returning heroes find work as cops, firefighters, and park rangers in communities across the country. A few weeks ago, Republicans in the Senate voted that plan down. Ask them why someone who fights for this country abroad should have to fight for a job when they come home. In other words, ask them to get back to work and get these things done. <p>If we're going to keep this economy moving forward, there's no time for political games, even in a political season. Everyone needs to do their part. If you agree with me, let your Representative know where you stand. Tell them that if they want your vote, then they need to stand with you and not in the way of our recovery. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"211" "\"<i>The President.</i> Good morning! <i>Buenos dias! Si se puede!</i> <p><i>Audience members.</i> <i>Si se puede!</i> <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you, everybody. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. Thank you so much. Everybody, thank you so much. I am truly grateful to be here. It is such a great honor to be with you on this beautiful day, a day that has been a long time coming. <p>To the members of the Chavez family and those who knew and loved Cesar, to the men and women who've worked so hard for so long to preserve this place, I want to say to all of you, thank you. Your dedication, your perseverance, made this day possible. <p>I want to acknowledge the members of my administration who have championed this project from the very beginning: Secretary Ken Salazar, Secretary Hilda Solis, Nancy Sutley. To Governor Brown, Mayor Villaraigosa, Congressman Grijalva&mdash;they are here&mdash;we are grateful for your presence. And I also want to recognize my dear friend, somebody we're so proud of: Arturo Rodriguez, the current president of the UFW. <p>Most of all, I want to thank Helen Chavez. In the years to come, generations of Americans will stand where we stand and see a piece of history, a tribute to a great man and a great movement. But to Helen, this will always be home. It's where she fought alongside the man that she loved, where she raised 8 children and spoiled 31 grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren. This is where she continues to live out the rest of her days. So, Helen, today we are your guests. We appreciate your hospitality, and you should feel free to kick us out whenever you want. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Today La Paz joins a long line of national monuments&mdash;stretching from the Statue of Liberty to the Grand Canyon&mdash;monuments that tell the story of who we are as Americans. It's a story of natural wonders and modern marvels, of fierce battles and quiet progress. <p>But it's also a story of people: of determined, fearless, hopeful people who have always been willing to devote their lives to making this country a little more just and a little more free. One of those people lies here, beneath a rose garden at the foot of a hill he used to climb to watch the sun rise. And so today we celebrate Cesar Chavez. <p>Cesar would be the first to say that this is not a monument to one man. The movement he helped to lead was sustained by a generation of organizers who stood up and spoke out and urged others to do the same, including the great Dolores Huerta, who is here today. <p>It drew strength from Americans of every race and every background who marched and boycotted together on behalf of La Causa. And it was always inspired by the farmworkers themselves, some of whom are with us. This place belongs to you, too. <p>But the truth is, we would not be here if it weren't for Cesar. Growing up as the son of migrant workers who had lost their home in the Great Depression, Cesar wasn't easy on his parents. He described himself as <i>caprichoso</i>&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;capricious. His brother Richard had another word for him: stubborn. <p>By the time he reached 7th grade, Cesar estimated he had attended 65 elementary schools, following the crop cycles with his family, working odd jobs, sometimes living in roadside tents without electricity or plumbing. It wasn't an easy childhood. But Caesar always was different. While other kids could identify all the hottest cars, he memorized the names of labor leaders and politicians. <p>After serving in the Navy during World War II, Cesar returned to the fields. And it was a time of great change in America, but too often that change was only framed in terms of war and peace, black and white, young and old. No one seemed to care about the invisible farmworkers who picked the Nation's food: bent down in the beating sun, living in poverty, cheated by growers, abandoned in old age, unable to demand even the most basic rights. <p>But Cesar cared, and in his own peaceful, eloquent way, he made other people care too. A march that started in Delano with a handful of activists, that march ended 300 miles away in Sacramento with a crowd 10,000 strong. A boycott of table grapes that began in California eventually drew 17 million supporters across the country, forcing growers to agree to some of the first farmworker contracts in history. Where there had once been despair, Cesar gave workers a reason to hope. \\"What the growers don't know,\\" he said, \\"is that it's not bananas or grapes or lettuce&mdash;it's people.\\" <p>\\"It's people\\"&mdash;more than higher wages or better working conditions, that was Cesar's gift to us&mdash;a reminder that we are all God's children; that every life has value; that, in the words of one of his heroes, Dr. King, \\"We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.\\" <p>Cesar didn't believe in helping those who refused to help themselves, but he did believe that when someone who works 12 hours a day in the fields can earn enough to put food on the table and maybe save up enough to buy a home, that that makes our communities stronger, that lifts up our entire economy. <p>He believed that when a worker is treated fairly and humanely by their employer, that adds meaning to the values this country was founded upon and credence to the claim that out of many, we are one. And he believed that when a child anywhere in America can dream beyond her circumstances and work to realize that dream, it makes all our futures just a little bit brighter. <p>It was that vision, that belief in the power of opportunity, that drove Cesar every day of his life. It's a vision that says, maybe I never had a chance to get a good education, but I want my daughter to go to college. Maybe I started out working in the fields, but someday, I'll own my own business. Maybe I have to make sacrifices, but those sacrifices are worth it if it means a better life for my family. <p>That's the story of my ancestors; that's the story of your ancestors. It's the promise that has attracted generations of immigrants to our shores from every corner of the globe, sometimes at great risk, drawn by the idea that no matter who you are or what you look like or where you come from, this is the place where you can make it if you try. <p>Today, we have more work to do to fulfill that promise. The recession we're fighting our way back from is still taking a toll, especially in Latino communities, which already faced higher unemployment and poverty rates. Even with the strides we've made, too many workers are still being denied basic rights and simple respect. But thanks to the strength and character of the American people, we are making progress: our businesses are creating more jobs; more Americans are getting back to work. <p>And even though we have a difficult road ahead, I know we can keep moving forward together. I know it because Cesar himself worked for 20 years as an organizer without a single major victory&mdash;think about that&mdash;but he refused to give up. He refused to scale back his dreams. He just kept fasting and marching and speaking out, confident that his day would come. <p>And when it finally did, he still wasn't satisfied. After the struggle for higher wages, Cesar pushed for fresh drinking water and worker's compensation, for pension plans and safety from pesticides. Always moving, always striving for the America he knew we could be. <p>More than anything, that's what I hope our children and grandchildren will take away from this place. Every time somebody's son or daughter comes and learns about the history of this movement, I want them to know that our journey is never hopeless, our work is never done. I want them to learn about a small man guided by enormous faith in a righteous cause, a loving God, the dignity of every human being. I want them to remember that true courage is revealed when the night is darkest and the resistance is strongest and we somehow find it within ourselves to stand up for what we believe in. <p>Cesar once wrote a prayer for the farmworkers that ends with these words: <p>Let the Spirit flourish and grow, <p>So that we will never tire of the struggle. <p>Let us remember those who have died for justice, <p>For they have given us life. <p>Help us love even those who hate, <p>So we can change the world. <p>Our world is a better place because Cesar Chavez decided to change it. Let us honor his memory. But most importantly, let's live up to his example. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless America. <i>Si se puede!</i> <p><i>Audience members.</i> <i>Si se puede!</i> <p><i>The President.</i> <i>Si se puede!</i> <p><i>Audience members.</i> <i>Si se puede! </i><p><i>The President.</i> <i>Si se puede!</i> <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you, everybody.\" "
"212" "\"Hi, everybody. <p>Every year around this time, American car companies start rolling out their newest, shiniest models, hoping to entice you into buying one. It's Detroit's chance to show you what they've been working on, the latest and greatest. And this year is no exception. They've got some pretty good-looking cars coming out. <p>But something is different this time around, and it starts with the auto companies themselves. <p>Just a few years ago, the auto industry wasn't just struggling, it was flatlining. GM and Chrysler were on the verge of collapse. Suppliers and distributors were at risk of going under. More than a million jobs across the country were on the line, and not just auto jobs, but the jobs of teachers, small-business owners, and everyone in communities that depend on this great American industry. <p>But we refused to throw in the towel and do nothing. We refused to let Detroit go bankrupt. I bet on American workers and American ingenuity, and 3 years later, that bet is paying off in a big way. <p>Today, auto sales are the highest they've been in more than 4 years. GM is back. Ford and Chrysler are growing again. Together, our auto industry has created nearly a quarter of a million new jobs right here in America. <p>And we're not just making more cars and trucks, we're making better ones. <p>After 30 years of inaction, we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade, cars and light trucks will average almost 55 miles per gallon, nearly double what they get today. That means you'll only have to fill up every 2 weeks instead of every week. It's good for your wallet, it's good for our economy, and it's good for the environment. <p>The technology that makes it happen will also help America stay on the cutting edge for decades to come. Just this week, GM announced they plan to hire 1,500 workers for a new research center in Michigan to help make sure the high-tech cars of tomorrow are designed and built right here in America. <p>I've also signed new bipartisan trade agreements into law because I want to see more cars on the road in places like South Korea imported from Detroit and Toledo and Chicago. <p>All of this is something the American people can and should be proud of. It's a reminder that when the American people put their mind to something, there's nothing we can't do. <p>So the next time you see one of those brand new 2013 models on TV or on the lot, think about how far we've come together. Think about how, thanks to the hard work and can-do spirit of the American people, more of those cars and trucks are being manufactured by American workers at American companies in communities all across the country. And they're going to save you more money at the pump. <p>That's what America is all about. When we get knocked down, we get back up. We come back stronger. And as long as I'm President, that's what we'll keep doing. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"213" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. Everyone, please take your seats; otherwise, Clint Eastwood will yell at them. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Thank you to Al and Nan; to Your Eminence; Governor, Mrs. Romney; Governor Cuomo; Mayor Bloomberg; Senator Schumer; all the distinguished guests who are here. <p>In less than 3 weeks, voters in States like Ohio, Virginia, and Florida will decide this incredibly important election, which begs the question, what are we doing here? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Of course, New Yorkers also have a big choice to make: You have to decide which one of us you want holding up traffic for the next 4 years. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Tonight I am here with a man whose father was a popular Governor and who knows what it's like to run a major northeastern State and who could very well be President someday, and I'm hoping it is Andrew Cuomo. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>This is the third time that Governor Romney and I have met recently. As some of you may have noticed, I had a lot more energy at our second debate. [<i>Laughter</i>] I felt really well rested after the nice, long nap I had in the first debate. [<i>Laughter</i>] Although it turns out millions of Americans focused in on the second debate who didn't focus in on the first debate, and I happen to be one of them. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I particularly want to apologize to Chris Matthews. [<i>Laughter</i>] Four years ago, I gave him a thrill up his leg&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;this time around I gave him a stroke. <p>Of course, there's a lot of things I learned from that experience. For example, I learned that there are worse things that can happen to you on your anniversary than forgetting to buy a gift. [<i>Laughter</i>] So take note, gentlemen. <p>Now, win or lose, this is my last political campaign. So I'm trying to drink it all in. Unfortunately, Mayor Bloomberg will only let me have 16 ounces of it. [<i>Laughter</i>] But that's okay. I'm still making the most of my time in the city. Earlier today I went shopping at some stores in Midtown. I understand Governor Romney went shopping for some stores in Midtown. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And it brought back some great memories because, some of you know, I went to school here in New York, had a wonderful experience here. I used to love walking through Central Park, loved to go to old Yankee Stadium, the house that Ruth built, although he really did not build that. [<i>Laughter</i>] I hope everybody is aware of that. <p>It's been 4 years since I was last at the Al Smith Dinner. And I have to admit some things have changed since then. I've heard some people say: \\"Barack, you're not as young as you used to be. Where's that golden smile? Where's that pep in your step?\\" And I say: \\"Settle down, Joe, I'm trying to run a Cabinet meeting here.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] He does smile when he says it though. <p>Tomorrow it's back to campaigning. I visit cities and towns across our great country, and I hear the same thing everywhere I go: Honestly, we were hoping to see Michelle. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I have to admit it can be a grind. Sometimes it feels like this race has dragged on forever. But Paul Ryan assured me that we've only been running for 2 hours and 50-something minutes. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Of course, the economy is on everybody's minds. The unemployment rate is at its lowest level since I took office. I don't have a joke here. I just thought it would be useful to remind everybody that the unemployment rate is at the lowest it's been since I took office. <p>And we're getting to that time when folks are making up their minds. Just the other day, Honey Boo Boo endorsed me. [<i>Laughter</i>] So that's a big relief. <p>Ultimately, though, tonight is not about the disagreements Governor Romney and I may have. It's what we have in common, beginning with our unusual names. Actually, Mitt is his middle name. I wish I could use my middle name. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And even though we're enjoying ourselves tonight, we're both thinking ahead of our final debate on Monday. I'm hoping that Governor Romney and I will have a chance to answer the question that is on the minds of millions of Americans watching at home: Is this happening again? [<i>Laughter</i>] Why aren't they putting on \\"The Voice\\"? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, Monday's debate is a little bit different because the topic is foreign policy. Spoiler alert: We got bin Laden. [<i>Applause</i>] Of course, world affairs are a challenge for every candidate. After&mdash;some of you guys remember, after my foreign trip in 2008, I was attacked as a celebrity because I was so popular with our allies overseas. And I have to say, I'm impressed with how well Governor Romney has avoided that problem. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, just so everyone knows, in our third debate, we won't spend a whole lot of time interrupting each other. We will also interrupt the moderator, just to mix things up. <p>And finally, let me say that I've been doing some thinking, and I've decided that for our final debate, I'm going to go back to the strategy I used to prepare for the first debate. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm just kidding; I'm trying to make Axelrod sweat a little bit. [<i>Laughter</i>] Get him a little nervous. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>In all seriousness, I couldn't be more honored to be here this evening. I'm honored to be with leaders of both the private and public sectors, and particularly, the extraordinary work that is done by the Catholic Church. <p>It's written in Scripture that tribulation produces perseverance, and perseverance, character, and character, hope. This country has fought through some very tough years together, and while we still have a lot of work ahead, we've come as far as we have mainly because of the perseverance and character of ordinary Americans. And it says something about who we are as a people that in the middle of a contentious election season, opposing candidates can share the same stage, people from both parties can come together to support a worthy cause. <p>And I particularly want to thank Governor Romney for joining me because I admire him very much as a family man and a loving father, and those are two titles that will always matter more than any political ones. <p>So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;we may have different political perspectives, but I think&mdash;in fact, I'm certain&mdash;that we share the hope that the next 4 years will reflect the same decency and the same willingness to come together for a higher purpose that are on display this evening. May we all, in the words of Al Smith, do our full duty as citizens. <p>God bless you. God bless your families. And may God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much.\" "
"214" "\"Hi, everybody. In recent weeks, you might have noticed something or maybe even heard the sound of it if you live close enough. New homes are going up. In fact, construction workers are breaking ground on new homes in America at the fastest pace in more than 4 years. <p>At the same time, more homes are being sold. Home values are back on the rise. And foreclosure filings are at their lowest point in the 5 years since the housing bubble burst and left millions of responsible families holding the bag. <p>Now, we're not where we need to be yet. Too many homes are still underwater. Too many families are still having a hard time making the mortgage on their piece of the American Dream. But one of the heaviest drags on our recovery is getting lighter. Now we have to build on the progress we've made and keep moving forward. <p>I never believed that the best way to deal with the housing market was to just sit back, do nothing, and simply wait for things to hit bottom. That would have been a disaster for all the responsible families who&mdash;through no fault of their own&mdash;are struggling to make ends meet. <p>Instead, I've made helping those homeowners a priority. Since I took office, my administration has taken action to help millions of families stay in their homes. We teamed up with attorneys general in almost every State to investigate and crack down on the practices that caused this mess. And in the end, we secured a $25 billion settlement from the biggest banks&mdash;one of the biggest settlements in history&mdash;and used it to provide relief to families all across America. <p>We've taken action to help responsible homeowners refinance their mortgages. As a result, just this year, hundreds of thousands of Americans who were stuck in high-interest loans have been able to take advantage of historically low rates and are saving thousands of dollars every year. <p>And now I want every homeowner in America to have that chance. I just wish it didn't require an act of Congress. But it does. So, back in February, I sent Congress a plan to give every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage by refinancing at historically low rates. That's the equivalent of a $3,000 tax cut. <p>It's a plan that we know will work. It has the support of independent, nonpartisan economists and leaders across the housing industry. It's a no-brainer that should have passed easily. <p>But Republicans in Congress banded together and kept this plan from even coming to a vote. They banded together and prevented millions of Americans&mdash;including many of you listening today&mdash;from saving $3,000 a year. That's money that could have gone back into the value of your home or your kid's college savings account. That's money that could have gone into your local businesses so they could hire and create more jobs in your town. <p>But Republicans in Congress still won't let that happen. And that's only held back the economy, when we should be doing everything we can to accelerate our economic engine. <p>Let's be honest. Republicans in Congress won't act on this plan before the election. But maybe they'll come to their senses afterward if you give them a push. So contact your Representative, especially if this plan will help you or somebody you know. Tell him or her that American homeowners have waited long enough. Tell them that it's time for Congress to stop standing in the way of our recovery and start standing up for you. Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"215" "\"Hi, everybody. It's now been 4 years since a crisis that began on Wall Street spread to Main Street, hammering middle class families and ultimately costing our economy 9 million jobs. <p>Since then, we've fought our way back. Our businesses have added more than 5 million new jobs. The unemployment rate has fallen to the lowest level since I took office. Home values are rising again. And our assembly lines are humming once more. <p>And to make sure America never goes through a crisis like that again, we passed tough new Wall Street reform to end taxpayer-funded bailouts for good. Wall Street reform also created the first-ever independent consumer watchdog, whose sole job is to look out for you. <p>That means making sure you've got all the information you need to make important financial decisions like buying a home or paying for college. And it means going after anyone who tries to take advantage of you or rip you off. Starting this month, that includes the folks who come up with your credit score. <p>If you haven't checked out your credit score recently, you should. It can have a major impact on your life. It can determine whether or not you qualify for a loan or what kind of interest you have to pay. It can even affect your chances at renting an apartment or getting a job. <p>But here's the thing: The companies that put your credit score together can make mistakes. They may think you had a loan or a credit card that was never yours. They may think you were late making a payment when you were on time. And when they mess up, you're the one who suffers. <p>Until this week, if you had a complaint, you took it to the company. Sometimes they listened. Sometimes they didn't. But that was pretty much it. They were your only real hope. <p>Well, not anymore. If you have a complaint about your credit score that hasn't been properly addressed, you can go to consumerfinance.gov/complaint and let the consumer watchdog know. Not only will they bring your complaint directly to the company in question, they'll give you a tracking number so you can check back and see exactly what's being done on your behalf. And fixing your credit score isn't the only thing they can help you with. <p>If you're opening a bank account, trying to get a student loan, or applying for a credit card and something doesn't seem right, you can let them know and they'll check it out. If you're looking to buy a home and you want to know if you're getting a fair deal on your mortgage, you can give them a call and they'll get you an answer. Their only mission is to fight for you. And when needed, they'll take action. <p>For example, alongside other regulators, they recently ordered three big credit card companies to return more than $400 million to folks who were deceived or misled into buying things they didn't want or didn't understand. <p>That's what Wall Street reform is all about: looking out for working families and making sure that everyone is playing by the same rules. <p>Sadly, that hasn't been enough to stop Republicans in Congress from fighting these reforms. Backed by an army of financial industry lobbyists, they've been waging an all-out battle to delay, defund, and dismantle these new rules. I refuse to let that happen. <p>I believe that the free market is one of the greatest forces for progress in human history and that the true engine of job creation in this country is the private sector, not the government. <p>But I also believe that the free market has never been about taking whatever you want, however you can get it. Alongside our innovative spirit, America only prospers when we meet certain obligations to one another and when we all play by the same set of rules. <p>We've come too far&mdash;and sacrificed too much&mdash;to go back to an era of top-down, on-your-own economics. And as long as I'm President, we're going to keep moving this country forward so that everyone&mdash;whether you start a business or punch a clock&mdash;can have confidence that if you work hard, you can get ahead. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"216" "\"<i>The President.</i> Well, good afternoon, everybody. Obviously, all of us across the country are concerned about the potential impact of Hurricane Sandy. This is a serious and big storm. And my first message is to all people across the Eastern Seaboard, Mid-Atlantic, going north, that you need to take this very seriously and follow the instructions of your State and local officials, because they are going to be providing you with the best advice in terms of how to deal with this storm over the coming days. <p>We've just had an excellent meeting with the FEMA team here, the various agencies that are in charge, including the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and others that are going to need to respond very quickly. <p>Under Craig Fugate's leadership here at FEMA, we've had a chance to talk to the regional officials as well. And I just had a phone call with the Governors of the potentially impacted States as well as some of the major cities in the region. <p>At this stage, everybody is confident that the staging process, the prepositioning of resources, commodities, equipment that are going to be needed to respond to this storm are in place. But as Craig has emphasized, this hasn't hit landfall yet, so we don't yet know where it's going to hit, where we're going to see the biggest impacts. And that's exactly why it's so important for us to respond big and respond fast as local information starts coming in. <p>I want to thank all the members of the team for the outstanding work that they're doing. But the other thing that makes this storm unique is we anticipate that it is going to be slow moving. That means that it may take a long time not only to clear, but also to get, for example, the power companies back in to clear trees and to put things back in place so that folks can start moving back home. <p>So my main message to everybody involved is that we have to take this seriously. The Federal Government is working effectively with the State and local governments. It's going to be very important that populations in all the impacted States take this seriously, listen to your State and local elected officials. <p>My message to the Governors, as well as to the mayors, is anything they need, we will be there. And we're going to cut through redtape. We're not going to get bogged down with a lot of rules. We want to make sure that we are anticipating and leaning forward into making sure that we've got the best possible response to what is going to be a big and messy system. <p>So again, thank you, everybody. Craig, would you like add to something? <p><i>Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator W. Craig Fugate</i>. Now, again, as the President says, it's going to really come down to the public heeding those evacuation orders, taking protective measures. If they haven't gotten ready, they can go to ready.gov, get information on how to protect them and their families, but also check on your neighbors. This is going to be a big storm. We need to be there for each other. <p><i>The President.</i> Okay. That&mdash;let me emphasize that again&mdash;ready.gov&mdash;for the general public. If you need to know how to respond, that's where you can get centralized information. <p>But I think Craig's point is exactly right. In times like this, one of the things that Americans do is we pull together and we help out one another. And so there may be elderly populations in your area. Check on your neighbor, check on your friend. Make sure that they are prepared. If we do, then we're going to get through this storm just fine. But we're going to have to make sure that we are vigilant and vigilant for a couple of days. Don't anticipate that just because the immediate storm has passed that we're not going to have some potential problems in a lot of these communities going forward through the week. <p>All right. Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"217" "\"<i>The President.</i> First of all, I want to thank Gail and Charlie who are on the scene doing work every time we have a disaster here in the United States of America. But obviously, the Red Cross is doing outstanding work internationally, so we want to thank them for their outstanding work. <p>A few things that I want to emphasize to the public at the top. This storm is not yet over. We've gotten briefings from the National Hurricane Center. It is still moving north. There are still communities that could be affected. And so I want to emphasize there are still risks of flooding, there are still risks of downed power lines, risks of high winds. And so it is very important for the public to continue to monitor the situation in your local community, listen to your State and local officials, follow instructions. The more you follow instructions, the easier it is for our first-responders to make sure that they are dealing with true emergency situations. So the better prepared individual families are for the situation, the easier it is going to be for us to deal with it. <p>Next, obviously, I want to talk about the extraordinary hardship that we've seen over the last 48 hours. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all the families who have lost loved ones. Unfortunately, there have been fatalities as a consequence of Hurricane Sandy, and it's not clear that we've counted up all the fatalities at this point. And obviously, this is something that is heartbreaking for the entire Nation. And we certainly feel profoundly for all the families whose lives have been upended and are going to be going through some very tough times over the next several days, perhaps several weeks and months. <p>The most important message I have for them is that America is with you. We are standing behind you, and we are going to do everything we can to help you get back on your feet. <p>Earlier today I had a conversation with the Governors and many of the mayors in the affected areas, including Governor Christie, Governor Cuomo, and Mayor Bloomberg. I want to praise them for the extraordinary work that they have done. Sadly, we are getting more experience with these kinds of big impact storms along the East Coast, and the preparation shows. Were it not for the outstanding work that they and their teams have already done and will continue to do in the affected regions, we could have seen more deaths and more property damage. So they have done extraordinary work working around the clock. The coordination between the State, local, and Federal governments has been outstanding. <p>Obviously, we're now moving into the recovery phase in a lot of the most severely affected areas. New Jersey, New York in particular have been pounded by this storm. Connecticut has taken a big hit. Because of some of the work that had been done ahead of time, we've been able to get over a thousand FEMA officials in place, prepositioned. We've been able to get supplies, food, medicine, water, emergency generators to ensure that hospitals and law enforcement offices are able to stay up and running as they are out there responding. <p>We are going to continue to push as hard as we can to make sure that power is up throughout the region. And obviously, this is mostly a local responsibility, and the private utilities are going to have to lean forward, but we are doing everything we can to provide them additional resources so that we can expedite getting power up and running in many of these communities. <p>There are places like Newark, New Jersey, for example, where you've got 80, 90 percent of the people without power. We can't have a situation where that lasts for days on end. And so my instructions to the Federal agency has been, do not figure out why we can't do something; I want you to figure out how we do something. I want you to cut through redtape. I want you to cut through bureaucracy. There's no excuse for inaction at this point; I want every agency to lean forward and to make sure that we are getting the resources where they need&mdash;where they're needed as quickly as possible. <p>So I want to repeat my message to the Federal Government: No bureaucracy, no redtape. Get resources where they're needed as fast as possible, as hard as possible, and for the duration, because the recovery process obviously in a place like New Jersey is going to take a significant amount of time. The recovery process in a lower Manhattan is going to take a lot of time. <p>And part of what we're trying to do here is also to see where some resources that can be brought to bear that maybe traditionally are not used in these kind of disaster situations. For example, there may be military assets that allow us to help move equipment to ensure that pumping and getting the flooding out of New York subway systems can proceed more quickly. There may be resources that we can bring to bear to help some of the private utilities get their personnel and their equipment in place more swiftly so that we can get power up and running as soon as possible. <p>So my message to the Governors and the mayors and, through them, to the communities that have been hit so hard is that we are going to do everything we can to get resources to you and make sure that any unmet need that is identified, we are responding to it as quickly as possible. And I told the mayors and the Governors, if they're getting no for an answer somewhere in the Federal Government, they can call me personally at the White House. <p>Now, obviously, the State, local, Federal response is important, but what we do as a community&mdash;what we do as neighbors and as fellow citizens&mdash;is equally important. So a couple of things that I want the public to know they can do. <p>First of all, because our local law enforcement, our first-responders are being swamped, to the extent that everybody can be out there looking out for their neighbors, especially older folks, I think that's really important. If you've got a neighbor nearby, you're not sure how they're handling a power outage, flooding, et cetera, go over, visit them, knock on their door, make sure that they're doing okay. That can make a big difference. The public can be the eyes and ears in terms of identifying unmet needs. <p>Second thing, the reason we're here is because the Red Cross knows what it's doing when it comes to emergency response. And so for people all across the country who have not been affected, now is the time to show the kind of generosity that makes America the greatest nation on Earth. And a good place to express that generosity is by contributing to the Red Cross. <p>Obviously, you can go on their web site. The Red Cross knows what they're doing. They're in close contact with Federal, State, and local officials. They will make sure that we get the resources to those families as swiftly as possible. And again, I want to thank everybody here who is doing such a great job when it comes to the disaster response. <p>The final message I'd just say is, during the darkness of the storm, I think we also saw what's brightest in America. I think all of us obviously have been shocked by the force of Mother Nature as we watch it on television. At the same time, we've also seen nurses at NYU hospital carrying fragile newborns to safety. We've seen incredibly brave firefighters in Queens, waist deep in water, battling infernos, and rescuing people in boats. <p>One of my favorite stories is down in North Carolina, the Coast Guard going out to save a sinking ship. They sent a rescue swimmer out, and the rescue swimmer said: \\"Hi, I'm Dan. I understand you guys need a ride.\\" That kind of spirit of resilience and strength, but most importantly, looking out for one another, that's why we always bounce back from these kinds of disasters. <p>This is a tough time for a lot of people: millions of folks all across the Eastern Seaboard. But America is tougher, and we're tougher because we pull together. We leave nobody behind. We make sure that we respond as a nation and remind ourselves that whenever an American is in need, all of us stand together to make sure that we're providing the help that's necessary. <p>So I just want to thank the incredible response that we've already seen, but I do want to remind people this is going to take some time. It is not going to be easy for a lot of these communities to recover swiftly, and so it's going to be important that we sustain that spirit of resilience, that we continue to be good neighbors for the duration until everybody is back on their feet. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, Red Cross.\" "
"218" "\"This weekend, millions of our fellow Americans are still picking up the pieces from one of the worst storms in our history. <p>I toured New Jersey on Wednesday with Governor Christie, and witnessed some of the terrible devastation first hand. It's heartbreaking. Families have lost loved ones. Entire communities have been wiped away. Even some of the first-responders, who repeatedly put themselves in harm's way to bravely save the lives of others, have suffered losses of their own. <p>Today I ask everyone to keep them in your prayers. And as President, I promise them this: Your country will be there for you for as long as it takes to recover and rebuild. <p>Throughout the week, I've been in constant contact with Governors and mayors in the affected areas, who are doing an excellent job in extraordinarily difficult circumstances. And we owe the first-responders and National Guardsmen who have been working around the clock our deepest gratitude. <p>Our number-one concern has been making sure the affected States and communities have everything they need to respond to and recover from this storm. <p>From the earliest hours, I ordered that resources be made available to States in the path of the storm as soon as they needed them. And I instructed my team not to let redtape and bureaucracy get in the way of solving problems, especially when it came to making sure local utilities could restore power as quickly as possible. <p>Before the storm hit, FEMA prestaged emergency response teams from North Carolina to Maine and deployed resources like food, water, and generators up and down the coast. As the storm passed, thousands of FEMA personnel were on the ground responding to those in need. And by midweek, the Department of Defense was ready to fly in cargo planes that could be loaded with trucks and equipment to help local power companies get up and running faster. <p>But recovery will still be a long, hard road for many communities. There's a lot of work ahead. <p>If you've been directly impacted by this storm and need temporary assistance getting back on your feet, you can call 1-800-621-FEMA, 1-800-FEMA, or apply at disasterassistance.gov. If you know folks who are still without power, please spread the word and let them know. <p>And if you don't live in an affected area and want to help, supporting the Red Cross is the best and fastest way. <p>This week, we have been humbled by nature's destructive power. But we've been inspired as well. For when the storm was darkest, the heroism of our fellow citizens shone brightest: The nurses and doctors at NYU Medical Center who evacuated fragile newborns, carrying some down several flights of stairs; the firefighters in Queens who battled an inferno from flooded streets and rescued people from an apartment building by boat; the Coast Guard crews from North Carolina who saved a sinking ship in stormy seas and their rescue swimmer who, when he reached those in need, said, \\"I'm Dan, and I hear you guys need a ride.\\" <p>That's who we are. We're Americans and when times are tough, we're tougher. We put others first. We go that extra mile. We open our hearts and our homes to one another, as one American family. We recover, we rebuild, we come back stronger, and together, we will do that once more. Thanks, God bless you, and God bless America.\" "
"219" "\"Well, listen, I just completed not only a meeting with our team here at FEMA and all of our Cabinet officers who are involved in the recovery process along the East Coast, but we also had a conference call with the Governors of Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey, as well as many of the municipalities who have been directly affected by this crisis and this tragedy. <p>We still have a long way to go to make sure that the people of New Jersey, Connecticut, New York, and some of the surrounding areas get their basic needs taken care of and that we start moving back to normalcy. <p>A couple of things that we've emphasized: Number one, that it is critical for us to get power back on as quickly as possible. And just to give people an example of the kind of work we're doing, the military, DOD, thanks to the work of Leon and others, have been able to get military transport facilities to move cherry pickers and personnel from as far away as California to get that equipment into the area so that we can start getting some of the power back on as quickly as possible. It is a painstaking process, but we're making progress. <p>Number two, we're getting assets in to pump as much water out as possible. Lower Manhattan obviously is a particularly acute example, but there are problems with flooding that are affecting substations throughout the region. That's going to continue to be a top priority. <p>Number three, making sure that people's basic needs are taken care of. As we start seeing the weather get a little bit colder, people can't be without power for long periods of time, without heat for long periods of time. And so what we're doing is starting to shift to identify where we can have temporary housing outside of shelters so people can get some sense of normalcy. They can have a hot meal; they can have the capacity to take care of their families as their homes are being dealt with. <p>Number four, debris removal, still important. Number five, making sure that the National Guard and other Federal assets are in place to help with getting the transportation systems back up and running, that's going to be critical. <p>What I told the Governors and the mayors is what I've been saying to my team from the start of this event, and that is, we don't have any patience for bureaucracy, we don't have any patience for redtape, and we want to make sure that we are figuring out a way to get to yes, as opposed to no, when it comes to these problems. <p>The other thing I emphasize, though, is that it is much easier for us to respond if we know what these problems are out in these areas, so if everybody can help publicize the number 800-621-FEMA&mdash;800-621-FEMA&mdash;then individuals can register with FEMA and immediately get the assistance that they need. <p>And so the more that folks in New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut understand that there are a lot of resources available for them, not just with respect to housing, but also with respect to childcare, medicine, a whole range of support, then we want to make sure that they contact us as soon as possible if they're in distress, because help is available. <p>Let me just close by saying this: Obviously, we've now seen that after the initial search and rescue, the recovery process is difficult, and it's painful. But the Governors at the local level&mdash;Governors Christie, Cuomo, and Malloy&mdash;they are working around the clock; their teams are working around the clock. We are incredibly grateful to the heroism and hard work of our first-responders, many of whom themselves have had their homes flooded out. Our hearts continue to go out to those families who have been affected and who have actually lost loved ones; that's obviously heartbreaking. <p>But I'm confident that we can continue to make progress, as long as State, local, and Federal officials stay focused. And I can assure you everybody on this team, everybody sitting around the table, has made this a number-one priority and this continues to be my number-one priority. <p>There's nothing more important than us getting this right. And we're going to spend as much time, effort, and energy as is necessary to make sure that all the people in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut know that the entire country is behind them in this difficult recovery effort. We are going to put not just 100 percent, but 120 percent behind making sure that they get the resources they need to rebuild and recover. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"220" "\"Thank you very much, everybody. Everybody, please have a seat. Thank you. <p>Well, good afternoon, everybody. Now that those of us on the campaign trail have had a chance to get a little sleep&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;it's time to get back to work. And there is plenty of work to do. <p>As I said on Tuesday night, the American people voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. And in that spirit, I've invited leaders of both parties to the White House next week so we can start to build consensus around the challenges that we can only solve together. And I also intend to bring in business and labor and civic leaders from all across the country here to Washington to get their ideas and input as well. <p>At a time when our economy is still recovering from the great recession, our top priority has to be jobs and growth. That's the focus of the plan I talked about during the campaign. It's a plan to reward small businesses and manufacturers that create jobs here, not overseas. It's a plan to give people the chance to get the education and training that businesses are looking for right now. It's a plan to make sure this country is a global leader in research and technology and clean energy, which will attract new companies and high-wage jobs to America. It's a plan to put folks back to work, including our veterans, rebuilding our roads and our bridges and other infrastructure. And it's a plan to reduce our deficit in a balanced and responsible way. <p>Now, our work is made that much more urgent because, at the end of this year, we face a series of deadlines that require us to make major decisions about how to pay our deficit down, decisions that will have a huge impact on the economy and the middle class, both now and in the future. Last year, I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars' worth of spending that we just couldn't afford. I intend to work with both parties to do more, and that includes making reforms that will bring down the cost of health care so we can strengthen programs like Medicaid and Medicare for the long haul. <p>But as I've said before, we can't just cut our way to prosperity. If we're serious about reducing the deficit, we have to combine spending cuts with revenue, and that means asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more in taxes. That's how we did it in the 1990s, when Bill Clinton was President. That's how we can reduce the deficit while still making the investments we need to build a strong middle class and a strong economy. That's the only way we can still afford to train our workers or help our kids pay for college or make sure that good jobs in clean energy or high-tech manufacturing don't end up in countries like China. <p>Now, already, I've put forward a detailed plan that allows us to make these investments, while reducing our deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade. I want to be clear: I'm not wedded to every detail of my plan. I'm open to compromise. I'm open to new ideas. I'm committed to solving our fiscal challenges. But I refuse to accept any approach that isn't balanced. I am not going to ask students and seniors and middle class families to pay down the entire deficit, while people like me, making over $250,000, aren't asked to pay a dime more in taxes. I'm not going to do that. <p>And I just want to point out: This was a central question during the election. It was debated over and over again. And on Tuesday night, we found out that the majority of Americans agree with my approach, and that includes Democrats, Independents, and a lot of Republicans across the country, as well as independent economists and budget experts. That's how you reduce the deficit, with a balanced approach. <p>So our job now is to get a majority in Congress to reflect the will of the American people. And I believe we can get that majority. I was encouraged to hear Speaker Boehner agree that tax revenue has to be part of this equation, so I look forward to hearing his ideas when I see him next week. <p>And let me make one final point that every American needs to hear. Right now if Congress fails to come to an agreement on an overall deficit reduction package by the end of the year, everybody's taxes will automatically go up on January 1&mdash;everybody's&mdash;including the 98 percent of Americans who make less than $250,000 a year. And that makes no sense. It would be bad for the economy and would hit families that are already struggling to make ends meet. <p>Now, fortunately, we shouldn't need long negotiations or drama to solve that part of the problem. While there may be disagreement in Congress over whether or not to raise taxes on folks making over $250,000 a year, nobody&mdash;not Republicans, not Democrats&mdash;want taxes to go up for folks making under $250,000 a year. So let's not wait. Even as we're negotiating a broader deficit reduction package, let's extend the middle class tax cuts right now. Let's do that right now. <p>That one step&mdash;that one step&mdash;would give millions of families, 98 percent of Americans and 97 percent of small businesses, the certainty that they need going into the new year. It would immediately take a huge chunk of the economic uncertainty off the table, and that will lead to new jobs and faster growth. Business will know that consumers, they're not going to see a big tax increase. They'll know that most small businesses won't see a tax increase. And so a lot of the uncertainty that you're reading about, that will be removed. <p>In fact, the Senate has already passed a bill doing exactly this, so all we need is action from the House. And I've got the pen ready to sign the bill right away. I'm ready to do it. [<i>Applause</i>] I'm ready to do it. <p>The American people understand that we're going to have differences and disagreements in the months to come. They get that. But on Tuesday, they said loud and clear that they won't tolerate dysfunction. They won't tolerate politicians who view compromise as a dirty word. Not when so many Americans are still out of work. Not when so many families and small business owners are still struggling to pay the bills. <p>What the American people are looking for is cooperation. They're looking for consensus. They're looking for common sense. Most of all, they want action. I intend to deliver for them in my second term, and I expect to find willing partners in both parties to make that happen. So let's get to work. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.\" "
"221" "\"Hi, everybody. On Tuesday, America went to the polls, and the message you sent was clear: You voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. <p>That's why I've invited leaders of both parties to the White House next week so we can start to build consensus around challenges we can only solve together. I also intend to bring in business, labor, and civic leaders from around the country&mdash;from outside Washington to get their ideas and input as well. <p>At a time when our economy is still recovering from the great recession, our top priority has to be jobs and growth. That's the focus of the plan I talked about throughout the campaign. It's a plan to reward businesses that create jobs here in America and give people access to the education and training that those businesses are looking for. It's a plan to rebuild our infrastructure and keep us on the cutting edge of innovation and clean energy. And it's a plan to reduce our deficit in a balanced and responsible way. <p>This is even more important because at the end of this year, we face a series of deadlines that require us to make major decisions about how to pay down our deficit, decisions that will have a huge impact on the economy and the middle class not only now, but in the future. <p>Last year, I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars' worth of spending, and I intend to work with both parties to do more. But as I said over and over again on the campaign trail, we can't just cut our way to prosperity. If we're serious about reducing the deficit, we have to combine spending cuts with revenue, and that means asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more in taxes. That's how we did it when Bill Clinton was President and that's the only way we can afford to invest in education and job training and manufacturing&mdash;all the ingredients of a strong middle class and a strong economy. <p>Already, I've put forward a detailed plan that allows us to make these investments while reducing our deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade. Now, I'm open to compromise and new ideas. But I refuse to accept any approach that isn't balanced. I will not ask students or seniors or middle class families to pay down the entire deficit while people making over $250,000 a year aren't asked to pay a dime more in taxes. This was a central question in the election. And on Tuesday, we found out that the majority of Americans agree with my approach: Democrats, Independents, and some Republicans. <p>Now we need a majority in Congress to listen, and they should start by making sure taxes don't go up on the 98 percent of Americans making under $250,000 a year starting January 1. This is something we all agree on: that taxes on middle class families should not go up. Congress should permanently extend the middle class tax cuts right now, even as we negotiate a broader deficit reduction package. It's a step that would give millions of families and 97 percent of small businesses the peace of mind that will lead to new jobs and faster growth. There's no reason to wait. <p>We know there will be differences and disagreements in the months to come. That's part of what makes our political system work. But on Tuesday, you said loud and clear that you won't tolerate dysfunction or politicians who see compromise as a dirty word. Not when so many of your families are still struggling. <p>Instead, you want cooperation. You want action. That's what I plan to deliver in my second term, and I expect to find leaders from both parties willing to join me. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"222" "\"Thank you so much. Please, everybody, be seated. Good morning, everyone. <p>Thank you, Secretary Shinseki, for a lifetime of service to our Nation and for being such a tireless advocate on behalf of America's veterans, including your fellow Vietnam veterans. <p>To Rick Delaney; to Vice President Biden; to Admiral Winnefeld; Major General Linnington; our outstanding veteran service organizations; our men and women in uniform&mdash;Active, Guard, and Reserve; and most of all, to the proud veterans and family members joining us in this sacred place: It is truly a privilege and an honor to be with all of you here today. <p>Each year, on the 11th day of the 11th month, we pause&mdash;as a nation and as a people&mdash;to pay tribute to you, to thank you, to honor you: the heroes, over the generations, who have served this country of ours with distinction. <p>And moments ago, I laid a wreath to remember every servicemember who has ever worn our Nation's uniform. And this day, first and foremost, belongs to them and their loved ones: to the father and mother, the husband and wife, the brother and sister, the comrade and the friend who, when we leave here today, will continue to walk these quiet hills and kneel before the final resting place of those they cherished most. <p>On behalf of the American people, I say to you that the memory of your loved one carries on not just in your hearts, but in ours as well. And I assure you that their sacrifice will never be forgotten. <p>For it is in that sacrifice that we see the enduring spirit of America. Since even before our founding, we have been blessed with an unbroken chain of patriots who have always come forward to serve. Whenever America has come under attack, you've risen to her defense. Whenever our freedoms have come under assault, you've responded with resolve. Time and again, at home and abroad, you and your families have sacrificed to protect that powerful promise that all of us hold so dear: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. <p>Today a proud Nation expresses our gratitude. But we do so mindful that no ceremony or parade, no hug or handshake, is enough to truly honor that service. For that, we must do more. For that, we must commit&mdash;this day and every day&mdash;to serving you as well as you've served us. <p>When I spoke here 3 years ago, I spoke about today's generation of servicemembers: this 9/11 generation who stepped forward after the towers fell and, in the years since, have stepped into history, writing one of the greatest chapters of military service our country has ever known. <p>You toppled a dictator and battled an insurgency in Iraq. You pushed back the Taliban and decimated Al Qaida in Afghanistan. You delivered justice to Usama bin Laden. Tour after tour, year after year, you and your families have done all that this country has asked. You've done that and more. <p>Three years ago, I promised your generation that when your tour comes to an end, when you see our flag, when you touch our soil, you'll be welcomed home to an America that will forever fight for you, just as hard as you've fought for us. And so long as I have the honor of serving as your Commander in Chief, that is the promise that we will never stop working to keep. <p>This is the first Veterans Day in a decade in which there are no American troops fighting and dying in Iraq. Thirty-three thousand of our troops have now returned from Afghanistan, and the transition there is underway. After a decade of war, our heroes are coming home. And over the next few years, more than a million servicemembers will transition back to civilian life. They'll take off their uniforms and take on a new and lasting role. They will be veterans. <p>As they come home, it falls to us, their fellow citizens, to be there for them and their families, not just now, but always, not just for the first few years, but for as long as they walk this Earth. <p>To this day, we still care for a child of a Civil War veteran. To this day, we still care for over a hundred spouses and children of the men who fought in the Spanish-American War. Just last year, I came here to pay tribute as Frank Buckles, the last remaining American veteran of World War I, was laid to rest. Frank stepped up and served in World War I for 2 years. But the United States of America kept its commitment to serve him for many decades that followed. <p>So long after the battles end, long after our heroes come home, we stay by their side. That's who we are. And that's who we'll be for today's returning servicemembers and their families, because no one who fights for this country overseas should ever have to fight for a job or a roof over their head or the care that they have earned when they come home. <p>We know the most urgent task many of you face is finding a new way to serve. That's why we've made it a priority to help you find jobs worthy of your incredible skills and talents. That's why, thanks to the hard work of Michelle and Jill Biden, some of our most patriotic businesses have hired or trained 125,000 veterans and military spouses. It's why we're transforming, for the first time in decades, how the military transitions servicemembers from the battlefield to the workplace. And because you deserve to share in the opportunities you defend, we are making sure that the post-9/11 GI bill stays strong so you can earn a college education and pursue your dreams. <p>If you find yourself struggling with the wounds of war&mdash;such as posttraumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injuries&mdash;we'll be there as well, with the care and treatment that you need. No veteran should have to wait months or years for the benefits that you've earned, so we will continue to attack the claims backlog. We won't let up. [<i>Applause</i>] We will not let up. And as we mark the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam war, we have secured new disability benefits for Vietnam-era veterans exposed to agent orange. You needed it, you fought for it, and we got it done. <p>That's what we do in America. We take care of our own. We take care of our veterans. We take care of your families. Not just by saluting you on one day, once a year, but by fighting for you and your families every day of every year. That's our obligation&mdash;a sacred obligation&mdash;to all of you. <p>And it's an obligation that we gladly accept for Americans like Petty Officer Taylor Morris. Six months ago, Taylor was serving our Nation in Afghanistan. And as a member of an explosive ordnance disposal team, his job was one of the most dangerous there is: to lead the way through territory littered with hidden explosives, to clear the way for his brothers in arms. <p>On May 3, while out on patrol, Taylor stepped on an IED. The blast threw him into the air. And when he hit the ground, Taylor realized that both his legs were gone. And his left arm. And his right hand. <p>But as Taylor lay there, fully conscious, bleeding to death, he cautioned the medics to wait before rushing his way. He feared another IED was nearby. Taylor's concern wasn't for his own life, it was for theirs. <p>Eventually, they cleared the area. They tended to Taylor's wounds. They carried him off the battlefield. And days later, Taylor was carried into Walter Reed, where he became only the fifth American treated there to survive the amputation of all four limbs. <p>Now, Taylor's recovery has been long. And it has been arduous. And it's captivated the Nation. A few months after the attack, with the help of prosthetics, the love and support of his family, and above all, his girlfriend Danielle, who never left his side, Taylor wasn't just walking again. In a video that went viral, the world watched he and Danielle dance again. <p>I've often said the most humbling part of my job is serving as Commander in Chief. And one of the reasons is that, every day, I get to meet heroes. I met Taylor at Walter Reed. And then in July, at the White House, I presented him with the Purple Heart. And right now hanging on a wall in the West Wing is a photo of that day, a photo of Taylor Morris smiling wide and standing tall. <p>I should point out that Taylor couldn't make it here today because he and Danielle are out kayaking. [<i>Laughter</i>] In Taylor we see the best of America: a spirit that says, when we get knocked down, we rise again. When times are tough, we come together. When one of us falters, we lift them up. In this country, we take care of our own, especially our veterans, who have served so bravely and sacrificed so selflessly in our name. And we carry on, knowing that our best days always lie ahead. <p>On this day, we thank all of our veterans from all of our war, not just for your service to this country, but for reminding us why America is and always will be the greatest nation on Earth. <p>God bless you. God bless our veterans. God bless our men and women in uniform. And God bless these United States of America. Thank you very much.\" "
"223" "\"Thank you so much, everybody. I'm going to be relatively brief. I came up here right after the storm, was on the Jersey side, and I had promised to everybody that I was speaking on behalf of the country when I said we are going to be here until the rebuilding is complete, and I meant it. So I'm going to come back today, but I'm also going to be coming back in the future to make sure that we have followed through on that commitment. <p>I want to thank the outstanding leadership that's been provided by State and local officials. Obviously, Governor Cuomo and Mayor Bloomberg have done an outstanding job. To Borough President Molinaro, thank you so much for your leadership at a time when the folks here on this island were obviously going through extraordinarily difficult times, the people of Long Island who are going through really tough times. <p>Across the board, what we've seen is cooperation and a spirit of service. And for the first-responders who are here&mdash;the police officers, the firefighters, the EMS folks, the sanitation workers who sometimes don't get credit, but have done heroic work&mdash;we are so grateful to you because you exemplify what America is all about. I'm grateful to the Red Cross who has been so responsive not just here, but in disasters around the country. And I want to thank all the volunteers. As we were shaking hands over there, we had folks from every part of the country. We had some Canadians who had come down to help out. <p>And during difficult times like this, we're reminded that we're bound together and we have to look out for each other. And a lot of the things that seem important&mdash;the petty differences&mdash;melt away, and we focus on what binds us together and that we as Americans are going to stand with each other in their hour of need. <p>Now, more specifically, we are now still in the process of recovery. As you can see, as you travel around parts of Staten Island, as we flew over parts of&mdash;other parts of the city and the region that had been impacted, there is still a lot of cleanup to do. People still need emergency help. They still need heat. They still need power. They still need food. They still need shelter. Kids are still trying to figure out where they're going to school. So there's a lot of short-term, immediate stuff that has to be dealt with. And we are going to make sure that we stay here as long as people need that immediate help. That's FEMA's primary task. And we'll be coordinating closely with State and local governments to make sure folks are getting the short-term help. <p>But what we've also already heard is that there's going to be some long-term rebuilding that's required. You look at this block, and you know that this is a community that is deeply rooted. Most of the folks that I met here have been here 20, 30, 50 years. They don't want to see their community uprooted, but there's got to be a plan for rebuilding, and that plan is going to have to be coordinated, and they're going to need resources. <p>So what I've committed to doing is to work with the outstanding congressional delegation led by your Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, also working with Governor Christie and the Jersey delegation to try to come up with a game plan for how we're going to be able to resource the rebuilding process. <p>And I'm confident, as Governor Cuomo said, that we're going to be able to do it. But it's going to require everybody focused on getting the job done. We're going to have to put some of the turf battles aside. We're going to have to make sure that everybody's focused on doing the job as opposed to worrying about who's getting the credit or who's getting the contracts or all that stuff that sometimes goes into the rebuilding process. <p>On the Federal level, because this is going to be such a big job, I wanted to assign one particular person who would be in charge from our perspective, who would be our point person, because FEMA basically runs the recovery process, it doesn't focus on the rebuilding. For that, we've got to have all Government agencies involved. Janet Napolitano has done a great job with respect to DHS, but we thought it would be good to have a New Yorker who is going to be the point person. And so our outstanding HUD Secretary, Shaun Donovan, who used to be the head of the New York Housing Authority, so he knows a little bit about New York and building, is going to be our point person. And he's going to be working with the mayor, the Governor, the borough presidents, the county officials to make sure that we come up with a strong, effective plan. And then, I'll be working with the Members of Congress to do everything we can to get the resources needed to rebuild. And I have every confidence that Shaun is going to be doing a great job, and so people should feel some confidence about that. <p>Let me just close by saying this: I had the opportunity to give some hugs and communicate thoughts and prayers to the Moore family. They lost two young sons during the course of this tragedy. And obviously, I expressed to them&mdash;as a father, as a parent&mdash;my heartbreak over what they went through. And they're still obviously a little shell shocked. <p>But they came here, in part because they wanted to say thank you to all the people who have been supportive of them. They, in particular, mentioned Lieutenant Kevin Gallagher of the NYPD, who, when they knew that their sons were missing, Lieutenant Gallagher made a point of staying with them and doing everything he could so that ultimately they knew what had happened with their boys and were able to recover their bodies, and has been with them as a source of support ever since. <p>That's not in the job description of Lieutenant Gallagher. He did that because that's what so many of our first-responders do. They go above and beyond the call of duty to respond to people in need. And so I want to give a shout-out to Lieutenant Gallagher, but I also want to point out, the Moores, even in their grief, asked me to mention Lieutenant Gallagher, and that says something about them as well. <p>And that spirit and sense of togetherness and looking out for one another, that's what's going to carry us through this tragedy. It's not going to be easy. There's still going to be, believe it or not, some complaints over the next several months. Not everybody is going to be satisfied. I have to tell you the insurance companies and some of the other private sector folks who are involved in this, we need you to show some heart and some spirit in helping people rebuild as well. <p>But when I hear the story of the Moores and I hear about Lieutenant Gallagher, that's what makes me confident that we're going to be able to rebuild. All right? <p>I'm very proud of you, New York. You guys are tough. You bounce back, just as America always bounces back. The same is going to be true this time out. All right, thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"224" "\"<i>The President.</i> Well, I want to welcome the Congressional leadership here and thank them for their time. I think we're all aware that we have some urgent business to do. We've got to make sure that taxes don't go up on middle class families, that our economy remains strong, that we're creating jobs. And that's an agenda that Democrats and Republicans and Independents, people all across the country, share. <p>So our challenge is to make sure that we are able to cooperate together, work together, find some common ground, make some tough compromises, build some consensus, to do the people's business. And what folks are looking for, and I think all of us agree on this, is action. They want to see that we are focused on them, not focused on our politics here in Washington. <p>So my hope is, is that this is going to be the beginning of a fruitful process where we're able to come to an agreement that will reduce our deficit in a balanced way, that we will deal with some of these long-term impediments to growth. And we're also going to be focusing on making sure that middle class families are able to get ahead. <p>So I want to thank all the leadership for coming. And with that, we're going to get to work. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. Appreciate it. <p>Oh, wait, wait. Excuse me. There's actually one other point that I wanted to make. And that is that my understanding is tomorrow is Speaker Boehner's birthday. So for those of you who want to wish him a happy birthday, we will. We're not going to embarrass him with a cake because we didn't know how many candles were needed. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Speaker of the House of Representatives John A. Boehner</i>. Yes, right. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> But we do want to wish him a happy birthday. <p><i>Speaker Boehner</i>. Thank you. Thank you. <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you, everybody.\" "
"225" "\"Hi, everybody. <p>Four years after the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes, our economy is growing again and creating jobs. But we have much more to do. Our task now is to build on that progress, because this Nation only succeeds when we've got a growing, thriving middle class. <p>That's what drives me. That's what I campaigned on for the past year. That's what will guide me in our work over the next 4 years. And I'm willing to work with anyone of any party to move this country forward. <p>Because soon, we face a very clear deadline that requires us to make some big decisions on jobs and taxes, on investments and deficits. Both parties voted to set this deadline, and I believe both parties can work together to make these decisions in a balanced and responsible way. <p>When it comes to taxes, for example, there are two paths available. One says, if Congress fails to act by the end of the year, then everybody's taxes automatically go up, including the 98 percent of Americans who make less than $250,000 a year. Our economy just can't afford that right now; you can't afford that right now; and nobody wants that to happen. <p>The other path is for Congress to pass a law right away to prevent a tax hike on the first $250,000 of anyone's income. That means all Americans, including the wealthiest Americans, get a tax cut and 98 percent of Americans and 97 percent of all small-business owners won't see their income taxes go up a single dime. The Senate's already passed a bill like this. Democrats in the House are ready to pass one too. All we need is for Republicans in the House to come onboard. <p>We shouldn't hold the middle class hostage while Congress debates tax cuts for the wealthy. Let's begin our work by actually doing what we all agree on. Let's keep taxes low for the middle class. And let's get it done soon so we can give families and businesses some good news going into the holiday season. <p>I know these challenges won't be easy to solve, but we can do it if we work together. That's why on Friday I sat down with Congressional leaders to discuss how we can reduce our deficit in a way that strengthens our economy and protects our middle class. It was a constructive meeting. And everyone agreed that while we may have our differences, we need to come together, find solutions, and take action as soon as possible. <p>Because if anything, that's the message I heard loud and clear in this election. Work as hard as you can to make our lives better, and do it together. Don't worry about the politics. Just get it done. <p>Everywhere I went during the campaign, from the farms of Iowa to the Vegas strip, from Colorado's Rockies to the Florida coast, I was inspired by the grit and resilience of the American people, by your hard work and sense of decency. And it makes me want to work even harder for you. I saw it again this week in New York, where our fellow citizens are going through a really tough time, but are helping each other through it. And we're going to be there to help them rebuild. <p>Every single day, the good people of this country work as hard as you can to meet your responsibilities. Those of us that you send to Washington have to do the same. <p>Thanks and have a great weekend.\" "
"226" "\"<i>Prime Minister Yinglak.</i> President Barack Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me a great pleasure to welcome you to Thailand and to be the first country to receive you after your decisive reelection victory. I hope to make the gala dinner tonight not only a reception for your visit, but also a celebration for your second term in office. I sincerely believe that your Presidency will be a successful one and will be fruitful in enhancing the relationship between our two nations. <p>I also wish to take this occasion to thank you, you and your team, in particular Secretary Clinton, for all that she has done to advance Thai-U.S. relations and U.S. engagement with Asia. Our partnership is exceptional, not only because of the deep historical roots, but also because of strong people-to-people ties based on shared values of democracy and respect for civil liberties. <p>We appreciate your support in bringing democracy in Thailand back on track. I hope you continue to do so as Thailand's democracy still faces many challenges ahead. <p>In terms of economic relations, as the President and I have discussed today, we will continue to build on a strong foundations in expanding our trade and investment to promote growth and create jobs. The world is changing fast, and only through trust, partnership, can we ensure peace and prosperity for both nations. <p>Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, for me there is no better way to launch a celebration of our 180th anniversary of relations in 2013 than with this Presidential visit today. May I invite all of you to join me in toast: To the good health and success of President Barack Obama and to the long-lasting friendship between the United States of America and the Kingdom of Thailand. <p>Cheers. <p>[<i>At this point, Prime Minister Yinglak offered a toast.</i>] <p><i>President Obama.</i> Well, good evening, everyone. Madam Prime Minister, distinguished guests, and ladies and gentlemen, my visit to Thailand is far too brief, but even in my short stay, I've already felt the extraordinary warmth and kindness and hospitality of the people of Thailand. Everyone knows that this is the Land of Smiles, and I have felt it everywhere that I've gone. <p>I've also felt the dignity and strength of this country and its people: the tranquility and peace that I felt as I had the privilege of walking around the sacred grounds of Wat Pho and gazing up at the Reclining Buddha; the compassion and wisdom that you felt in the presence of His Majesty the King, who has devoted his reign to the welfare and development of his people. We've seen it in the resilience that has pushed this nation forward, most recently, in the face of devastating floods. <p>And most of all, I think we all feel here tonight the unique friendship between our peoples. His Majesty once said that since he was born in America, the United States is \\"half my motherland.\\" And we are just as proud of all the Thai Americans who enrich our country. In fact, I was mentioning to His Majesty that my friend, Ladda \\"Tammy\\" Duckworth, just became the first Thai American woman ever to be elected to our Congress, and she's from my home State of Illinois, so I'm especially proud of her. <p>Everything that I've felt&mdash;your dignity, your resilience, your friendship, your warmth&mdash;that is the foundation of our alliance. It's why you were the first Asian nation to reach out to America after we won our Independence. It's why in Asia, to this day, we can say Thailand is our oldest friend. And we are extraordinarily proud of that friendship, and we are especially pleased to see the excellent leadership that, Madam Prime Minister, you are providing as you continue this country's path of democracy, freedom, and development. <p>So I want to propose a toast: To the friendship between our peoples, to the strength of our alliance, to the peace and prosperity that we seek, and to Their Majesties the King and the Queen. <p><i>Chai yo! </i><p>[<i>President Obama offered a toast.</i>]\" "

I have seen just earlier today the golden stupa of Shwedagon and have been moved by the timeless idea of <i>metta</i>&mdash;the belief that our time on this Earth can be defined by tolerance and by love. And I know this land reaches from the crowded neighborhoods of this old city to the homes of more than 60,000 villages, from the peaks of the Himalayas, the forests of Karen State, to the banks of the Irrawaddy River. <p>I came here because of my respect for this university. It was here at this school where opposition to colonial rule first took hold. It was here that Aung San edited a magazine before leading an independence movement. It was here that U Thant learned the ways of the world before guiding it at the United Nations. Here, scholarship thrived during the last century, and students demanded their basic human rights. Now your Parliament has at last passed a resolution to revitalize this university, and it must reclaim its greatness, because the future of this country will be determined by the education of its youth. <p>I came here because of the history between our two countries. A century ago, American traders, merchants, and missionaries came here to build bonds of faith and commerce and friendship. And from within these borders in World War II, our pilots flew into China, and many of our troops gave their lives. Both of our nations emerged from the British Empire, and the United States was among the first countries to recognize an independent Union of Burma. We were proud to found an American Center in Rangoon and to build exchanges with schools like this one. And through decades of differences, Americans have been united in their affection for this country and its people. <p>Above all, I came here because of America's belief in human dignity. Over the last several decades, our two countries became strangers. But today I can tell you that we always remained hopeful about the people of this country, about you. You gave us hope ,and we bore witness to your courage. <p>We saw the activists dressed in white visit the families of political prisoners on Sundays and monks dressed in saffron protesting peacefully in the streets. We learned of ordinary people who organized relief teams to respond to a cyclone and heard the voices of students and the beats of hip-hop artists projecting the sound of freedom. We came to know exiles and refugees who never lost touch with their families or their ancestral home. And we were inspired by the fierce dignity of <i>Daw </i>Aung San Suu Kyi, as she proved that no human being can truly be imprisoned if hope burns in your heart. <p>When I took office as President, I sent a message to those governments who ruled by fear. I said, in my Inauguration address, \\"We will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.\\" And over the last year and a half, a dramatic transition has begun, as a dictatorship of five decades has loosened its grip. Under President Thein Sein, the desire for change has been met by an agenda for reform. A civilian now leads the Government, and a parliament is asserting itself. The once-outlawed National League for Democracy stood in an election, and Aung San Suu Kyi is a Member of Parliament. Hundreds of prisoners of conscience have been released, and forced labor has been banned. Preliminary cease-fires have been reached with ethnic armies, and new laws allow for a more open economy. <p>So today I've come to keep my promise and extend the hand of friendship. America now has an Ambassador in Rangoon, sanctions have been eased, and we will help rebuild an economy that can offer opportunity for its people and serve as an engine of growth for the world. But this remarkable journey has just begun and has much further to go. Reforms launched from the top of society must meet the aspirations of citizens who form its foundation. The flickers of progress that we have seen must not be extinguished, they must be strengthened; they must become a shining North Star for all this nation's people. <p>And your success in that effort is important to the United States, as well as to me. Even though we come from different places, we share common dreams: to choose our leaders, to live together in peace, to get an education and make a good living, to love our families and our communities. That's why freedom is not an abstract idea; freedom is the very thing that makes human progress possible, not just at the ballot box, but in our daily lives. <p>One of our greatest Presidents in the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, understood this truth. He defined America's cause as more than the right to cast a ballot. He understood democracy was not just voting. He called upon the world to embrace four fundamental freedoms: freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear. These four freedoms reinforce one another, and you cannot fully realize one without realizing them all. <p>So that's the future that we seek for ourselves and for all people. And that is what I want to speak to you about today. <p>First, we believe in the right of free expression so that the voices of ordinary people can be heard, and governments reflect their will&mdash;the people's will. <p>In the United States, for more than two centuries, we have worked to keep this promise for all of our citizens: to win freedom for those who were enslaved, to extend the right to vote for women and African Americans, to protect the rights of workers to organize. <p>And we recognize no two nations achieve these rights in exactly the same way, but there is no question that your country will be stronger if it draws on the strength of all of its people. That's what allows nations to succeed. That's what reform has begun to do. <p>Instead of being repressed, the right of people to assemble together must now be fully respected. Instead of being stifled, the veil of media censorship must continue to be lifted. And as you take these steps, you can draw on your progress. Instead of being ignored, citizens who protested the construction of the Myitsone Dam were heard. Instead of being outlawed, political parties have been allowed to participate. You can see progress being made. As one voter said during the parliamentary elections here, \\"Our parents and grandparents waited for this, but never saw it.\\" And now you can see it. You can taste freedom. <p>And to protect the freedom of all the voters, those in power must accept constraints. That's what our American system is designed to do. Now, America may have the strongest military in the world, but it must submit to civilian control. I, as the President of the United States, make determinations that the military then carries out, not the other way around. As President and Commander in Chief, I have that responsibility because I'm accountable to the people. <p>Now, on other hand, as President, I cannot just impose my will on Congress&mdash;the Congress of the United States&mdash;even though sometimes I wish I could. The legislative branch has its own powers and its own prerogatives, and so they check my power and balance my power. I appoint some of our judges, but I cannot tell them how to rule, because every person in America&mdash;from a child living in poverty to me, the President of the United States&mdash;is equal under the law. And a judge can make a determination as to whether or not I am upholding the law or breaking the law, and I am fully accountable to that law. <p>And I describe our system in the United States because that's how you must reach for the future that you deserve, a future where a single prisoner of conscience is one too many. You need to reach for a future where the law is stronger than any single leader, because it's accountable to the people. You need to reach for a future where no child is made to be a soldier and no woman is exploited and where the laws protect them even if they're vulnerable, even if they're weak. A future where national security is strengthened by a military that serves under civilians and a constitution that guarantees that only those who are elected by the people may govern. <p>On that journey, America will support you every step of the way: by using our assistance to empower civil society, by engaging your military to promote professionalism and human rights, and by partnering with you as you connect your progress towards democracy with economic development. So advancing that journey will help you pursue a second freedom: the belief that all people should be free from want. <p>It's not enough to trade a prison of powerlessness for the pain of an empty stomach. But history shows that governments of the people and by the people and for the people are far more powerful in delivering prosperity. And that's the partnership we seek with you. <p>When ordinary people have a say in their own future, then your land can't just be taken away from you. And that's why reforms must ensure that the people of this nation can have that most fundamental of possessions: the right to own the title to the land on which you live and on which you work. <p>When your talents are unleashed, then opportunity will be created for all people. America is lifting our ban on companies doing business here, and your government has lifted restrictions on investment and taken steps to open up your economy. And now, as more wealth flows into your borders, we hope and expect that it will lift up more people. It can't just help folks at the top, it has to help everybody. And that kind of economic growth, where everybody has opportunity&mdash;if you work hard, you can succeed&mdash;that's what gets a nation moving rapidly when it comes to development, but that kind of growth can only be created if corruption is left behind. For investment to lead to opportunity, reform must promote budgets that are transparent and industry that is privately owned. <p>To lead by example, America now insists that our companies meet high standards of openness and transparency if they're doing business here. And we'll work with organizations like the World Bank to support small businesses and to promote an economy that allows entrepreneurs, small-businesspeople to thrive and allows workers to keep what they earn. And I very much welcome your Government's recent decision to join what we've called our Open Government Partnership so that citizens can come to expect accountability and learn exactly how monies are spent and how your system of government operates. <p>Above all, when your voices are heard in government, it's far more likely that your basic needs will be met. And that's why reform must reach the daily lives of those who are hungry and those who are ill and those who live without electricity or water. And here too, America will do our part in working with you. <p>Today I was proud to reestablish our USAID mission in this country, which is our lead development agency. And the United States wants to be a partner in helping this country, which used to be the rice bowl of Asia, to reestablish its capacity to feed its people and to care for its sick and educate its children and build its democratic institutions as you continue down the path of reform. <p>This country is famous for its natural resources, and they must be protected against exploitation. And let us remember that in a global economy, a country's greatest resource is its people. So by investing in you, this nation can open the door for far more prosperity, because unlocking a nation's potential depends on empowering all its people, especially its young people. <p>Just as education is the key to America's future, it is going to be the key to your future as well. And so we look forward to working with you, as we have with many of your neighbors, to extend that opportunity and to deepen exchanges among our students. We want students from this country to travel to the United States and learn from us, and we want U.S. students to come here and learn from you. <p>And this truth leads me to the third freedom that I want to discuss: the freedom of worship&mdash;the freedom to worship as you please, and your right to basic human dignity. <p>This country, like my own country, is blessed with diversity. Not everybody looks the same. Not everybody comes from the same region. Not everybody worships in the same way. In your cities and towns, there are pagodas and temples and mosques and churches standing side by side. Well over a hundred ethnic groups have been a part of your story. Yet within these borders, we've seen some of the world's longest running insurgencies, which have cost countless lives and torn families and communities apart and stood in the way of development. <p>No process of reform will succeed without national reconciliation. You now have a moment of remarkable opportunity to transform cease-fires into lasting settlements and to pursue peace where conflicts still linger, including in Kachin State. Those efforts must lead to a more just and lasting peace, including humanitarian access to those in need and a chance for the displaced to return home. <p>Today, we look at the recent violence in Rakhine State that has caused so much suffering, and we see the danger of continued tensions there. For too long, the people of this state, including ethnic Rakhine, have faced crushing poverty and persecution. But there is no excuse for violence against innocent people. And the Rohingya hold themselves&mdash;hold within themselves the same dignity as you do and I do. <p>National reconciliation will take time, but for the sake of our common humanity, and for the sake of this country's future, it is necessary to stop incitement and to stop violence. And I welcome the Government's commitment to address the issues of injustice and accountability and humanitarian access and citizenship. That's a vision that the world will support as you move forward. <p>Every nation struggles to define citizenship. America has had great debates about these issues, and those debates continue to this day, because we're a nation of immigrants&mdash;people coming from every different part of the world. But what we've learned in the United States is that there are certain principles that are universal, apply to everybody no matter what you look like, no matter where you come from, no matter what religion you practice. The right of people to live without the threat that their families may be harmed or their homes may be burned simply because of who they are or where they come from. <p>Only the people of this country ultimately can define your union, can define what it means to be a citizen of this country. But I have confidence that as you do that you can draw on this diversity as a strength and not a weakness. Your country will be stronger because of many different cultures, but you have to seize that opportunity. You have to recognize that strength. <p>I say this because my own country and my own life have taught me the power of diversity. The United States of America is a nation of Christians and Jews and Muslims and Buddhists and Hindus and nonbelievers. Our story is shaped by every language; it's enriched by every culture. We have people from every corners of the world. We've tasted the bitterness of civil war and segregation, but our history shows us that hatred in the human heart can recede, that the lines between races and tribes fade away. And what's left is a simple truth: <i>e pluribus unum</i>&mdash;that's what we say in America&mdash;out of many, we are one Nation and we are one people. And that truth has, time and again, made our Union stronger. It has made our country stronger. It's part of what has made America great. <p>We amended our Constitution to extend the democratic principles that we hold dear. And I stand before you today as President of the most powerful nation on Earth, but recognizing that once, the color of my skin would have denied me the right to vote. And so that should give you some sense that if our country can transcend its differences then yours can too. Every human being within these borders is a part of your nation's story, and you should embrace that. That's not a source of weakness, that's a source of strength, if you recognize it. <p>And that brings me to the final freedom that I will discuss today, and that is the right of all people to live free from fear. <p>In many ways, fear is the force that stands between human beings and their dreams. Fear of conflict and the weapons of war. Fear of a future that is different from the past. Fear of changes that are reordering our societies and our economy. Fear of people who look different, or come from a different place, or worship in a different way. In some of her darkest moments, when Aung San Suu Kyi was imprisoned, she wrote an essay about freedom from fear. She said, \\"Fear of losing corrupts those who wield it, fear of losing power corrupts those who wield it, and fear of the scourge of power corrupts those who are subject to it.\\" <p>That's the fear that you can leave behind. We see that chance in leaders who are beginning to understand that power comes from appealing to people's hopes, not people's fears. We see it in citizens who insist that this time must be different, that this time change will come and will continue. As Aung San Suu Kyi wrote: \\"Fear is not the natural state of civilized man.\\" I believe that. And today, you are showing the world that fear does not have to be the natural state of life in this country. <p>That's why I am here. That's why I came to Rangoon. And that's why what happens here is so important, not only to this region, but to the world. Because you're taking a journey that has the potential to inspire so many people. This is a test of whether a country can transition to a better place. <p>The United States of America is a Pacific nation, and we see our future as bound to those nations and peoples to our west. And as our economy recovers, this is where we believe we will find enormous growth. As we have ended the wars that have dominated our foreign policy for a decade, this region will be a focus for our efforts to build a prosperous peace. <p>Here in Southeast Asia, we see the potential for integration among nations and people. And as President, I have embraced ASEAN for reasons that go beyond the fact that I spent some of my childhood in this region, in Indonesia. Because with ASEAN, we see nations that are on the move: nations that are growing and democracies that are emerging; governments that are cooperating; progress that's building on the diversity that spans oceans and islands and jungles and cities, peoples of every race and every religion. This is what the 21st century should look like if we have the courage to put aside our differences and move forward with a sense of mutual interest and mutual respect. <p>And here in Rangoon, I want to send a message across Asia: We don't need to be defined by the prisons of the past. We need to look forward to the future. To the leadership of North Korea, I have offered a choice: Let go of your nuclear weapons and choose the path of peace and progress. If you do, you will find an extended hand from the United States of America. <p>In 2012, we don't need to cling to the divisions of East, West, and North and South. We welcome the peaceful rise of China, your neighbor to the north and India, your neighbor to the west. The United Nations&mdash;the United States will work with any nation, large or small, that will contribute to a world that is more peaceful and more prosperous, and more just and more free. And the United States will be a friend to any nation that respects the rights of its citizens and the responsibilities of international law. <p>That's the nation&mdash;that's the world&mdash;that you can start to build here in this historic city. This nation that's been so isolated can show the world the power of a new beginning and demonstrate once again that the journey to democracy goes hand in hand with development. I say this knowing that there are still countless people in this country who do not enjoy the opportunities that many of you seated here do. There are tens of millions who have no electricity. There are prisoners of conscience who still await release. There are refugees and displaced peoples in camps where hope is still something that lies on the distant horizon. <p>Today I say to you&mdash;and I say to everybody that can hear my voice&mdash;that the United States of America is with you, including those who have been forgotten, those who are dispossessed, those who are ostracized, those who are poor. We carry your story in our heads and your hopes in our hearts, because in this 21st century with the spread of technology and the breaking down of barriers, the frontlines of freedom are within nations and individuals, not simply between them. <p>As one former prisoner put it in speaking to his fellow citizens: \\"Politics is your job. It's not only for politicians.\\" And we have an expression in the United States that the most important office in a democracy is the office of citizen: not President, not Speaker, but citizen. <p>So as extraordinary and difficult and challenging and sometimes frustrating as this journey may seem, in the end, you, the citizens of this country, are the ones who must define what freedom means. You're the ones who are going to have to seize freedom, because a true revolution of the spirit begins in each of our hearts. It requires the kind of courage that so many of your leaders have already displayed. <p>The road ahead will be marked by huge challenges, and there will be those who resist the forces of change. But I stand here with confidence that something is happening in this country that cannot be reversed, and the will of the people can lift up this nation and set a great example for the world. And you will have in the United States of America a partner on that long journey. So<i> chezu tinbade</i>. <p>Thank you.\" "
"228" "\"<i>The President.</i> Well, good afternoon, everybody. <p>[<i>At this point, the turkey gobbled.</i>] <p>[<i>Laughter</i>] <p>They say that life is all about second chances. And this November, I could not agree more. So in the spirit of the season, I have one more gift to give, and it goes to a pair of turkeys named Cobbler and Gobbler. The American people have spoken, and these birds are moving forward. <p>[<i>The turkey gobbled.</i>] <p>[<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I love this bird. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, I joke, but for the first time in our history, the winners of the White House turkey pardon were chosen through a highly competitive online vote. And once again, Nate Silver completely nailed it. [<i>Laughter</i>] The guy is amazing. He predicted these guys would win. <p>I want to thank everyone who participated in this election. Because of your votes, the only cobbler anyone's eating this Thanksgiving will come with a side of ice cream. And for that, our winning turkey can thank his stellar campaign team led by Steve Willardsen, who is the chairman of the National Turkey Foundation and raised this beautiful bird at Miller Farm in Harrisonburg, Virginia. So here's Steve. <p>And, as always, if for some reason Cobbler cannot fulfill his duties as the Official White House Turkey, Gobbler will be waiting in the wings. <p>From here, these two&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;from here these two lucky birds will be swept up in a whirlwind of fame and fortune that will ultimately lead them to Mount Vernon, where they will spend their twilight years in the storied home of George Washington. And later today Michelle, Malia, Sasha and I will be taking two turkeys who were not so lucky to a local food bank here in Washington, DC. I want to thank Jaindl Turkey Farms in Pennsylvania for donating these birds&mdash;or those birds&mdash;and I'd like to ask every American to do what they can to help families who are in need of a real Thanksgiving this year. <p>Tomorrow, in the company of friends and loved ones, we will celebrate a uniquely American holiday. And it's a chance for us to spend time with the people we care about and to give thanks for the blessings that we enjoy and to think about just how lucky we are to live in the greatest nation on Earth. <p>But it's also a time to remember those who are less fortunate. And this year, that's particularly true for our neighbors in the Northeast who have lost their homes and their possessions and even their loved ones to Hurricane Sandy. <p>In the last few weeks, I had a chance to visit both New Jersey and New York. And while I've seen entire neighborhoods reduced to rubble and heartbreaking loss and devastation, I have yet to find a broken spirit. <p>Countless stories of courage and compassion and resilience have emerged in the aftermath of the storm. But one that comes to mind today is about a tree on Staten Island. It's a giant blue spruce that came crashing down in the front yard of Joseph Ingenito, whose home in New Dorp Beach flooded during the hurricane. Today, if you go to Joseph's street, you'll see a lot of damage and debris scattered all over the block. But you'll also see the top of that tree, standing tall in front of his house, decorated with ornaments that survived the storm, along with anything else his neighbors could find, including empty cups and surgical masks and safety goggles. It's a Christmas tree, and it's there to remind the neighborhood that there will still be holidays to celebrate and happy moments to share. And life will go on, and we will rebuild. <p>And so tomorrow, we give thanks, not only for the things that we have or the people we love, but for the spirit that sees us through the toughest times and holds us together as one American family, guided along our journey by the hope of a better day. <p>And I hope that over this holiday weekend, we're also thinking about our extraordinary men and women overseas who are serving far away from home in harm's way. But the reason they're there is because they give thanks too for the extraordinary life that we have here in the United States of America. <p>So may God bless those brave men and women in uniform who are away from their families this holiday season. May God bless the American people. May you all have a very happy Thanksgiving. <p>And with that, I think we are going to bestow the official pardon on, on a&mdash;wait, which&mdash;is he Gobbler or Cobbler? Cobbler. That's it. <p>Come on. <p>[<i>The President walked with his daughters toward the turkey.</i>] <p>All right, I've got to give the special dispensation. <p>[<i>The President made a hand gesture and pardoned the turkey</i>.] <p>You are hereby pardoned. Congratulations, Cobbler. You're going to have a great life. <p>Everybody, give Cobbler a big round of applause.\" "
"229" "\"On behalf of the Obama family, Michelle, Malia, Sasha, Bo, and me, I want to wish everyone a very happy Thanksgiving. <p>For us, like so many of you, this is a day full of family and friends, food and football. It's a day to fight the overwhelming urge to take a nap, at least until after dinner. But most of all, it's a time to give thanks for each other and for the incredible bounty we enjoy in this country. <p>That's especially important this year. As a nation, we've just emerged from a campaign season that was passionate, noisy, and vital to our democracy. But it also required us to make choices. And sometimes those choices led us to focus on what sets us apart instead of what ties us together; on what candidate we support instead of what country we all belong to. Thanksgiving is a chance to put it all in perspective&mdash;to remember that despite our differences, we are and always will be, Americans first and foremost. <p>Today we give thanks for blessings that are all too rare in this world. The ability to spend time with the ones we love, to say what we want, to worship as we please, to know that there are brave men and women defending our freedom around the globe, and to look our children in the eye and to tell them that here in America, no dream is too big, if they're willing to work for it. We're also grateful that this country has always been home to Americans who see these blessings not simply as gifts to enjoy, but as opportunities to give back; Americans who believe we have a responsibility to look out for those who are less fortunate, to pull each other up and move forward together. <p>Right now, as we prepare to gather around our dinner tables, there are families in the Northeast who don't have that luxury. Many of them have lost everything to Hurricane Sandy&mdash;homes, possessions, even loved ones. And it will be a long time before life gets back to normal for them. <p>But in the midst of so much tragedy, there are also glimmers of hope. Over the last few weeks, we've seen FEMA personnel, National Guard, and first-responders working around the clock in hard-hit communities. We've seen hospital workers using their lunch breaks to distribute supplies; families offering up extra bedrooms; the fire department advertising free hot showers; buses full of volunteers coming from hundreds of miles away; neighbors sharing whatever they have&mdash;food, water, and electricity&mdash;and saying again and again how lucky they are to have a roof over their heads. It would have been easy for these folks to do nothing, to worry about themselves and leave the rest to someone else. But that's not who we are; that's not what we do. <p>As Americans, we are bold, generous, big-hearted people. When our brothers and sisters are in need, we roll up our sleeves and get to work&mdash;not for the recognition or the reward, but because it's the right thing to do; because there but for the grace of God go I; and because here in America, we rise or fall together, as one Nation and one people. That's something to be grateful for, today and every day. <p>So to all the Americans doing your part to make our world a better place, it is my great privilege to serve as your President; to all our servicemembers, it is my honor to be your Commander in Chief; and from our family to yours, happy Thanksgiving, everybody.\" "
"230" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. Thank you very much. Everybody, please have a seat, except you guys. Don't sit down. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Well, good morning, everybody. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Good morning. <p><i>The President.</i> You know, there's been a lot of talk here in Washington about the deadlines we're facing on taxes and deficits. These deadlines are going to be coming up very soon in the coming weeks. But today is important because I want to make sure everybody understands this debate is not just about numbers. It's a set of major decisions that are going to affect millions of families all across this country in very significant ways. And their voices&mdash;the voices of the American people&mdash;have to be part of this debate. And so I asked some friends of mine here to join me, some folks from here in the area. <p>Our ultimate goal is an agreement that gets our long-term deficit under control in a way that is fair and balanced. That kind of agreement would be good for our businesses; it would be good for our economy; it would be good for our children's future. And I believe that both parties can agree on a framework that does that in the coming weeks. In fact, my hope is to get this done before Christmas. <p>But the place where we already have, in theory at least, complete agreement right now is on middle class taxes. And as I've said before, we've got two choices. If Congress does nothing, every family in America will see their taxes automatically go up at the beginning of next year. Starting January 1, every family in America will see their taxes go up. <p>A typical middle class family of four would see its income taxes go up by $2,200. That's $2,200 out of people's pockets. That means less money for buying groceries, less money for filling prescriptions, less money for buying diapers. [<i>Laughter</i>] It means a tougher choice between paying the rent and paying tuition. And middle class families just can't afford that right now. <p>By the way, businesses can't afford it either. Yesterday I sat down with some small-business owners who stressed this point. Economists predict that if taxes go up on the middle class next year, consumers will spend nearly $200 billion less on things like cars and clothes and furniture, and that obviously means fewer customers. That cuts into business profits. That makes businesses less likely to invest and hire, which means fewer jobs, and that can drag our entire economy down. <p>Now, the good news is there's a better option. Right now, as we speak, Congress can pass a law that would prevent a tax hike on the first $250,000 of everybody's income&mdash;everybody's. And that means that 98 percent of Americans and 97 percent of small businesses wouldn't see their income taxes go up by a single dime. Ninety-eight percent of Americans, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up by a single dime. <p>Even the wealthiest Americans would still get a tax cut on the first $250,000 of their income. So it's not like folks who make more than 250 aren't getting a tax break too. They're getting a tax break on the first 250 just like everybody else. <p>Families and small businesses would, therefore, be able to enjoy some peace of mind heading into Christmas and heading into the New Year. And it would give us more time then next year to work together on a comprehensive plan to bring down our deficits, to streamline our tax system, to do it in a balanced way, including asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more, so that we can still invest in things like education and training and science and research. <p>Now, I know some of this may sound familiar to you because we talked a lot about this during the campaign. This shouldn't be a surprise to anybody. This was a major debate in the Presidential campaign and in congressional campaigns all across the country. And a clear majority of Americans&mdash;not just Democrats, but also a lot of Republicans and a lot of Independents&mdash;agreed we should have a balanced approach to deficit reduction that doesn't hurt the economy and doesn't hurt middle class families. And I'm glad to see&mdash;if you've been reading the papers lately&mdash;that more and more Republicans in Congress seem to be agreeing with this idea that we should have a balanced approach. <p>So if both parties agree we should not raise taxes on middle class families, let's begin our work with where we agree. The Senate has already passed a bill that keeps income taxes from going up on middle class families. Democrats in the House are ready to vote for that same bill today. And if we can get a few House Republicans to agree as well, I'll sign this bill as soon as Congress sends it my way. I've got to repeat, I've got a pen. I'm ready to sign it. <p>So my point here today is to say, let's approach this problem with the middle class in mind: the folks who are behind me and the millions of people all across the country who they represent. The American people are watching what we do&mdash;middle class families, folks who are working hard to get into the middle class&mdash;they're watching what we do right now. And if there's one thing that I've learned, when the American people speak loudly enough, lo and behold, Congress listens. <p>Some of you may remember that a year ago, during our last big fight to protect middle class families, tens of thousands of working Americans called and tweeted and e-mailed their representatives, asking them to do the right thing. And sure enough, it worked. The same thing happened earlier this year when college students across the country stood up and demanded that Congress keep rates low on their student loans. Congress got the message loud and clear and they made sure that interest rates on student loans did not go up. <p>So the lesson is that when enough people get involved, we have a pretty good track record of actually making Congress work. And that's important, because this is our biggest challenge yet, and it's one that we can only meet together. <p>So in the interest of making sure that everybody makes their voices heard, last week, we asked people to tell us what would a $2,000 tax hike mean to them. Some families told us it would make it more difficult for them to send their kids to college. Others said it would make it tougher for them to cover the cost of prescription drugs. Some said it would make it tough for them to make their mortgage. <p>Lyn Lyon, who's here from Newport News&mdash;where's Lyn? There she is. She just wants to see some cooperation in Washington. She wrote, \\"Let's show the rest of the world that we're adults and, living in a democracy, we can solve our problems by working together.\\" <p>So that's what this debate is all about. And that's why it's so important that as many Americans as possible send a message that we need to keep moving forward. So today I'm asking Congress to listen to the people who sent us here to serve. I'm asking Americans all across the country to make your voice heard. Tell Members of Congress what a $2,000 tax hike would mean to you. Call your Members of Congress, write them an e-mail, post it on their Facebook walls. You can tweet it using the hashtag &ldquo;My2K.\\" Not \\"Y2K.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"My2K.\\" We figured that would make it a little easier to remember. <p>And I want to assure the American people I'm doing my part: I'm sitting down with CEOs; I'm sitting down with labor leaders; I'm talking to leaders in Congress. I am ready and able and willing and excited to go ahead and get this issue resolved in a bipartisan fashion so that American families, American businesses have some certainty going into next year. And we can do it in a balanced and fair way, but our first job is to make sure that taxes on middle class families don't go up. And since we all theoretically agree on that, we should go ahead and get that done. If we get that done, a lot of the other stuff is going to be a lot easier. <p>So in light of just, sort of, spreading this message, I'm going to be visiting Pennsylvania on Friday to talk with folks at a small business there that are trying to make sure that they're filling their Christmas orders. And I'll go anywhere, and I'll do whatever it takes to get this done. It's too important for Washington to screw this up. Now is the time for us to work on what we all agree to, which is, let's keep middle class taxes low. That's what our economy needs. That's what the American people deserve. <p>And if we get this part of it right, then a lot of the other issues surrounding deficit reduction in a fair and balanced and responsible way are going to be a whole lot easier. And if we get this wrong, the economy is going to go south. It's going to be much more difficult for us to balance our budgets and deal with our deficits, because if the economy is not strong, that means more money is going out in things like unemployment insurance, and less money is coming in, in terms of tax receipts. And it just actually makes our deficit worse. <p>So we really need to get this right. I can only do it with the help of the American people. So tweet&mdash;what was that again&mdash;\\"My2K\\". Tweet using the hashtag \\"My2K\\" or e-mail; post it on a Member of Congress's Facebook wall. Do what it takes to communicate a sense of urgency. We don't have a lot of time here. We've got a few weeks to get this thing done. We could get it done tomorrow. Now, optimistically, I don't think we're going to get it done tomorrow&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but I tell you, if everybody here goes out of their way to make their voices heard, and spread the word to your friends and your family, your coworkers, your neighbors, then I am confident we will get it done. And we will put America on the right track not just for next year, but for many years to come. All right? <p>Thank you very much, everybody. Appreciate it.\" "
"231" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! Thank you. Thank you. Well, good morning, everybody. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Good morning! <p><i>The President.</i> Everybody, please, please have a seat. Have a seat. Relax for a second. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>It is good to see all of you. Hello, Hatfield! It is good to be back in Pennsylvania. And it is good to be right here at K'NEX. Now, I want to thank Michael Araten, Robert Glickman, and the inventor of K'NEX, Joel Glickman, for hosting me today and giving me a great tour. Where did they go? Where did they go? I want to&mdash;stand up. Stand up so everybody can see you guys. There they are. There you go. <p>And I just noticed, we've got a couple of outstanding Members of Congress here. We've got Chaka Fattah and Allyson Schwartz. <p>Now, I just finished getting a tour of the K'NEX workshop. I have to say, it makes me wish that Joel had invented this stuff a little sooner, when I was a kid. [<i>Laughter</i>] Back then, you couldn't really build a rollercoaster out of your Erector Set. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And I also got a chance to meet some of the folks who have been working around the clock to keep up with the Christmas rush, and that's a good thing. These guys are Santa's extra elves here. They manufacture almost 3,000 K'NEX pieces every minute. And every box that ends up on store shelves in 30 countries is stamped \\"Made in America.\\" And that's something to be proud of. [<i>Applause</i>] That's something to be proud of. <p>By the way, I hope the camera folks had a chance to take a look at some of the K'NEX, including that flag made out of K'NEX. And Joe Biden was in Costco; he wanted to buy some of this stuff. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I told him he had too much work to do. I wasn't going to have him building rollercoasters all day long. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, of course, Santa delivers everywhere. I've been keeping my own naughty-and-nice list for Washington. So you should keep your eye on who gets some K'NEX this year. [<i>Laughter</i>] There are going to be some Members of Congress who get them and some who don't. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But look, this is a wonderful time of year. It's been a few weeks since a long election finally came to an end. And obviously, I couldn't be more honored to be back in the White House. But I'm already missing the time that I spent on the campaign visiting towns like this and talking to folks like you. <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. That's why I miss you. <p>And one of the benefits of traveling and getting out of the White House is it gives you a chance to have a conversation with the American people about what kind of country do we want to be and what kind of country do we want to leave to our kids. <p>I believe America only thrives when we have a strong and growing middle class. And I believe we're at our best when everybody who works hard has a chance to get ahead. That's what I believe. And I know that's what the founders of this company believe as well. We were talking about these guys' dad, who I understand just passed away at the age of 101. So these guys have good genes in addition to inventive minds. [<i>Laughter</i>] And the story of generations starting businesses, hiring folks, making sure that if you work hard, you can get ahead, that's what America is all about. And that's at the heart of the plan that I've been talking about all year. <p>I want to reward manufacturers like this one and small businesses that create jobs here in the United States, not overseas. I want to&mdash;and by the way, this is a company&mdash;one of the few companies in the toy industry that have aggressively moved jobs back here. That's a great story to tell because we've got the best workers in the world and the most productive workers in the world, and so we need champions for American industry creating jobs here in the United States. <p>I want to give more Americans the chance to earn the skills that businesses are looking for right now, and I want to give our children the kind of education that they need in the 21st century. I want America to lead the world in research and technology and clean energy. I want to put people back to work rebuilding our roads and our bridges and our schools. And I want to do all this while bringing down our deficits in a balanced and responsible way. <p>Now, on this last point, you've probably heard a lot of talk in Washington and in the media about the deadlines that we're facing on jobs and taxes and investment. This is not some run-of-the-mill debate. This isn't about which political party can come out on top in negotiations. We've got important decisions to make that are going to have a real impact on businesses and families all across the country. <p>Our ultimate goal&mdash;our long-term goal&mdash;is to get our long-term deficit under control in a way that is balanced and is fair. That would be good for businesses, for our economy, for future generations. And I believe both parties can&mdash;and will&mdash;work together in the coming weeks to get that done. We know how that gets done. We're going to have to raise a little more revenue. We've got to cut out spending we don't need, building on the trillion dollars of spending cuts we've already made. And if we combine those two things, we can create a path where America is paying its bills while still being able to make investments in the things we need to grow like education and infrastructure. So we know how to do that. <p>But in Washington, nothing is easy, so there is going to be some prolonged negotiations. And all of us are going to have to get out of our comfort zones to make that happen. I'm willing to do that, and I'm hopeful that enough Members of Congress in both parties are willing to do that as well. We can solve these problems. But where the clock is really ticking right now is on middle class taxes. At the end of the year, middle class taxes that are currently in place are set to expire. Middle class tax cuts that are currently in place are set to expire. <p>There are two things that can happen. If Congress does nothing, every family in America will see their income taxes automatically go up on January 1. Every family, everybody here, you'll see your taxes go up on January 1. I mean, I'm assuming that doesn't sound too good to you. <p><i>Audience members.</i> No! <p><i>The President.</i> That's sort of like the lump of coal you get for Christmas. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's a Scrooge Christmas. A typical middle class family of four would see their income taxes go up by about $2,200. That's for a typical family; it would be more for some folks. That's money a lot of families just can't afford to lose. That's less money to buy gas, less money to buy groceries. In some cases, it means tougher choices between paying the rent and saving for college. It means less money to buy more K'NEX. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Yes. [<i>Laughter</i>] Just the other day, economists said that if income taxes go up on the middle class, people will spend nearly $200 billion less in stores and online. And when folks are buying fewer clothes or cars or toys, that's not good for our businesses, it's not good for our economy, it's not good for employment. <p>So that's one path: Congress does nothing; we don't deal with this looming tax hike on middle class families; and starting in January, everybody gets hit with this big tax hike and businesses suddenly see fewer customers, less demand. The economy, which we've been fighting for 4 years to get out of this incredible economic crisis that we have, it starts stalling again. So that's one path. <p>The good news is there's a second option. Right now Congress can pass a law that would prevent a tax hike on the first $250,000 of everybody's income&mdash;everybody. So that means 98 percent of Americans, 97 percent of small businesses wouldn't see their income taxes go up by a single dime, right? Because 98 percent of Americans make $250,000 a year or less; 97 percent of small businesses make $250,000 a year or less. So if you say income taxes don't go up for any income above $250,000, the vast majority of Americans, they don't see a tax hike. <p>But here's the thing. Even the top 2 percent, even folks who make more than $250,000, they'd still keep their tax cut on the first $250,000 of income. So it would still be better off for them too for us to go ahead and get that done. Families would have a sense of security going into the new year. Companies like this one would know what to expect in terms of planning for next year and the year after. That means people's jobs would be secure. <p>The sooner Congress gets this done, the sooner our economy will get a boost. And it would then give us in Washington more time to work together on that long-range plan to bring down deficits in a balanced way: tax reform, working on entitlements, and asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little bit more so we can keep investing in things like education and research that make us strong. <p>All right? So those are the choices that we have. And understand, this was a central question in the election, maybe the central question in the election. You remember. We talked about this a lot. [<i>Laughter</i>] It wasn't like this should come to anybody&mdash;a surprise to anybody. We had debates about it. There were a lot of TV commercials about it. And at the end of the day, a clear majority of Americans&mdash;Democrats, Republicans, Independents&mdash;they agreed with a balanced approach to deficit reduction and making sure that middle class taxes don't go up. Folks agreed to that. <p>Now, the good news is we're starting to see a few Republicans coming around to it too; I'm talking about Republicans in Congress. So the reason I'm here is because I want the American people to urge Congress soon, in the next week, the next 2 weeks, to begin the work we have by doing what we all agree on. Both parties agree that we should extend the middle class tax cuts. We've got some disagreements about the high-end tax cuts, right? Republicans want to&mdash;don't want to raise taxes on folks like me; I think I can pay a little bit more to make sure that kids can go to college and we can build roads and invest in NIH so that we're finding cures for Alzheimer's. And that's a disagreement that we're going to have and we've got to sort out. <p>But we already all agree, we say, on making sure middle class taxes don't go up, so let's get that done. Let's go ahead and take the fear out for the vast majority of American families so they don't have to worry about $2,000 coming out of their pockets starting next year. <p>The Senate has already passed a bill to keep income taxes from going up on middle class families. That's already passed the Senate. Your Members of Congress like Allyson and Chaka, other Democrats in the House, they're ready to go. They're ready to vote on that same thing. And if we can just get a few House Republicans on board, we can pass the bill in the House. It will land on my desk, and I am ready; I've got a bunch of pens ready to sign this bill. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm ready to sign it. [<i>Applause</i>] I'm ready to sign it. There are no shortage of pens in the White House. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I carry one around for an emergency just in case, just waiting for the chance to use it to sign this bill to make sure people's taxes don't go up. But&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> Thank you! <p><i>The President.</i> Well, don't thank me yet, because I haven't signed it. [<i>Laughter</i>] I need some help from Congress. <p>So the key is, though, that the American people have to be involved. It's not going to be enough for me to just do this on my own. So I'm hopeful that both sides are going to come together and do the right thing, but we all know you can't take anything for granted when it comes to Washington. Let's face it. And that's why I'm going to be asking for all of you to make your voices heard over the next few days and the next couple of weeks. <p>I need you to remind Members of Congress&mdash;Democrats and Republicans&mdash;to not get bogged down in a bunch of partisan bickering, but let's go ahead and focus on the people who sent us to Washington and make sure that we're doing the right thing by them. <p>So I want you to call, I want you to send an e-mail, post on their Facebook wall. If you tweet, then use a hashtag we're calling \\"My2K.\\" Not \\"Y2K,\\" \\"My2K,\\" all right? Because it's about your 2K in your pocket. [<i>Laughter</i>] We're trying to burn that into people's minds here. <p>So in the meantime I'm doing my part. I'm meeting with every constituency group out there. We're talking to CEOs. We're talking to labor groups. We're talking to civic groups. I'm talking to media outlets, just explaining to the American people, this is not that complicated. Let's make sure that middle class taxes don't go up. Let's get that done in the next couple of weeks. <p>Let's also work together on a fair and balanced, responsible plan so that we are paying our bills, we're not spending on things we don't need, but we are still spending on the things that make us grow. That's the kind of fair, balanced, responsible plan that I talked about during the campaign, and that's what the majority of Americans believe in. <p>So I'm hopeful, but I'm going to need folks like you&mdash;the people here in Hatfield and here in Pennsylvania and all across the country&mdash;to get this done. And a lot's riding on this debate. This is too important to our economy&mdash;it's too important for our families&mdash;to not get it done. And it's not acceptable to me, and I don't think it's acceptable to you, for just a handful of Republicans in Congress to hold middle class tax cuts hostage simply because they don't want tax rates on upper income folks to go up. All right? That doesn't make sense. <p>If your voices are heard, then we can help businesses like this one. We're going to sell a whole bunch of K'NEX. [<i>Laughter</i>] Let's give families all across America the kind of security and certainty that they deserve during the holiday season. Let's keep our economy on the right track. Let's stand up for the American belief that each of us have our own dreams and aspirations, but we're also in this together, and we can work together in a responsible way; that we're one people and we're one Nation. <p>That's what this country is about. That's what all of you deserve. That's what I'm fighting for every single day, and I will keep fighting for as long as I have the privilege of being your President. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless the America.\" "
"232" "\"Hi, everybody. I'm here on the factory floor of a business in Hatfield, Pennsylvania, where folks are working around the clock, making toys to keep up with the Christmas rush. And I came here because, back in Washington, the clock is ticking on some important decisions that will have a real impact on our businesses and on families like yours. <p>The most pressing decision has to do with your taxes. See, at the end of the year, middle class tax cuts are set to expire. And there are two things that can happen. <p>First, if Congress does nothing, every family will see their income taxes automatically go up at the beginning of next year. A typical middle class family of four will see their income taxes rise by $2,200. We can't let that happen. Our families can't afford it, and neither can our economy. <p>The second option is better. Right now Congress can pass a law that would prevent a tax hike on the first $250,000 of everybody's income&mdash;everybody. That means that 98 percent of Americans and 97 percent of small businesses wouldn't see their income taxes go up at all. And even the wealthiest Americans would get a tax cut on the first $250,000 of their income. <p>Congress can do that right now. They can give families like yours a sense of security going into the new year. They can give companies like this one some certainty about what to expect down the road. And with the issue behind us, we'll have more time to work out a plan to bring down our deficits in a balanced way, including by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more, so we can still invest in the things that make our Nation strong, like education and research. <p>So let's begin by doing what we all agree on. Both parties say we should keep middle class taxes low. The Senate has already passed a bill to keep income taxes from going up on middle class families. Democrats in the House are ready to do the same thing. And if we can just get a few House Republicans on board, I'll sign this bill as soon as Congress sends it my way. <p>But it's unacceptable for some Republicans in Congress to hold middle class tax cuts hostage simply because they refuse to let tax rates go up on the wealthiest Americans. And if you agree with me, then I could use your help. Let your Congressman know what $2,000 means to you. Give them a call, write them an e-mail, or tweet them using the hashtag \\"My2K.\\" That's \\"My2K.\\" <p>You and your family have a lot riding on the outcome of this debate; we all do. And as citizens, we all have a say in the country we want to build, not just on election day, but every day. So make your voice heard. I promise: It makes a difference. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"233" "\"Everybody, please have a seat. Thank you very much. Thank you. Well, good evening, everybody. You all look lovely. [<i>Laughter</i>] Welcome to the White House on a night when I am nowhere close to being the main attraction. <p>Thank you, David Rubenstein, Michael Kaiser and the Kennedy Center trustees, and everyone who has worked so hard to uphold President Kennedy's commitment to supporting the arts. I also want to recognize another of President Kennedy's amazing legacies, and that is his wonderful daughter Caroline, who is here tonight. <p>None of this would be possible without the cochairs of the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, George Stevens&mdash;where is George, there he is&mdash;and his son Michael&mdash;where did Michael go, there he is&mdash;who have produced the Kennedy Center Honors&mdash;they have produced the Kennedy Center Honors for 35 years now. <p>Tonight we continue a tradition here at the White House by honoring some extraordinary people who have no business being on the same stage together. [<i>Laughter</i>] We've got Buddy Guy sitting next to Dustin Hoffman. [<i>Laughter</i>] We've got Dave Letterman alongside one of the greatest ballerinas of all time. I don't think Dave dances. [<i>Laughter</i>] All three living members of Led Zeppelin in one place. So this is a remarkable evening. <p>And it speaks to something that has always made this country great: the idea that here in America, more than any other place on Earth, we are free to follow our own passions, explore our own gifts, wherever they may lead us. And people from all around the world come here to make sure that they too can provide us the incredible gifts that they have. <p>Tonight's honorees didn't just take up their crafts to make a living. They did it because they couldn't imagine living any other way. And that passion took each of them from humble beginnings to the pinnacle of their profession. And tonight, in the People's House, we have a chance to say thank you. <p>Growing up as the son of a sharecropper in Louisiana, Buddy Guy made his first guitar out of wires from a window screen. That worked until his parents started wondering how all the mosquitoes were getting in. [<i>Laughter</i>] But Buddy was hooked, and a few years later, he bought a one-way ticket to Chicago to find his heroes, Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf. Pretty soon he was broke, hungry, and ready to head home. And then, one night outside a blues club, a man pulled up and handed Buddy a salami sandwich and said, \\"I'm Mud, and you ain't going nowhere.\\" And that was the start of something special. <p>Of course, success hasn't changed the humble country boy who used to milk cows on a farm outside of Baton Rouge. Buddy tells a story about his son Greg wanting to learn to play the guitar like Prince. Buddy told him he'd better learn some Jimi Hendrix first. [<i>Laughter</i>] And it was only after watching a TV special on Hendrix that Greg found out Jimi had borrowed some licks from his dad. So Greg said, \\"I didn't know you could play like that.\\" And Buddy said, \\"You never asked.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Today, Buddy is still going strong, one of the last guardians of the great American blues. And on a personal note, I will never forget Buddy playing \\"Sweet Home Chicago\\" in this very room back in February and him and a few others forcing me to sing along&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;which was just okay. [<i>Laughter</i>] There aren't too many people who can get me to sing, but Buddy was one of them. And so we are so glad that we can honor him tonight. Congratulations, Buddy Guy. <p>When \\"The Graduate\\" was originally written, the main character was supposed to be Robert Redford, a tall, blond track star. And when Dustin Hoffman auditioned for the part, a crewmember handed him a subway token on his way out, saying, \\"Here, kid, you're going to need this.\\"[<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Dustin ended up getting the role, and it launched one of the greatest movie careers of his generation, of any generation. Most actors dream of being in maybe one film that becomes part of our cultural vocabulary. Dustin churned out \\"Midnight Cowboy,\\" \\"Tootsie,\\" \\"Rain Man,\\" \\"Hook\\"&mdash;not bad for a guy who signed up for his first acting class after a friend told him: \\"Nobody flunks acting; it's like gym.\\"[<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Still, I imagine one secret to his success is his inability to see himself as anything but an underdog. Even after \\"The Graduate\\" became a runaway success, Dustin says: \\"I really believed that was a fluke, and I refused to believe I had arrived. And in a way, I've been hanging on by my fingertips for the entire ride.\\" <p>Well, Dustin, you'll be glad to know that this award was not supposed to go to Robert Redford. [<i>Laughter</i>] He's already got one. [<i>Laughter</i>] So tonight we honor Dustin Hoffman, an actor who has finally arrived. He's made it. [<i>Applause</i>] He's made it. <p>If you ask David Letterman what's it like to tape his show, he'll say: \\"If it's going well, it just lifts you. If it's not going well, it sinks you. It's exhilarating. It's my favorite hour of the day.\\" It's unclear how Dave feels about this hour. It's different when you're not the one with the mike, isn't it, Dave? [<i>Laughter</i>] You're looking a little stressed, aren't you? [<i>Laughter</i>] I'd also point out it's a lot warmer here than it is on Dave's set. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But I've enjoyed my time in the Ed Sullivan Theater. And earlier this year, Dave celebrated his 30th anniversary in late night television, the only person to reach that milestone besides Johnny Carson. Now, Dave will be the first to tell you that he's no Carson, that all his years on television have only made him appreciate even more how unique Johnny was. But that's a good thing, because if he were more like Johnny, he'd be less like Dave. <p>After all, it was Dave who got his start as an Indianapolis weatherman, once reporting that the city was being pelted by hail \\"the size of canned hams.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] It's one of the highlights of his career. [<i>Laughter</i>] It was Dave who strapped a camera to a monkey&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;worked a Taco Bell drive-through, told Lady Gaga that when he was her age, he had a paper route. [<i>Laughter</i>] It was Dave who came back on the air less than a week after 9/11 to show the world that New York was still standing. <p>So tonight we honor Dave Letterman, who has always offered us an authentic piece of himself: sometimes cranky, often self-deprecating, always funny. And those of you who have been on his show know he is also a true gentleman. So thank you, Dave. Thank you. Congratulations. <p>When Natalia Makarova defected from the Soviet Union in 1970, she made headlines around the globe. But back home, her name was excised from textbooks, her photo expunged from the walls of her school. And for the next 18 years, her countrymen were forced to rely on underground channels to follow the rise of one of the most accomplished ballerinas in the world. <p>But no one can erase what takes hold of the heart. And in 1989, when the Iron Curtain opened, the Russian people welcomed her back with open arms. Over 2,000 people packed the Kirov Theater where she had trained as a young girl; another 20 people crammed in with the orchestra, all to watch a dancer who never thought she'd be back. It was a fitting end to a career that began when 13-year-old Natalia&mdash;completely double jointed and possessed of an incredible gift for musicality and movement&mdash;told her parents she did not want to be an engineer, thank you, she wanted to dance. <p>After hanging up her shoes, Natalia moved to Broadway, where she won a Tony Award. And she remains as humble as ever, once saying: \\"I'm never proud of what I've done. Sometimes, I'm not ashamed.\\" So thank you, Natalia, for the understatement of the century. [<i>Laughter</i>] Thank you for sharing your talents with all of us. Congratulations. <p>I worked with the speechwriters; there's no smooth transition from ballet to Led Zeppelin. [<i>Laughter</i>] We were trying to work the \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" metaphor, and it didn't work. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So when Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, John Paul Jones, and John Bonham burst onto the musical scene in the late 1960s, the world never saw it coming. There was this singer with a mane like a lion, a voice like a banshee; a guitar prodigy who left people's jaws on the floor; a versatile bassist who was equally at home on the keyboards; a drummer who played like his life depended on it. <p>And when the Brits initially kept their distance, Led Zeppelin grabbed America from the opening chord. We were ready for what Jimmy called songs with \\"a lot of light and shade.\\" It's been said that a generation of young people survived teenage angst with a pair of headphones and a Zeppelin album, and a generation of parents wondered what all that noise was about. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But even now, 32 years after John Bonham's passing&mdash;and we all I think appreciate the fact that the Zeppelin legacy lives on. The last time the band performed together in 2007&mdash;perhaps the last time ever, but we don't know&mdash;more than 20 million fans from around the world applied for tickets. And what they saw was vintage Zeppelin. No frills, no theatrics, just a few guys who can still make the ladies weak at the knees, and huddled together, following the music. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Of course, these guys also redefined the rock-and-roll lifestyle. We do not have video of this. [<i>Laughter</i>] But there was some hotel rooms trashed and mayhem all around. So it's fitting that we're doing this in a room with windows that are about 3 inches thick&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and Secret Service all around. [<i>Laughter</i>] So, guys, just settle down. [<i>Laughter</i>] These paintings are valuable. [<i>Laughter</i>] They look very calm now, though, don't they? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>The&mdash;it is a tribute to you guys. And tonight we honor Led Zeppelin for making us all feel young and for showing us that some guys who are not completely youthful can still rock. <p>So we've got Buddy Guy. We've got Dustin Hoffman. We've got David Letterman, Natalia Makarova, Led Zeppelin. Each&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. There you go. Each of us can remember a moment when the people on this stage touched our lives. Maybe they didn't lead us to become performers ourselves. But maybe they inspired us to see things in a new way, to hear things differently, to discover something within us or to appreciate how much beauty there is in the world. <p>It's that unique power that makes the arts so important. We may not always think about the importance of music or dance or laughter to the life of this Nation, but who would want to imagine America without it? And that's why we celebrate artists like the ones here tonight. And that's why, in this season of joy and thanksgiving, they have earned our deepest appreciation. <p>So congratulations again to tonight's honorees. Thank you all very much. And I look forward to a spectacular evening. Thank you.\" "
"234" "\"Thank you so much. Everybody, please have a seat. Thank you. <p>Well, good afternoon everybody. It is wonderful to be back. Secretary Panetta, thank you for the introduction. Last week at the White House, we had our first Cabinet meeting since the election, and it was a chance for me to thank my entire team for their service; for keeping our country safe and strong these past 4 years. And, Leon, few have done more than you in that regard. And that includes taking care of our remarkable men and women in uniform and their families and keeping our military the absolute best in the world, bar none. So thank you, Leon, for being such an outstanding Secretary of Defense. We're very grateful. <p>Now, I am not here to give a big speech. I wanted to just come by and join you in marking the 20th anniversary of one of the country's smartest and most successful national security programs: Nunn-Lugar. And I want to express my gratitude to all of you: from government, academia, NGOs, and our partners from around the world. People in this room conceived it. You built it. You've sustained it. And of course, I especially want to acknowledge a leader who helped create it and who now helps guide it as our outstanding Deputy Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter. So thank you, Ash, for your great work. <p>Of course, no one has done more than the two visionaries on this stage. Now, you have to think about what real visionaries do. They look at the world, and they see what's missing. So they set out to fill the gap, to build something new. And that's what Sam Nunn and Dick Lugar did many years ago. They challenged us to think anew, to imagine, after decades of confrontation, how our nations might engage in cooperation. Early in the cold war, Einstein warned of the danger of our wisdom not keeping pace with our technology. And with Nunn-Lugar, our wisdom began to catch up. <p>I also wanted to be here because of my own personal debt to these two leaders. When I was in&mdash;when I was elected to the Senate, Sam Nunn was one of the first leaders I called. Obviously, he had an extraordinary reputation for his work on a whole range of issues in the Senate. And, Sam, by the way, I should&mdash;I always meant to say thanks for taking my call. [<i>Laughter</i>] So we do small talk; he congratulates me on being elected. And then he says, I've got two pieces of advice for you. First piece of advice: Get a seat on the Foreign Relations Committee. I did that. Second piece of advice: Learn from Dick Lugar. [<i>Laughter</i>] I did that too. So I took Sam advice&mdash;Sam's advice then. And as President, I continue to value his advice and his counsel. <p>Sam, as one of the so-called Four Horsemen&mdash;which, I have to say, is a pretty ominous nickname&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;has spoken out for a world without nuclear weapons. And with your Nuclear Threat Initiative, you helped us ratify the new START treaty, rally the world to secure nuclear materials, strengthen the global nonproliferation regime, and create an international fuel bank for peaceful nuclear power. Sam, that's an extraordinary legacy and an extraordinary record. Thank you for your partnership and your leadership. <p>And because I took Sam's advice, I came to know and admire Dick Lugar. I was a new, junior Senator. But nevertheless, he was willing to take me in and served in many cases, particularly on the issues that we're celebrating here today, took me in as a pupil for him. I watched, and I learned. And when we worked together to pass a law to speed up the lockdown of nuclear materials, obviously, it was called Lugar-Obama, in that order. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And, Dick, I want to take this opportunity to say something else. At times, we've disagreed on matters of policy. But one thing we've always shared is a notion of what public service should be. That it ought to be more than just doing what's popular in the moment. That it ought to be about what's right for our Nation, over the long term. It ought to be about problem-solving and governance, not just how we can score political points on each other or engage in obstructionism. And where compromise is not a vice and where bipartisanship is actually considered a virtue, to be rewarded and not punished. <p>That's the essence of these two gentlemen, and that's the essence of Nunn-Lugar. That's the spirit that's defined Dick's public service for nearly 50 years. And that's the bipartisan tradition that we need more of here in Washington, especially on foreign policy. So, Dick, as you prepare to leave the Senate that you love, I think I speak on behalf of everybody here and millions of people across the country to say that your legacy will endure in a safer and more secure world and a safer and more secure America. And we pray that this Nation produces more leaders with your sense of decency and civility and integrity. We are grateful to you. Thank you very much. <p>Now, I will point out, it was Dick who took me on my first foreign trip as a Senator: to Russia and Ukraine and Azerbaijan. We were there to see the Cooperative Threat Reduction program in action. And the first thing I learned is that when Dick Lugar travels overseas, it's not a junket. We didn't stop and look at a lot of beautiful sights&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and, sort of, lounge around on some shopping excursions. He wore out every 25-year-old staffer that was part of this delegation. <p>What you also learn is that Dick Lugar&mdash;the more remote the place is and the more obscure the facility is, the bigger a rock star Dick Lugar is. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, they love him in these places. <p>I remember walking through one facility. I started leaning in for a closer look, and one of the workers said, \\"Don't touch that orange stuff.\\" It turned out to be TNT. [<i>Laughter</i>] At another point, the workers were taking apart munitions&mdash;gloves on their hands, masks over their faces&mdash;and I'm thinking, wait a second, why don't we have masks on? [<i>Laughter</i>] This is the kind of trip you take with Dick Lugar. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We're traipsing through nuclear weapon storage sites and junkyards full of old landmines and technicians showing off test tubes where you ask, well, what's that? Well, that's anthrax, that's plague. [<i>Laughter</i>] Shouldn't this&mdash;shouldn't you keep it in something a little more sturdy than this? [<i>Laughter</i>] Dick Lugar is standing in the back of the room. [<i>Laughter</i>] I remember I asked him, \\"Dick, have you seen it?\\" He says: \\"Yes, yes, I've seen it. I don't get too close now.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] That's what it's like traveling with Dick Lugar. <p>And I had been a strong advocate for CTR before. But visiting those facilities, seeing the work that so many of you do, seeing these old weapons once aimed at us now being turned into scrap truly brought home how important this work was. This is one of our most important national security programs. And it's a perfect example of the kind of partnerships that we need, working together to meet challenges that no nation can address on its own. <p>And so Nunn-Lugar is the foundation for the vision that I laid out, once I was elected President, and traveled to Prague: where nations come together to secure nuclear materials, as we're doing with our nuclear security summits; where we build on new START and continue to work to reduce our arsenals; where we strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and prevent the spread of the world's most deadly weapons; where, over time, we come closer to our ultimate vision: a world without nuclear weapons. <p>That's why we haven't just sustained programs like Nunn-Lugar over the past 4 years. We've worked with all of you to strengthen it, expanding it to some 80 nations, far beyond the old Soviet Union; moving ahead with the destruction of chemical weapons; partnering with others&mdash;countries from Africa to Asia and global health organizations&mdash;to prevent the spread of deadly diseases and bioterrorism. And I have to give a shout-out to somebody who was on the original team with Ash that conceived of CTR; she's been working it ever since and now leads our efforts at the White House. Laura Holgate is here. And so we're very proud of her for the outstanding work that she's doing. <p>And we've worked to keep weapons from spreading, whether it was nuclear material in Libya or, now, chemical weapons in Syria. And on Syria, let me just say this: We will continue to support the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people, engaging with the opposition, providing with&mdash;providing them with the humanitarian aid, and working for a transition to a Syria that's free of the Asad regime. <p>And today I want to make it absolutely clear to Asad and those under his command: The world is watching. The use of chemical weapons is and would be totally unacceptable. And if you make the tragic mistake of using these weapons, there will be consequences, and you will be held accountable. <p>We simply cannot allow the 21st century to be darkened by the worst weapons of the 20th century. And that's why, over the past 4 years, we've continued to make critical investments in our threat reduction programs, not just at DOD, but at Energy and at State. In fact, we've been increasing funding, and sustaining it. And even as we make some very tough fiscal choices, we're going to keep investing in these programs, because our national security depends on it. <p>After all, even with all your success&mdash;the thousands of missiles destroyed, bombers and submarines eliminated, the warheads that have been deactivated&mdash;we're nowhere near done. Not by a long shot. And you all know this. There's still much too much material&mdash;nuclear, chemical, biological&mdash;being stored without enough protection. There are still terrorists and criminal gangs doing everything they can to get their hands on it. <p>And make no mistake, if they get it, they will use it, potentially killing hundreds of thousands of innocent people, perhaps triggering a global crisis. That's why I continue to believe that nuclear terrorism remains one of the greatest threats to global security. That's why working to prevent nuclear terrorism is going to remain one of my top national security priorities as long as I have the privilege of being President of the United States. <p>So I came here in part to say we cannot let our guard down. This needs to be a sustained effort across all your organizations, across our Government. We have to keep investing in our people and in new technologies. We have to sustain the partnerships we have, and that includes Russia. <p>We're joined by some of our Russian friends here today. Russia has said that our current agreement hasn't kept pace with the changing relationship between our countries. To which we say, let's update it. Let's work with Russia as an equal partner. Let's continue the work that's so important to the security of both our countries. And I'm optimistic that we can. <p>And we have to keep creating new partnerships. We have to make sure&mdash;to paraphrase Einstein&mdash;that our wisdom stays ahead of our technology. And I know you're committed to this. And I want you to know that I am too. <p>So let me leave you with a story of that first trip Dick and I took together. You may remember this, Dick. I was in Ukraine. We went to a facility, an old factory. We walked down these long, dark corridors. We're ducking our heads, stepping over puddles of something&mdash;we're not sure what it was. [<i>Laughter</i>] Finally, we came across some women, sitting at a worktable. On it were piles of old artillery shells. And the women were sitting there, taking them apart. By hand. Slowly. [<i>Laughter</i>] Carefully. [<i>Laughter</i>] One by one. <p>It took decades&mdash;and extraordinary sums of money&mdash;to build those arsenals. It's going to take decades&mdash;and continued investments&mdash;to dismantle them. The two of you know this better than anybody. It's painstaking work. It rarely makes headlines. But I want each of you to know, and everybody who's participating in this important effort to know, that the work you do is absolutely vital to our national security and to our global security. <p>Missile by missile, warhead by warhead, shell by shell, we're putting a bygone era behind us. Inspired by Sam Nunn and Dick Lugar, we're moving closer to the future that we seek: a future where these weapons never threaten our children again; a future where we know the security and peace of a world without nuclear weapons. I could not be prouder of these gentlemen. I'm proud to call them friends. And I'm looking forward to continuing to work with them and all of you in the years to come. <p>Thank you very much.\" "
"235" "\"<i>The President.</i> Well, good morning, everybody. It is great to see all of you. Many of you I've had a chance to see individually or in small groups over the last several months, but it's good to be back at the Business Roundtable. Jim, thanks for your leadership. <p>Originally, my team had prepared some remarks. They always get nervous when I'm out there on my own&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;never know what I might say. Given the dialogue that we had the last time, I thought it was useful for me to abbreviate my remarks, speak off the cuff at the top, and then spend most of our time just having a conversation. <p>Let me begin by saying that all of you in this room are not just business leaders, not just CEOs of your companies, but you're also economic leaders and thought leaders in this country. And I recognize that all of you have an enormous investment not only in your own companies, but in the well-being of America. <p>There are a lot of patriots in this room, people who care deeply about not only your bottom lines, but also the future of this country. You've shown that over the last 4 years. We've gone through as difficult an economic period as we've seen in most of our lifetimes, and we've emerged not yet where we need to be, but we've certainly made progress. And the reason we've made progress in part has been because of the outstanding management and productivity gains and efficiencies and competitiveness that you've been able to achieve in each and every one of your companies. <p>And I've said this to some of the small groups, let me repeat it to the large group: I am passionately rooting for your success, because if the companies in this room are doing well, then small businesses and medium-sized businesses up and down the chain are doing well. If companies in this room are doing well, then folks get jobs, consumers get confidence, and we're going to be able to compete around the world. <p>Now, the good news is that despite the extraordinary challenges that we've seen over the last 4 years, there is progress in some key sectors of our economy. We've seen housing finally begin to bounce back for the first time. And that obviously has a enormous ripple effect throughout the economy. Consumer confidence is as high as it's been. Many of you, over the last 2, 3 years, have experienced record profits or near-record profits and have a lot of money where you're prepared to invest in plants and equipment and hire folks. <p>Obviously, globally, the economy is still soft. Europe is going to be in the doldrums for quite some time. Asia is not charging forward, and some of the emerging markets are not charging forward as quickly as they were maybe a few years ago. <p>But I think what all of you recognize and many of you have told me is, is that everybody is looking to America because they understand that if we're able to put forward a long-term agenda for growth and prosperity that's broad-based here in the United States, that confidence will not just increase here in the United States, it will increase globally, and we can get the kind of virtuous cycle that I think all of us have been waiting for and want to see. <p>What's holding us back right now, ironically, is a lot of stuff that's going on in this town. And I know that many of you have come down here to try to see is there a way that we can break through the logjam and go ahead and get things done. And I'm here to tell you that nobody wants to get this done more than me. I know that you've gotten a lot of briefings, but let me just try to describe where the situation is right now with respect to our fiscal situation, both what the opportunities are, but what also the challenges are. <p>I campaigned over the last year on the idea that we need to make sure that this economy is growing and that we're providing ladders of opportunity for folks&mdash;&mdash; <p>[<i>At this point, the microphone lost power.</i>] <p>I can speak pretty loud. Can people hear me in the back? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes. <p><i>The President.</i> You're all good? All right. Let me just continue, because I don't want to take up too much time. <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>]&mdash;hand-held mike. <p><i>The President.</i> The hand-held's working? <p>[<i>At this point, the President was handed a microphone.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> All right. <p>During the entire campaign, I talked about the importance of short-term measures to boost growth, but also a long-term plan to make sure that we've got our fiscal house in order, and I called for a balanced and responsible plan. My budget reflects a balanced, responsible plan, and I've shown myself willing to make some tough decisions when it comes to Government spending, because despite, I think, my reputation or the reputation of Democrats, I don't think every Government program works exactly the way it should. I think there are efficiencies that can be gained. There are some programs that used to work and just don't work now the way they were intended. And as a consequence, working with Democrats and Republicans last year, we were able to cut over a trillion dollars of spending&mdash;the largest cut, by the way, in discretionary spending in history. So we're prepared to make some tough decisions when it comes to spending cuts. <p>But if you look at what's needed in order for us to stabilize our budget, stabilize our deficit-to-GDP ratio, our debt-to-GDP ratio, then every credible economist will tell you that you can't just do it on spending cuts, we can't cut our way to prosperity, that there's got to be a balanced approach in which we also are bringing in new revenues, partly because our revenue levels are as low as they've been in most of our lifetimes. <p>And what I've proposed, what I put forward during the campaign and what, I think, a majority of the American people agreed with&mdash;in fact, there's some folks who didn't vote for me, but focus groups and polls show nevertheless they agreed with my concept when it comes to deficit reduction&mdash;is that an approach that says we're going to raise additional revenue, particularly from those who have done best in the economy over the last decade, combined with some smart cuts and with entitlement reform that can strengthen our social safety net over the long term but do so in a responsible way, that's the way to go forward. And that's what we've put forward. <p>Now, the question, I think, on the minds of a lot of you is, how do you get there? Because I know that, speaking to many of you privately, you agree with this approach. I've been struck by the number of CEOs who said, we're willing to pay slightly higher taxes if it means that we've got the kind of certainty and stability over the long term that allows us to invest and hire with confidence. So most of the folks in this room, I think, are onboard for a balanced plan. <p>The problem that we've had up until fairly recently&mdash;and this was extensively debated during the campaign&mdash;was the belief that either, A, we could balance our budgets entirely on spending cuts, or a variation that has emerged is, is that we can do so while still lowering rates simply by closing loopholes and deductions. And you've heard from my team, but let me just repeat: We don't have any objection to tax reform, tax simplification, closing loopholes, closing deductions. But there is a bottom-line amount of revenue that is required in order for us to get a real, meaningful deficit reduction plan that hits the numbers that are required for us to stabilize our debt and deficits. And all the math that we've done&mdash;and we analyzed this stuff pretty carefully&mdash;shows that it is not possible for us to raise the amount of revenue that's required for a balanced package if all you are relying on is closing deductions and loopholes. <p>Let me amend that. It is possible to do, theoretically; it is not possible or wise to do as a practical matter. And the reason is, is that in order for us to raise the amount of revenue that's needed just by closing deductions and loopholes for high earners, we'd have to, for example, eliminate or severely cap the charitable deduction. And folks in this room, you guys are not only CEOs; I can't imagine there's a person here who doesn't sit on a number of non-for-profit boards, university boards, hospital boards. In your respective communities, you are supporting an entire infrastructure that is the glue that holds our communities together. So the notion that somehow we're going to just eliminate charitable deductions is unlikely. <p>What that means is, is that any formula that says we can't increase tax rates probably only yields about $300 to $400 billion, realistically. And that's well short of the amount of revenue that's needed for a balanced package. <p>So what we've said instead is, let's allow higher rates to go up for the top 2 percent&mdash;that includes all of you, yes, but not in any way that's going to affect your spending, your lifestyles, or the economy in any significant way. Let's make sure that 98 percent of Americans don't see a single dime in tax increases next year, 97 percent of small businesses don't see a single dime in tax increases next year. And by doing that alone, we raise almost a trillion dollars without any adverse effects on the economy. <p>Let's combine that, then, with some additional spending cuts and some long-term entitlement reform that can get us to a number close to $4 trillion, which stabilizes our debt and our deficits relative to GDP for at least a decade, perhaps more. <p>That's our plan. That's what we've presented. The holdup right now is that Speaker Boehner took a position I think the day after the campaign that said, we're willing to bring in revenue, but we're not willing to increase rates. And I've just explained to you why we don't think that works. We're not trying to&mdash;we're not insisting on rates just out of spite or out of any kind of partisan bickering, but rather because we need to raise a certain amount of revenue. <p>Now, we've seen some movement over the last several days among some Republicans. I think there's a recognition that maybe they can accept some rate increases as long as it's combined with serious entitlement reform and additional spending cuts. And if we can get the leadership on the Republican side to take that framework, to acknowledge that reality, then the numbers actually aren't that far apart. Another way of putting this is, we can probably solve this in about a week; it's not that tough. But we need that conceptual breakthrough that says, we need to do a balanced plan, that's what's best for the economy, that's what the American people voted for, that's how we're going to get it done. <p>Let me make one last point, and then I'll start taking questions. There had been reports&mdash;and these are not necessarily confirmed, and maybe some of you have more insight than I do on this&mdash;that perhaps the Republicans go ahead and let the middle class tax cuts get extended, the upper income tax cuts go up, otherwise we don't get a deal, and next year, we come back, and the thinking is Republicans will have more leverage because there will be another vote on the debt ceiling, and we will try to extract more concessions with a stronger hand on the debt ceiling. <p>I have to just tell you, that is a bad strategy for America, it is a bad strategy for your businesses, and it is not a game that I will play. <p>Most of you were involved in discussions and watched the catastrophe that happened in August of 2011. Everybody here is concerned about uncertainty. There's no uncertainty like the prospect that the United States of America, the largest economy that holds the world's reserve currency, potentially defaults on its debts, that we give up the basic notion that the United States stands behind its obligations. <p>And we can't afford to go there again. And this isn't just my opinion; it's the opinion of most of the folks in this room. So when I hear some on the other side suggesting that to resolve the possibility of a perpetual or a quarterly debt ceiling crisis that there is a price to pay, well, the price is paid by the American people and your businesses and the economic environment worldwide. And we should not accept going through that. <p>John Engler, who is, I think&mdash;he and I philosophically don't agree on much&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;no, I'm just being honest about John, and he's a great politician and&mdash;but he originally comes from the other party. But John is exactly right when he says that the only thing that the debt ceiling is good for as a weapon is just to destroy your credit rating. <p>So I want to send a very clear message to people here: We are not going to play that game next year. If Congress in any way suggests that they're going to tie negotiations to debt ceiling votes and take us to the brink of default once again as part of a budget negotiation&mdash;which, by the way, we have never done in our history until we did it last year&mdash;I will not play that game. Because we've got to break that habit before it starts. <p>So, with that, let me just say we've got one path where we resolve this fairly quickly. We've got some tough spending cuts, we reform our entitlements, we have modest revenue increases. You get business certainty, you do what you do best: innovate, invest, hire workers, make profits, do well by your shareholders, and grow America. And we then have open running room next year to deal with a whole host of other issues like infrastructure and tax reform and immigration reform that will further make America, Inc., competitive. That's one option. <p>The other option is to engage in a self-inflicted series of wounds that will potentially push us back into recession and set back this country, after all the work that we've done over the last 4 years digging ourselves out of a hole. <p>I know the choice I'd like to make. And I think the BRT can be helpful in making sure that everybody here in Washington makes the right choice. <p>All right? So let me&mdash;with that, let me take some questions.\" "
"236" "\"It's good to be back. Thank you, everybody. Thank you so much. Everybody, please, please have a seat. <p>Thank you, Brian, for that wonderful introduction. Thanks to all the Members of Congress and members of my administration who are here. And I want to give a special shout-out to Senator Danny Akaka, who's been such a tireless advocate for Native Americans throughout his career. You know that Danny is going to be retiring this year, and he's such a great friend. And as a Hawaiian boy, I've got to give him a little special props. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I want to thank all the tribal leaders who took the time and the effort to come and take part in this conference.<B> <p></B>Every year, I look forward to this event. It's especially wonderful to see so many friends that I've gotten to know from various nations all across the country. You guys inspire me every single day, and whenever I've traveled to your home States, there's been such a warm welcome that I've received. So I'm truly grateful to all of you. <p>Today I want to begin by remembering somebody we lost last week. To the Crow Nation he was a revered elder, to many Native Americans, he was a respected healer; and I knew him warmly, for a few years at least, as an adoptive father. Sonny Black Eagle adopted me into the Crow Nation during my 2008 campaign. And yesterday he would have been 79 years old. And while we can't celebrate that milestone with him today, we can celebrate his remarkable life and all that happened along the way, because Sonny's story is not just one man's journey to keep his culture alive, but one country's journey to keep perfecting itself. <p>So Sonny Black Eagle was born in 1933 just outside of Lodge Grass, Montana. That's where his grandparents raised him after his mother died of tuberculosis, where he tended to cattle as a child, and where as an adult, he raised a family of his own. And Sonny was brought up in the traditional Crow ways, with the same values that many of you share: a reverence for the Earth, to cherish the Earth and to cherish each other, to honor ancestors and preserve traditions. <p>Staying true to those values wasn't always easy. As a child, if Sonny spoke Crow in school, his teachers would strike his hand with a ruler. As a teenager, when he went to eat at local restaurants, he was sometimes met with a sign on the door that said, \\"No Indians or dogs allowed.\\" In the 1950s, as Sonny and his wife Mary began a new life together, the Government put in place a new policy of forced assimilation, a move that harkened back to the days when Native religions and languages were banned. The policy was called \\"termination\\" for a reason; it was meant to end tribal governments in America once and for all. <p>So Sonny, like many of you, knew intolerance and knew injustice. He knew what it was like to be persecuted for who you are and what you believe. But as time went by, year by year, decade by decade, as Native Americans rallied together and marched together, as students descended on Alcatraz and activists held their ground at Frank's Landing, as respect and appreciation for your unique heritage grew and a seminal struggle played itself out, Sonny lived to see something else; he saw a new beginning. <p>He lived to see a Government that turned the page on a troubled past and adopted a new policy towards Native Americans, a policy centered on self-determination and the right for tribal governments to do whatever you think is best to strengthen your communities. <p>Over the past 40 years, that policy has had a major impact. It's empowered you to build up stronger institutions. It's enabled you to establish more effective law and order. It's laid the foundation for a true and lasting government-to-government relationship with the United States. <p>And over those decades, as Sonny went from being a father to a great-great-grandfather; and as he taught his family the Crow language and his community the Crow customs, as he became a living symbol of the perseverance of the entire Crow Nation, Sonny stayed true to those fundamental values&mdash;to cherish the Earth and each other, to honor ancestors, and preserve traditions. <p>And these are not just Sonny's values. In fact, they're not just values cherished by Native Americans, these should be and are American values. And they lie at the heart of some of our country's greatest challenges: to rebuild a middle class, to build ladders of opportunity for everybody who's working hard, to protect our planet, to leave our children something better than we inherited, to make sure Americans remain optimistic about the future and that this country of ours remains the place where no matter who you are or what you look like or where you come from or what your last name is, you can make it here, if you try. <p>Now, these are the challenges that we can only solve together, and that's been our approach to the unique challenges facing Indian Country. <p>Now, 3 years ago, I was proud to see that this conference was the largest gathering of tribal leaders in our history. And back then, an event like this was rare. Today, it's gotten routine. [<i>Laughter</i>] What I told you then is that I was committed to more than a unique nation-to-nation relationship. I was committed to getting this relationship right so that your nations can be full partners in our economy and your children can have a fair shot at pursuing the American Dream and that no one has to live under the cloud of fear or injustice. <p>And to make sure that we follow through on those commitments&mdash;&mdash; <p>[<i>At this point, the President sneezed</i>.] <p>Excuse me. I've named Native Americans to my White House staff like Jodi Gillette and Charlie Galbraith, who many of you know. I've named Native Americans throughout my administration. And today, because we've made sure that the conversations here have translated into action, we can point to signs of real progress. <p>We've focused on justice and tribal sovereignty. Longstanding legal disputes like the <i>Cobell</i> case have been resolved. I signed into law the Tribal Law and Order Act, which is helping to fight crime. These are all important steps, but we've got more to do. With domestic violence so prevalent on reservations, we're pushing Congress to restore your power to bring to justice anyone&mdash;Indian or non-Indian&mdash;who hurts a woman. With some tribal nations unable to put their land into Federal trust, we're pushing Congress to pass the Carcieri fix right away. <p>The other focus that a lot of you have spoken to me about and that we're now really trying to drill down on is expanding economic opportunity for Native Americans. Now, together, we've stepped up support for Tribal Colleges and Universities, so that more young people can graduate with the skills they need to start a career. We've strengthened tribal health care and made it more accessible. And along with the HEARTH Act, we've streamlined leasing regulations, putting more power in your hands to build more homes and more small businesses, more clean energy projects, like the Moapa solar project in Nevada. <p>But we've got more work to do. We've got to rebuild America's infrastructure&mdash;from roads to high-speed Internet&mdash;that will help connect Native communities to other parts of the country and other parts of the world. Congress needs to expand support for Native American small businesses, because when they're opening new stores or exporting new goods, then they're creating new jobs. <p>So that's where we need to go. That's the future we need to build. And I've never been more hopeful about our chances. Part of that hopefulness is because I've gotten to know so many of you and I know the skills and the talent and the dedication and the values and the wisdom that you all represent. And I'm hopeful not just because of the work all of you are doing, not just because of the solemn commitment of tribal leaders all across this country, I'm also hopeful because of the rising generation who I've seen embrace the responsibility of following in your footsteps. <p>I'm hopeful because of young folks like Nick Tilsen. I just had a chance to talk to Nick, a Lakota Indian who lives on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, which is one of the poorest parts of the country. And unemployment there is rampant. High rates of disease and violence are often forcing folks to downsize their dreams. But there's a more promising statistic in Pine Ridge. More than half of Pine Ridge's population is under 30 years old. And many of those young people, like Nick, are giving all they have to help turn things around. <p>So Nick heads up a nonprofit in Pine Ridge. A few years ago, with the support of some grants and other members of his tribe, Nick built a community center that uses spiritual and cultural teachings to help young people stay off drugs and their parents live healthier lifestyles. And it's making a difference. So today, he's building something bigger: a clean energy community that will provide affordable housing for folks who need it and help more Lakota small businesses get off the ground. <p>Day by day, family by family, community by community, Nick and his nonprofit have helped inspire a new beginning for Pine Ridge. In fact, just a few months ago, young and old came together to adopt a long-term plan that commits to bringing back jobs and development, bringing back native languages and customs, bringing back the spiritual strength that for so long has defined the Lakota people. And Nick says, \\"We've decided as a community to take ownership of our own future.\\" <p>See, that makes me hopeful, talking to young people like that, because throughout Indian Country, you've got a generation ready to build on what generations before them have built. They're out there stirring with hope and restless for change and ready to take ownership of their future. <p>So let's make sure our work here is worthy of their efforts. Let's do everything we can to get things in the best shape possible for when they're in charge. <p>And over the next 4 years, as long as I have the privilege of serving as your President, we're going to keep working together to make sure that the promise of America is fully realized for every Native American. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"237" "\"<i>The President.</i> Merry Christmas, everybody! Michelle told me to be brief because she wants to hear music. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Thank you, Secretary Salazar, for that generous introduction and for your dedication to protecting our natural resources. I want to thank Neil Mulholland and the whole National Park Foundation and the National Park Service team for helping to put on this beautiful production. <p>Let's give a big hand to Neil Patrick Harris and this evening's performers for putting on a fantastic show. And I want to also thank all of you for joining us to celebrate this great American tradition. <p>As has been mentioned, we've been lighting the National Christmas Tree for 90 years now. In times of war and peace, triumph and tragedy, we've always come together to rejoice in the Christmas miracle. But our tree has been having a hard time recently; this is our third one in as many years. Our longstanding tree was lost in a storm, and then its replacement didn't take hold. It just goes to show, nobody's job is safe here in Washington. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I feel good about this one. It was planted just days before Hurricane Sandy, and it made it through the storm in one piece. <p>Now, we know that some of our neighbors to the north saw a more ruthless and destructive Sandy. And this holiday season is especially difficult for families who lost everything in the storm. But it's also a time for us to be grateful for the heroism and perseverance of ordinary men and women in the storm's path who have showed us that Americans will always be stronger than the challenges that we face. And as I did before Thanksgiving, I can't help but tell a story of their enduring holiday spirit. <p>This evening in Midland Beach, New York, on a street lined with houses and businesses devastated by the storm, a great big Christmas tree shines out of the darkness. Just a couple of weeks ago, as impacted families were still seeking some sense of getting back to normal, one local nursery donated the tree, another chipped in for the lights and a star, and 70-year-old Tom Killeen and his longtime buddies from the area planted it at the end of the street, overlooking the town beach. As Tom says, the tree has one message: \\"It's Christmas time, not disaster time.\\" <p>And Tom's right. For centuries, the message of Christmas, of peace and goodwill to all, has guided millions of people around the world through good times, but also through bad times. This year is no different. It's a chance for all of us to open our hearts to the least fortunate among us. It's a chance to remember what Christ taught us: that it is truly more blessed to give than to receive and that the simplest gifts bring the greatest joy. And it's a chance to count our blessings and give thanks to those outstanding servicemembers who bravely defend them. <p>For Americans of all backgrounds and beliefs, may this holiday season remind us of the spirit of brotherhood and generosity that unites us as citizens. And may every tree from Midland Beach to this Ellipse and all across the country shine as a beacon of hope for all Americans. <p>So on behalf of Michelle, Malia, Sasha, Grandma, and Bo, I'd like to wish each and every one of you a very merry Christmas and a peaceful and joyful holiday season. <p>God bless you, and God bless America. <p>[<i>At this point, the choir sang Christmas carols</i>.] <p><i>The President.</i> Well, everybody, I just want to say, can we give a huge round of applause to these outstanding performers? To our outstanding choir. <p>Neil, are we going out with a song? <p><i>Actor Neil Patrick Harris</i>. Sure, let's sing one. You start it. <p><i>The President.</i> No, no, no&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I just wasn't sure. I know this program is taped so we can always edit this out. [<i>Laughter</i>] Was there something else that we were supposed to be singing? \\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\\"&mdash;that's what I thought. Let's hit it! <p><i>Mr. Harris.</i> It's a dandy tune. <p><i>The President. </i>Let's hit it!<B> <p></B>[<i>The music for \\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\\" began to play, and a Santa Claus character walked onto stage.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Oh! Here he is! <p><i>Mr. Harris. </i>It's Santa. <p><i>The President</i>. Santa! <p>[<i>\\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\\" was sung.</i>] <p><i>The President</i>. Merry Christmas, everybody.\" "
"238" "\"Well, I want to, first of all, just thank Tiffany and Richard, Jimmie and Velma for opening up their beautiful home to us. The reason that we're here is because Tiffany is one of the people who responded to \\"My2K.\\" <p>As many of you know, we asked folks all across the country to talk a little bit about what would it mean if their income taxes went up in 2013, and Tiffany, who is a high school teacher, responded. Her husband, Richard, works at a Toyota dealership. They actually live with Tiffany's parents, both of whom are still working. And so what Tiffany pointed out was that an increase of $2,000 or so for her and her husband in this household would actually mean $4,000 that was lost. And a couple of thousand dollars means a couple months' rent for this family. <p>And the story they tell about working hard, my understanding is they're interested in starting a business as well as the work that they currently do. They've got dreams and ambitions. They've got a beautiful 6-year-old son, Noah, who's back with great-grandma. And they're keeping it together, they're working hard, they're meeting their responsibilities. <p>For them to be burdened unnecessarily because Democrats and Republicans aren't coming together to solve this problem gives you a sense of the costs involved in very personal terms. Obviously, it would also have an impact on our economy, because if this family has a couple of thousand dollars less to spend, that translates into $200 billion of less consumer spending next year. And that's bad for businesses large and small. It's bad for our economy. It means less folks are being hired, and we can be back in a downward spiral instead of the kind of virtuous cycle that we want to see. <p>So the message that I got from Tiffany and the message that, I think, we all want to send to members of Congress is this is a solvable problem. The Senate has already passed a bill that would make sure that middle class taxes do not go up next year by a single dime. Ninety-eight percent of Americans whose incomes are $250,000 a year or less would not see any increases. Ninety-seven percent of small businesses would not see any increases in their income taxes. And even folks who make more than $250,000 would still have a tax break for their incomes up to $250,000. So 100 percent of Americans actually would be keeping a portion of their tax cuts, and 98 percent of them would not be seeing any increase in their income tax. <p>That's the right thing to do for our economy. It's the right thing to do for families like Tiffany's and Richard's. And it's very important that we get this done now, that we don't wait. We're in the midst of the Christmas season; I think the American people are counting on this getting solved. The closer it gets to the brink, the more stressed they're going to be. Businesses are making decisions right now about investment and hiring, and if they don't have confidence that we can get this thing done, then they're going to start pulling back and we could have a rocky time in our economy over the next several months or even next year. <p>So I'm encouraged to see that there's been some discussion on the part of Republicans acknowledging the need for additional revenue. As I've indicated, the only way to get the kind of revenue for a balanced deficit reduction plan is to make sure that we're also modestly increasing rates for people who can afford it, folks like me. For folks who are in the top 2 percent, we can afford to have a modest rate increase. That allows us to not only reduce our deficit in a balanced, responsible way, it also allows us to make investments in education, in making college affordable, in putting folks back to work, and investing in basic research that's important for our economy. <p>And I think we all recognize that there are some smart cuts we've got to make in Government. We're going to have to strengthen our entitlement programs so that they're there for future generations. Everybody is going to have to share in some sacrifice, but it starts with folks who are in the best position to sacrifice, who are in the best position to do a little bit more to step up. And that's what my plan does. <p>So just to be clear, I'm not going to sign any package that somehow prevents the top rate from going up for folks at the top 2 percent. But I do remain optimistic that we can get something done that is good for families like this one's and that is good for the American economy. <p>All right. Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"239" "\"Hello, everybody. Over the last few weeks, there's been a lot of talk about deadlines we're facing on jobs and taxes and investments. But with so much noise and so many opinions flying around, it can be easy to lose sight of what this debate is really about. It's not about which political party comes out on top or who wins or loses in Washington, it's about making smart decisions that will have a real impact on your lives and the lives of Americans all across the country. <p>Right now middle class tax cuts are set to expire at the end of the year. Time's running out. And there are two things that can happen. <p>First, if Congress does nothing, every family in America will see their income taxes automatically go up on January 1. A typical middle class family of four would get a $2,200 tax hike. That would be bad for families, it would be bad for businesses, and it would drag down our entire economy. <p>Now, Congress can avoid all this by passing a law that prevents a tax hike on the first $250,000 of everybody's income. That means 98 percent of Americans and 97 percent of small businesses wouldn't see their income taxes go up by a single dime. Even the wealthiest Americans would get a tax cut on the first $250,000 of their income. And families everywhere would enjoy some peace of mind. <p>The Senate has already done their part. Now we're just waiting for Republicans in the House to do the same thing. But so far, they've put forward an unbalanced plan that actually lowers rates for the wealthiest Americans. If we want to protect the middle class, then the math just doesn't work. <p>We can and should do more than just extend middle class tax cuts. And I stand ready to work with Republicans on a plan that spurs economic growth, creates jobs, and reduces our deficit, a plan that gives both sides some of what they want. I'm willing to find ways to bring down the cost of health care without hurting seniors and other Americans who depend on it. And I'm willing to make more entitlement spending cuts on top of the $1 trillion dollars in spending cuts I signed into law last year. <p>But if we're serious about reducing our deficit while still investing in things like education and research that are important to growing our economy, and if we're serious about protecting middle class families, then we're also going to have to ask the wealthiest Americans to pay higher tax rates. That's one principle I won't compromise on. <p>After all, this was a central question in the election. A clear majority of Americans&mdash;Democrats, Republicans, and Independents&mdash;agreed with a balanced approach that asks something from everyone, but a little more from those who can afford it the most. It's the only way to put our economy on a sustainable path without asking even more from the middle class. And it's the only kind of plan I'm willing to sign. <p>Everyone agrees we need to bring down our deficit and strengthen our economy for the long term. The question is whether we can do it in a responsible way that allows us to keep investing in the things that have always made America strong. I'm convinced we can. And if both sides are willing to compromise, I believe we can give businesses and families a sense of security going into the new year. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"240" "\"<i>The President.</i> Well, good evening, everybody, and let's give it up for our host, the tallest elf I've ever seen: Conan O'Brien. [<i>Laughter</i>] We're also grateful to all the outstanding performers, the choirs, the glee clubs who are sharing their tremendous talents with us. <p>Tonight is a chance to get in the Christmas spirit; to spread some joy and sing along with artists who have much better voices than we do. [<i>Laughter</i>] But it's also a chance to make a real difference in the lives of some very brave young people being treated at Children's National Medical Center. Many of these kids and their parents are going through tough times right now, and your support helps give them a reason to hope, not just during the holidays, but all year round. <p>And that's really what Christmas is all about. Each of us is incredibly blessed in so many ways. But those blessings aren't just meant to be enjoyed, they're meant to be used and shared with those who have less. The Christian faith teaches us that on this day a child was born so that we might have eternal life. And at the heart of many of the world's great religions is the idea that we're all better off when we treat our brothers and sisters with the same love and compassion that we want for ourselves. <p>So yes, tonight is about Conan and Diana Ross and Santa and all the other talented folks on this stage. But it's also about the Americans who are spending this holiday in a hospital bed or a shelter or protecting our freedom on a battlefield far from home. Let's keep them in our prayers and follow Christ's calling to love one another as He has loved all of us. <p>Merry Christmas, everybody. God bless you, and God bless these United States of America.\" "
"241" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Redford! Oh, it is good to be back in Michigan. How is everybody doing today? <p>Now, let me just start off by saying we have something in common: Both our teams lost yesterday. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, I would like to come here and talk a little smack about the Bears, but we didn't quite get it done. But it is wonderful to be back. It is good to see everybody in the great State of Michigan. <p>A few people I want to acknowledge: First of all, the mayor of Detroit here, Dave Bing is in the house. We've got the Redford Supervisor Tracey Schultz Kobylarz. We've got some outstanding Members of Congress who are here; please give them a big round of applause. <p>I want to thank Martin for hosting us. I want to thank Jeff and Gibby for giving me a great tour of the factory. I've got to say: I love coming to factories. <p><i>Audience member.</i> I love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you. <p>So in addition to seeing the best workers in the world, you've also got all this cool equipment. [<i>Laughter</i>] I wanted to try out some of the equipment, but Secret Service wouldn't let me. [<i>Laughter</i>] They said, \\"You're going to drop something on your head, hurt yourself.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] They were worried I'd mess something up. And I&mdash;Jeff and Gibby may not admit it, but I think they were pretty happy the Secret Service wouldn't let me touch the equipment. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, it's been a little over a month since the election came to an end. So it's now safe for you to turn your televisions back on. [<i>Laughter</i>] All those scary political ads are off the air. You can answer your phone again; nobody is calling you in the middle of dinner asking for your support. But I have to&mdash;look, I have to admit there's one part of the campaign that I miss, and that is, it is a great excuse for me to get out of Washington and come to towns like this and talk to the people who work so hard every day and are looking out for their families and are in their communities and just having a conversation about what kind of country do we want to be, what kind of country do we want to leave behind for our kids. Because ultimately, that's what this is about. <p>And I believe&mdash;and I've been saying this not just for the last 6 months or the last year, but ever since I got into public office&mdash;I believe America only succeeds and thrives when we've got a strong and growing middle class. That's what I believe. I believe we're at our best when everybody who works hard has a chance to get ahead; that they can get a job that pays the bills; that they've got health care that they can count on; that they can retire with dignity and respect, maybe take a vacation once in a while&mdash;nothing fancy, just being able to pack up the kids and go someplace and enjoy time with people that you love; make sure that your kids can go to a good school; make sure they can aspire to whatever they want to be. <p>That idea is what built America. That's the idea that built Michigan. That's the idea that's at the heart of the economic plan I've been talking about all year long on the campaign trail. I want to give more Americans the chance to earn the skills that businesses are looking for right now and give our kids the kind of education they need to succeed in the 21st century. I want to make sure America leads the world in research and technology and clean energy. I want to put people back to work rebuilding our roads and our bridges and our schools. That's how we grow an economy. <p>I want us to bring down our deficits, but I want to do it in a balanced, responsible way. And I want to reward&mdash;I want a Tax Code that rewards&mdash;businesses and manufacturers like Detroit Diesel right here, creating jobs right here in Redford, right here in Michigan, right here in the United States of America. That's where we need to go. That's the country we need to build. And when it comes to bringing manufacturing back to America, that's why I'm here today. <p>Since 1938, Detroit Diesel has been turning out some of the best engines in the world. Over all those years, generations of Redford workers have walked through these doors. Not just to punch a clock. Not just to pick up a paycheck. Not just to build an engine. But to build a middle class life for their families, to earn a shot at the American Dream. <p>For seven-and-a-half decades, through good times and bad, through revolutions in technology that sent a lot of good jobs&mdash;manufacturing jobs&mdash;overseas, men and women like you, your parents, maybe even your grandparents, have done your part to build up America's manufacturing strength. That's something you can all be proud of. And now you're writing a new proud chapter to that history. Eight years ago, you started building axles here alongside the engines. That meant more work. That meant more jobs. So you started seeing products&mdash;more products stamped with those three proud words: Made in America. <p>Today, Daimler is announcing a new $120 million investment into this plant, creating 115 good, new, union jobs building transmissions and turbochargers right here in Redford. A hundred and fifteen good new jobs right here in this plant, making things happen. That is great for the plant. It's great for this community. But it's also good for American manufacturing. Soon, you guys will be building all the key parts that go into powering a heavy-duty truck, all at the same facility. Nobody else in America is doing that. Nobody else in North America is doing that. <p>And by putting everything together in one place, under one roof, Daimler engineers can design each part so it works better with the others. That means greater fuel efficiency for your trucks. It means greater savings for your customers. That's a big deal. And it's just the latest example of Daimler's leadership on this issue. <p>Last year, I was proud to have your support when we announced the first-ever national fuel efficiency standards for commercial trucks, which is going to help save consumers money and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. That's good news. <p>But here's the other reason why what you guys are doing&mdash;what Daimler is doing&mdash;is so important. For a long time, companies, they weren't always making those kinds of investments here in the United States. They weren't always investing in American workers. They certainly weren't willing to make them in the U.S. auto industry. <p>Remember, it was just a few years ago that our auto industry was on the verge of collapse. GM, Chrysler were all on the brink of failure. And if they failed, the suppliers and distributors that get their business from those companies, they would have died off too. Even Ford could have gone down. Production halted, factories shuttered, once proud companies chopped up and sold off for scraps. And all of you&mdash;the men and women who built these companies with your own hands &mdash;would have been hung out to dry. And everybody in this community that depends on you&mdash;restaurant owners, storekeepers, bartenders&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;their livelihoods would have been at stake too. <p>So I wasn't about to let that happen. I placed my bet on American workers. We bet on American ingenuity. I'd make that same bet any day of the week. Three-and-a-half years later, that bet is paying off. This industry has added over a quarter of a million new jobs. Assembly lines are humming again. The American auto industry is back. <p>And companies like Daimler know you're still a smart bet. They could have made their investment somewhere else, but they didn't. And if you ask them whether it was a tough call, they'll tell you it wasn't even close. So the word's going out all around the world: If you want to find the best workers in the world, if you want to find the best factories in the world, if you want to build the best cars or trucks or any other product in the world, you should invest in the United States of America. This is the place to be. <p>See, you're starting to see the competitive balance is tipping a little bit. Over the past few years, it's become more expensive to do business in countries like China. Our workers have become more productive. Our energy costs are starting to go down here in the United States. And we still have the largest market. So when you factor in everything, it makes sense to invest here in America. <p>And that's one of the reasons why American manufacturing is growing at the fastest pace since the 1990s. And thanks in part to the boost in manufacturing, 4 years after the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes, our economy is growing again. Our businesses have created more than half&mdash;5&frac12; million new jobs over the past 33 months. So we're making progress. We're moving in the right direction. We're going forward. <p>So what we need to do is simple. We need to keep going. We need to keep going forward. We should do everything we can to keep creating good, middle class jobs that help folks rebuild security for their families. And we should do everything we can to encourage companies like Daimler to keep investing in American workers. <p>And by the way, what we shouldn't do&mdash;I've just got to say this&mdash;what we shouldn't be doing is trying to take away your rights to bargain for better wages and working conditions. [<i>Applause</i>] We shouldn't be doing that. These so-called \\"right to work\\" laws, they don't have to do with economics, they have everything to do with politics. What they're really talking about is giving you the right to work for less money. <p>You only have to look to Michigan&mdash;where workers were instrumental in reviving the auto industry&mdash;to see how unions have helped build not just a stronger middle class, but a stronger America. So folks from our State's capital, all the way to the Nation's Capital, they should be focused on the same thing. They should be working to make sure companies like this manufacturer is able to make more great products. That's what they should be focused on. We don't want a race to the bottom, we want a race to the top. <p>We&mdash;America is not going to compete based on low skill, low wage, no workers' rights. That's not our competitive advantage. There's always going to be some other country that can treat its workers even worse. Right? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Right! <p><i>The President.</i> What's going to make us succeed is we got the best workers: well trained, reliable, productive, low turnover, healthy. That's what makes us strong. And it also is what allows our workers then to buy the products that we make because they've got enough money in their pockets. <p>So we've got to get past this whole situation where we manufacture crises because of politics. That actually leads to less certainty, more conflict, and we can't all focus on coming together to grow. <p>And the same thing&mdash;we're seeing the same thing in Washington. I'm sure you've all heard the talk recently about some big deadlines we're facing in a few weeks when it comes to decisions on jobs and investment and taxes. And that debate is going to have a big impact on all of you. Some of you may know this: If Congress doesn't act soon&mdash;meaning in the next few weeks&mdash;starting on January 1, everybody is going to see their income taxes go up. <p><i>Audience members.</i> No! <p><i>The President.</i> It's true. You all don't like that. <p><i>Audience members.</i> No! <p><i>The President.</i> Typical, middle class family of four will see an income tax hike of around $2,200. How many of you can afford to pay another $2,200 in taxes? <p><i>Audience member</i>. Not me! <p><i>The President</i>. Not you? <p><i>Audience members.</i> No! <p><i>The President.</i> No, I didn't think so. You can't afford to lose that money. That's a hit you can't afford to take. And by the way, that's not a good hit for businesses either, because if Congress lets middle class taxes go up, economists will tell you, that means people will spend nearly $200 billion less than they otherwise would spend. Consumer spending is going to go down. That means you've got less customers. Businesses get fewer profits. They hire fewer workers. You go in a downward spiral. Wrong idea. <p>Here is the good news: We can solve this problem. All Congress needs to do is pass a law that would prevent a tax hike on the first $250,000 of everybody's income&mdash;everybody. That means 98 percent of Americans&mdash;and probably 100 percent of you&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;97 percent of small businesses wouldn't see their income taxes go up a single dime. Even the wealthiest Americans would still get a tax cut on the first $250,000 of their income. But when they start making a million or 10 million or 20 million, you can afford to pay a little bit more. You're not too strapped. <p>So Congress can do that right now. Everybody says they agree with it. Let's get it done. <p>Now, so that's the bare minimum. That's the bare minimum we should be doing in order to the grow the economy. But we can do more. We can do more than just extend middle class tax cuts. I've said I will work with Republicans on a plan for economic growth, job creation, and reducing our deficits. And that has some compromise between Democrats and Republicans. I understand this&mdash;people have a lot of different views. I'm willing to compromise a little bit. <p>But if we're serious about reducing our deficit, we've also got to be serious about investing in the things that help us grow and make the middle class strong, like education and research and development and making sure kids can go to college and rebuilding our roads and our infrastructure. We've got to do that. <p>So when you put it all together, what you need is a package that keeps taxes where they are for middle class families; we make some tough spending cuts on things that we don't need; and then, we ask the wealthiest Americans to pay a slightly higher tax rate. And that's a principle I won't compromise on, because I'm not going to have a situation where the wealthiest among us, including folks like me, get to keep all our tax breaks, and then, we're asking students to pay higher student loans. Or suddenly, a school doesn't have schoolbooks because the school district couldn't afford it. Or some family that has a disabled kid isn't getting the help that they need through Medicaid. <p>We're not going to do that. We're not going to make that tradeoff. That's not going to help us to grow. Our economic success has never come from the top down, it comes from the middle out. It comes from the bottom up. It comes from folks like you working hard, and if you're working hard and you're successful, then you become customers and everybody does well. <p>Our success as a country in this new century will be defined by how well we educate our kids, how well we train our workers, how well we invent, how well we innovate, how well we build things like cars and engines&mdash;all the things that helped create the greatest middle class the world's ever known. That's how you bring new jobs back to Detroit. That's how you bring good jobs back to America. That's what I'm focused on. That's what I will stay relentlessly focused on going forward. <p>Because when we focus on these things&mdash;when we stay true to ourselves and our history&mdash;there's nothing we can't do. And if you don't believe me, you need to come down to this plant and see all these outstanding workers. <p>In fact, as I was coming over here, I was hearing about a guy named Willie. Where's Willie? There's Willie right here. [<i>Applause</i>] There's Willie. Now, all right. [<i>Applause</i>] In case&mdash;there's Willie. Now, in case you haven't heard of him, they actually call him Pretty Willie. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, I got to say you got to be pretty tough to have a nickname like Pretty Willie. [<i>Laughter</i>] He's tough. <p>On Wednesday, Willie will celebrate 60 years working at Detroit Diesel&mdash;60 years. Willie started back on December 12, 1952. I was not born yet. [<i>Laughter</i>] Wasn't even close to being born. He made $1.40 an hour. Only time he spent away from this plant was when he was serving our country in the Korean war. So three generations of Willie's family have passed through Detroit Diesel. One of his daughters works here with him right now. Is that right? There she is. <p>In all his years, Willie has been late to work only once. It was back in 1977. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's been so long he can't remember why he was late&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but we're willing to give him a pass. <p>So Willie believes in hard work. You don't keep a job for 60 years if you don't work hard. Sooner or later, someone is going to fire you if you don't work hard. He takes pride in being something&mdash;in being part of something bigger than himself. He's committed to family; he's committed to community; he's committed to country. That's how Willie lives his life. That's how all of you live your lives. <p>And that makes me hopeful about the future, because you're out there fighting every day for a better future for your family and your country. And when you do that, that means you're creating value all across this economy. You're inspiring people. You're being a good example for your kids. That's what makes America great. That's what we have to stay focused on. <p>And as long as I've got the privilege of serving as your President, I'm going to keep fighting for you. I'm going to keep fighting for your kids. I'm going to keep fighting for an America where anybody, no matter who you are, no matter what you look like, no matter where you come from, you can make it if you try here in America. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you.\" "
"242" "\"<i>The President.</i> Good evening, everybody. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Good evening. <p><i>The President.</i> Well, thank you for coming to the White House tonight to celebrate the sixth night of Hanukkah. It is truly an honor to host so many leaders from the Jewish community this evening. Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren is here. And obviously, I know I speak for all of us when we say that America's support for our friend and ally Israel remains unshakeable during these difficult times. <p>Many Members of Congress and local government are here, and we want to welcome you. We are graced by two Supreme Court Justices, several members of my Cabinet and administration, so, everybody, be on your best behavior. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to thank the incredibly talented members of the West Point Jewish Chapel Cadet Choir for their service. They are incredible young people. Obviously, we're in awe of their service to our Nation and for sharing a couple of Hanukkah favorites with the Marine Band. <p>And finally, I'd like to recognize the rabbis and lay leaders who traveled from all over the country to be here. Thank you for sharing the holiday with us. We're grateful. <p>So tonight, as we gather to light the sixth candle of Hanukkah, we remember an enduring story of resilience and optimism. Over 2,000 years ago, a tyrant forbade the Israelites from practicing their religion, and his forces desecrated the holy temple. So Judah Maccabee gathered a small band of believers to fight this oppression, and against all odds, they prevailed. The Maccabees liberated Jerusalem and restored the faith of its people. And when they went to reclaim the temple, the people of Jerusalem received another gift from God: The oil that should have lasted only 1 night burned for 8. That miraculous flame brought hope, and it sustained the faithful. <p>To this day, Jews around the world honor the Maccabees' everlasting hope that light will overcome the darkness, that goodness will overcome evil, and that faith can accomplish miracles. <p>The menorah that we're using tonight and the man who will light it are both powerful symbols of that spirit. Six weeks ago, the Temple Israel Synagogue in Long Beach, New York, was badly damaged by Hurricane Sandy. But this 90-year-old menorah survived, and I am willing to bet it will survive another 90 years and another 90 years after that. So tonight it shines as a symbol of perseverance and as a reminder of those who are still recovering from Sandy's destruction: a reminder of resilience and hope and the fact that we will be there for them as they recover. <p>So I want to thank Rabbi David Bauman for sharing your congregation's blessed menorah with us. We pray that its light will carry victims of Sandy and all Americans to a brighter tomorrow. And we're confident that it will. <p>And we're confident that it will, because for centuries, the menorah has served as a source of inspiration and courage for all those dreaming of a better future, and Rabbi Larry Bazer knows that as well as anybody. <p>Now, we had hoped that Rabbi would join us to light the candles last year, but he wasn't able to make it. We don't get that very often. Usually, when we invite people, they come. [<i>Laughter</i>] But we gave him another chance because he had a pretty good excuse the first time. <p>Last Hanukkah, Rabbi Bazer&mdash;and he happens to be the Joint Forces Chaplain for the Massachusetts National Guard&mdash;was 4 months into his deployment in Afghanistan, and he lit a custom-built electric menorah in the central square of Camp Phoenix in Kabul. As the only rabbi in Afghanistan at the time, he spent every night of Hanukkah with a different group of soldiers, reminding them of the Maccabees' perseverance and bringing them faith to guide their challenging work. <p>Even in the face of great danger, the message of Hanukkah endures. And it continues to inspire those all over the world who stand for freedom and opportunity, and we could not be more grateful to Rabbi Bazer for his extraordinary service to our country as well as his service to his congregation. <p>I think the Rabbi stands here alongside this menorah both as a symbol of hope and perseverance and determination and duty. And it also reminds us that there are sacrifices that are involved in defending our values. Obviously, we're grateful to the men and women who serve our Nation so nobly and so bravely all around the world. And our thoughts and prayers in this holiday season especially go out to those who are away from home during the holiday season. <p>But obviously, the lessons of Hanukkah also apply to those of us who should be serving in different ways in our own communities, in our workplaces, in our own families, as citizens of this Nation: that we have obligations to one another; that we're stronger together than we are apart; that we have to think about future generations and not just the present. <p>Those are all values that we have to also make sacrifices to defend. And so I want to welcome all of you. I'm honored to be with you. I see a lot of good friends around the room. But at this time, I'd like to invite Rabbi Bazer to join me to light the White House menorah. <p>[<i>At this point, a blessing was offered, and the menorah was lit.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Have a wonderful evening, everybody. We're going to go around and try and shake some hands.\" "
"243" "\"This afternoon I spoke with Governor Malloy and FBI Director Mueller. I offered Governor Malloy my condolences on behalf of the Nation and made it clear he will have every single resource that he needs to investigate this heinous crime, care for the victims, counsel their families. <p>We've endured too many of these tragedies in the past few years. And each time I learn the news, I react not as a President, but as anybody else would: as a parent. And that was especially true today. I know there's not a parent in America who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that I do. <p>The majority of those who died today were children, beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them: birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers, men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. <p>So our hearts are broken today, for the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children and for the families of the adults who were lost. Our hearts are broken for the parents of the survivors as well, for as blessed as they are to have their children home tonight, they know that their children's innocence has been torn away from them too early and there are no words that will ease their pain. <p>As a country, we have been through this too many times. Whether it's an elementary school in Newtown or a shopping mall in Oregon or a temple in Wisconsin or a movie theater in Aurora or a street corner in Chicago, these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods, and these children are our children. And we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics. <p>This evening Michelle and I will do what I know every parent in America will do, which is hug our children a little tighter, and we'll tell them that we love them, and we'll remind each other how deeply we love one another. But there are families in Connecticut who cannot do that tonight. And they need all of us right now. In the hard days to come, that community needs us to be at our best as Americans, and I will do everything in my power as President to help. Because while nothing can fill the space of a lost child or loved one, all of us can extend a hand to those in need, to remind them that we are there for them, that we are praying for them, that the love they felt for those they lost endures not just in their memories, but also in ours. <p>May God bless the memory of the victims and, in the words of Scripture, heal the brokenhearted and bind up their wounds.\" "
"244" "\"On Friday, we learned that more than two dozen people were killed when a gunman opened fire in an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. Most of those who died were just young children with their whole lives ahead of them. And every parent in America has a heart heavy with hurt. Among the fallen were also teachers: men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. <p>So our hearts are broken today. We grieve for the families of those we lost, and we keep in our prayers the parents of those who survived. Because, as blessed as they are to have their children home, they know that their child's innocence has been torn away far too early. <p>As a nation, we have endured far too many of these tragedies in the last few years&mdash;an elementary school in Newtown, a shopping mall in Oregon, a house of worship in Wisconsin, a movie theater in Colorado, countless street corners in places like Chicago and Philadelphia. Any of these neighborhoods could be our own. So we have to come together, and we're going to have to take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this from happening, regardless of politics. <p>This weekend, Michelle and I are doing what I know every parent is doing: holding our children as close as we can and reminding them how much we love them. <p>There are families in Connecticut who can't do that today. And they need all of us right now. Because while nothing can take the place of a lost child or loved one, all of us can extend a hand to those in need to remind them that we are there for them; that we are praying for them; and that the love they felt for those they lost endures not just in their own memories, but also in their communities and in their country. <p>Thank you, and God bless you.\" "
"245" "\"Thank you, Governor. To all the families, first-responders; to the community of Newtown, clergy, guests&mdash;Scripture tells us: \\"Do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, inwardly we are being renewed day by day. For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal. For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands.\\" <p>We gather here in memory of 20 beautiful children and 6 remarkable adults. They lost their lives in a school that could have been any school, in a quiet town full of good and decent people that could be any town in America. <p>Here in Newtown, I come to offer the love and prayers of a nation. I am very mindful that mere words cannot match the depths of your sorrow, nor can they heal your wounded hearts. I can only hope it helps for you to know that you're not alone in your grief; that our world too has been torn apart; that all across this land of ours, we have wept with you and we've pulled our children tight. And you must know that whatever measure of comfort we can provide, we will provide; whatever portion of sadness that we can share with you to ease this heavy load, we will gladly bear it. Newtown, you are not alone. <p>As these difficult days have unfolded, you've also inspired us with stories of strength and resolve and sacrifice. We know that when danger arrived in the halls of Sandy Hook Elementary, the school's staff did not flinch; they did not hesitate. Dawn Hochsprung and Mary Sherlach, Vicki Soto, Lauren Rousseau, Rachel D'Avino, and Anne Marie Murphy&mdash;they responded as we all hope we might respond in such terrifying circumstances: with courage and with love, giving their lives to protect the children in their care. <p>We know that there were other teachers who barricaded themselves inside classrooms and kept steady through it all and reassured their students by saying: \\"Wait for the good guys; they're coming.\\" \\"Show me your smile.\\" <p>And we know that good guys came: the first-responders who raced to the scene, helping to guide those in harm's way to safety and comfort those in need, holding at bay their own shock and their own trauma because they had a job to do and others needed them more. <p>And then, there were the scenes of the schoolchildren, helping one another, holding each other, dutifully following instructions in the way that young children sometimes do, one child even trying to encourage a grownup by saying: \\"I know karate. So it's okay. I'll lead the way out.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>As a community, you've inspired us, Newtown. In the face of indescribable violence, in the face of unconscionable evil, you've looked out for each other, and you've cared for one another, and you've loved one another. This is how Newtown will be remembered. And with time and God's grace, that love will see you through. <p>But we as a nation, we are left with some hard questions. Someone once described the joy and anxiety of parenthood as the equivalent of having your heart outside of your body all the time, walking around. With their very first cry, this most precious, vital part of ourselves&mdash;our child&mdash;is suddenly exposed to the world, to possible mishap or malice. And every parent knows there is nothing we will not do to shield our children from harm. And yet we also know that with that child's very first step and each step after that, they're separating from us; that we won't&mdash;that we can't&mdash;always be there for them. They'll suffer sickness and setbacks and broken hearts and disappointments. And we learn that our most important job is to give them what they need to become self-reliant and capable and resilient, ready to face the world without fear. <p>And we know we can't do this by ourselves. It comes as a shock at a certain point where you realize, no matter how much you love these kids, you can't do it by yourself; that this job of keeping our children safe and teaching them well is something we can only do together, with the help of friends and neighbors, the help of a community, and the help of a nation. And in that way, we come to realize that we bear a responsibility for every child because we're counting on everybody else to help look after ours; that we're all parents; that they're all our children. <p>This is our first task: caring for our children. It's our first job. If we don't get that right, we don't get anything right. That's how, as a society, we will be judged. <p>And by that measure, can we truly say, as a nation, that we're meeting our obligations? Can we honestly say that we're doing enough to keep our children&mdash;all of them&mdash;safe from harm? Can we claim, as a nation, that we're all together there, letting them know that they are loved and teaching them to love in return? Can we say that we're truly doing enough to give all the children of this country the chance they deserve to live out their lives in happiness and with purpose? <p>I've been reflecting on this the last few days, and if we're honest with ourselves, the answer is no. We're not doing enough. And we will have to change. <p>Since I've been President, this is the fourth time we have come together to comfort a grieving community torn apart by mass shootings, the fourth time we've hugged survivors, the fourth time we've consoled the families of victims. And in between, there have been an endless series of deadly shootings across the country, almost daily reports of victims, many of them children, in small towns and big cities all across America, victims whose&mdash;much of the time, their only fault was being in the wrong place at the wrong time. <p>We can't tolerate this anymore. These tragedies must end. And to end them, we must change. We will be told that the causes of such violence are complex, and that is true. No single law&mdash;no set of laws&mdash;can eliminate evil from the world or prevent every senseless act of violence in our society. <p>But that can't be an excuse for inaction. Surely, we can do better than this. If there is even one step we can take to save another child or another parent or another town from the grief that's visited Tucson and Aurora and Oak Creek and Newtown and communities from Columbine to Blacksburg before that, then surely we have an obligation to try. <p>In the coming weeks, I will use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens&mdash;from law enforcement to mental health professionals to parents and educators&mdash;in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this. Because what choice do we have? We can't accept events like this as routine. Are we really prepared to say that we're powerless in the face of such carnage, that the politics are too hard? Are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of our freedom? <p>All the world's religions&mdash;so many of them represented here today&mdash;start with a simple question: Why are we here? What gives our life meaning? What gives our acts purpose? We know our time on this Earth is fleeting. We know that we will each have our share of pleasure and pain; that even after we chase after some earthly goal, whether it's wealth or power or fame or just simple comfort, we will in some fashion fall short of what we had hoped. We know that no matter how good our intentions, we'll all stumble sometimes, in some way. We'll make mistakes; we will experience hardships. And even when we're trying to do the right thing, we know that much of our time will be spent groping through the darkness, so often unable to discern God's heavenly plans. <p>There's only one thing we can be sure of, and that is the love that we have: for our children, for our families, for each other. The warmth of a small child's embrace: That is true. The memories we have of them, the joy that they bring, the wonder we see through their eyes, that fierce and boundless love we feel for them, a love that takes us out of ourselves and binds us to something larger&mdash;we know that's what matters. We know we're always doing right when we're taking care of them, when we're teaching them well, when we're showing acts of kindness. We don't go wrong when we do that. <p>That's what we can be sure of. And that's what you, the people of Newtown, have reminded us. That's how you've inspired us. You remind us what matters. And that's what should drive us forward in everything we do, for as long as God sees fit to keep us on this Earth. <p>\\"Let the little children come to me,\\" Jesus said, \\"and do not hinder them&mdash;for to such belongs the Kingdom of Heaven.\\" <p>Charlotte. Daniel. Olivia. Josephine. Ana. Dylan. Madeleine. Catherine. Chase. Jesse. James. Grace. Emilie. Jack. Noah. Caroline. Jessica. Benjamin. Avielle. Allison. <p>God has called them all home. For those of us who remain, let us find the strength to carry on and make our country worthy of their memory. <p>May God bless and keep those we've lost in His heavenly place. May He grace those we still have with His holy comfort. And may He bless and watch over this community and the United States of America.\" "
"246" "\"Thank you. Well, good evening, everyone. It is wonderful to see all of you. <p>I want to publicly thank Deputy Secretary Bill Burns. For those of you who don't know, Bill is only the second career diplomat in American history to rise to the level of Deputy Secretary. It is a tribute to Bill's extraordinary skills. I first met him when I was a new Senator, and I traveled to Moscow. And he was then the Ambassador in Moscow, and he immediately impressed me. One of these guys who doesn't speak loud, but actually has something to say&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;which is hard to find in Washington. In Washington, you have a lot of folks who speak loud and have nothing to say. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And so we're thrilled obviously with the work that he's done, but Bill, I think, is representative of our incredible Foreign Service officers. So thanks not only to Bill, but to all the outstanding State Department personnel who are working every day, often at great risk, to advance our interests and our ideals around the world. <p>Had Secretary Clinton been able to join us, I was going to congratulate her on her record-breaking travels, visiting 112 nations&mdash;just about every one of the countries that are represented here this evening&mdash;more than 400 travel days, nearly 1 million miles. These are not frequent flyer miles. [<i>Laughter</i>] She does not get discounts. I suspect she's not going to be flying commercial that much after she leaves the State Department. But she is tireless and extraordinary. <p>I spoke with her this past week. We can't wait to have her back. And I know that all of you join me in sending her wishes for a speedy recovery. <p>Now, we get together like this every year or so around the holidays, either here or at the White House. It's a chance for me to express my appreciation for the cooperation and partnership between our countries. That includes the hospitality that you and your fellow citizens show every single day to our diplomats and their families, Americans who are serving far from home. <p>But tonight I also want to thank you for something else. This obviously continues to be a very difficult week here in America. We're still grieving and reeling from unspeakable violence that took place in Newtown. I was up there on Sunday. I told the families there that they are not alone, that our entire Nation stands with them. But over the past few days, what we've also seen is, is that the entire world stands with them, and so many of your countries, your citizens, your leaders have sent messages to them. And I know they are grateful, and certainly, I am grateful. <p>At our Embassies and consulates, people are placing flowers and leaving notes. We've seen candlelight vigils and makeshift memorials, including a beach in Brazil marked by 26 crosses and a bright American flag. Across the globe, people are going online and posting messages and sending e-mails and texts of support. I think of the woman, a teacher in Lithuania, who said: \\"I send all my love and prayers to the families. It's all I can do so far away, but my heart is now in Newtown.\\" <p>So this evening I want you and your fellow citizens back home to know how much this has meant to all of us: to the good people of Newtown, to me, and to the American people. You've stood with us, just as we've stood with you in similar moments: whether it's been a Scottish village, an Australian town, most recently, the terrible tragedy at a youth camp in Norway. <p>Whether it's a tsunami that strikes or an earthquake that levels communities or when a young girl is targeted and nearly killed just for wanting to go to school, we're reminded that terrible things happen in this world, but there are more people of good will than people of ill will. And that if we can just remind ourselves of our common humanity, perhaps we can make progress. <p>These are moments that pierce through all the noise of our daily lives. And they speak to a larger truth that permeates our work together. You turn on the TV, you open the newspaper, and every day, it seems we're bombarded with images of tension and conflict and division and differences. And that sometimes seems to validate those who believe that civilizations are destined to clash. <p>But when you think about the last few days, you're reminded that there's a fundamental human response that transcends cultures and transcends borders. And that's what is represented in this room. You look around the room, and we reflect this vast tapestry of human experience: people from every continent and every culture; North, South, East and West; from all great faiths; every creed and color; men and women. And we're reminded that whatever differences on the surface, deep down we're bound by a certain set of basic aspirations. <p>We want our children to be safe and free from fear. We want people to live in dignity and prosperity, free from want. We want people to be free to think for themselves and speak their minds and pray as they choose. We want them to surpass or do a little bit better than we did. That's what we want for our children. That's why we're here, to serve them, to do everything in our power to leave our children and the next generation a better, safer world. <p>And that's why, over the past 4 years, we've worked together, wherever we can, with your nations in a new era of engagement, based on mutual interest and mutual respect: strengthening alliances; forging new partnerships; confronting the spread of nuclear weapons; promoting open government, global health and food security and fighting human trafficking; ending one war in Iraq; winding down another war in Afghanistan; going after terrorist networks that threaten all of our people; standing up for self-determination and freedom, from South Sudan to the Arab Spring to Burma. <p>At the same time, we're mindful that we've got so much more work to do together. There still are wars to end. There are still democratic transitions to sustain. Violent extremism remains out there and has to be confronted and deadly weapons still have to be contained. We have to work to ease tensions between nations and uphold human rights. There are still political prisoners that need to be freed and children that deserve a better education. And all of us have to be concerned about a changing climate that could have a profound impact on every single country here. <p>This must be our work. And I'm here to say tonight that this spirit of partnership with your nations that defined my first term will remain a core principle of my second term. That's my commitment. That is America's commitment. And that, I think, is one of the ways we can honor all these beautiful children and incredible teachers who were lost this past Friday: by building a future that is equal to their dreams and delivers on the dreams of children all around the world just like them. <p>So as we gather this holiday season and look ahead to the new year, I'd leave you with a simple message, a wish: In the face of violence, let's seek peace. In the face of injustice, let's strive for dignity. In the face of oppression, let's stand for liberty. And in the face of suspicion and mistrust, let's build empathy and understanding. Let's understand that we need to live together: as nations and as peoples and as brothers and sisters, as children of a loving God. I hope all of you have a wonderful holiday season, and I look forward to seeing you in the new year. <p>God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"247" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. Over the last few weeks, I've been working with leaders of both parties on a proposal to get our deficit under control, avoid tax cuts&mdash;or avoid tax hikes on the middle class, and to make sure that we can spur jobs and economic growth; a balanced proposal that cuts spending, but also asks the wealthiest Americans to pay more; a proposal that will strengthen the middle class over the long haul and grow our economy over the long haul. <p>During the course of these negotiations, I offered to compromise with Republicans in Congress. I met them halfway on taxes, and I met them more than halfway on spending. And in terms of actual dollar amounts, we're not that far apart. <p>As of today, I am still ready and willing to get a comprehensive package done. I still believe that reducing our deficit is the right thing to do for the long-term health of our economy and the confidence of our businesses. I remain committed to working towards that goal, whether it happens all at once or whether it happens in several different steps. <p>But in 10 days, we face a deadline. In 10 days, under current law, tax rates are scheduled to rise on most Americans. And even though Democrats and Republicans are arguing about whether those rates should go up for the wealthiest individuals, all of us&mdash;every single one of us&mdash;agrees that tax rates shouldn't go up for the other 98 percent of Americans, which includes 97 percent of small businesses. Every Member of Congress believes that: every Democrat, every Republican. So there is absolutely no reason&mdash;none&mdash;not to protect these Americans from a tax hike. At the very least, let's agree right now on what we already agree on. Let's get that done. <p>I just spoke to Speaker Boehner, and I also met with Senator Reid. In the next few days, I've asked leaders of Congress to work towards a package that prevents a tax hike on middle class Americans, protects unemployment insurance for 2 million Americans, and lays the groundwork for further work on both growth and deficit reduction. That's an achievable goal. That can get done in 10 days. <p>Once this legislation's agreed to, I expect Democrats and Republicans to get back to Washington and have it pass both Chambers. And I will immediately sign that legislation into law, before January 1 of next year. It's that simple. <p>Averting this middle class tax hike is not a Democratic responsibility or a Republican responsibility. With their votes, the American people have determined that governing is a shared responsibility between both parties. In this Congress, laws can only pass with support from Democrats and Republicans. And that means nobody gets 100 percent of what they want. Everybody's got to give a little bit, in a sensible way. We move forward together, or we don't move forward at all. <p>So as we leave town for a few days to be with our families for the holidays, I hope it gives everybody some perspective. Everybody can cool off; everybody can drink some eggnog, have some Christmas cookies, sing some Christmas carols, enjoy the company of loved ones. And then I'd ask every Member of Congress while they're back home to think about that. Think about the obligations we have to the people who sent us here. Think about the hardship that so many Americans will endure if Congress does nothing at all. <p>Just as our economy is really starting to recover and we're starting to see optimistic signs and we've seen actually some upside statistics from a whole range of areas, including housing, now is not the time for more self-inflicted wounds, certainly not those coming from Washington. And there's so much more work to be done in this country: on jobs and on incomes, education and energy. We're a week away from one of the worst tragedies in memory, so we've got work to do on gun safety, host of other issues. These are all challenges that we can meet. They're all challenges that we have to meet if we want our kids to grow up in an America that's full of opportunity and possibility, as much opportunity and possibility as the America that our parents and our grandparents left for us. <p>But we're only going to be able to do it together. We're going to have to find some common ground. And the challenge that we've got right now is that the American people are a lot more sensible and a lot more thoughtful and much more willing to compromise and give and sacrifice and act responsibly than their elected representatives are. And that's a problem. <p>There's a mismatch right now between how everybody else is thinking about these problems&mdash;Democrats and Republicans outside of this town&mdash;and how folks are operating here. And we've just got to get that aligned. But we've only got 10 days to do it. <p>So I hope that every Member of Congress is thinking about that. Nobody can get 100 percent of what they want. And this is not simply a contest between parties in terms of who looks good and who doesn't. There are real world consequences to what we do here. <p>And I want next year to be a year of strong economic growth. I want next year to be a year in which more jobs are created and more businesses are started and we're making progress on all the challenges that we have out there, some of which, by the way, we don't have as much control over as we have in terms of just shaping a sensible budget. <p>This is something within our capacity to solve. It doesn't take that much work. We just have to do the right thing. So call me a hopeless optimist, but I actually still think we can get it done. <p>And with that, I want to wish every American a merry Christmas. And because we didn't get this done, I will see you next week. Thank you.\" "
"248" "\"To Irene, Ken, Jennifer, Danny's friends, and former colleagues, it is an extraordinary honor to be with you in this magnificent place to pay tribute to a man who'd probably be wondering what all the fuss is about. <p>This Tuesday was in many ways a day like any other: The sun rose, the sun set, the great work of our democracy carried on. But in a fundamental sense, it was different. It was the first day in many of our lives, certainly my own, that the halls of the United States Congress were not graced by the presence of Daniel Ken Inouye. <p>Danny was elected to the U.S. Senate when I was 2 years old. He had been elected to Congress a couple of years before I was born. He would remain my Senator until I left Hawaii for college. <p>Now, even though my mother and grandparents took great pride that they had voted for him, I confess that I wasn't paying much attention to the United States Senate at the age of 4 or 5 or 6. It wasn't until I was 11 years old that I recall even learning what a U.S. Senator was or it registering at least. It was during my summer vacation with my family, my first trip to what those of us in Hawaii call the \\"Mainland.\\" <p>So we flew over the ocean, and with my mother and my grandmother and my sister, who at the time was 2, we traveled around the country. It was a big trip. We went to Seattle, and we went to Disneyland, which was most important. We traveled to Kansas, where my grandmother's family was from, and went to Chicago and went to Yellowstone. And we took Greyhound buses most of the time, and we rented cars, and we'd stay at local motels or Howard Johnson's. And if there was a pool at one of these motels, even if it was just tiny, I would be very excited. And the ice machine was exciting, and the vending machine, I was really excited about that. <p>But this is at a time when you didn't have 600 stations and 24 hours' worth of cartoons. And so at night, if the TV was on, it was what your parents decided to watch. And my mother, that summer, would turn on the TV every night during this vacation and watch the Watergate hearings. And I can't say that I understood everything that was being discussed, but I knew the issues were important. I knew they spoke to some basic way about who we were and who we might be as Americans. <p>And so, slowly, during the course of this trip, which lasted about a month, some of this seeped into my head. And the person who fascinated me most was this man of Japanese descent with one arm, speaking in this courtly baritone, full of dignity and grace. And maybe he captivated my attention because my mom explained that this was our Senator and that he was upholding what our Government was all about. Maybe it was a boyhood fascination with the story of how he had lost his arm in war. But I think it was more than that. <p>Now, here I was, a young boy with a White mom, a Black father, raised in Indonesia and Hawaii. And I was beginning to sense how fitting into the world might not be as simple as it might seem. And so to see this man, this Senator, this powerful, accomplished person, who wasn't out of central casting when it came to what you'd think a Senator might look like at the time, and the way he commanded the respect of an entire nation, I think it hinted to me what might be possible in my own life. <p>This was a man who as a teenager stepped up to serve his country even after his fellow Japanese Americans were declared enemy aliens; a man who believed in America even when its Government didn't necessarily believe in him. That meant something to me. It gave me a powerful sense, one that I couldn't put into words: a powerful sense of hope. <p>And as I watched those hearings, listening to Danny ask all those piercing questions night after night, I learned something else. I learned how our democracy was supposed to work&mdash;our Government of and by and for the people&mdash;that we have a system of Government where nobody is above the law; where we have an obligation to hold each other accountable, from the average citizen to the most powerful of leaders, because these things that we stand for, these ideals that we hold dear, are bigger than any one person or party or politician. <p>And somehow, nobody communicated that more effectively than Danny Inouye. You got a sense, as Joe mentioned, of just a fundamental integrity, that he was a proud Democrat, but most importantly, he was a proud American. And were it not for those two insights planted in my head at the age of 11, in between Disneyland and a trip to Yellowstone, I might never have considered a career in public service. I might not be standing here today. <p>I think it's fair to say that Danny Inouye was perhaps my earliest political inspiration. And then, for me to have the privilege of serving with him: to be elected to the United States Senate and arrive, and one of my first visits is to go to his office and for him to greet me as a colleague and treat me with the same respect that he treated everybody he met and to sit me down and give me advice about how the Senate worked and then regale me with some stories about wartime and his recovery, stories full of humor&mdash;never bitterness, never boastfulness&mdash;just matter of fact. Some of them, I must admit, a little offcolor. I couldn't probably repeat them in the Cathedral. There's a side of Danny that&mdash;well. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Danny once told his son, his service to this country had been for the children, for all the sons and daughters who deserve to grow up in a nation that never questioned their patriotism. This is my country, he said. Many of us have fought hard for the right to say that. And obviously, Ric Shinseki described what it meant for Japanese Americans, but my point is, is that when he referred to our sons and daughters, he wasn't just talking about Japanese Americans. He's talking about all of us. He's talking about those who serve today who might have been excluded in the past. He's talking about me. <p>And that's who Danny was. For him, freedom and dignity were not abstractions. They were values that he had bled for, ideas he had sacrificed for, rights he understood as only someone can who has had them threatened, had them taken away. <p>The valor that earned him our Nation's highest military decoration&mdash;a story so incredible that when you actually read the accounts, you think this, you couldn't make this up; it's like out of an action movie&mdash;that valor was so rooted in a deep and abiding love of this country. And he believed, as we say in Hawaii, that we're a single <i>ohana</i>, that we're one family. And he devoted his life to making that family strong. <p>After experiencing the horror of war himself, Danny also felt a profound connection to those who follow. It wasn't unusual for him to take time out of his busy schedule to sit down with a veteran or a fellow amputee, trading stories, telling jokes&mdash;two heroes, generations apart&mdash;sharing an unspoken bond that was forged in battle and tempered in peace. In no small measure, because of Danny's service, our military is, and will always remain, the best in the world, and we recognize our sacred obligation to give our veterans the care they deserve. <p>Of course, Danny didn't always take credit for the difference he made. Ever humble, one of the only landmarks that bear his name is a Marine Corps messhall in Hawaii. And when someone asked him how he wanted to be remembered, Danny said: \\"I represented the people of Hawaii and this Nation honestly and to the best of my ability&mdash;I think I did okay.\\" <p>Danny, you were more than okay. You were extraordinary. <p>It's been mentioned that Danny ended his convention speech in Chicago in 1968 with the word \\"aloha.\\" \\"To some of you who visited us, it may have meant hello,\\" he said, but \\"to others, it may have meant goodbye. Those of us who've been privileged to live in Hawaii understand aloha means I love you.\\" <p>And as someone who has been privileged to live in Hawaii, I know that he embodied the very best of that spirit, the very best of \\"aloha.\\" It's fitting it was the last word that Danny spoke on this Earth. He may have been saying goodbye to us. Maybe he was saying hello to someone waiting on the other side? But it was a final expression, most of all, of his love for the family and friends that he cared so much about, for the men and women he was honored to serve with, for the country that held such a special place in his heart. <p>And so we remember a man who inspired all of us with his courage and moved us with his compassion, that inspired us with his integrity, and who taught so many of us, including a young boy growing up in Hawaii, that America has a place for everyone. <p>May God bless Daniel Inouye. And may God grant us more souls like his.\" "
"249" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hi, everybody. This weekend, as you gather with family and friends, Michelle and I wanted to wish you a merry Christmas and a happy holidays. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> We both love this time of year. And there's nothing quite like celebrating the holidays at the White House. It's an incredible experience and one that we try to share with as many folks as possible. <p>This month, more than 90,000 people will come through the White House to see the holiday decorations. And our theme for this year's holiday season was \\"Joy to All,\\" a reminder to appreciate the many joys of the holidays: the joy of giving, the joy of service, and of course, the joy of homecomings. <p><i>The President.</i> That's right. This weekend, parents are picking up their kids from college and making room for all the laundry they bring with them. Children are counting down the hours until the grandparents arrive. And uncles, aunts, and cousins are making their way to join the family and share in the holiday spirit. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> That's what makes this season so special, getting to spend time with the people we love most. <p><i>The President.</i> And this year, that's especially true for some of our military families. You see, the war in Iraq is over, the transition in Afghanistan is underway, and after a decade of war, our heroes are coming home. All across America, military families are reuniting. <p>So this week, let's give thanks for our veterans and their families. And let's say a prayer for all our troops, especially those in Afghanistan, who are spending this holiday season overseas, risking their lives to defend the freedoms that we hold so dear. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> And remember, when our men and women in uniform answer the call to serve, their families serve right along with them. All across the country, military spouses have been raising their families all alone during those long deployments. And let's not forget about our military kids, moving from base to base and school to school every few years and stepping up to help out at home when mom or dad is away. <p>Our military families sacrifice so much on our behalf, and Barack and I believe that we should serve them as well as they serve this country. That's why Dr. Jill Biden and I started Joining Forces, an effort to rally all Americans to honor and support our veterans and military families. Just go to joiningforces.gov to find out how you can show your gratitude for their service. <p><i>The President.</i> Because that's what this season is all about. For my family and millions of Americans, it's a time to celebrate the birth of Christ, to reflect on His life and learn from His example. Every year, we commit to love one another, to give of ourselves, to be our brother's keeper, to be our sister's keeper. But those ideas are not just part of our faith, they're part of all faiths. And they unite us as Americans. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> In this country, we take care of each other. And in this season of giving, it's inspiring to see so many people all across America taking the time to help those most in need. <p><i>The President.</i> That's part of what makes us such a compassionate nation. And this year, I know many of you are extending that kindness to the families who are still picking up the pieces from Hurricane Sandy and extending your prayers to the people of Newtown, Connecticut. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> So thank you for all that you've done this year on behalf of your fellow Americans. <p><i>The President.</i> And on behalf of my favorite Americans&mdash;Michelle, Malia, Sasha, and Bo&mdash;merry Christmas, everybody. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Happy holidays.\" "
"250" "\"<i>The President. </i>Hello, everybody! Well, it is wonderful to see all of you. First of all, we want to say merry Christmas to everybody. <p><i>Audience members. </i>Merry Christmas! <p><i>The President. </i>This looks like it was a nice rather than naughty crowd&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;so I'm sure Santa treated you well. <p>On behalf of Michelle and myself and our whole family, we do this every year. This is where I was born, and so we come back for the holidays. But one of our favorite things is always coming to the base on Christmas Day and having a chance just to meet you, those of you who have families here, and to say thank you for the extraordinary work and service that you guys do each and every day. <p>Obviously, the greatest honor I have as President is being Commander in Chief. And the reason it's an honor is because not only do we have the finest military in the world, but we also have the finest fighting men and women in the world. And so many of you make sacrifices day in, day out on behalf of our freedom, on behalf of our security. <p>And not only do those in uniform make sacrifices, but I think everybody here understands the sacrifices that families make each and every day as well. And Michelle, working with Dr. Jill Biden, has done a lot of work to focus attention on our military families to make sure that you get the support that you have earned and that you deserve. <p>So I'm not going to make a long speech. Obviously, we're still in a wartime footing. There are still folks, as we speak, who are overseas, especially in Afghanistan, risking their lives each and every day. Some of you may have loved ones who are deployed there. Some of you may be about to be deployed there. And so we know that it's not easy. But what we also want you to know is that you have the entire country behind you and that all of us understand that we would be nowhere without the extraordinary service that you guys provide. <p>And so we want to say thank you, we love you. And with that, what we're going to do is we're going to slip back here. Last couple of years, we went from table to table, but we kept on missing tables, and some folks didn't get pictures. So this time, we're going to do it in a slightly more organized fashion. So the people who want to take a picture, we're going to be standing right here next to a tree. You guys will be able to come up. You can take your time, those of you who are still finishing your meals. <p>The only thing we'd ask, I think, is when we're taking the photos&mdash;people will get copies of this stuff, so I know everybody these days has a phone all the time. But we have a White House photographer who's pretty good. [<i>Laughter</i>] He knows what he's doing. And we'll make sure that the photographs come back through the General&mdash;through your commanding officer, so that everybody who is here today will be able to get a copy. <p>All right, thank you very much, everybody. And have a great New Year as well. Happy New Year!\" "
"251" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. For the past couple of months, I've been working with leaders of both parties to try and forge an agreement that would grow our economy and shrink the deficit, a balanced plan that would cut spending in a responsible way, but also ask the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more and, above all, protect our middle class and everybody who is striving to get into the middle class. <p>I still want to get this done. It's the right thing to do for our families, for our businesses, and for our entire economy. But the hour for immediate action is here. It is now. <p>We're now at the point where, in just 4 days, every American's tax rates are scheduled to go up by law. Every American's paycheck will get considerably smaller. And that would be the wrong thing to do for our economy, it would be bad for middle class families, and it would be bad for businesses that depend on family spending. Fortunately, Congress can prevent it from happening if they act right now. <p>I just had a good and constructive discussion here at the White House with Senate and House leadership about how to prevent this tax hike on the middle class, and I'm optimistic we may still be able to reach an agreement that can pass both houses in time. Senators Reid and McConnell are working on such an agreement as we speak. <p>[<i>At this point, a conversation could be heard off camera</i>.] <p>But if an agreement isn't reached in time between Senator Reid and Senator McConnell, then I will urge Senator Reid to bring to the floor a basic package for an up-or-down vote, one that protects the middle class from an income tax hike, extends the vital lifeline of unemployment insurance to 2 million Americans looking for a job, and lays the groundwork for future cooperation on more economic growth and deficit reduction. <p>[<i>The disruption continued.</i>] <p>Guys, I can hear you over here. <p>I believe such a proposal could pass both Houses with bipartisan majorities as long as those leaders allow it to actually come to a vote. If Members of the House or the Senate want to vote no, they can, but we should let everybody vote. That's the way this is supposed to work. If you can get a majority in the House and you can get a majority in the Senate, then we should be able to pass a bill. <p>So the American people are watching what we do here. Obviously, their patience is already thin. This is deja vu all over again. America wonders why it is that in this town, for some reason, you can't get stuff done in an organized timetable, why everything always has to wait until the last minute. Well, we're now at the last minute, and the American people are not going to have any patience for a politically self-inflicted wound to our economy. Not right now. <p>The economy is growing, but sustaining that trend is going to require elected officials to do their jobs. The housing market is recovering, but that could be impacted if folks are seeing smaller paychecks. The unemployment rate is the lowest it's been since 2008, but already, you're seeing businesses and consumers starting to hold back because of the dysfunction that they see in Washington. <p>Economists, business leaders all think that we're poised to grow in 2013, as long as politics in Washington don't get in the way of America's progress. <p>So we've got to get this done. I just want to repeat: We had a constructive meeting today. Senators Reid and McConnell are discussing a potential agreement, where we can get a bipartisan bill out of the Senate, over to the House, and done in a timely fashion so that we've met the December 31 deadline. But given how things have been working in this town, we always have to wait and see until it actually happens. The one thing that the American people should not have to wait and see is some sort of action. <p>So if we don't see an agreement between the two leaders in the Senate, I expect a bill to go on the floor&mdash;and I've asked Senator Reid to do this&mdash;put a bill on the floor that makes sure that taxes on middle class families don't go up, that unemployment insurance is still available for 2 million people, and that lays the groundwork, then, for additional deficit reduction and economic growth steps that we can take in the new year. <p>But let's not miss this deadline. That's the bare minimum that we should be able to get done, and it shouldn't be that hard since Democrats and Republicans both say they don't want to see taxes go up on middle class families. <p>And I just have to repeat: Outside of Washington, nobody understands how it is that this seems to be a repeat pattern over and over again. Ordinary folks, they do their jobs. They meet deadlines. They sit down, and they discuss things, and then, things happen. If there are disagreements, they sort through the disagreements. The notion that our elected leadership can't do the same thing is mind-boggling to them. And it needs to stop. <p>So I'm modestly optimistic that an agreement can be achieved. Nobody is going to get 100 percent of what they want, but let's make sure that middle class families and the American economy&mdash;and in fact, the world economy&mdash;aren't adversely impacted because people can't do their jobs. <p>All right? Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"252" "\"Hi, everybody. For the past couple of months, I've been working with people in both parties, with the help of business leaders and ordinary Americans, to come together around a plan to grow the economy and shrink our deficits. It's a balanced plan, one that would protect the middle class, cut spending in a responsible way, and ask the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more. And I'll keep working with anybody who's serious about getting a comprehensive plan like this done because it's the right thing to do for our economic growth. <p>But we're now at the point where, in just a couple of days, the law says that every American's tax rates are going up. Every American's paycheck will get a lot smaller. And that would be the wrong thing to do for our economy. It would hurt middle class families, and it would hurt the businesses that depend on your spending. <p>And Congress can prevent it from happening, if they act now. Leaders in Congress are working on a way to prevent this tax hike on the middle class.

If they still want to vote no and let tax hikes hit the middle class, that's their prerogative. But they should let everybody else vote as well. That's the way this is supposed to work. <p>We just can't afford a politically self-inflicted wound to our economy. The economy is growing, but keeping it that way means that the folks you sent to Washington have to do their jobs. The housing market is healing, but that could stall if folks are seeing smaller paychecks. The unemployment rate is the lowest it's been since 2008, but already, families and businesses are starting to hold back because of the dysfunction they see in Washington. <p>You meet your deadlines; you meet your responsibilities every single day; the folks you sent here to serve should do the same. We cannot let Washington politics get in the way of America's progress. We've got to do what it takes to protect the middle class, grow this economy, and move our country forward. <p>Thanks, everybody.\" "
"253" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! Thank you. Please, everybody, have a seat. Well, good afternoon, everybody. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Good afternoon! <p><i>The President.</i> Welcome to the White House. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Thank you! <p><i>Audience member.</i> Thank you for having us. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Now, I realize that the last thing you want to hear on New Year's Eve is another speech from me. But I do need to talk about the progress that's being made in Congress today. <p>For the last few days, leaders in both parties have been working toward an agreement that will prevent a middle class tax hike from hitting 98 percent of all Americans, starting tomorrow. Preventing that tax hike has been my top priority, because the last thing folks like the folks up here on this stage can afford right now is to pay an extra $2,000 in taxes next year. Middle class families can't afford it. Businesses can't afford it. Our economy can't afford it. <p>Now, today it appears that an agreement to prevent this New Year's tax hike is within sight, but it's not done. There are still issues left to resolve, but we're hopeful that Congress can get it done. But it's not done. <p>And so part of the reason that I wanted to speak to all of you here today is to make sure that we emphasize to Congress and that members of both parties understand that all across America, this is a pressing concern on people's minds. <p>Now, the potential agreement that's being talked about would not only make sure that taxes don't go up on middle class families, it also would extend tax credits for families with children. It would extend our tuition tax credit that's helped millions of families pay for college. It would extend tax credits for clean energy companies that are creating jobs and reducing our dependence on foreign oil. It would extend unemployment insurance to 2 million Americans who are out there still actively looking for a job. <p>Now, I have to say that ever since I took office, throughout the campaign, and over the last couple of months, my preference would have been to solve all these problems in the context of a larger agreement, a bigger deal, a grand bargain&mdash;whatever you want to call it&mdash;that solves our deficit problems in a balanced and responsible way, that doesn't just deal with the taxes, but deals with the spending in a balanced way so that we can put all this behind us and just focusing on growing our economy. <p>But with this Congress, that was obviously a little too much to hope for at this time. [<i>Laughter</i>] It may be we can do it in stages. We're going to solve this problem instead in several steps. <p>Last year, in 2011, we started reducing the deficit through $1 trillion in spending cuts. Those have already taken place. The agreement being worked on right now would further reduce the deficit by asking the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans to pay higher taxes for the first time in two decades, so that would add additional hundreds of billions of dollars to deficit reduction. So that's progress, but we're going to need to do more. <p>Keep in mind that just last month Republicans in Congress said they would never agree to raise tax rates on the wealthiest Americans. Obviously, the agreement that's currently being discussed would raise those rates and raise them permanently. <p>Now&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;but keep in mind, we're going to still have more work to do. We still have deficits that have to be dealt with. We're still going to have to think about how we put our economy on a long-term trajectory of growth, how we continue to make investments in things like education, things like infrastructure that help our economy grow. <p>And keep in mind that the threat of tax hikes going up is only one part of this so-called fiscal cliff that everybody's been talking about. What we also have facing us starting tomorrow are automatic spending cuts that are scheduled to go into effect. And keep in mind that some of these spending cuts that Congress has said will automatically go into effect have an impact on our Defense Department, but they also have an impact on things like Head Start. And so there are some programs that are scheduled to be cut that&mdash;we're using an ax instead of a scalpel&mdash;may not always be the smartest cuts. And so that is a piece of business that still has to be taken care of. <p>And I want to make clear that any agreement we have to deal with these automatic spending cuts that are being threatened for next month, those also have to be balanced. Because remember, my principle has always been let's do things in a balanced, responsible way. And that means that revenues have to be part of the equation in turning off the sequester, in eliminating these automatic spending cuts, as well as spending cuts. <p>Now, the same is true for any future deficit agreement. Obviously, we're going to have to do more to reduce our debt and our deficit. I'm willing to do more, but it's going to have to be balanced. We're going to have to do it in a balanced, responsible way. <p>For example, I'm willing to reduce our Government's Medicare bills by finding new ways to reduce the cost of health care in this country. That's something that we all should agree on. We want to make sure that Medicare is there for future generations. But the current trajectory of health care costs is going up so high we've got to find ways to make sure that it's sustainable. <p>But that kind of reform has to go hand in hand with doing some more work to reform our Tax Code so that wealthy individuals, the biggest corporations can't take advantage of loopholes and deductions that aren't available to most of the folks standing up here, aren't available to most Americans. So there's still more work to be done in the Tax Code to make it fairer, even as we're also looking at how we can strengthen something like Medicare. <p>Now, if Republicans think that I will finish the job of deficit reduction through spending cuts alone&mdash;and you hear that sometimes coming from them, that, sort of, after today we're just going to try to shove only spending cuts down, well&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;shove spending cuts at us that will hurt seniors or hurt students or hurt middle class families, without asking also equivalent sacrifice from millionaires or companies with a lot of lobbyists, et cetera, if they think that's going to be the formula for how we solve this thing, then they've got another think coming. That's not how it's going to work. We've got to do this in a balanced and responsible way. And if we're going to be serious about deficit reduction and debt reduction, then it's going to have to be a matter of shared sacrifice, at least as long as I'm President. And I'm going to be President for the next 4 years, I hope, so&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>So anyway, for now, our most immediate priority is to stop taxes going up for middle class families, starting tomorrow. I think that is a modest goal that we can accomplish. Democrats and Republicans in Congress have to get this done, but they're not there yet. They are close, but they're not there yet. And one thing we can count on with respect to this Congress is that if there's even one second left before you have to do what you're supposed to do&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;they will use that last second. <p>So, as of this point, it looks like I'm going to be spending New Year's here in DC. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Aww! <p><i>The President.</i> It's&mdash;you all are going to be hanging out in DC too. [<i>Laughter</i>] I can come to your house? Is that what you said? [<i>Laughter</i>] I don't want to spoil the party. <p><i>Audience member.</i> You are the party. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> But the people who are with me here today, the people who are watching at home, they need our leaders in Congress to succeed. They need us to all stay focused on them, not on politics, not on special interests. They need to be focused on families, students, grandmas, folks who are out there working really, really hard and are just looking for a fair shot and some reward for that hard work. <p>They expect our leaders to succeed on their behalf. So do I. And so keep the pressure on over the next 12 hours or so. Let's see if we can get this thing done. <p>And I thank you all. And if I don't see you, if I don't show up at your house&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I want to wish everybody a happy New Year. Thank you very much. All right.\" "
