"1" "\"Hi, everybody, and happy New Year. <p>This is a time when we look ahead to all the possibilities and opportunities of the year to come, when we resolve to better ourselves and to better our relationships with one another. And today I want to talk about one place that Washington should start, a place where we can make a real and powerful difference in the lives of many of our fellow Americans right now. <p>Just a few days after Christmas, more than 1 million of our fellow Americans lost a vital economic lifeline: the temporary insurance that helps folks make ends meet while they look for a job. Republicans in Congress went home for the holidays and let that lifeline expire. And for many of their constituents who are unemployed through no fault of their own, that decision will leave them with no income at all. <p>We make this promise to one another because it makes a difference to a mother who needs help feeding her kids while she's looking for work. It makes a difference to a father who needs help paying the rent while learning the skills to get a new and better job. And denying families that security is just plain cruel. We're a better country than that. We don't abandon our fellow Americans when times get tough; we keep the faith with them until they start that new job. <p>What's more, it actually slows down the economy for all of us. If folks can't pay their bills or buy the basics, like food and clothes, local businesses take a hit and hire fewer workers. That's why the independent Congressional Budget Office says that unless Congress restores this insurance, we'll feel a drag on our economic growth this year. And after our businesses created more than 2 million new jobs last year, that's a self-inflicted wound we don't need. <p>So when Congress comes back to work this week, their first order of business should be making this right. Right now a bipartisan group in Congress is working on a 3-month extension of unemployment insurance, and if they pass it, I will sign it. For decades, Republicans and Democrats put partisanship and ideology aside to offer some security for job seekers, even when the unemployment rate was lower than it is today. Instead of punishing families who can least afford it, Republicans should make it their New Year's resolution to do the right thing and restore this vital economic security for their constituents right now. <p>After all, our focus as a country this year shouldn't be shrinking our economy, but growing it; not narrowing opportunity, but expanding it; not fewer jobs, but doing everything we can to help our businesses create more of the good jobs that a growing middle class requires. That's my New Year's resolution: to do everything I can every single day to help make 2014 a year in which more of our citizens can earn their own piece of the American Dream. <p>After 5 years of working and sacrificing to recover and rebuild from crisis, we have it within our power right now to move this country forward. It's entirely up to us. And I'm optimistic for the year that lies ahead. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"2" "\"<i>The President.</i> Please, everybody, have a seat. Well, happy New Year, everybody. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Happy New Year! <p><i>The President.</i> Hope you're keeping warm. A few weeks ago, I said that 2014 could be a breakthrough year for America. Think about it: Five years ago this month, our economy was shedding 800,000 jobs, just in 1 month. But as Americans buckled down and worked hard and sacrificed, we began to come back. <p>And our businesses have created more than 8 million new jobs since we hit the bottom. Our auto industry has gone from bust to boom. Manufacturing is rebounding. The housing market's rebounding. Stock markets are restoring retirement accounts. The promise of energy independence is actually in sight. Health care costs eat up less of our economy; over the past 4 years, costs have grown at the slowest rate on record. And since I took office, we've cut our deficits by more than half. <p>So America is getting stronger, and we've made progress. And the economy is growing, and we've got to do more to make sure that all Americans share in that growth. We've got to help our businesses create more jobs. We've got to make sure those jobs offer the wages and benefits that let families rebuild a little security. In other words, we've got to make sure that this recovery leaves nobody behind. And we've got a lot of work to do on that front. The good news is, I'm optimistic we can do it if we do it together. <p>Now, before the holidays, both parties compromised on a budget that lifts some of the drag that's been on the economy from these indiscriminate cuts we call sequester. And as a consequence, this year, we may see more stability when it comes to economic growth. And I think I'm not alone in saying that we are all grateful in the new year that we won't have another partisan shutdown, hopefully, going forward. <p>So that was a good sign. And we should build on that progress with what I said should be the first order of business in 2014, and that is extending insurance for the unemployed. The good news is, this morning the Senate took a very important step in that direction. <p>For the Americans who have joined me at the White House today and millions like them who were laid off in the recession through no fault of their own, unemployment insurance has been a vital economic lifeline. For a lot of people, it's the only source of income they've got to support their families while they look for a new job. These aren't folks who are just sitting back waiting for things to happen. They're out there actively looking for work. They desperately want work. <p>But although the economy has been growing and we've been adding new jobs, the truth of the matter is, is that the financial crisis was so devastating that there's still a lot of people who are struggling. And in fact, if we don't provide unemployment insurance, it makes it harder for them to find a job. <p>You heard Katherine's story. And she's far more eloquent than I could ever be. She wrote me last month to say, \\"Please let those who think I am sitting at home enjoying being unemployed know that I'd much rather be working.\\" And I had a chance to talk to Katherine, and I think it's pretty clear that that's the case. Katherine went on to say: \\"I have applied to everything for which I am possibly qualified to no avail. I have worked hard all my life, paid taxes, voted, engaged in political discussion, and made the ultimate sacrifice: My two sons serve in the U.S. military. Job loss is devastating, and if I could fix it myself, I would. I challenge any lawmaker to live without an income.\\" That's what Katherine said. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's hard. <p>So when we've got the mom of two of our troops, who is working hard out there, but is having to wear a coat inside the house, we've got a problem. And it's one that can be fixed. And Katherine is not alone. <p>Devlin Smith, who's watching today from her home in California, wrote me about her hunt for a new job. Since she was laid off 13 months ago, she has sent out hundreds of r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, she has volunteered, she has done seasonal work. She doesn't want to just be sitting around the house. She's been taking online courses to learn new skills. Without unemployment insurance, though, she won't be able to pay for her car or her cell phone, which makes the job hunt that much harder. And Devlin wrote to me and said: \\"I've wanted nothing more than to find a new full-time job, and I've dedicated every day to that mission. I'm asking you to advocate for me and the millions like me who need our extended unemployment benefits to make ends meet.\\" <p>So I just want everybody to understand, this is not an abstraction. These are not statistics. These are your neighbors, your friends, your family members. It could at some point be any of us. That's why we set up a system of unemployment insurance. The notion was, everybody is making a contribution because you don't know when the business cycle or an economic crisis might make any of us vulnerable. <p>And this insurance helps keep food on the table while Dad is sending out r&eacute;sum&eacute;s. It helps Mom pay the rent while she's learning new skills to earn that new job. It provides that extra bit of security so that losing your job doesn't mean that you have to lose your house or everything you've worked so hard to build for years. We make this promise to our fellow Americans who are working hard to get back on their feet because when times get tough, we are not a people who say, you're on your own. We're a people who believe that we're all in it together. And we know, \\"There but the grace of God go I.\\" <p>So that's the values case for this. That's the moral case for this. But there's an economic case for it as well. Independent economists have shown that extending emergency unemployment insurance actually helps the economy, actually creates new jobs. When folks like Katherine have a little more to spend to turn up the heat in her house or buy a few extra groceries, that means more spending with businesses in her local community, which in turn may inspire that business to hire one more person, maybe Kathy. <p>That's why, in the past, both parties have repeatedly put partisanship and ideology aside to offer some security for job seekers with no strings attached. It's been done regardless of whether Democrats or Republicans were in the White House. It's been done regardless of whether Democrats or Republicans controlled Congress. And by the way, it's done&mdash;it's been done multiple times when the unemployment rate was significantly lower than it is today. <p>And what's important to keep in mind also is that the recovery in a big country like the United States is going to be somewhat uneven. So there are some States that have a 2.5 unemployment rate, and then there are some places that may still have a 7-, 8-, 9-percent unemployment rate. The people living in those respective States may be working equally hard to find a job, but it's going to be harder in some places than others. <p>Now, 2 weeks ago, Congress went home for the holidays and let this lifeline expire for 1.3 million Americans. If this doesn't get fixed, it will hurt about 14 million Americans over the course of this year, 5 million workers along with 9 million of their family members: their spouses, their kids. <p>Now, I've heard the argument that says extending unemployment insurance will somehow hurt the unemployed because it saps their motivation to get a new job. [<i>Laughter</i>] I really want to go at this for a second. [<i>Laughter</i>] I&mdash;that really sells the American people short. I meet a lot of people as President of the United States and as a candidate for President of the United States and as a U.S. Senator and as a State senator. I meet a lot of people. And I can't name a time where I met an American who would rather have an unemployment check than the pride of having a job. <p>The long-term unemployed are not lazy. And they're not lacking in motivation. They're coping with the aftermath of the worst economic crisis in generations. In some cases, they may have a skills mismatch. Right? They may have been doing a certain job for 20 years; suddenly, they lose that job. They may be an older worker, may have to get retrained. It's hard. Sometimes, employers will discriminate if you've been out of work for a while; they decide, well, we're not sure we want to hire you, we'd rather hire somebody who's still working right now. <p>So it's hard out there. There are a lot of our friends, a lot of our neighbors who have lost their jobs, and they are working their tails off every single day trying to find a new job. Now, as the job market keeps getting better, more and more of these folks will find work. But in the meantime, the insurance keeps them from falling off a cliff. It makes sure they can pay their car note to go to that interview. It makes sure they can pay their cell phone bill so that if somebody calls back for an interview, they can answer it. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And Katherine explained this. Katherine, in the letter that she wrote to me, said, do folks really think that \\"cutting this benefit will make someone hire me?\\" I mean, that's not how employers are thinking. <p>So letting unemployment insurance expire for millions of Americans is wrong. Congress should make things right. I am very appreciative that they're on their way to doing just that thanks to the bipartisan work of two Senators. You had a Democrat from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, and you had a conservative Republican from Nevada, Senator Heller. And despite their political differences, they worked together on a plan to extend unemployment insurance at least for 3 months, temporarily, while we figure out a longer term solution. And this morning, a bipartisan majority of Senators agreed to allow this commonsense provision to at least move forward in the process. <p>Now, the Senate is a complicated place. [<i>Laughter</i>] So just because they agreed on this vote, all they've agreed to so far is that we're actually going to be able to have a vote on it. They haven't actually passed it. So we've got to get this across the finish line without obstruction or delay, and we need the House of Representatives to be able to vote for it as well. And it's&mdash; that's the bottom line. <p>Voting for unemployment insurance helps people and creates jobs, and voting against it does not. Congress should pass this bipartisan plan right away, and I will sign it right away. And more than 1 million Americans across the country will feel a little hope right away. And hope is contagious. <p>When Katherine has a little bit more confidence about her situation, when she finds a job, she is going to be able to help somebody down the line maybe who is also down on their luck. When Congress passes a bipartisan effort starting here right at the beginning of the new year, who knows, we might actually get some things done this year. [<i>Laughter</i>] So after all the hard work and sacrifice of the past 5 years to recover and rebuild from the crisis, what I think the American people are really looking for in 2014 is just a little bit of stability. Let's just do the commonsense thing. Let's do what's right. <p>We're going to have to require&mdash;we're going to have to see action, though, on the part of Congress. And I'll be willing to work with them every step of the way: action to help our businesses create more of the good jobs that a growing middle class requires, action to restore economic mobility and reduce inequality, action to open more doors of opportunity for everybody who is willing to work hard and walk through those doors. <p>When I was listening to Katherine, I was just so struck by her strength and dignity. And I think people, when they bump into some tough times, like Katherine, they're not looking for pity, they just want a shot. And they just want to feel as if, you know what, as a part of this country, as a part of their communities, that if misfortune strikes, all the things that they've done in the past, all the hard work they've done raising children and paying taxes and working hard, that that counts for something and that folks aren't suddenly just going to dismiss their concerns, but we're going to rally behind them. That's not too much to ask. That's who we are as Americans. That's what built this country. That's what I want to promote. <p>So thank you very much, everybody. And let's get to work. Let's get this done. I appreciate you.\" "
"3" "\"Good job. Thank you. Well, everybody, have a seat. Well, welcome to the White House, everybody. And that was one of the best introductions I've ever had. [<i>Laughter</i>] So we're so proud of Kiara for that introduction and for sharing your story, and you're just so poised. And I know Geoff Canada is just out there all excited&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and proud, so&mdash;and I know your mom is proud. I know she is. She should be. <p>Kiara and the rest of these young people grew up in a 97-square-block section of Harlem. It's a place where the odds used to be stacked against them every single day. Even just graduating from high school was a challenge. But with the help of some very dedicated adults and a program called the Harlem's Children's Zone, they're right on track to go to college. Together, students, teachers, administrators, parents, community, they're changing the odds in this neighborhood. And that's what we're here to talk about today: changing the odds for every American child so that no matter who they are, no matter where they are born, they have a chance to succeed in today's economy. <p>Now, the good news is that, thanks to the hard work and sacrifice of the American people all across the country over the last 5 years, our economy has grown stronger. Our businesses have now created more than 8 million new jobs since the depths of the recession. Our manufacturing, our housing sectors are rebounding. Our energy and technology and auto industries are booming. And we've got to keep our economy growing. We've got to make sure that everybody is sharing in that growth. We've got to keep creating jobs, and then we've got to make sure that wages and benefits are such that families can rebuild a little bit of security. We've got to make sure this recovery, which is real, leaves nobody behind. And that's going to be my focus throughout the year. <p>This is going to be a year of action. That's what the American people expect, and they're ready and willing to pitch in and help. This is not just a job for government, this is a job for everybody. <p>Working people are looking for the kind of stable, secure jobs that too often went overseas in the past couple of decades. So next week, I'll join companies and colleges and take action to boost high-tech manufacturing, the kind that attracts good new jobs and helps grow a middle class. Business owners are ready to play their part to hire more workers. So this month, I'm going to host CEOs here at the White House not once, but twice: first to lay out specific steps we can take to help more workers earn the skills that they need for today's new jobs; second, they're going to announce commitments that we're making to put more of the long-term unemployed back to work. <p>And on January 28, in my State of the Union Address&mdash;which, I want all the legislators here to know, I'm going to try to keep a little shorter than usual&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;they're cheering silently&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I will mobilize the country around the national mission of making sure our economy offers every American who works hard a fair shot at success. Anybody in this country who works hard should have a fair shot at success, period. It doesn't matter where they come from, what region of the country, what they look like, what their last name is, they should be able to succeed. <p>And obviously, we're coming off of a rancorous political year, but I genuinely believe that this is not a partisan issue. Because when you talk to the American people, you know that there are people working in soup kitchens and people who are mentoring and people who are starting small businesses and hiring their neighbors and very rarely are they checking, are they Democrat or Republican? There's a sense of neighborliness that's inherent in the American people; we just have to tap into that. <p>And I've been very happy to see that there are Republicans like Rand Paul, who's here today, who are ready to engage in this debate. That's a good thing. We've got Democratic and Republican elected officials across the country who are ready to roll up their sleeves and get to work. And this should be a challenge that unites us all. <p>I don't care whether the ideas are Democrat or Republican. I do care that they work. I do care that they are subject to evaluation and we can see if we are using tax dollars in a certain way; if we're starting a certain program, I want to make sure that young people like Kiara are actually benefiting from them. <p>Now, it's one thing to say we should help more Americans get ahead, but talk is cheap. We've got to actually make sure that we do it. And I will work with anybody who's willing to lay out some concrete ideas to create jobs, help more middle class families find security in today's economy, and offer new ladders of opportunity for folks to climb into the middle class. <p>And personally, I hope we start by listening to the majority of the American people and restoring the unemployment insurance for Americans who need a little help supporting their families while they look for a new job. And I'm glad that Republicans and Democrats in the Senate are working together to extend that lifeline. I hope their colleagues in the House will join them to set this right. <p>Today I want to talk about something very particular, a specific example of how we can make a difference. We are here with leaders who are determined to change the odds in their communities the way these kids and their parents and dedicated citizens have changed the odds in Harlem. It's now been 50 years since President Johnson declared an unconditional War on Poverty in America. And that groundbreaking effort created new avenues of opportunity for generations of Americans. It strengthened our safety net for working families and seniors, Americans with disabilities, and the poor, so that when we fall&mdash;and you never know what life brings you&mdash;we can bounce back faster. It made us a better country and a stronger country. <p>In his speech 50 years ago, President Johnson talked about communities \\"on the outskirts of hope where opportunity was hard to come by.\\" Well, today's economic challenges are different, but they've still resulted in communities where in recent decades wrenching economic change has made opportunity harder and harder to come by. There are communities where for too many young people, it feels like their future only extends to the next street corner or the outskirts of town; too many communities where no matter how hard you work, your destiny is&mdash;feels like it's already been determined for you before you took that first step. <p>I'm not just talking about pockets of poverty in our inner cities. That's the stereotype. I'm talking about suburban neighborhoods that have been hammered by the housing crisis. I'm talking about manufacturing towns that still haven't recovered after the local plants shut down and jobs dried up. There are islands of rural America where jobs are scarce&mdash;they were scarce even before the recession hit&mdash;so that young people feel like if they want to actually succeed, they've got to leave town, they've got to leave their communities. <p>And I've seen this personally even before I got into politics. In fact, this is what drove me into politics. I was just 2 years out of college when I first moved to the South Side of Chicago. I was hired by a group of churches to help organize a community that had been devastated when the local steel plants closed their doors. And I'd walk through neighborhoods filled up with boarded-up houses and crumbling schools and single parents and dads who had nothing to do with their kids and kids who were hanging out on the street corners without any hope or prospects for the future. <p>But these churches came together. And then they started working with other nonprofits and businesses&mdash;local businesses. And the government&mdash;local, State, and Federal&mdash; participated. And we started getting some things done that gave people hope. And that experience taught me that government does not have all the answers. No amount of money can take the place of a loving parent in a child's life. But I did learn that when communities and governments and businesses and non-for-profits work together, we can make a difference. Kiara is proof&mdash;all these young people are proof&mdash;we can make a difference. <p>For the last 17 years, the Harlem Children's Zone&mdash;the brainchild of Geoffrey Canada, who's here today&mdash;has proven we can make a difference. And it operated on a basic premise: that each child will do better if all the children around them are doing better. So in Harlem, staff members go door to door and they recruit soon-to-be parents for \\"Baby College,\\" preparing them for those crucial first few months of life; making sure that they understand how to talk to their child and read to their child; and sometimes working with the parents to teach them how to read so they can read to their child and give them the healthy start that they need. <p>And then, early childhood education to get kids learning at 4 years old. And then a charter school that help students succeed all the way through high school. And medical care and healthy foods that are available close to home. And exercise, I was very pleased to hear that&mdash; Michelle was very pleased to hear that&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that they've got a strong phys ed program. And then students getting help finding internships and applying to college and an outstanding, dedicated staff that tries to make sure that nobody slips through the cracks or falls behind. <p>And this is an incredible achievement, and the results have been tremendous. Today, preschool students in the Harlem's Children's Zone are better prepared for kindergarten. Last year, a study found that students who win a spot in one of the charter schools score higher on standardized tests than those who don't. In a neighborhood where higher education was once just something that other people did, you've got hundreds of kids who have now gone to college. <p>And Harlem is not the only community that's found success taking on these challenges together. In Cincinnati, a focus on education has helped to make sure more kids are ready for kindergarten. In Nashville, they've redesigned high schools and boosted graduation rates by almost 20 percent over the past 12 years. In Milwaukee, they've cut teen pregnancy in half. <p>Every community is different, with different needs and different approaches. But communities that are making the most progress on these issues have some things in common. They don't look for a single silver bullet; instead, they bring together local government and nonprofits and businesses and teachers and parents around a shared goal. That's what Geoffrey did when he started the Harlem Children's Zone. Government was involved. So don't be confused here: It has an important role to play. And already there are government resources going into these communities. But it's important that our faith institutions and our businesses and the parents and the communities themselves are involved in designing and thinking through how do we move forward. <p>And the second thing is, they're holding themselves accountable by delivering measurable results. We don't fund things, we don't start projects just for the sake of starting them. They've got to work. If they don't work we should try something else. And sometimes, those of us who care deeply about advancing opportunity aren't willing to subject some of these programs to that test: Do they work? <p>Now, in my State of the Union Address last year, I announced our commitment to identify more communities like these&mdash;urban, rural, tribal&mdash;where dedicated citizens are determined to make a difference and turn things around. And we challenged them. We said, if you can demonstrate the ability and the will to launch an all-encompassing, all-hands-on-deck approach to reducing poverty and expanding opportunity, we'll help you get the resources to do it. We'll take some&mdash;resources from some of the programs that we're already doing and concentrate them. We'll make sure that our agencies are working together more effectively. We'll put in talent to help you plan. But we're also going to hold you accountable and measure your progress. <p>And if you're doing real stuff that is making a difference in the lives of young people like Kiara, then we're going to be there. Your country will help you remake your community on behalf of your kids, family by family, block by block. <p>We call these communities Promise Zones. They're neighborhoods where we will help local efforts to meet one national goal: that a child's course in life should be determined not by the zip code she's born in, but by the strength of her work ethic and the scope of her dreams. <p>So we're here today to announce the first five Promise Zones in America. And I could not be prouder to be joined by Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles; and Mayor Michael Nutter of Philadelphia; and Councilwoman Ivy Taylor from San Antonio; Chief Gregory Pyle, one of our tribal leaders; and Jerry Rickett from the Kentucky Highlands Investment Corporation&mdash;some of the leaders from these neighborhoods who are helping to make it happen. <p>In the East Side neighborhood of San Antonio, nearly 4 in 10 adults don't have a high school diploma. The violent crime rate is 50 percent higher than the rest of the city. So schools and community members are focused on getting more kids into pre-K, boosting math and science in high school, and they're putting more cops on foot patrol to make their neighborhoods safer. It's a project worth investing in. <p>In a section of L.A. that stretches from Pico-Union to Hollywood, the population decreased by 13,000 people in just 10 years. So developers are working to build more affordable housing. Technical schools and community colleges are helping more people get the training they need to get jobs. It's a project worth investing in. <p>In Philly, nearly 4 out of every 10 kids lives below the poverty line, and a lot of them are on the West Side of the city. So a local university is helping connect middle and high school students with mentors to get them ready for college. You've got a supermarket that's being planned that will create jobs and provide healthy food where there's been too little of both. We're going to invest in that. <p>In Senator Mitch McConnell's home State of Kentucky, there are communities that have been struggling for decades with shutdowns and layoffs. So they're taking steps, locally initiated, to attract new businesses and create new jobs in new industries. And you've got a local college that's stepping up to expand technical training and help more kids get a higher education. <p>In the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, where up to half of the residents in some areas live in poverty, community leaders are determined to change things. And they're making financing available to help women start their own businesses. They're investing in new water and sewer systems that will make the area more attractive for companies looking to locate there. And they're helping farmers and ranchers create more jobs and more families thereby get access to healthy foods. <p>So these are America's first five Promise Zones. And over the next 3 years, we're going to help launch 20 in all. And each of these communities is designing from the bottom up, not the top down, what it is they think they need, and we're working with them to make that happen. And each of these communities is prepared to do what it takes to change the odds for their kids. We will help them succeed, not with a handout, but as partners with them every step of the way. And we're going to make sure it works, and we're going to hold them accountable to make sure it is making a difference in the lives of kids. <p>As a nation, we've got plenty of reasons to hope. And I just want to end with one story just to give you a sense of what we're talking about here. Roger Brown came here today from Harlem. Where is Roger? There he is right here. I used to have a haircut like that, but&mdash; [<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and maybe after I'm done with the Presidency, I'm going back to that. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Growing up&mdash;I want you to listen to Roger's story, because it's unique and it's special, but it's also representative. So growing up, Roger spent some time in the foster care system before going to live with his mom, who was working two jobs to make ends meet. When Roger was in sixth grade, his mom entered his name in the Promise Academy Charter School lottery and prayed. And Roger won a spot. <p>Now, the way I hear it, Roger, you were still having some problems sometimes. He was the class clown and acting out and almost got himself expelled. But the teachers and the staff did not give up on him. They saw something in him. They kept pushing him. And then one summer when Roger was home visiting his foster family, he looked around the room, and he realized nobody in that room had gone to college and nobody in that room had a job. And at that moment, something clicked. And Roger decided he wanted something better for himself&mdash;and for his mom and for his two sisters that looked up to him. <p>So Roger buckled down. He went from failing his classes to passing his classes. He became a member of the first graduating class at the Promise Academy. And today, Roger is a sophomore at Hunter College in New York, one of the best colleges in the country, the first person in his family to get that far. And now he wants to go to medical school and become a neurologist. So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>If you want to know why I care about this stuff so much, it's because I'm not that different from Roger. There was a period of time in my life where I was goofing off. I was raised by a single mom. I didn't know my dad. The only difference between me and Roger was my environment was more forgiving than his. That's the only difference. If I screwed up, the consequences weren't quite as great. <p>So if Roger can make it, and if I can make it, if Kiara can make it, every kid in this country can make it. But we've got to believe in that. We can't just give lip service to it. And it can't just get caught up in a bunch of political arguments. <p>There are legitimate questions about how the best way to do this is, how we can best make progress. And there are legitimate debates to be had about how big of a role is government in that process, how big of a role is the private sector. And there's no disagreement that there has to be individual initiative; it's got to start inside. Roger had to have a change of attitude. I had to have a change in attitude. Kiara&mdash;she probably didn't need a change in attitude. [<i>Laughter</i>] She was focused the whole time. <p>We don't dispute that, but we do know that sometimes, we talk about this stuff as if we care, and then we don't deliver. We don't follow through. We don't make the effort. It's not sustained. We lose interest. And then we say to ourselves, well, maybe nothing can be done, and we put up with it. And as a consequence, a lot of our kids get lost. And we can't allow that to happen. That's what the Promise Zones represent. <p>I want more kids to have the chance that Roger got. I want more kids to have the chance this country gave me. We should all want every one of our kids and their families to have a shot at success. If you are willing to dream big and work hard, you should grow up with the same opportunities in life as any other child living in any other place. <p>That's what we're fighting for. That's what America is about. So let's act. Let's make it happen this year. All right? <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"4" "\"Hi, everybody. Yesterday we learned that in 2013, our businesses created 2.2 million new jobs, including 87,000 last month. Our unemployment rate is the lowest it has been since October 2008. And across our broader economy, there are signs of progress. Our manufacturing and housing sectors are rebounding. Our energy, technology, and auto sectors are booming. Thanks in part to the reforms in the Affordable Care Act, health care costs now eat up less of our economy: Over the past 4 years, costs have grown at the slowest rate on record. And since I took office, we've cut our deficits by more than half. <p>Thanks to the hard work and sacrifice of the American people, our economy is growing stronger. But we know we've got more work to do together. Our success as a country depends on more than the success of our broader economy, it depends on the success of the American people. It depends on your ability to make ends meet, provide for your family, and with a little hard work, feel like you can get ahead. <p>So we've got to keep our economy growing and make sure more Americans have the opportunity to share in that growth. We've got to keep creating jobs that offer new opportunity and make sure those jobs offer the wages and benefits that let you rebuild some security. We've got more kids to educate and families to get covered with health insurance and an immigration system to fix. And we've got to make sure this recovery leaves no one behind. <p>So this will be a year of action. I'll keep doing everything I can to create new jobs and new opportunities for American families: with Congress&mdash;or on my own&mdash;and with everyone willing to play their part. And that action should begin by extending unemployment insurance for Americans who were laid off in the recession through no fault of their own. This vital economic lifeline helps people support their families while they look for a new job. And it demands responsibility in return by requiring that they prove they're actively looking for work. But before the holidays, Republicans in Congress just let that lifeline expire for 1.3 million Americans. And if this doesn't get fixed, it will actually hurt about 14 million Americans over the course of this year. Earlier this week, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate took the first steps toward making this right. But Congress needs to finish the job right away. More than 1 million Americans across the country will feel a little hope right away if they do. <p>Working folks are looking for the kind of stable, secure jobs that went overseas in the past couple of decades. So next week, I'll join companies and colleges and take action to boost the high-tech manufacturing that attracts the kind of good new jobs a growing middle class requires. <p>Business owners are ready to play their part and hire more workers. So next week, I'll be joined by college presidents as we lay out specific steps to help more young people go to college and graduate with the skills they need for today's new jobs. Later this month, I'll host CEOs at the White House to announce commitments we're making to put more of the long-term unemployed back to work. <p>And at the end of the month, in my State of the Union Address, I will mobilize the country around the national mission of making sure our economy offers everyone who works hard a fair shot at opportunity and success. As Americans, that's what we should expect. And after everything you've done to recover and rebuild from crisis this past 5 years, after all your hard work and sacrifice, that's what you deserve. <p>Thanks. Have a great weekend.\" "
"5" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello! Everybody, please have a seat. Have a seat. Welcome to the White House. Actually, for these guys, it is welcome back to the White House, after being back-toback world champions, the Miami Heat. <p>[<i>At this point, an audience member hollered</i>.] <p>[<i>Laughter</i>] Now, one of the cool things about this job is welcoming championship sports teams from across the sporting world to the White House. And usually, people enjoy coming to the White House. I have to say, I've never seen folks more excited than the Heat when they came last year. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, LeBron was so pumped up I thought he was going to give me a hug and knock me over, like the guy in \\"SportsCenter\\" who hit the half-court shot. But it was wonderful to see them then. It wonderful to see them back. <p>We've got some outstanding Members of Congress who are big fans of the Heat. They're from both parties, because we all know nothing brings people together like the Miami Heat. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's a&mdash;across the NBA there's just a unifying&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;sense about the Heat. <p>I want to congratulate Coach Spoelstra for the outstanding work that he does; legendary team president, Pat Riley, for his outstanding leadership; and all the coaches and players, members of the staff and crew to make a championship season. This group has now won twice, but it's gone to the finals three times. And sometimes, it feels like they're still fighting for a little respect. I can relate to that. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Last season, the Heat put together one of the most dominating regular seasons ever by a defending champion. They won a team record 66 games. At what point, they won 27 games straight, the second longest winning streak ever, extraordinarily impressive, almost as impressive as the Bulls' 72-win season. [<i>Laughter</i>] Riley and I were reminiscing about those Knicks years. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But as these guys know, winning a title is never easy. In the playoffs, the Pacers put them through seven bruising games. In the finals, the Spurs showed us all that they've got an awful lot of life left in them and one of the greatest players of all time and one of the greatest coaches of all time. In fact, San Antonio had the series all but wrapped up in game six. As you will recall, Miami was down five points, less than 30 seconds to go. The last 122 times that happened in the playoffs, the team that was down lost 122 times. <p>And then they brought out the ropes. And then Ray Allen saw them bring out the ropes. [<i>Laughter</i>] And with 5 seconds left, Chris Bosh gets an incredible offensive rebound, passes it out to Ray; Ray is backing up, he's got to jump forward; hits one of the most iconic shots of all time. And then he added a few choice words about the ropes, which we cannot&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash; which we cannot repeat here. But, Ray, I do want you to know that when you say those things on the court, like, people can read your lips, right? [<i>Laughter</i>] You do understand that? <p><i>Guard Ray Allen.</i> Yes. <p><i>The President.</i> Okay. All right. <p>So the Heat won game six, went on to win game seven, their third title in eight seasons. LeBron James earned his second straight Finals MVP to go along with four regular season MVPs in 5 years. Dwyane Wade, warrior that he is, played through a pair of injured knees, always came through when it mattered. Chris Bosh was there playing great defense, getting the rebound, hitting a clutch shot. Everybody on this team participated. <p>And from Ray's big shot to the contributions of Mario Chalmers, Shane Battier, Udonis Haslem, Birdman, Birdman's tattoos&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;Birdman's mohawk&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;the Heat showed us the kind of heart and determination it takes to be a champion. <p>And they also showed what it&mdash;what heart means off the court. Last year, they raised close to $2 million for local charities. Before this event, they met with some of our amazing wounded warriors over at Walter Reed, and we're proud to have some of those wounded warriors here in the audience here today. Honoring our troops isn't just something that they do when they come to the White House, it's something they do all year round with their Heat Home Strong initiative. And Pat Riley, I know, has been hugely invested in this, and we talked a little bit about this. His incredible admiration for our men and women in uniform, but more concretely, his willingness to do something about how we support them, I think, is a credit to the entire organization. <p>On top of that, Coach Spoelstra serves as a member of the NBA Fit team to encourage healthy habits among young people. I know Michelle is thankful for the support that many of these players have given to her \\"Let's Move!\\" initiative. I heard that all of you are getting ready to embarrass yourselves by singing some karaoke for Shane's education foundation. [<i>Laughter</i>] Just leave Al Green to the pros, people. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So bottom line is, outstanding athletes, outstanding organization, outstanding team, but also outstanding members of their community. And so we're very proud to have them back. We wish them great luck for the rest of the season, unless they're playing the Bulls. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And with that, I think we should take a picture, but we should make it quick before one of these guys starts yelling at Mario. [<i>Laughter</i>] All right. I mean, sometimes, it's just a bad pass, guys. It's not Mario's fault. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, but&mdash;I got your back, man. <p><i>Head Coach Erik Spoelstra.</i> Well, this is a great honor for the entire Miami Heat family. It does not get old. Okay? And what this is, is we put this together before the playoff run last year, and it was a covenant between all of us that we signed, that we would commit to each other, all the way to the end. So&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The President.</i> This is outstanding. <p><i>Coach Spoelstra.</i> So we have marks for each win, and it signified each player would mark the win for that game, and the final one was the team one. So this one, right here, you can see \\"44\\" and your name right there. <p><i>The President.</i> There you go. It was added to it. You know, you guys are winning me over a little bit. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Coach Spoelstra.</i> Getting there. Getting there. <p><i>The President</i>. I mean&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Coach Spoelstra. </i>We promise we'll put together another one for you and let you mark it this year. [<i>Laughter</i>] Okay? <p><i>The President.</i> Congratulations. Thank you.\" "
"6" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Raleigh! Thank you so much. Thank you. Well, it is good to be back in North Carolina. If you have a seat, go ahead and have a seat. Now, if you don't have a seat, don't. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>It is good to be here at the home of the Wolfpack. I want to thank your chancellor, Randy Woodson, for the introduction and the great work that he's doing on behalf of students all across the system. I want to recognize my Secretary of Energy, Ernie Moniz, who is here. Give him a big round of applause; he's doing good work. Your Governor, Pat McCrory, is here. The mayor of Raleigh, Nancy McFarlane. The mayor of Chapel Hill, Mark Kleinschmidt. The mayor of Durham, Bill Bell. And we've got Congressman Mike McIntyre doing great work. Your Senator, Kay Hagan, couldn't be here, but I wanted to thank her publicly for the great work she's doing. <p>And I want to thank all the students for coming out. We're doing this event nice and early so it doesn't run up against the Wake game. I've learned a few things as President, and one of them is not to compete with college basketball down here on Tobacco Road. You don't do that. <p>Now, this is actually my second stop in Raleigh-Durham. I just took a tour of a company called Vacon, where workers design the drives that power everything from elevators to the giant fans that help cool buildings like this one, although I think we're kind of saving money on this one&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;which is the smart thing to do. <p>So this company is making these engines and these systems more efficient, saving businesses big bucks on energy costs, improving the environment. Those savings get passed on to customers, puts money in people's pockets. And growing companies that need the products that Vacon makes, they're benefiting enormously. So it's a good-news story. But in a global economy, that company, just like every company in America, has to keep inventing and innovating in order to stay on the cutting edge. And that's where all of you come in. <p>Here at NC State, you know something about innovation. You've got one of the largest undergraduate engineering programs in the country. That's worth cheering for. I'm a lawyer by training, and that's nice. But we need more engineers. <p>So companies like Cisco and IBM, they come to this school when they're looking to hire because of the quality of the engineering program. And over at Centennial Campus, some very smart people experiment in state-of-the-art facilities to figure out everything from how to design better fireproof fabrics to how to better protect our computer systems. <p>So the reason I came here today is because we've got to do more to connect universities like NC State with companies like Vacon to make America the number-one place in the world to open new businesses and create new jobs. We want to do that here in North Carolina, and we want to do this all across America. <p>Now, it's been more than 5 years since a devastating recession cost this country millions of jobs, and it hurt North Carolina pretty tough. But everyone here knows that even before the recession hit, the middle class had been hitting it&mdash;getting hit on the chin for years before that. Here in North Carolina, factories were shutting their doors; jobs were getting shipped overseas. Wages and incomes were flatlining so even if you had a job, you didn't see your standard of living going up very much. Meanwhile, the cost of everything from college tuition to groceries did go up. <p>So when I took office, we decided to focus on the hard work of rebuilding our economy on a new foundation for growth and prosperity and to make sure that everybody had a chance to get ahead. And thanks to the hard work and sacrifice of the American people, the good news is, the economy is growing stronger. Our businesses have now created more than 8 million new jobs since we hit bottom. Because of an all-of-the-above strategy for American energy, for the first time in nearly two decades, we produce more oil here in the United States than we buy from the rest of the world. That hasn't happened in a very long time. We now generate more renewable energy than ever before, more natural gas than anybody on the planet. We're lowering energy costs, reducing pollution. <p>Health care costs are growing at their slowest rate in 50 years. For the first time since the 1990s, health care costs eat up a smaller chunk of our economy, and part of that, yes, has to do with the Affordable Care Act. And so over time, that means bigger paychecks for middle class families, bigger savings for companies that are looking to hire. And along with all this, since I took office, we've cut our deficits by more than half. <p>So we've made progress. And that's what I mean when I say this can be a breakthrough year for America. The pieces are all there to start bringing back more of the jobs that we've lost over the past decade. A lot of companies around the world are starting to talk about bringing jobs back to the United States, bringing jobs back to places like North Carolina, partly because we got cheap energy costs, we've got the best workers in the world, we've got the best university systems in the world, and we've got the largest market in the world. <p>So the pieces are there to restore some of the ground that the middle class has lost in recent decades, start raising wages for American families. But it requires us to take action. This has to be a year of action. <p>And here in North Carolina, you're doing your part to create good jobs that pay good wages. Congress has to do its part too, because restoring the American Dream of opportunity for everyone who's willing to work for it is something that should unite the country. That shouldn't divide the country. That's what we should be aspiring to: that everybody has a shot if they're willing to work hard and take responsibility. <p>So in the short term, one thing Congress could do is listen to the majority of the American people and restore the unemployment insurance for Americans who need it. And just&mdash;let me just make an aside here: North Carolina still has a higher than average unemployment rate, so this is important to this State. Folks aren't looking for a handout. They're not looking for special treatment. There are a lot of people who are sending out r&eacute;sum&eacute;s every single day, but the market&mdash;the job market is still tough in pockets around the country, and people need support, a little help, so they can look after their families while they're looking for a new job. So Congress should do the right thing and extend this vital lifeline for millions of Americans. <p>Of course, that's just short term. Long term, the challenge of making sure everybody who works hard can get ahead in today's economy is so important that we can't wait for Congress to solve it. Where I can act on my own without Congress, I'm going to do so. <p>And today I'm here to act: to help make Raleigh-Durham and America a magnet for the good, high-tech manufacturing jobs that a growing middle class requires and that is&mdash;are going to continue to keep this country on the cutting edge. <p>So we've already got some success to build on. Manufacturing is a bright spot in this economy. For decades, we'd been losing manufacturing jobs. But now our manufacturers have added, over the last 4 years, more than 550,000 new jobs, including almost 80,000 manufacturing jobs in the last 5 months alone. So we want to keep that trend going. We want to build on the kind of work that's being done in places like NC State to develop technology that leads to new jobs and entire new industries. <p>So a little over a year ago, we launched America's first manufacturing innovation institute in Youngstown, Ohio. And what it was is a partnership; it includes companies and colleges. They came up with a joint plan. They were focusing on developing 3-D printing technology and training workers with the skills required to master that technology. <p>Now, that was a great start. We got one going, and some of the folks from Youngstown are here today, and we congratulate them on the great work they're doing. But here's the problem: We created one. In Germany, they've already got about 60 of these manufacturing innovation hubs. So we've got some catching up to do. I don't want the next big job-creating discovery, the research and technology to be in Germany or China or Japan. I want it to be right here in the United States of America. I want it to be right here in North Carolina. <p>So what I said was, in my State of the Union Address last year, I said to Congress, let's set up a network of at least 15 of these manufacturing hubs all across America, focusing on different opportunities where we can get manufacturing innovation going, create jobs, make sure that the research is tied to businesses that are actually hiring. And those synergies are going to grow the economy regionally and ultimately across the whole country. <p>And last summer, as part of our push to create middle class jobs, I said, you know what, let's not settle on 15, let's just go ahead and do 45. Republicans and Democrats in the House and the Senate introduced bills that would get this going. That's good. But they haven't passed the bills yet. So I want to encourage them to continue to pass the bills that would create 45 of these manufacturing hubs. In the meantime, I'm directing my administration to move forward where we can on our own. <p>So today, after almost a year of competition, I'm pleased to announce America's newest high-tech manufacturing hub&mdash;which is going to be focused on the next generation of power electronics&mdash;is going to be based right here in Raleigh, North Carolina. That's good news. That's good news. [<i>Applause</i>] So&mdash;that's good news. It's great. <p>So just like the hub in Youngstown, what we're calling the Next Generation Power Electronics Innovation Institute is bringing together leading companies, universities, and Federal research all together under one roof. Folks at this hub are going to develop what are called wide bandgap semiconductors. <p>Now, I was just schooled on all this. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm not sure that I'm fully qualified to describe the technical elements of this. Raise your hand if you know what it is. [<i>Laughter</i>] See, we have some. [<i>Laughter</i>] For all you nonengineers out there, here's what it means in the simplest terms. Semiconductors obviously are at the heart of every piece of the electronics that we use every day: your smartphone, your television set, these days everything. Public research helped develop them decades ago, and then that research allowed commercialization, new products, new services, and obviously not only improved the economy, but greatly enhanced our lives. So we want companies to run with the ball also, but first, we've got to make sure that we're also doing the research and linking it up to those companies. <p>Wide bandgap semiconductors, they're special because they lose up to 90 percent less power; they can operate at higher temperatures than normal semiconductors. So that means they can make everything from cell phones to industrial motors, to electric cars smaller, faster, cheaper. There are going to be still applications for the traditional semiconductors, but these can be focused on certain areas that will vastly improve energy efficiency, vastly improve the quality of our lives. And the country that figures out how to do this first, and the companies that figure how to do this best, they're the ones that are going to attract the jobs that come with it. <p>So this manufacturing hub, right here, focused in North Carolina&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> Go Pack! <p><i>The President.</i> Go Pack! [<i>Applause</i>] This hub is going to make it easier for these wide bandgap semiconductors to go from the drawing board to the factory floor, to the store shelves&mdash;or not necessarily the store shelves, because what I just saw, for example, were these really big pieces of equipment that are attached to utility companies or help windmills translate the power they're generating actually in getting transmitted to where they're going to be finally used. It's going to bring together chip designers and manufacturers with companies like Vacon and Delphi that stand to benefit from these new technologies. And this will help big companies, but it's also going to help small companies, because they're going to be able to use equipment they otherwise wouldn't be able to afford to test and prototype new products. And of course, American workers will be able to come right here to North Carolina to learn the skills that companies are looking for. And the next generation of manufacturing will be an American revolution. <p>So in the coming weeks, we're going to be launching two more of these innovation hubs; I&mdash;we've already got them all planned out. One is going to focus on digital design and manufacturing; another is going to be developing lightweight metals that could transform everything from wind turbines to military vehicles. And together, they're going to help build new partnerships in areas that show potential. They'll help to lift up our communities. They'll help spark the technology and research that will create the new industries, the good jobs required for folks to punch their ticket into the middle class. <p>And that's what America is all about. We have always been about research, innovation, and then commercializing that research and innovation so that everybody can benefit. And then we start selling our stuff all around the world, we start exporting it. And we create good jobs, and middle class families then are able to buy the products that result from this innovation. And you get a virtuous cycle where everybody is doing better and nobody is left behind. And that's what we can do if we pull together the way those companies and universities have pulled together as part of this bid. <p>Now, this is going to be a long haul. We're not going to turn things around overnight. A lot of jobs were lost in the textile industry and furniture-making. But the great news is, is that ultimately, because our people are good and smart and hard-working and willing to take risks, we are going to be able to start bringing those jobs back to America. And that's what we do. When the times get tough, we don't give up. We get up. We innovate. We adapt. We keep going. We look to the future. <p>And I want all of you to know, North Carolina, that as long as we keep working together and fighting together and doing what it takes to widen the circle of opportunity for more Americans so nobody is left behind, if you work hard, if you are responsible, then you can go out there, get a skill, train yourself, find a job, support a family. If we work together, and that's our focus, there's nothing we can't achieve. There's no limit to how far we can go. <p>So congratulations, North Carolina State. Congratulations, Raleigh. Let's get to work. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"7" "\"Thank you, everybody. Everybody, please have a seat. Have a seat. Welcome to the White House, everybody. And let me begin by thanking Troy and sharing his remarkable story. I could not be more inspired by what he's accomplished and can't wait to see what he's going to accomplish in the future. <p>My wife, it's hard to speak after her. [<i>Laughter</i>] The&mdash;we were in the back, and Gene Sperling, who did extraordinary work putting this whole summit together, said, \\"Everybody is so excited that Michelle is here.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] I said, well, what about me? [<i>Laughter</i>] But you should be excited, her being here, because she brings a passion and a body of experience and a passion to this issue that is extraordinary. And I couldn't be prouder of the work she's already done and the work, I know, that she's going to keep on doing around these issues. <p>She did leave one thing out of her speech, and that is, it's her birthday tomorrow. [<i>Applause</i>] So I want everybody to just keep that in mind. <p>Now, we are here for one purpose: We want to make sure more young people have the chance to earn a higher education. And in the 21st-century economy, we all understand it's never been more important. <p>The good news is, is that our economy is steadily growing and strengthening after the worst recession in a generation. So we've created more than 8 million new jobs. Manufacturing is growing, led by a booming auto industry. Thanks to some key public investments in advances like affordable energy and research and development, what we've seen is not only an energy revolution in this country that bodes well for our future, but in areas like health care, for example, we've slowed the growth of health care costs in ways that a lot of people wouldn't have anticipated as recently as 5 or 10 years ago. <p>So there are a lot of good things going on in the economy. And businesses are starting to invest. In fact, what we're seeing are businesses overseas starting to say, instead of outsourcing, let's insource back into the U.S. <p>All that bodes well for our future. Here's the thing though: We don't grow just for the sake of growth. We grow so that it translates into a growing middle class, people getting jobs, people being able to support their families, and people being able to pass something on to the next generation. We want to restore the essential promise of opportunity and upward mobility that's at the heart of America, the notion that if you work hard, you can get ahead, you can improve your situation in life, you can make something of yourself, the same essential story that Troy so eloquently told about himself. <p>And the fact is, it's been getting harder to do that for a lot of people. It is harder for folks to start in one place and move up that ladder, and that was true long before the recession hit. And that's why I've said that in 2014, we have to consider this a year of action, not just to grow the economy, not just to increase GDP, not just to make sure that corporations are profitable and the stock market's doing well and the financial system is stable. We've also got to make sure that that growth is broad based and that everybody has a chance to access that growth and take advantage of it. We've got to make sure that we're creating new jobs and that the wages and benefits that go along with those jobs can support a family. We have to make sure that there are new ladders of opportunity into the middle class and that those ladders&mdash;the rungs on those ladders are solid and accessible for more people. <p>Now, I'm going to be working with Congress where I can to accomplish this, but I'm also going to act on my own if Congress is deadlocked. I've got a pen to take executive actions where Congress won't, and I've got a telephone to rally folks around the country on this mission. <p>And today is a great example of how, without a whole bunch of new legislation, we can advance this agenda. We've got philanthropists and business leaders here. We've got leaders of innovative non-for-profits. We've got college presidents, from State universities and historically Black colleges to Ivy League universities and community colleges. And today more than 100 colleges and 40 organizations are announcing new commitments to help more young people not only go to, but graduate from college. And that's an extraordinary accomplishment, and we didn't pass a bill to do it. <p>Everybody here is participating, I believe, because you know that college graduation has never been more valuable than it is today. Unemployment for Americans with a college degree is more than a third lower than the national average; incomes, twice as high as those without a high school diploma. College is not the only path to success. We've got to make sure that more Americans of all age are getting the skills that they need to access the jobs that are out there right now. But more than ever, a college degree is the surest path to a stable, middle class life. <p>And higher education speaks to something more than that. The premise that we're all created equal is the opening line in our American story. And we don't promise equal outcomes; we've strived to deliver equal opportunity: the idea that success does not depend on being born into wealth or privilege, it depends on effort and merit. You can be born into nothing and work your way into something extraordinary. And to a kid that goes to college, maybe like Michelle, the first in his or her family, that means everything. <p>And the fact is, is if we hadn't made a commitment as a country to send more of our people to college, Michelle, me, maybe a few of you would not be here today. My grandfather wasn't rich, but when he came home from the war he got the chance to study on the GI bill. I grew up with a single mom. She had me when she was 18 years old. There are a lot of circumstances where that might have waylaid her education for good. But there were structures in place that allowed her then to go on and get a Ph.D. Michelle's dad was a shift worker at the city waterplant; mom worked as a secretary. They didn't go to college. But there were structures in place that allowed Michelle to take advantage of those opportunities. <p>Now, as Michelle mentioned, our parents and grandparents made sure we knew that we'd have to work for it, that nobody was going to hand us something, that education was not a passive enterprise, it's&mdash;you just tip your head over and somebody pours education into your ear. You've got to work for it. And I've told the story of my mother: When I was living overseas, she'd wake me up before dawn to do correspondence courses in English before I went to the other school. I wasn't that happy about it. But with that hard work&mdash;but also with scholarships, also with student loans, and with support programs in place&mdash;we were able to go to some of the best colleges in the country even though we didn't have a lot of money. Every child in America should have the same chance. <p>So over the last 5 years, we've worked hard in a variety of ways to improve these mechanisms to get young people where they need to be and to knock down barriers that are preventing them from getting better prepared for the economies that they're going to face. <p>We've called for clearer, higher standards in our schools, and 45 States and the District of Columbia have answered that call so far. We've set a goal of training 100,000 new math and science teachers over the next 10 years, and the private sector has already committed to help train 40,000. We've taken new steps to help students stay in school, and today, the high school dropout rate is the lowest it has been in 40 years, something that's rarely advertised. The dropout rate among Hispanic students, by the way, has been cut in half over the last decade. <p>But we still have to hire more good teachers and pay them better. We still have to do more training and development and ensure that the curriculums are ones that maximize the chances for student success. When young people are properly prepared in high school, we've got to make sure that they can afford to go to college. So we took on a student loan system that was giving billions of dollars of taxpayer dollars to big banks, and we said, let's give that money directly to students. As a consequence, we were able to double the grant aid that goes to millions of students. And today, more young people are earning college degrees than ever before. <p>So we've made progress there, but as I've discussed with some of you, we're still going to have to make sure that rising tuition doesn't price the middle class out of a college education. The Government is not going to be able to continually subsidize a system in which higher education inflation is going up faster than health care inflation. So I've laid out a plan to bring down costs and make sure that students are not saddled with debt before they even start out in life. <p>Even after all these steps that we've taken over the last 5 years, we still have a long way to go to unlock the doors of higher education to more Americans and especially lower income Americans. We're going to have to make sure they're ready to walk through those doors. The added value of a college diploma has nearly doubled since Michelle and I were undergraduates. Unfortunately, today, only 30 percent of low-income students enroll in college right after high school, and far worse, by their midtwenties, only 9 percent earn a bachelor's degree. <p>So if we as a nation can expand opportunity and reach out to those young people and help them not just go to college, but graduate from college or university, it could have a transformative effect. There is this huge cohort of talent that we're not tapping. <p>Now, what this meeting today tells me is we've got dedicated citizens across the country who are ready to stand up and meet this challenge. And what I want to really do is highlight some of the commitments that have been made here today. So we know that not enough low-income students are taking the steps required to prepare for college. That's why I'm glad the University of Chicago, my neighbor, and the place where Michelle and I both worked in the past, is announcing a $10 million College Success Initiative that will reach 10,000 high schools over the next 5 years. It's why iMentor, a mentoring program that began 15 years ago with just 49 students in the South Bronx, has committed to matching 20,000 new students with mentoring in more than 20 States over the next 5 years. <p>We also know that too many students don't apply to the schools that are right for them. They may sometimes underestimate where they could succeed, where they could go. There may be a mismatch in terms of what their aspirations are and the nature of what's offered at the school that's close by. And they kind of assume, well, that's my only option. So UVA, for example, is going to experiment with new ways to contact high-achieving, low-income students directly, encourage them to apply. Organizations like the College Board are going to work with colleges to make it easier for students to apply to more schools for free. <p>I know sometimes for those of you in university administrations, the perception may be that a hundred-dollar application fee is not a big deal. But for a lot of these students, that's enough of a barrier that they just don't end up applying. <p>Number three, we know that when it comes to college advising and preparing for tests like the ACT and the SAT, low-income kids are not on a level playing field. We call these standardized tests; they're not standardized. Malia and Sasha, by the time they're in seventh grade at Sidwell School here, are already getting all kinds of advice and this and that and the other. The degree of preparation that many of the&mdash;our kids here are getting in advance of actually taking this test tilts the playing field. It's not fair. And it's gotten worse. <p>I was telling Michelle, when I was taking the SAT, I just barely remembered to bring a pencil. I mean, that's how much preparation I did. [<i>Laughter</i>] But the truth of the matter is, is that we don't have a level playing field when it comes to so-called standardized tests. So we've got a young man here today named Lawrence Harris who knows this better than most. Lawrence went to the University of Georgia, and like a lot of first-generation college students, it wasn't easy for him. He had to take remedial classes. He had to work two part-time jobs to make ends meet. At one point, he had to leave school for a year while he helped support his mom and his baby brother. Those are the kinds of just day-to-day challenges that a lot of these young people with enormous talent are having to overcome. Now, he stuck with it. He graduated. <p>But now he's giving back. He's made it his mission to help other young people like him graduate, as a college adviser at Clarke Central High School in Athens, Georgia. And today the National College Advising Corps, the program that placed Lawrence in Clarke Central, is announcing plans to add 129 more advisers who will serve more than 80,000 students over the next 3 years. <p>Finally, we know that once low-income students arrive on campus&mdash;Michelle, I think, spoke eloquently to her own personal experience on this&mdash;they often learn that even if they were at the top of their high school class, they still have a lot of catching up to do with respect to some of their peers in the classroom. Bunker Hill Community College is addressing this by giving more incoming students the chance to start catching up over the summer before their freshman year. And we've got 22 States and the District of Columbia who have joined together in a commitment to dramatically increase the number of students who complete college-level math and English their first year. <p>So these are just a sampling of the more than 100 commitments that your organizations and colleges are making here today. And that's an extraordinary first step. But we've got more colleges and universities than this around the country. We've got more business leaders around the country and philanthropies around the country. And so we have to think of this as just the beginning; we want to do something like this again, and we want even more colleges and universities and businesses and non-for-profits to take part. <p>For folks who are watching this who were not able be here today, we want you here next time. Start thinking about your commitments now. We want you to join us. For those who were able to make commitments today, I want to thank you for doing your part to make better the life of our country. Because what you're doing here today means that there are a bunch of young people, like Troy and like Michelle and like me, who suddenly may be able to see a whole new world open up before&mdash;that they didn't realize was there. <p>So I'll end with a great story that, I think, speaks to this. There's a former teacher here today named Nick Ehrmann. Where's Nick? All right, so here's Nick right here. Five years ago, Nick founded a New York City nonprofit called Blue Engine, and they recruit recent college graduates to work as teaching assistants in public high schools that serve low-income communities, teaming up to help students build the skills they need to enter college ready for college. <p>The first group of students to work with those teaching assistants are seniors now. One of them, Estiven Rodriguez, where&mdash;who also is here today. Where is he? There he is, good-looking young guy right here. [<i>Laughter</i>] Could not speak a word of English when he moved to the United States from the Dominican Republic at age of 9. Didn't speak much more English by the time he entered sixth grade. <p>Today, with the support of a tightly knit school community, he's one of the top students in his senior class at Washington Heights Expeditionary Learning Schools, or WHEELS. Last month, he and his classmates put on their WHEELS sweatshirts, unfurled a banner, waved flags and marched down the streets of Washington Heights in New York City through cheering crowds. You would have thought it was the Macy's parade. [<i>Laughter</i>] But the crowds on the sidewalk were parents and teachers and neighbors. The flags were college pennants. The march was to the post office, where they mailed in their college applications. And Estiven just heard back. This son of a factory worker who didn't speak much English just 6 years ago won a competitive scholarship to attend Dickinson College this fall. <p>So everywhere you go, you've got stories like Estiven's, and you've got stories like Troy's. But we don't want these to be the exceptions, we want these to be the rule. That's what we owe our young people, and that's what we owe this country. We all have a stake in restoring that fundamental American idea that says: It doesn't matter where you start, what matters is where you end up. And as parents and as teachers and as business and philanthropic and political leaders&mdash;and as citizens&mdash;we've all got a role to play. <p>So I'm going to spend the next 3 years as President playing mine. And I look forward to working with you on the same team to make this happen. Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"8" "\"Thank you so much. Please have a seat. At the dawn of our Republic, a small, secret surveillance committee born out of the Sons of Liberty was established in Boston. And the group's members included Paul Revere. At night, they would patrol the streets, reporting back any signs that the British were preparing raids against America's early patriots. <p>Throughout American history, intelligence has helped secure our country and our freedoms. In the Civil War, Union balloons reconnaissance tracked the size of Confederate armies by counting the number of campfires. In World War II, code breakers gave us insights into Japanese war plans, and when Patton marched across Europe, intercepted communications helped save the lives of his troops. After the war, the rise of the Iron Curtain and nuclear weapons only increased the need for sustained intelligence gathering. And so, in the early days of the Cold War, President Truman created the National Security Agency, or NSA, to give us insights into the Soviet bloc and provide our leaders with information they needed to confront aggression and avert catastrophe. <p>Throughout this evolution, we benefited from both our Constitution and our traditions of limited government. U.S. intelligence agencies were anchored in a system of checks and balances, with oversight from elected leaders and protections for ordinary citizens. Meanwhile, totalitarian states like East Germany offered a cautionary tale of what could happen when vast, unchecked surveillance turned citizens into informers and persecuted people for what they said in the privacy of their own homes. <p>In fact, even the United States proved not to be immune to the abuse of surveillance. And in the 1960s, Government spied on civil rights leaders and critics of the Vietnam War. And partly in response to these revelations, additional laws were established in the 1970s to ensure that our intelligence capabilities could not be misused against our citizens. In the long, twilight struggle against communism, we had been reminded that the very liberties that we sought to preserve could not be sacrificed at the altar of national security. <p>Now, if the fall of the Soviet Union left America without a competing superpower, emerging threats from terrorist groups and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction placed new and in some ways more complicated demands on our intelligence agencies. Globalization and the Internet made these threats more acute, as technology erased borders and empowered individuals to project great violence as well as great good. Moreover, these new threats raised new legal and new policy questions. For while few doubted the legitimacy of spying on hostile states, our framework of laws was not fully adapted to prevent terrorist attacks by individuals acting on their own or acting in small, ideological&mdash;ideologically driven groups on behalf of a foreign power. <p>The horror of September 11 brought all these issues to the fore. Across the political spectrum, Americans recognized that we had to adapt to a world in which a bomb could be built in a basement and our electric grid could be shut down by operators an ocean away. We were shaken by the signs we had missed leading up to the attacks: how the hijackers had made phone calls to known extremists and traveled to suspicious places. So we demanded that our intelligence community improve its capabilities and that law enforcement change practices to focus more on preventing attacks before they happen than prosecuting terrorists after an attack. <p>It is hard to overstate the transformation America's intelligence community had to go through after 9/11. Our agencies suddenly needed to do far more than the traditional mission of monitoring hostile powers and gathering information for policymakers. Instead, they were now asked to identify and target plotters in some of the most remote parts of the world and to anticipate the actions of networks that, by their very nature, cannot be easily penetrated with spies or informants. <p>And it is a testimony to the hard work and dedication of the men and women of our intelligence community that over the past decade, we've made enormous strides in fulfilling this mission. Today, new capabilities allow intelligence agencies to track who a terrorist is in contact with and follow the trail of his travel or his funding. New laws allow information to be collected and shared more quickly and effectively between Federal agencies and State and local law enforcement. Relationships with foreign intelligence services have expanded, and our capacity to repel cyber attacks have been strengthened. And taken together, these efforts have prevented multiple attacks and saved innocent lives, not just here in the United States, but around the globe. <p>And yet, in our rush to respond to a very real and novel set of threats, the risk of Government overreach&mdash;the possibility that we lose some of our core liberties in pursuit of security&mdash;also became more pronounced. We saw, in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, our Government engaged in enhanced interrogation techniques that contradicted our values. As a Senator, I was critical of several practices, such as warrantless wiretaps. And all too often new authorities were instituted without adequate public debate. <p>Through a combination of action by the courts, increased congressional oversight, and adjustments by the previous administration, some of the worst excesses that emerged after 9/11 were curbed by the time I took office. But a variety of factors have continued to complicate America's efforts to both defend our Nation and uphold our civil liberties. <p>First, the same technological advances that allow U.S. intelligence agencies to pinpoint an Al Qaida cell in Yemen or an e-mail between two terrorists in the Sahel also mean that many routine communications around the world are within our reach. And at a time when more and more of our lives are digital, that prospect is disquieting for all of us. <p>Second, the combination of increased digital information and powerful supercomputers offers intelligence agencies the possibility of sifting through massive amounts of bulk data to identify patterns or pursue leads that may thwart impending threats. It's a powerful tool. But the Government collection and storage of such bulk data also creates a potential for abuse. <p>Third, the legal safeguards that restrict surveillance against U.S. persons without a warrant do not apply to foreign persons overseas. This is not unique to America; few, if any, spy agencies around the world constrain their activities beyond their own borders. And the whole point of intelligence is to obtain information that is not publicly available. But America's capabilities are unique, and the power of new technologies means that there are fewer and fewer technical constraints on what we can do. That places a special obligation on us to ask tough questions about what we should do. <p>And finally, intelligence agencies cannot function without secrecy, which makes their work less subject to public debate. Yet there is an inevitable bias, not only within the intelligence community, but among all of us who are responsible for national security, to collect more information about the world, not less. So in the absence of institutional requirements for regular debate and oversight that is public as well as private or classified, the danger of Government overreach becomes more acute. And this is particularly true when surveillance technology and our reliance on digital information is evolving much faster than our laws. <p>For all these reasons, I maintained a healthy skepticism toward our surveillance programs after I became President. I ordered that our programs be reviewed by my national security team and our lawyers, and in some cases, I ordered changes in how we did business. We increased oversight and auditing, including new structures aimed at compliance. Improved rules were proposed by the Government and approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. And we sought to keep Congress continually updated on these activities. <p>What I did not do is stop these programs wholesale, not only because I felt that they made us more secure, but also because nothing in that initial review and nothing that I have learned since indicated that our intelligence community has sought to violate the law or is cavalier about the civil liberties of their fellow citizens. <p>To the contrary, in an extraordinarily difficult job&mdash;one in which actions are second-guessed, success is unreported, and failure can be catastrophic&mdash;the men and women of the intelligence community, including the NSA, consistently follow protocols designed to protect the privacy of ordinary people. They're not abusing authorities in order to listen to your private phone calls or read your e-mails. When mistakes are made&mdash;which is inevitable in any large and complicated human enterprise&mdash;they correct those mistakes. Laboring in obscurity, often unable to discuss their work even with family and friends, the men and women at the NSA know that if another 9/11 or massive cyber attack occurs, they will be asked, by Congress and the media, why they failed to connect the dots. What sustains those who work at NSA and our other intelligence agencies through all these pressures is the knowledge that their professionalism and dedication play a central role in the defense of our Nation. <p>Now, to say that our intelligence community follows the law and is staffed by patriots is not to suggest that I or others in my administration felt complacent about the potential impact of these programs. Those of us who hold office in America have a responsibility to our Constitution, and while I was confident in the integrity of those who lead our intelligence community, it was clear to me in observing our intelligence operations on a regular basis that changes in our technological capabilities were raising new questions about the privacy safeguards currently in place. <p>Moreover, after an extended review of our use of drones in the fight against terrorist networks, I believed a fresh examination of our surveillance programs was a necessary next step in our effort to get off the open-ended war footing that we've maintained since 9/11. And for these reasons, I indicated in a speech at the National Defense University last May that we needed a more robust public discussion about the balance between security and liberty. Of course, what I did not know at the time is that within weeks of my speech, an avalanche of unauthorized disclosures would spark controversies at home and abroad that have continued to this day. <p>Now, given the fact of an open investigation, I'm not going to dwell on Mr. Snowden's actions or his motivations. I will say that our Nation's defense depends in part on the fidelity of those entrusted with our Nation's secrets. If any individual who objects to Government policy can take it into their own hands to publicly disclose classified information, then we will not be able to keep our people safe or conduct foreign policy. Moreover, the sensational way in which these disclosures have come out has often shed more heat than light, while revealing methods to our adversaries that could impact our operations in ways that we may not fully understand for years to come. <p>Regardless of how we got here, though, the task before us now is greater than simply repairing the damage done to our operations or preventing more disclosures from taking place in the future. Instead, we have to make some important decisions about how to protect ourselves and sustain our leadership in the world, while upholding the civil liberties and privacy protections that our ideals and our Constitution require. We need to do so not only because it is right, but because the challenges posed by threats like terrorism and proliferation and cyber attacks are not going away any time soon. They are going to continue to be a major problem. And for our intelligence community to be effective over the long haul, we must maintain the trust of the American people and people around the world. <p>This effort will not be completed overnight, and given the pace of technological change, we shouldn't expect this to be the last time America has this debate. But I want the American people to know that the work has begun. Over the last 6 months, I created an outside Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies to make recommendations for reform. I consulted with the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board created by Congress. I've listened to foreign partners, privacy advocates, and industry leaders. My administration has spent countless hours considering how to approach intelligence in this era of diffuse threats and technological revolution. So before outlining specific changes that I've ordered, let me make a few broad observations that have emerged from this process. <p>First, everyone who has looked at these problems, including skeptics of existing programs, recognizes that we have real enemies and threats and that intelligence serves a vital role in confronting them. We cannot prevent terrorist attacks or cyber threats without some capability to penetrate digital communications, whether it's to unravel a terrorist plot, to intercept malware that targets a stock exchange, to make sure air traffic control systems are not compromised, or to ensure that hackers do not empty your bank accounts. We are expected to protect the American people; that requires us to have capabilities in this field. <p>Moreover, we cannot unilaterally disarm our intelligence agencies. There is a reason why BlackBerrys and iPhones are not allowed in the White House Situation Room. We know that the intelligence services of other countries&mdash;including some who feign surprise over the Snowden disclosures&mdash;are constantly probing our Government and private sector networks and accelerating programs to listen to our conversations and intercept our e-mails and compromise our systems. We know that. <p>Meanwhile, a number of countries&mdash;including some who have loudly criticized the NSA&mdash;privately acknowledge that America has special responsibilities as the world's only superpower, that our intelligence capabilities are critical to meeting these responsibilities, and that they themselves have relied on the information we obtain to protect their own people. <p>Second, just as ardent civil libertarians recognize the need for robust intelligence capabilities, those with responsibilities for our national security readily acknowledge the potential for abuse as intelligence capabilities advance and more and more private information is digitized. After all, the folks at NSA and other intelligence agencies are our neighbors. They're our friends and family. They've got electronic bank and medical records like everybody else. They have kids on Facebook and Instagram, and they know, more than most of us, the vulnerabilities to privacy that exist in a world where transactions are recorded and e-mail and text and messages are stored and even our movements can increasingly be tracked through the GPS on our phones. <p>Third, there was a recognition by all who participated in these reviews that the challenges to our privacy do not come from Government alone. Corporations of all shapes and sizes track what you buy, store and analyze our data, and use it for commercial purposes; that's how those targeted ads pop up on your computer and your smartphone periodically. But all of us understand that the standards for Government surveillance must be higher. Given the unique power of the state, it is not enough for leaders to say, \\"Trust us, we won't abuse the data we collect.\\" For history has too many examples when that trust has been breached. Our system of Government is built on the premise that our liberty cannot depend on the good intentions of those in power, it depends on the law to constrain those in power. <p>I make these observations to underscore that the basic values of most Americans when it comes to questions of surveillance and privacy converge a lot more than the crude characterizations that have emerged over the last several months. Those who are troubled by our existing programs are not interested in repeating the tragedy of 9/11, and those who defend these programs are not dismissive of civil liberties. <p>The challenge is getting the details right, and that is not simple. In fact, during the course of our review, I have often reminded myself I would not be where I am today were it not for the courage of dissidents like Dr. King who were spied upon by their own Government. And as President, a President who looks at intelligence every morning, I also can't help but be reminded that America must be vigilant in the face of threats. <p>Fortunately, by focusing on facts and specifics rather than speculation and hypotheticals, this review process has given me&mdash;and hopefully, the American people&mdash;some clear direction for change. And today I can announce a series of concrete and substantial reforms that my administration intends to adopt administratively or will seek to codify with Congress. <p>First, I have approved a new Presidential directive for our signals intelligence activities both at home and abroad. This guidance will strengthen executive branch oversight of our intelligence activities. It will ensure that we take into account our security requirements, but also our alliances; our trade and investment relationships, including the concerns of American companies; and our commitment to privacy and basic liberties. And we will review decisions about intelligence priorities and sensitive targets on an annual basis so that our actions are regularly scrutinized by my senior national security team. <p>Second, we will reform programs and procedures in place to provide greater transparency to our surveillance activities and fortify the safeguards that protect the privacy of U.S. persons. Since we began this review, including information being released today, we've declassified over 40 opinions and orders of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which provides judicial review of some of our most sensitive intelligence activities, including the section 702 program targeting foreign individuals overseas and the section 215 telephone metadata program. <p>And going forward, I'm directing the Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with the Attorney General, to annually review for the purposes of declassification any future opinions of the Court with broad privacy implications and to report to me and to Congress on these efforts. To ensure that the Court hears a broader range of privacy perspectives, I am also calling on Congress to authorize the establishment of a panel of advocates from outside Government to provide an independent voice in significant cases before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Third, we will provide additional protections for activities conducted under section 702, which allows the Government to intercept the communications of foreign targets overseas who have information that's important for our national security. Specifically, I am asking the Attorney General and DNI to institute reforms that place additional restrictions on Government's ability to retain, search, and use in criminal cases communications between Americans and foreign citizens incidentally collected under section 702. <p>Fourth, in investigating threats, the FBI also relies on what's called national security letters, which can require companies to provide specific and limited information to the Government without disclosing the orders to the subject of the investigation. Now, these are cases in which it's important that the subject of the investigation, such as a possible terrorist or spy, isn't tipped off. But we can and should be more transparent in how Government uses this authority. <p>I've therefore directed the Attorney General to amend how we use national security letters so that this secrecy will not be indefinite, so that it will terminate within a fixed time unless the Government demonstrates a real need for further secrecy. We will also enable communications providers to make public more information than ever before about the orders that they have received to provide data to the Government. <p>This brings me to the program that has generated the most controversy these past few months: the bulk collection of telephone records under section 215. Let me repeat what I said when this story first broke: This program does not involve the content of phone calls or the names of people making calls. Instead, it provides a record of phone numbers and the times and lengths of calls, metadata that can be queried if and when we have a reasonable suspicion that a particular number is linked to a terrorist organization. <p>Why is this necessary? The program grew out of a desire to address a gap identified after 9/11. One of the 9/11 hijackers, Khalid al-Mihdhar, made a phone call from San Diego to a known Al Qaida safe house in Yemen. NSA saw that call, but it could not see that the call was coming from an individual already in the United States. The telephone metadata program under section 215 was designed to map the communications of terrorists so we can see who they may be in contact with as quickly as possible. And this capability could also prove valuable in a crisis. For example, if a bomb goes off in one of our cities and law enforcement is racing to determine whether a network is poised to conduct additional attacks, time is of the essence. Being able to quickly review phone connections to assess whether a network exists is critical to that effort. <p>In sum, the program does not involve the NSA examining the phone records of ordinary Americans. Rather, it consolidates these records into a database that the Government can query if it has a specific lead, a consolidation of phone records that the companies already retained for business purposes. The Review Group turned up no indication that this database has been intentionally abused. And I believe it is important that the capability that this program is designed to meet is preserved. <p>Having said that, I believe critics are right to point out that without proper safeguards, this type of program could be used to yield more information about our private lives and open the door to more intrusive bulk collection programs in the future. They're also right to point out that although the telephone bulk collection program was subject to oversight by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and has been reauthorized repeatedly by Congress, it has never been subject to vigorous public debate. For all these reasons, I believe we need a new approach. I am therefore ordering a transition that will end the section 215 bulk metadata program as it currently exists and establish a mechanism that preserves the capabilities we need without the Government holding this bulk metadata. <p>This will not be simple. The Review Group recommended that our current approach be replaced by one in which the providers or a third party retain the bulk records, with Government accessing information as needed. Both of these options pose difficult problems. Relying solely on the records of multiple providers, for example, could require companies to alter their procedures in ways that raise new privacy concerns. On the other hand, any third party maintaining a single, consolidated database would be carrying out what's essentially a Government function, but with more expense, more legal ambiguity, potentially less accountability, all of which would have a doubtful impact on increasing public confidence that their privacy is being protected. <p>During the review process, some suggested that we may also be able to preserve the capabilities we need through a combination of existing authorities, better information sharing, and recent technological advances. But more work needs to be done to determine exactly how this system might work. <p>Because of the challenges involved, I've ordered that the transition away from the existing program will proceed in two steps. Effective immediately, we will only pursue phone calls that are two steps removed from a number associated with a terrorist organization instead of the current three. And I have directed the Attorney General to work with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court so that during this transition period, the database can be queried only after a judicial finding or in the case of a true emergency. <p>Next, step two, I've instructed the intelligence community and the Attorney General to use this transition period to develop options for a new approach that can match the capabilities and fill the gaps that the section 215 program was designed to address without the Government holding this metadata itself. They will report back to me with options for alternative approaches before the program comes up for reauthorization on March 28. And during this period, I will consult with the relevant committees in Congress to seek their views and then seek congressional authorization for the new program as needed. <p>Now, the reforms I'm proposing today should give the American people greater confidence that their rights are being protected, even as our intelligence and law enforcement agencies maintain the tools they need to keep us safe. And I recognize that there are additional issues that require further debate. For example, some who participated in our review, as well as some Members of Congress, would like to see more sweeping reforms to the use of national security letters so that we have to go to a judge each time before issuing these requests. Here, I have concerns that we should not set a standard for terrorism investigations that is higher than those involved in investigating an ordinary crime. But I agree that greater oversight on the use of these letters may be appropriate, and I'm prepared to work with Congress on this issue. <p>There are also those who would like to see different changes to the FISA Court than the ones I've proposed. On all these issues, I am open to working with Congress to ensure that we build a broad consensus for how to move forward, and I'm confident that we can shape an approach that meets our security needs while upholding the civil liberties of every American. <p>Let me now turn to the separate set of concerns that have been raised overseas and focus on America's approach to intelligence collection abroad. As I've indicated, the United States has unique responsibilities when it comes to intelligence collection. Our capabilities help protect not only our Nation, but our friends and our allies as well. But our efforts will only be effective if ordinary citizens in other countries have confidence that the United States respects their privacy too. And the leaders of our close friends and allies deserve to know that if I want to know what they think about an issue, I'll pick up the phone and call them, rather than turning to surveillance. In other words, just as we balance security and privacy at home, our global leadership demands that we balance our security requirements against our need to maintain the trust and cooperation among people and leaders around the world. <p>For that reason, the new Presidential directive that I've issued today will clearly prescribe what we do and do not do when it comes to our overseas surveillance. To begin with, the directive makes clear that the United States only uses signals intelligence for legitimate national security purposes and not for the purpose of indiscriminately reviewing the e-mails or phone calls of ordinary folks. I've also made it clear that the United States does not collect intelligence to suppress criticism or dissent, nor do we collect intelligence to disadvantage people on the basis of their ethnicity or race or gender or sexual orientation or religious beliefs. We do not collect intelligence to provide a competitive advantage to U.S. companies or U.S. commercial sectors. <p>And in terms of our bulk collection of signals intelligence, U.S. intelligence agencies will only use such data to meet specific security requirements: counterintelligence, counterterrorism, counterproliferation, cybersecurity, force protection for our troops and our allies, and combating transnational crime, including sanctions evasion. <p>In this directive, I have taken the unprecedented step of extending certain protections that we have for the American people to people overseas. I've directed the DNI, in consultation with the Attorney General, to develop these safeguards, which will limit the duration that we can hold personal information, while also restricting the use of this information. <p>The bottom line is that people around the world, regardless of their nationality, should know that the United States is not spying on ordinary people who don't threaten our national security and that we take their privacy concerns into account in our policies and procedures. This applies to foreign leaders as well. Given the understandable attention that this issue has received, I have made clear to the intelligence community that unless there is a compelling national security purpose, we will not monitor the communications of heads of state and government of our close friends and allies. And I've instructed my national security team, as well as the intelligence community, to work with foreign counterparts to deepen our coordination and cooperation in ways that rebuild trust going forward. <p>Now, let me be clear: Our intelligence agencies will continue to gather information about the intentions of governments&mdash;as opposed to ordinary citizens&mdash;around the world, in the same way that the intelligence services of every other nation does. We will not apologize simply because our services may be more effective. But heads of state and government with whom we work closely and on whose cooperation we depend should feel confident that we are treating them as real partners. And the changes I've ordered do just that. <p>Finally, to make sure that we follow through on all these reforms, I am making some important changes to how our Government is organized. The State Department will designate a senior officer to coordinate our diplomacy on issues related to technology and signals intelligence. We will appoint a senior official at the White House to implement the new privacy safeguards that I have announced today. I will devote the resources to centralize and improve the process we use to handle foreign requests for legal assistance, keeping our high standards for privacy while helping foreign partners fight crime and terrorism. <p>I've also asked my Counselor, John Podesta, to lead a comprehensive review of big data and privacy. And this group will consist of Government officials who, along with the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology, will reach out to privacy experts, technologists, and business leaders and look how the challenges inherent in big data are being confronted by both the public and private sectors; whether we can forge international norms on how to manage this data; and how we can continue to promote the free flow of information in ways that are consistent with both privacy and security. <p>For ultimately, what's at stake in this debate goes far beyond a few months of headlines or passing tensions in our foreign policy. When you cut through the noise, what's really at stake is how we remain true to who we are in a world that is remaking itself at dizzying speed. Whether it's the ability of individuals to communicate ideas, to access information that would have once filled every great library in every country in the world, or to forge bonds with people on other sides of the globe, technology is remaking what is possible for individuals and for institutions and for the international order. So while the reforms that I've announced will point us in a new direction, I am mindful that more work will be needed in the future. <p>One thing I'm certain of: This debate will make us stronger. And I also know that in this time of change, the United States of America will have to lead. It may seem sometimes that America is being held to a different standard. And I'll admit, the readiness of some to assume the worst motives by our Government can be frustrating. No one expects China to have an open debate about their surveillance programs or Russia to take privacy concerns of citizens in other places into account. But let's remember: We are held to a different standard precisely because we have been at the forefront of defending personal privacy and human dignity. <p>As the nation that developed the Internet, the world expects us to ensure that the digital revolution works as a tool for individual empowerment, not Government control. Having faced down the dangers of totalitarianism and fascism and communism, the world expects us to stand up for the principle that every person has the right to think and write and form relationships freely, because individual freedom is the wellspring of human progress. <p>Those values make us who we are. And because of the strength of our own democracy, we should not shy away from high expectations. For more than two centuries, our Constitution has weathered every type of change because we have been willing to defend it and because we have been willing to question the actions that have been taken in its defense. Today is no different. I believe we can meet high expectations. Together, let us chart a way forward that secures the life of our Nation while preserving the liberties that make our Nation worth fighting for. <p>Thank you. God bless you. May God bless the United States of America. Thank you.\" "
"9" "\"Hello, everybody. Have a seat, have a seat. Now, this is not usually where I do bill signings. [<i>Laughter</i>] But in addition to the opportunity to take a walk&mdash;and whenever I get a chance to take a walk, I seize it&mdash;we wanted to make sure that we did this bill signing here because it represents the extraordinary work of so many of you. <p>Obviously, over the last several years, we've been dealing with the need to recover from the worst recession since the Great Depression. And that involved making sure we were investing in, first and foremost, the American people; that we were helping businesses stay open; that we were helping to make sure the financial system was back on track, that we reformed it so that we wouldn't see the kinds of crisis that we saw again; and most importantly, that we did everything we can to lay the foundation so that we have a middle class in this country that is thriving and growing and we've got ladders of opportunity for everybody who wants to work hard and get ahead. <p>And we've made remarkable progress over the last 5 years, but we have not made enough. Part of the reason we hadn't made as much progress as we needed to was we had a series of self-inflicted wounds in this town in which a mindless sequester impeded growth, in which we were governing by crisis and brinksmanship. And not only did that slow our ability to generate a full recovery, not only did that hamper economic growth, but it also had an enormous impact on all of you. And I know that the Office of Management and Budget was one of the hardest hit during the sequester and a lot of you were furloughed. A lot of you who remained during some of these furloughs had to carry extraordinary burdens, and so it took a personal toll on you and it took a personal toll on your family. <p>And yet, in part because of your dedication and your strength and your devotion to doing your jobs well, in part because of the strong leadership of Senator Barbara Mikulski and Congressman Rogers&mdash;Chairman Rogers, we now have a bill that will fund our Government, all our vital services: make sure that we are able to provide the needs for our veterans; to make sure that we are doing everything we need to do to advance our research agenda in this country and innovate; to make sure that we're investing in the job training that young people desperately need in order to get the skills to find that good-paying job. <p>Across the board, our Government is going to be operating without, hopefully, too many glitches over the next year. And not only is that good for all of you and all the dedicated public servants in the Federal Government, but most importantly, it's good for the American people because it means that we can focus our attention where we need to: on growing this economy and making sure that everybody gets a fair shot as long as they try. <p>We would not be here and we would not be able to sign this legislation if it hadn't been for your work and your dedication. And so this is my way of saying thank you. I want to say thank you to Sylvia and Brian and the whole team here and everybody represented because, goodness gracious, that is a big piece of business. [<i>Laughter</i>] That is a big bill. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I'm always interested on, like, where do they have the boxes for the really big ones? [<i>Laughter</i>] Somebody makes them. <p>But what that represents is just hours and hours and weekends and nights where people are really paying attention and sweating the details. And that's what you do. So these aren't numbers. These are homeless folks who are getting housing. These are a laid-off worker who suddenly is enrolling in that community college and finding that job that allows them to save a home and get back on track. That's some young scientist who is maybe going to find a cure for cancer or Alzheimer's. That's what those numbers represent. And that's because of you. <p>So thank you for your good work. And without further delay, so you guys can start your weekends&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and I've got to get back because somebody is having a birthday today. [<i>Laughter</i>] I've got to make sure I pay them some attention. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm going to go ahead and sit down and sign the bill. All right? <p>And I'm going to use all these pens. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>At this point</i>, <i>the President signed the bill</i>.] <p>There we go.\" "
"10" "\"Hi, everybody. This week, I visited a company in Raleigh, North Carolina, that helps make electric motors that save businesses money on energy costs and cut harmful carbon pollution. And I stopped by NC State University, where engineers are set to develop the new technology that will make those motors even better. It's part of my push not only to make America home to more high-tech manufacturing, but to make America more attractive for the good jobs that a growing middle class requires. <p>And increasingly, we are. Thanks in part to our all-of-the-above strategy for American energy, for the first time in nearly two decades, we produce more oil here at home than we buy from the rest of the world. We generate more renewable energy than ever and more natural gas than anybody. Health care costs are growing at their slowest rate in 50 years, due in part to the Affordable Care Act. And since I took office, we've cut our deficits by more than half. <p>So we are primed to bring back more of the good jobs claimed by the recession and lost to overseas competition in recent decades. But that requires a year of action. I want to work with Congress this year on proven ways to create jobs, like building infrastructure and fixing our broken immigration system. <p>Where Congress isn't acting, I'll act on my own to put opportunity within reach for anyone who's willing to work for it. That's what I did in Raleigh by launching America's second manufacturing innovation institute. It's a partnership between companies, colleges, and the Federal Government focused on making sure American businesses and American workers win the race for high-tech manufacturing and the jobs that come with it, jobs that can help people and communities willing to work hard punch their ticket into the middle class. <p>I firmly believe that this can be a breakthrough year for America. But to make that happen, we're going to have to act: to create good jobs that pay good wages and to offer more Americans a fair shot to get ahead. That's what I'm focused on every day that I have the privilege of serving as your President. That's what I'm going to be focused on every single day of this year. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"11" "\"<i>The President</i>. Thank you. Please have a seat. Well, hello, everybody. Welcome to the White House. To all of you in my administration, the partners with the White House Council on Women and Girls, led by Valerie and Tina Tchen, I want to thank all of you for being here today and for the work that you're doing every single day to advance a cause that matters to all of us, and that's preventing the outrage, the crime, of sexual violence in America. <p>I especially want to thank the members of my Cabinet who are here today. We've got Secretaries Chuck Hagel, Kathleen Sebelius, and Arne Duncan, as well as Attorney General Holder. And their presence here today, and the presence of so many leaders from across my administration, is a testament to how important we consider this issue and how committed we are across the entire Federal Government to meeting this challenge. <p>And that, of course, includes our outstanding Vice President. Few people have brought more passion to this fight over the decades than Joe Biden. Back when a lot of people believed that domestic abuse was a private family matter and women in danger often had nobody to turn to, Joe was out there saying: \\"This is unacceptable. This has to change.\\" And thanks to Joe and so many others, this Nation enshrined its commitment in the Violence Against Women's Act. <p>Police officers and prosecutors got special training on domestic violence. More shelters opened across the country. A national hotline was created. And as Joe mentioned, a cultural shift began to occur. Americans came to see how serious this problem was and how we all needed to do more to address it. And that's resulted in more hope and more safety and a new chance at life for countless women. So Joe was on the frontlines on this, and you can tell his passion is unabated. And so we are very grateful for everything that you've done on this work. <p><i>Vice President Joe Biden</i>. Thank you. <p><i>The President</i>. Thank you, Joe. [<i>Applause</i>] Appreciate it. <p>So I think that conviction and that passion brings us all here today. because this is not an abstract problem that goes on in other families or other communities. Even now, it's not always talked about enough. It can still go on in the shadows. But it affects every one of us. It's about all of us: our moms, our wives, our sisters, our daughters, our sons. Sexual assault is an affront on our basic decency and humanity. And for survivors, the awful pain can take years, even decades to heal. Sometimes, it lasts a lifetime. And wherever it occurs&mdash;whether it's in our neighborhoods or on our college campuses, our military bases or our tribal lands&mdash;it has to matter to all of us. <p>Because when a young girl or a young boy starts to question their self-worth after being assaulted and maybe starts withdrawing, we're all deprived of their full potential. When a young woman drops out of school after being attacked, that's not just a loss for her, that's a loss for our country. We've all got a stake in that young woman's success. <p>When a mother struggles to hold down a job after a traumatic assault or is assaulted in order to keep a job, that matters to all of us, because strong families are a foundation of a strong country. And if that woman doesn't feel like she has recourse when she's subject to abuse and we're not there supporting her, shame on us. When a member of our military is assaulted by the very people he or she trusted and serves with, or when they leave the military, voluntarily or involuntarily because they were raped, that's a profound injustice that no one who volunteers to defend America should ever have to endure. <p>So sexual violence is more than just a crime against individuals. It threatens our families, it threatens our communities; ultimately, it threatens the entire country. It tears apart the fabric of our communities. And that's why we're here today, because we have the power to do something about it as a Government, as a nation. We have the capacity to stop sexual assault, support those who have survived it, and bring perpetrators to justice. <p>And that's why last year I was proud to sign the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women's Act, which improved the support we gave to cities and States to help end sexual assault. And that includes funding to train police officers and nurses and to speed up the processing of untested rape kits so we can reduce that backlog, solve unsolved cases, get justice for victims. <p>We pushed for the Violence Against Women Act to include more protections for immigrants; for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans; for Native Americans. Because no matter who you are or where you live, everybody in this country deserves security and justice and dignity. And we have to keep reaching out to people who are still suffering in the shadows. <p>As Commander in Chief, I've made it clear to our military leadership that we need to deal aggressively with the problem of sexual assault in our Armed Forces. It has been going on too long, and we have an obligation to protect the men and women who put their lives on the line to protect us. And Secretary Hagel and Secretary&mdash;and Chairman Dempsey have already taken steps to reduce violence and support those who have been harmed. But I've made it clear, I expect significant progress in the year ahead. These crimes have no place in the greatest military on Earth. <p>I've directed agencies across the Federal Government to do more to help members of their workforce who have been assaulted, because employers have a role to play too, and I want my administration to lead by example. That's why we're releasing a new report today that outlines all of our efforts and where we intend to do more. And I met earlier today with Secretaries Sebelius, Hagel, Duncan, Attorney General Holder, as well as Vice President Biden, as well as members of my senior staff to discuss how we implement going forward. Because I want to make sure we're doing everything we can to spare another American the trauma of sexual assault. <p>Today we're taking another important step with a focus on our college campuses. It is estimated that one in five women on college campuses has been sexually assaulted during their time there&mdash;one in five. These young women worked so hard just to get into college; often, their parents are doing everything they can to help them pay for it. So when they finally make it there only to be assaulted, that is not just a nightmare for them and their families, it's an affront to everything they've worked so hard to achieve. It's totally unacceptable. <p>Three years ago, we sent every school district, college, and university that receives Federal funding new instructions clarifying their legal obligations to prevent and respond to sexual assault. And we have seen progress, including an inspiring wave of student-led activism and a growing number of students who have found the courage to come forward and report attacks. That's exactly what we want them to do. And we owe all these brave young people an extraordinary debt of gratitude. But we cannot stop there. There's obviously more that we have to do to keep our students safe. And that's why here today I will sign a Presidential memorandum creating the White House Task Force To Protect Students From Sexual Assault. And we're going to work with colleges and universities and educational institutions of all kinds across America to help them come up with better ways to prevent and respond to sexual assault on their campuses. And then we'll help them put those ideas into practice, because our schools need to be places where our young people feel secure and confident as they prepare to go as far as their God-given talents can carry them. <p>And none of this is going to be easy. Some of you have worked on these issues for years. You know how long it took for our country to get to where we are now. And it didn't just take new laws. It took a fundamental change in our culture, a shift in our attitudes about how we think about sexual violence and how much we value the lives and dignity of our wives and sisters and daughters and sons. Over time, we've become a better, stronger nation for it. <p>But now it's up to each of us&mdash;every single one of us&mdash;to keep up that momentum. We've got to keep teaching young men in particular to show women the respect they deserve and to recognize sexual violence and be outraged by it and to do their part to stop it from happening in the first place. Now, during our discussion earlier today, we talked about, I want every young man in America to feel some strong peer pressure in terms of how they are supposed to behave and treat women. And that starts before they get to college. <p>So those of us who are fathers have an obligation to transmit that information. But we can do more to make sure that every young man out there&mdash;whether they're in junior high or high school or college or beyond&mdash;understand what's expected of them and what it means to be a man and to intervene if they see somebody else acting inappropriately. We're going to need to encourage young people, men and women, to realize that sexual assault is simply unacceptable. And they're going to have to summon the bravery to stand up and say so, especially when the social pressure to keep quiet or to go along can be very intense. <p>We've got to keep working with our teachers and police officers and health professionals and community leaders to search for new ways to prevent these crimes. My hope and intention is, is that every college president who has not personally been thinking about this is going to hear about this report and is going to go out and figure out who is in charge on their campus of responding properly and what are the best practices and are we doing everything that we should be doing? And if you're not doing that right now, I want the students at the school to ask the president what he is doing or she is doing. And perhaps most important, we need to keep saying to anyone out there who has ever been assaulted, you are not alone. You will never be alone. We have your back; I've got your back. <p>And I promise I'm going to keep fighting for you and your families, and I'm going to keep pushing for others to step up across my administration and in Congress and in State capitals and in college campuses and on our military bases and all across our country. This is a priority for me not only as President and Commander in Chief, but as a husband and a father of two extraordinary girls. <p>I've often said in my travels around the world: You can judge a nation and how successful it will be based on how it treats its women and its girls. Those nations that are successful, they're successful in part because women and girls are valued. And I'm determined that, by that measure, the United States of America will be the global leader. I'm grateful to each of you for making sure that happens. I'm grateful for Joe Biden for having led the charge both in Congress and in my administration on many of these issues. And now I'd ask that those of you who will be joining me, please come up so I can sign this memorandum. <p>[<i>At this point, the President signed the memorandum</i>.] <p>Done. All right.\" "
"12" "\"Hello, everybody. Glad you guys made it to work. <p>I just want to say thank you publicly to all the wonderful people here who served on the Presidential Commission on Election Administration. I think all of us recall that in the last election in 2012, we had reports around the country of tremendously long lines for people when they had tried to vote, and in some cases, for hours they were stuck. The day of the election I said that we're going to need to do something about it. <p>And I think all of us share the belief that, regardless of party affiliation, that our democracy demands that our citizens can participate in a smooth and effective way. And I called on Congress to work with us, but I also thought that it was important for us to have a bipartisan, independent panel that could actually dig into the facts and try to determine what can we do to improve this situation. <p>And unlike a lot of countries, we've got a pretty complex system. We vote a lot. We have local jurisdictions that run these elections, and it makes things a little bit more complicated. But I was confident that if we put some good minds to work, they could come up with some recommendations. As a consequence, we set up this Commission. <p>I asked my top attorney during my election campaign, Bob Bauer, to join with Mitt Romney's top attorney in 2012, Ben Ginsberg, to cochair this Commission. I think it's fair to say that they may have voted for different candidates in 2012&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but what they shared was a reputation for integrity, for smarts, and a commitment to making sure that our democracy works the way it's supposed to. <p>And they have now, working with the rest of this Commission, put together an outstanding series of recommendations with an important goal, which is that no American should have to wait more than half an hour to vote. And they should know&mdash;they should be confident&mdash;that their vote is being properly counted and is secure. A lot of the recommendations they've made are common sense; they are ones that can be embraced by all of us. Importantly, my understanding is, a lot of the Commission recommendations are directed not simply at Congress or the Federal Government, but rather to the State and local jurisdictions who are largely responsible for our elections. <p>And so we intend to publicize this and to then reach out to stakeholders all across the country to make sure that we can implement this, in part because one of the troubling aspects of the work that they did was hearing from local officials indicating that we could have even more problems in the future if we don't act now. The good news is, is that the recommendations that are contained in this Commission report are eminently doable. <p>So I just want to publicly, again, thank both Bob and Ben for taking on this largely thankless job. And I want to thank all of you for being so diligent and maintaining a sense of urgency, producing an outstanding report in a relatively short period of time. <p>So thank you very much, everyone.\" "
"13" "\"Thank you. Please have a seat. <p>The&mdash;well, welcome to the White House. It is great to have you. For those of you who have been here before, welcome back. I see a lot of friends and a lot of familiar faces around the room, but I've also already had a chance to meet some newly elected mayors. So to all of you, congratulations, and make sure you're shoveling the snow. [<i>Laughter</i>] I&mdash;just a little piece of advice. It's been cold. <p>We've got more than 250 mayors here from more than 45 States and Territories. You represent about 40 million Americans. And over the last 5 years, thanks in part to the partnerships that we've been able to forge with mayors in this room and across the country, we've accomplished some big things on behalf of the American people. <p>But you know as well as anybody that while our economy is growing stronger and we are optimistic about growth this year and in subsequent years, we've got a lot more work to do to make sure that everybody has a chance to get ahead. If they're willing to work hard and take responsibility, they've got to be able to participate in that growth. And every day, mayors are proving that you don't have to wait for the gridlock to clear in Congress in order to make things happen. <p>Now, Mayor Greg Stanton in Phoenix and Mayor Ralph Becker in Salt Lake City have ended chronic homelessness among veterans. In San Antonio, Mayor Castro has launched an early childhood education program designed to reach more than 22,000 4-year-olds over the next 8 years. In Fresno, Mayor Ashley Swearengin is spearheading projects to develop her city's downtown, including a high-speed rail station that's going to help attract jobs and businesses to the Central Valley. In Philadelphia, Mayor Nutter is helping young people reach higher during their summers by working with partners across the city to create thousands of summer jobs. In Tampa, Mayor Bob Buckhorn has gone, in his words, \\"all in,\\" helping his constituents get covered with quality, affordable health insurance. <p>So mayors from both parties are a part of the climate task force, helping to make sure that cities have what it takes to withstand changes that may be taking place in our atmosphere in the years to come. More than a thousand mayors across America have signed agreements to cut dangerous carbon pollutions. I want to work with Congress whenever and wherever I can, but the one thing I'm emphasizing to all my Cabinet members is, we're not going to wait. Where Congress is debating things and hasn't been able to pull the trigger on stuff, my administration is going to move forward and we're going to do it in partnership with all of you. I've got a pen, and I've got a phone. And that's all I need. <p>Because with a pen, I can take executive actions. With a phone, I can rally folks from around the country to help grow the economy and restore opportunity. And that's what today, hopefully, has been about. You've met with members of the administration. You've gotten to know each other, but also, hopefully, they've given you some insight into where we see the most promising programs, things that are working, best practices. And we want to cooperate and coordinate with you as effectively as we can to make sure that whatever works is getting out there and hitting the streets and actually having an impact on people's lives. And frankly, there are a lot of things that folks in this town could learn from all of you. <p>And I want to close by personally saying how much it means to me to have you here today. As Joe mentioned, I know a little something about cities. I got my professional career started as somebody working in some of the toughest neighborhoods in Chicago. But I also saw how hard work can transform communities block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood. And to see the resilience and the strength of people and the incredible vibrancy that cities bring to not just those who live within the boundaries of cities, but to entire regions, that's what you understand. And I want to make sure that I've got your back in everything that you do. <p>So I want to say thank you to all of you for making sure that your constituents are well served, but as a consequence, America is well served.\" "
"14" "\"Hi, everybody. This week, I called members of my Cabinet to the White House to deal with a challenge that affects so many families and communities: the crime, the outrage, of sexual violence. Sexual assault is an affront to our basic decency and humanity. And it's about all of us, the safety of those we love most: our moms, our wives, our daughters, and our sons. <p>Because when a child starts to question their self-worth after being abused and maybe starts withdrawing or a young woman drops out of school after being attacked or a mom struggles to hold down a job and support her kids after an assault, it's not just these individuals and their families who suffer. Our communities, our whole country is held back. <p>Over the past 5 years, we've stepped up our efforts stop these crimes. And this week, we took another important step to protect young women at college. An estimated one in five women is sexually assaulted at college, and that's totally unacceptable. So I've created the White House Task Force To Protect Students From Sexual Assault. We're going to help schools do a better job of preventing and responding to sexual assault on their campuses, because college should be a place where our young people feel secure and confident so they can go as far as their talents will take them. <p>And we're going to keep working to stop sexual assaults wherever they occur. We'll keep strengthening our criminal justice system so police and prosecutors have the tools and training to prevent these crimes and bring perpetrators to justice. We'll keep reaching out to survivors to make sure they're getting all the support they need to heal. We're going to keep combating sexual assault in our Armed Forces, because when a member of our military is attacked by the very people he or she trusts and serves with, that's an injustice that no one who volunteers to protect our Nation should ever endure. <p>Some of this is a job for government. But really, it's up to all of us. We've got to teach young people, men and women, to be brave enough to stand up and help put an end to these crimes. We've especially got to teach young men to show women the respect they deserve. I want every young man in America to know that real men do not hurt women. And those of us who are fathers have a special obligation to make sure every young man out there understands that being a man means recognizing sexual violence and being outraged by it and doing their part to stop it. <p>Perhaps most important, we need to keep saying to anyone out there who's ever been assaulted: You are not alone; we have your back. I've got your back. <p>I'm going to keep pushing for others to step up across my administration, in Congress, in State capitals, college campuses, and military bases all across our country. This is a priority for me, not only as President and Commander in Chief, but as a husband and a father of two extraordinary girls. And I hope it's a priority for you, because here in the United States of America, every man and woman, every girl and boy, has the right to be safe and protected and to pursue their own piece of the American dream. <p>Let's all do our part to make that happen. Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "

And in tight-knit communities all across America, fathers and mothers will tuck in their kids, put an arm around their spouse, remember fallen comrades, and give thanks for being home from a war that after 12 long years is finally coming to an end. <p>Tonight this Chamber speaks with one voice to the people we represent: It is you, our citizens, who make the state of our Union strong. <p>And here are the results of your efforts: the lowest unemployment rate in over 5 years; a rebounding housing market; a manufacturing sector that's adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s; more oil produced at home than we buy from the rest of the world, the first time that's happened in nearly 20 years; our deficits cut by more than half. And for the first time in over a decade, business leaders around the world have declared that China is no longer the world's number-one place to invest, America is. <p>That's why I believe this can be a breakthrough year for America. After 5 years of grit and determined effort, the United States is better positioned for the 21st century than any other nation on Earth. <p>The question for everyone in this Chamber, running through every decision we make this year, is whether we are going to help or hinder this progress. For several years now, this town has been consumed by a rancorous argument over the proper size of the Federal Government. It's an important debate, one that dates back to our very founding. But when that debate prevents us from carrying out even the most basic functions of our democracy&mdash;when our differences shut down Government or threaten the full faith and credit of the United States&mdash;then we are not doing right by the American people. <p>Now, as President, I'm committed to making Washington work better and rebuilding the trust of the people who sent us here. And I believe most of you are too. Last month, thanks to the work of Democrats and Republicans, Congress finally produced a budget that undoes some of last year's severe cuts to priorities like education. Nobody got everything they wanted, and we can still do more to invest in this country's future while bringing down our deficit in a balanced way, but the budget compromise should leave us freer to focus on creating new jobs, not creating new crises. <p>And in the coming months, let's see where else we can make progress together. Let's make this a year of action. That's what most Americans want: for all of us in this Chamber to focus on their lives, their hopes, their aspirations. And what I believe unites the people of this Nation&mdash;regardless of race or region or party, young or old, rich or poor&mdash;is the simple, profound belief in opportunity for all: the notion that if you work hard and take responsibility, you can get ahead in America. <p>Now, let's face it, that belief has suffered some serious blows. Over more than three decades, even before the great recession hit, massive shifts in technology and global competition had eliminated a lot of good, middle class jobs and weakened the economic foundations that families depend on. <p>Today, after 4 years of economic growth, corporate profits and stock prices have rarely been higher, and those at the top have never done better. But average wages have barely budged. Inequality has deepened. Upward mobility has stalled. The cold, hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery, too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by, let alone to get ahead. And too many still aren't working at all. <p>So our job is to reverse these trends. It won't happen right away, and we won't agree on everything. But what I offer tonight is a set of concrete, practical proposals to speed up growth, strengthen the middle class, and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class. Some require congressional action, and I am eager to work with all of you. But America does not stand still, and neither will I. So wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that's what I'm going to do. <p>As usual, our First Lady sets a good example. [<i>Applause</i>] Well&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. Michelle's \\"Let's Move!\\" partnership with schools, businesses, local leaders has helped bring down childhood obesity rates for the first time in 30 years. And that's an achievement that will improve lives and reduce health care costs for decades to come. The Joining Forces alliance that Michelle and Jill Biden launched has already encouraged employers to hire or train nearly 400,000 veterans and military spouses. <p>Taking a page from that playbook, the White House just organized a College Opportunity Summit, where already, 150 universities, businesses, nonprofits have made concrete commitments to reduce inequality in access to higher education and to help every hard-working kid go to college and succeed when they get to campus. And across the country, we're partnering with mayors, Governors, and State legislatures on issues from homelessness to marriage equality. <p>The point is, there are millions of Americans outside of Washington who are tired of stale political arguments and are moving this country forward. They believe&mdash;and I believe&mdash;that here in America, our success should depend not on accident of birth, but the strength of our work ethic and the scope of our dreams. That's what drew our forebears here. That's how the daughter of a factory worker is CEO of America's largest automaker; how the son of a barkeep is Speaker of the House; how the son of a single mom can be President of the greatest nation on Earth. <p>Opportunity is who we are. And the defining project of our generation must be to restore that promise. We know where to start: The best measure of opportunity is access to a good job. With the economy picking up speed, companies say they intend to hire more people this year. And over half of big manufacturers say they're thinking of insourcing jobs from abroad. <p>So let's make that decision easier for more companies. Both Democrats and Republicans have argued that our Tax Code is riddled with wasteful, complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here and reward companies that keep profits abroad. Let's flip that equation. Let's work together to close those loopholes, end those incentives to ship jobs overseas, and lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs right here at home. <p>Moreover, we can take the money we save from this transition to tax reform to create jobs rebuilding our roads, upgrading our ports, unclogging our commutes, because in today's global economy, first-class jobs gravitate to first-class infrastructure. We'll need Congress to protect more than 3 million jobs by finishing transportation and waterways bills this summer. That can happen. But I'll act on my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible. <p>We also have the chance, right now, to beat other countries in the race for the next wave of high-tech manufacturing jobs. My administration has launched two hubs for high-tech manufacturing in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Youngstown, Ohio, where we've connected businesses to research universities that can help America lead the world in advanced technologies. Tonight I'm announcing, we'll launch six more this year. Bipartisan bills in both Houses could double the number of these hubs and the jobs they create. So get those bills to my desk. Put more Americans back to work. <p>Let's do more to help the entrepreneurs and small-business owners who create most new jobs in America. Over the past 5 years, my administration has made more loans to small-business owners than any other. And when 98 percent of our exporters are small businesses, new trade partnerships with Europe and Asia&mdash;the Asia-Pacific will help them create more jobs. We need to work together on tools like bipartisan trade promotion authority to protect our workers, protect our environment, and open new markets to new goods stamped \\"Made in the U.S.A.\\" <p>Listen, China and Europe aren't standing on the sidelines, and neither should we. We know that the nation that goes all-in on innovation today will own the global economy tomorrow. This is an edge America cannot surrender. Federally funded research helped lead to the ideas and inventions behind Google and smartphones. And that's why Congress should undo the damage done by last year's cuts to basic research so we can unleash the next great American discovery. There are entire industries to be built based on vaccines that stay ahead of drug-resistant bacteria or paper-thin material that's stronger than steel. And let's pass a patent reform bill that allows our businesses to stay focused on innovation, not costly and needless litigation. <p>Now, one of the biggest factors in bringing more jobs back is our commitment to American energy. The all-of-the-above energy strategy I announced a few years ago is working, and today, America is closer to energy independence than we have been in decades. <p>One of the reasons why is natural gas. If extracted safely, it's the bridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon pollution that causes climate change. Businesses plan to invest almost $100 billion in new factories that use natural gas. I'll cut redtape to help States get those factories built and put folks to work, and this Congress can help by putting people to work building fueling stations that shift more cars and trucks from foreign oil to American natural gas. <p>Meanwhile, my administration will keep working with the industry to sustain production and jobs growth while strengthening protection of our air, our water, our communities. And while we're at it, I'll use my authority to protect more of our pristine Federal lands for future generations. <p>Well, it's not just oil and natural gas production that's booming, we're becoming a global leader in solar too. Every 4 minutes, another American home or business goes solar, every panel pounded into place by a worker whose job cannot be outsourced. Let's continue that progress with a smarter tax policy that stops giving $4 billion a year to fossil fuel industries that don't need it so we can invest more in fuels of the future that do. <p>And even as we've increased energy production, we've partnered with businesses, builders, and local communities to reduce the energy we consume. When we rescued our automakers, for example, we worked with them to set higher fuel efficiency standards for our cars. In the coming months, I'll build on that success by setting new standards for our trucks so we can keep driving down oil imports and what we pay at the pump. <p>And taken together, our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a cleaner, safer planet. Over the past 8 years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth. But we have to act with more urgency, because a changing climate is already harming Western communities struggling with drought and coastal cities dealing with floods. That's why I directed my administration to work with States, utilities, and others to set new standards on the amount of carbon pollution our power plants are allowed to dump into the air. <p>The shift to a cleaner energy economy won't happen overnight, and it will require some tough choices along the way. But the debate is settled. Climate change is a fact. And when our children's children look us in the eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer, more stable world, with new sources of energy, I want us to be able to say, yes, we did. <p>Finally, if we're serious about economic growth, it is time to heed the call of business leaders, labor leaders, faith leaders, law enforcement and fix our broken immigration system. Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have acted, and I know that members of both parties in the House want to do the same. Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost $1 trillion in the next two decades. And for good reason: When people come here to fulfill their dreams&mdash;to study, invent, contribute to our culture&mdash;they make our country a more attractive place for businesses to locate and create jobs for everybody. So let's get immigration reform done this year. [<i>Applause</i>] Let's get it done. It's time. <p>The ideas I've outlined so far can speed up growth and create more jobs. But in this rapidly changing economy, we have to make sure that every American has the skills to fill those jobs. The good news is, we know how to do it. <p>Two years ago, as the auto industry came roaring back, Andra Rush opened up a manufacturing firm in Detroit. She knew that Ford needed parts for the best selling truck in America, and she knew how to make those parts. She just needed the workforce. So she dialed up what we call an American Job Center, places where folks can walk in to get the help or training they need to find a new job or a better job. She was flooded with new workers. And today, Detroit Manufacturing Systems has more than 700 employees. And what Andra and her employees experienced is how it should be for every employer and every job seeker. <p>So tonight I've asked Vice President Biden to lead an across-the-board reform of America's training programs to make sure they have one mission: train Americans with the skills employers need and match them to good jobs that need to be filled right now. That means more on-the-job training and more apprenticeships that set a young worker on an upward trajectory for life. It means connecting companies to community colleges that can help design training to fill their specific needs. And if Congress wants to help, you can concentrate funding on proven programs that connect more ready-to-work Americans with ready-to-be-filled jobs. <p>I'm also convinced we can help Americans return to the workforce faster by reforming unemployment insurance so that it's more effective in today's economy. But first, this Congress needs to restore the unemployment insurance you just let expire for 1.6 million people. <p>Let me tell you why. Misty DeMars is a mother of two young boys. She'd been steadily employed since she was a teenager, put herself through college. She'd never collected unemployment benefits, but she'd been paying taxes. In May, she and her husband used their life savings to buy their first home. A week later, budget cuts claimed the job she loved. Last month, when their unemployment insurance was cut off, she sat down and wrote me a letter, the kind I get every day. \\"We are the face of the unemployment crisis,\\" she wrote. \\"I'm not dependent on the government. Our country depends on people like us who build careers, contribute to society, care about our neighbors. I'm confident that in time, I will find a job, I will pay my taxes, and we will raise our children in their own home in the community we love. Please give us this chance.\\" <p>Congress, give these hard-working, responsible Americans that chance. Give them that chance. [<i>Applause</i>] Give them the chance. They need our help right now. But more important, this country needs them in the game. That's why I've been asking CEOs to give more long-term unemployed workers a fair shot at new jobs, a new chance to support their families. And in fact, this week, many will come to the White House to make that commitment real. Tonight I ask every business leader in America to join us and to do the same, because we are stronger when America fields a full team. <p>Of course, it's not enough to train today's workforce. We also have to prepare tomorrow's workforce, by guaranteeing every child access to a world-class education. Estiven Rodriguez couldn't speak a word of English when he moved to New York City at age 9. But last month, thanks to the support of great teachers and an innovative tutoring program, he led a march of his classmates through a crowd of cheering parents and neighbors from their high school to the post office, where they mailed off their college applications. And this son of a factory worker just found out, he's going to college this fall. <p>Five years ago, we set out to change the odds for all our kids. We worked with lenders to reform student loans, and today, more young people are earning college degrees than ever before. Race to the Top, with the help of Governors from both parties, has helped States raise expectations and performance. Teachers and principals in schools from Tennessee to Washington, DC, are making big strides in preparing students with the skills for the new economy: problem solving, critical thinking, science, technology, engineering, math. <p>Now, some of this change is hard. It requires everything from more challenging curriculums and more demanding parents to better support for teachers and new ways to measure how well our kids think, not how well they can fill in a bubble on a test. But it is worth it, and it is working. The problem is, we're still not reaching enough kids, and we're not reaching them in time. And that has to change. <p>Research shows that one of the best investments we can make in a child's life is high-quality early education. Last year, I asked this Congress to help States make high-quality pre-K available to every 4-year-old. And as a parent as well as a President, I repeat that request tonight. But in the meantime, 30 States have raised pre-K funding on their own. They know we can't wait. So just as we worked with States to reform our schools, this year, we'll invest in new partnerships with States and communities across the country in a Race to the Top for our youngest children. And as Congress decides what it's going to do, I'm going to pull together a coalition of elected officials, business leaders, and philanthropists willing to help more kids access the high-quality pre-K that they need. It is right for America. We need to get this done. <p>Last year, I also pledged to connect 99 percent of our students to high-speed broadband over the next 4 years. Tonight I can announce that with the support of the FCC and companies like Apple, Microsoft, Sprint, and Verizon, we've got a down payment to start connecting more than 15,000 schools and 20 million students over the next 2 years, without adding a dime to the deficit. <p>We're working to redesign high schools and partner them with colleges and employers that offer the real-world education and hands-on training that can lead directly to a job and career. We're shaking up our system of higher education to give parents more information and colleges more incentive to offer better value so that no middle class kid is priced out of a college education. <p>We're offering millions the opportunity to cap their monthly student loan payments to 10 percent of their income, and I want to work with Congress to see how we can help even more Americans who feel trapped by student loan debt. And I'm reaching out to some of America's leading foundations and corporations on a new initiative to help more young men of color facing especially tough odds to stay on track and reach their full potential. <p>The bottom line is, Michelle and I want every child to have the same chance this country gave us. But we know our opportunity agenda won't be complete, and too many young people entering the workforce today will see the American Dream as an empty promise, unless we also do more to make sure our economy honors the dignity of work and hard work pays off for every single American. <p>Today, women make up about half our workforce, but they still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. That is wrong, and in 2014, it's an embarrassment. Women deserve equal pay for equal work. She deserves to have a baby without sacrificing her job. A mother deserves a day off to care for a sick child or a sick parent without running into hardship. And you know what, a father does too. It is time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a \\"Mad Men\\" episode. [<i>Laughter</i>] This year, let's all come together&mdash;Congress, the White House, businesses from Wall Street to Main Street&mdash;to give every woman the opportunity she deserves. Because I believe when women succeed, America succeeds. <p>Now, women hold a majority of lower wage jobs, but they're not the only ones stifled by stagnant wages. Americans understand that some people will earn more money than others, and we don't resent those who, by virtue of their efforts, achieve incredible success. That's what America is all about. But Americans overwhelmingly agree that no one who works full-time should ever have to raise a family in poverty. <p>In the year since I asked this Congress to raise the minimum wage, five States have passed laws to raise theirs. Many businesses have done it on their own. Nick Chute is here today with his boss, John Soranno. John's an owner of Punch Pizza in Minneapolis, and Nick helps make the dough. [<i>Laughter</i>] Only now he makes more of it. [<i>Laughter</i>] John just gave his employees a raise to 10 bucks an hour, and that's a decision that has eased their financial stress and boosted their morale. <p>Tonight I ask more of America's business leaders to follow John's lead: Do what you can to raise your employees' wages. It's good for the economy. It's good for America. To every mayor, Governor, State legislator in America, I say: You don't have to wait for Congress to act; Americans will support you if you take this on. <p>And as a chief executive, I intend to lead by example. Profitable corporations like Costco see higher wages as the smart way to boost productivity and reduce turnover. We should too. In the coming weeks, I will issue an Executive order requiring Federal contractors to pay their federally funded employees a fair wage of at least 10 dollars and 10 cents an hour. Because if you cook our troops' meals or wash their dishes, you should not have to live in poverty. <p>Of course, to reach millions more, Congress does need to get on board. Today, the Federal minimum wage is worth about 20 percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan first stood here. And Tom Harkin and George Miller have a bill to fix that by lifting the minimum wage to 10 dollars and 10 cents. It's easy to remember: 10-10. This will help families. It will give businesses customers with more money to spend. It does not involve any new bureaucratic program. So join the rest of the country. Say yes. Give America a raise. Give them a raise. <p>There are other steps we can take to help families make ends meet, and few are more effective at reducing inequality and helping families pull themselves up through hard work than the earned-income tax credit. Right now it helps about half of all parents at some point. Think about that: It helps about half of all parents in America at some point in their lives. But I agree with Republicans like Senator Rubio that it doesn't do enough for single workers who don't have kids. So let's work together to strengthen the credit, reward work, help more Americans get ahead. <p>Let's do more to help Americans save for retirement. Today, most workers don't have a pension. A Social Security check often isn't enough on its own. And while the stock market has doubled over the last 5 years, that doesn't help folks who don't have 401(k)s. That's why, tomorrow, I will direct the Treasury to create a new way for working Americans to start their own retirement savings: MyI&mdash;MyRA. <p>It's a new savings bond that encourages folks to build a nest egg. MyRA guarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in. And if this Congress wants to help, work with me to fix an upside-down Tax Code that gives big tax breaks to help the wealthy save, but does little or nothing for middle class Americans. Offer every American access to an automatic IRA on the job so they can save at work just like everybody in this Chamber can. <p>And since the most important investment many families make is their home, send me legislation that protects taxpayers from footing the bill for a housing crisis ever again and keeps the dream of homeownership alive for future generations. <p>One last point on financial security: For decades, few things exposed hard-working families to economic hardship more than a broken health care system. And in case you haven't heard, we're in the process of fixing that. Now, a preexisting condition used to mean that someone like Amanda Shelley, a physician's assistant and single mom from Arizona, couldn't get health insurance. But on January 1, she got covered. On January 3, she felt a sharp pain. On January 6, she had emergency surgery. Just one week earlier, Amanda said, and that surgery would have meant bankruptcy. <p>That's what health insurance reform is all about: the peace of mind that if misfortune strikes, you don't have to lose everything. Already, because of the Affordable Care Act, more than 3 million Americans under age 26 have gained coverage under their parent's plan. More than 9 million Americans have signed up for private health insurance or Medicaid coverage. Nine million. <p>And here's another number: zero. Because of this law, no American&mdash;none, zero&mdash;can ever again be dropped or denied coverage for a preexisting condition like asthma or back pain or cancer. No woman can ever be charged more just because she's a woman. And we did all this while adding years to Medicare's finances, keeping Medicare premiums flat, and lowering prescription costs for millions of seniors. <p>Now, I do not expect to convince my Republican friends on the merits of this law. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I know that the American people are not interested in refighting old battles. So again, if you have specific plans to cut costs, cover more people, increase choice, tell America what you'd do differently. Let's see if the numbers add up. But let's not have another 40-something votes to repeal a law that's already helping millions of Americans like Amanda. The first 40 were plenty. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We all owe it to the American people to say what we're for, not just what we're against. And if you want to know the real impact this law is having, just talk to Governor Steve Beshear of Kentucky, who's here tonight. Now, Kentucky is not the most liberal part of the country. That's not where I got my highest vote totals. [<i>Laughter</i>] But he's like a man possessed when it comes to covering his Commonwealth's families. They're our neighbors and our friends, he said: \\"They're people we shop and go to church with, farmers out on the tractor, grocery clerks. They're people who go to work every morning praying they don't get sick. No one deserves to live that way.\\" <p>Steve's right. That's why tonight I ask every American who knows someone without health insurance to help them get covered by March 31. [<i>Applause</i>] Help them get covered. Moms, get on your kids to sign up. Kids, call your mom and walk her through the application. It will give her some peace of mind, and plus, she'll appreciate hearing from you. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>After all, that's the spirit that has always moved this Nation forward. It's the spirit of citizenship, the recognition that through hard work and responsibility, we can pursue our individual dreams, but still come together as one American family to make sure the next generation can pursue its dreams as well. <p>Citizenship means standing up for everyone's right to vote. Last year, part of the Voting Rights Act was weakened, but conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats are working together to strengthen it. And the bipartisan Commission I appointed, chaired by my campaign lawyer and Governor Romney's campaign lawyer, came together and have offered reforms so that no one has to wait more than a half hour to vote. Let's support these efforts. It should be the power of our vote, not the size of our bank accounts, that drives our democracy. <p>Citizenship means standing up for the lives that gun violence steals from us each day. I've seen the courage of parents, students, pastors, police officers all over this country who say, \\"We are not afraid.\\" And I intend to keep trying, with or without Congress, to help stop more tragedies from visiting innocent Americans in our movie theaters, in our shopping malls, or schools like Sandy Hook. <p>Citizenship demands a sense of common purpose, participation in the hard work of self-government, an obligation to serve our communities. And I know this Chamber agrees that few Americans give more to their country than our diplomats and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces. Thank you. Tonight, because of the extraordinary troops and civilians who risk and lay down their lives to keep us free, the United States is more secure. When I took office, nearly 180,000 Americans were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, all our troops are out of Iraq. More than 60,000 of our troops have already come home from Afghanistan. With Afghan forces now in the lead for their own security, our troops have moved to a support role. Together with our allies, we will complete our mission there by the end of this year, and America's longest war will finally be over. <p>After 2014, we will support a unified Afghanistan as it takes responsibility for its own future. If the Afghan Government signs a security agreement that we have negotiated, a small force of Americans could remain in Afghanistan with NATO allies to carry out two narrow missions: training and assisting Afghan forces and counterterrorism operations to pursue any remnants of Al Qaida. For while our relationship with Afghanistan will change, one thing will not: our resolve that terrorists do not launch attacks against our country. <p>The fact is, that danger remains. While we've put Al Qaida's core leadership on a path to defeat, the threat has evolved as Al Qaida affiliates and other extremists take root in different parts of the world. In Yemen, Somalia, Iraq, Mali, we have to keep working with partners to disrupt and disable those networks. In Syria, we'll support the opposition that rejects the agenda of terrorist networks. Here at home, we'll keep strengthening our defenses and combat new threats like cyber attacks. And as we reform our defense budget, we will have to keep faith with our men and women in uniform and invest in the capabilities they need to succeed in future missions. <p>We have to remain vigilant. But I strongly believe our leadership and our security cannot depend on our outstanding military alone. As Commander in Chief, I have used force when needed to protect the American people, and I will never hesitate to do so as long as I hold this office. But I will not send our troops into harm's way unless it is truly necessary, nor will I allow our sons and daughters to be mired in open-ended conflicts. We must fight the battles that need to be fought, not those that terrorists prefer from us: large-scale deployments that drain our strength and may ultimately feed extremism. <p>So even as we actively and aggressively pursue terrorist networks through more targeted efforts and by building the capacity of our foreign partners, America must move off a permanent war footing. That's why I've imposed prudent limits on the use of drones. For we will not be safer if people abroad believe we strike within their countries without regard for the consequence. <p>That's why, working with this Congress, I will reform our surveillance programs, because the vital work of our intelligence community depends on public confidence, here and abroad, that privacy of ordinary people is not being violated. <p>And with the Afghan war ending, this needs to be the year Congress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. Because we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military actions, but by remaining true to our constitutional ideals and setting an example for the rest of the world. <p>You see, in a world of complex threats, our security, our leadership, depends on all elements of our power, including strong and principled diplomacy. American diplomacy has rallied more than 50 countries to prevent nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands and allowed us to reduce our own reliance on cold war stockpiles. American diplomacy, backed by the threat of force, is why Syria's chemical weapons are being eliminated. <p>And we will continue to work with the international community to usher in the future the Syrian people deserve, a future free of dictatorship, terror, and fear. As we speak, American diplomacy is supporting Israelis and Palestinians as they engage in the difficult but necessary talks to end the conflict there, to achieve dignity and an independent state for Palestinians and lasting peace and security for the State of Israel, a Jewish state that knows America will always be at their side. <p>And it is American diplomacy, backed by pressure, that has halted the progress of Iran's nuclear program and rolled back parts of that program for the very first time in a decade. As we gather here tonight, Iran has begun to eliminate its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium. It's not installing advanced centrifuges. Unprecedented inspections help the world verify every day that Iran is not building a bomb. And with our allies and partners, we're engaged in negotiations to see if we can peacefully achieve a goal we all share: preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. <p>These negotiations will be difficult. They may not succeed. We are clear eyed about Iran's support for terrorist organizations like Hizballah, which threatens our allies. And we're clear about the mistrust between our nations, mistrust that cannot be wished away. But these negotiations don't rely on trust. Any long-term deal we agree to must be based on verifiable action that convinces us and the international community that Iran is not building a nuclear bomb. If John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan could negotiate with the Soviet Union, then surely a strong and confident America can negotiate with less powerful adversaries today. <p>The sanctions that we put in place helped make this opportunity possible. But let me be clear: If this Congress sends me a new sanctions bill now that threatens to derail these talks, I will veto it. For the sake of our national security, we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed. If Iran's leaders do not seize this opportunity, then I will be the first to call for more sanctions and stand ready to exercise all options to make sure Iran does not build a nuclear weapon. But if Iran's leaders do seize the chance&mdash;and we'll know soon enough&mdash;then Iran could take an important step to rejoin the community of nations, and we will have resolved one of the leading security challenges of our time without the risks of war. <p>Now, finally, let's remember that our leadership is defined not just by our defense against threats, but by the enormous opportunities to do good and promote understanding around the globe: to forge greater cooperation, to expand new markets, to free people from fear and want. And no one is better positioned to take advantage of those opportunities than America. <p>Our alliance with Europe remains the strongest the world has ever known. From Tunisia to Burma, we're supporting those who are willing to do the hard work of building democracy. In Ukraine, we stand for the principle that all people have the right to express themselves freely and peacefully and to have a say in their country's future. Across Africa, we're bringing together businesses and governments to double access to electricity and help end extreme poverty. In the Americas, we're building new ties of commerce, but we're also expanding cultural and educational exchanges among young people. And we will continue to focus on the Asia-Pacific, where we support our allies, shape a future of greater security and prosperity, and extend a hand to those devastated by disaster, as we did in the Philippines, when our Marines and civilians rushed to aid those battered by a typhoon, and who were greeted with words like, \\"We will never forget your kindness\\" and \\"God bless America.\\" <p>We do these things because they help promote our long-term security, and we do them because we believe in the inherent dignity and equality of every human being, regardless of race or religion, creed or sexual orientation. And next week, the world will see one expression of that commitment, when Team U.S.A. marches the red, white, and blue into the Olympic Stadium and brings home the gold. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience members.</i> U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! <p><i>The President.</i> My fellow Americans, no other country in the world does what we do. On every issue, the world turns to us, not simply because of the size of our economy or our military might, but because of the ideals we stand for and the burdens we bear to advance them. No one knows this better than those who serve in uniform. <p>As this time of war draws to a close, a new generation of heroes returns to civilian life. We'll keep slashing that backlog so our veterans receive the benefits they've earned and our wounded warriors receive the health care&mdash;including the mental health care&mdash;that they need. We'll keep working to help all our veterans translate their skills and leadership into jobs here at home. And we will all continue to join forces to honor and support our remarkable military families. <p>Let me tell you about one of those families I've come to know. I first met Cory Remsburg, a proud Army Ranger, at Omaha Beach on the 65th anniversary of D-day. Along with some of his fellow Rangers, he walked me through the program and the ceremony. He was a strong, impressive young man, had an easy manner, he was sharp as a tack. And we joked around and took pictures, and I told him to stay in touch. <p>A few months later, on his 10th deployment, Cory was nearly killed by a massive roadside bomb in Afghanistan. His comrades found him in a canal, face down, underwater, shrapnel in his brain. For months, he lay in a coma. And the next time I met him, in the hospital, he couldn't speak, could barely move. Over the years, he's endured dozens of surgeries and procedures, hours of grueling rehab every day. <p>Even now, Cory is still blind in one eye, still struggles on his left side. But slowly, steadily, with the support of caregivers like his dad Craig and the community around him, Cory has grown stronger. And day by day, he's learned to speak again and stand again and walk again. And he's working toward the day when he can serve his country again. \\"My recovery has not been easy,\\" he says. \\"Nothing in life that's worth anything is easy.\\" Cory is here tonight. And like the Army he loves, like the America he serves, Sergeant First Class Cory Remsburg never gives up, and he does not quit. Cory. <p>My fellow Americans, men and women like Cory remind us that America has never come easy. Our freedom, our democracy, has never been easy. Sometimes, we stumble, we make mistakes; we get frustrated or discouraged. But for more than 200 years, we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress: to create and build and expand the possibilities of individual achievement, to free other nations from tyranny and fear, to promote justice and fairness and equality under the law so that the words set to paper by our Founders are made real for every citizen. The America we want for our kids&mdash;a rising America where honest work is plentiful and communities are strong, where prosperity is widely shared and opportunity for all lets us go as far as our dreams and toil will take us&mdash;none of it is easy. But if we work together&mdash;if we summon what is best in us, the way Cory summoned what is best in him&mdash;with our feet planted firmly in today, but our eyes cast toward tomorrow, I know it is within our reach. Believe it. <p>God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\" "
"16" "\"Hello, Maryland! Well, it's good to see you. I love getting outside the Beltway, even if it is just a few hundred feet away. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Well, first of all, give Teressa a great big round of applause for the great job she did. I don't know where she&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. The&mdash;it is good to be here with all of you. I want to acknowledge a champion for working families right here in Maryland, Governor Martin O'Malley. Some folks who go to bat for working people every single day: Senator Ben Cardin is here; Congresswoman Donna Edwards is here. And all of you are here. <p>Teressa's story proves that treating workers well is not just the right thing to do, it is an investment. And Teressa's 27 years of hard work at Costco proves that investment pays off. I talked a little bit about this last night in my State of the Union Address. Now, I only finished 12 hours ago, so these remarks will be quicker. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I need some time to pick up a snow shovel and one of those 50-pound bags of dog food for Bo and Sunny. I was told I could get a big-screen TV too for the Super Bowl coming up. <p><i>Audience member</i>. What size can I get for you, sir? <p><i>The President</i>. The 80-inch. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member</i>. [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President</i>. Say, 60 is not enough, huh? Got to go 80. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>It is funny, though, I was looking&mdash;you can buy a sofa, a&mdash;chocolate chip cookies, and a snorkel set all in the same&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. The sofa didn't surprise me, but the snorkel set&mdash; [<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;now, that was impressive. Although, I do want to ask, who's snorkeling right now? [<i>Laughter</i>] How many of those are you guys selling? You never know. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But what I talked about last night was a simple but profound idea, and it's an idea that's at the heart of who we are as Americans: opportunity for everybody, giving everybody a fair chance. If they're willing to work hard, take responsibility, give them a shot. The idea that no matter who you are, where you come from, what you look like, what your last name is, if you work hard, you live up to your responsibilities, you can succeed, you can support a family. That's what America should be about. Nobody is looking for a free lunch, but give people a chance. And if they're working hard, make sure they can support a family. <p>Now, we're at a moment where businesses all across the country, businesses like Costco, have created 8 million new jobs over the last 4 years. Our unemployment rate is the lowest it's been in more than 5 years. Our deficits have been cut in half. Housing is rebounding. Manufacturing is adding jobs for the first time since the nineties. We sell more of what we make here in America to other places than ever before. Business leaders are deciding that China's not the best place to invest and create jobs, America is. <p>So we&mdash;this could be a breakthrough year for America. After 5 years of hard work, overcoming the worst recession in our lifetimes, we're better positioned for this young century than anybody else. But the question for folks in Washington is whether they're going to help that progress or hinder that progress; whether they're going to waste time creating new crises for people and new uncertainty&mdash;like the shutdown&mdash;or are we going to spend time creating new jobs and new opportunities. <p>And I know what I'm choosing to do, because it's what you do: I'm choosing this to be a year of action. Because too many Americans are working harder than ever just to get by, much less get ahead. The scars of the recession are real. The middle class has been taking it on the chin since before the recession. The economy has been growing for 4 years now. Corporate profits, stock prices have all soared. But the wages and incomes of ordinary people haven't gone up in over a decade. <p>So that's why last night, I laid out some steps that we can take&mdash;concrete, commonsense proposals&mdash;to speed up economic growth, strengthen the middle class, build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class. <p>And this opportunity agenda has four parts. Number one, we need more new jobs. Number two, we need to train more Americans with the job&mdash;with the skills that they need to fill those jobs. Number three, we should guarantee every child access to a world-class education. And number four, let's make sure hard work pays off. <p>Now, some of my ideas, I'll need Congress. But America can't just stand still if Congress isn't doing anything. I'm not going to stand still either. Wherever I can take steps to expand opportunity for more families, I'm going to do it, with or without Congress. Because the defining project of our time, of our generation, is to restore opportunity for everybody. And so I'm here at Costco today to talk about the fourth part of the opportunity agenda, and that is, making hard work pay off for every single American. <p>Five years ago I signed my first bill into law. I didn't have any gray hair. [<i>Laughter</i>] And&mdash; you think it's distinguished? Okay. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's the guy with the gray beard saying&mdash; [<i>laughter</i>]. So this first bill that I signed was called the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. Lilly was at my speech last night. And it's a law to help protect a woman's right to fair pay. But at a time when women make about&mdash;make up about half of the workforce, but still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns, we've got to finish the job and give women the tools they need to fight for equal pay. Women deserve equal pay for equal work. They deserve&mdash;if they're having a baby, they shouldn't have to sacrifice their job. A mom deserves a day off to care for a sick child or a sick parent, and a father does too. <p>As I said last night, we got to get rid of these&mdash;some of these workplace policies that belong in a \\"Mad Men\\" episode, belong back in the fifties. We've got to give every woman the opportunity she deserves. Because when women succeed, America succeeds. <p>Now, women happen to hold a majority of lower wage jobs in America. But they're not the only ones who are stifled when wages aren't going up. As Americans, we understand some people are going to earn more than other people, and we don't resent those who because they work hard, because they come up with a new idea, they achieve incredible success. We want our kids to be successful. <p>And it's funny, Michelle and I sometimes talk&mdash;Michelle's dad was a blue-collar worker; her mom was a secretary. I was raised by a single mom. We didn't go around when we were growing up being jealous about folks who had made a lot of money, as long as&mdash;if we were working hard, we could have enough. So Americans overwhelmingly agree, nobody who works full-time should ever have to raise a family in poverty. And that is why I firmly believe it's time to give America a raise. <p>A hundred years ago, Henry Ford started Ford Motor Company. Model T, you remember all that? Henry Ford realized he could sell more cars if his workers made enough money to buy the cars. He had started this&mdash;factories and mass production and all that, but then he realized, if my workers aren't getting paid, they won't be able to buy the cars, and then I can't make a profit and reinvest to hire more workers. But if I pay my workers a good wage, they can buy my product, I make more cars. Ultimately, I'll make more money, they've got more money in their pockets, so it's a win-win for everybody. <p>And leaders today&mdash;business leaders today, some of them understand this same concept. Now, Costco's CEO, Craig Jelinek, he understands this. He feels the same way. He knows that Costco is going to do better&mdash;all our businesses do better&mdash;when customers have more money to spend. And listen, Craig is a wonderful guy, but he's not in this for philanthropy. He's a businessman. He's looking at the bottom line. But he sees that if he's doing right by Costco's workers, then they can buy that 80-inch TV too. [<i>Laughter</i>] Right? <p>Profitable corporations like Costco see higher wages as a smart way to boost productivity and to reduce turnover. So entry-level employees here&mdash;stock associates, cashiers&mdash;start at 11.50 an hour. Start at 11.50 an hour.<p><i>Audience member. </i>Mr. President, we love you! <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. <p>The average hourly wage is more than $20, not including overtime or benefits. And Costco's commitment to fairness doesn't stop at the checkout counter, it extends down the supply chain, including to many of the farm workers who grow the product&mdash;the produce that you sell. <p>Now, what this means is that Costco has some of the lowest employee turnover in your industry. So you're not constantly retraining folks because they quit. You got people like Teressa who's been here 27 years because it's a company that's looking out for workers. And I got to tell you, when I walk around, just&mdash;I had a little tour of the produce section, the bakery&mdash;you could just tell people feel good about their job and they feel good about the company and you have a good atmosphere and the managers and people all take pride in what you do. <p>Now, folks who work at Costco understand that, but there are a lot of Americans who don't work somewhere like Costco, and they're working for wages that don't go as far as they once did. Today, the minimum wage&mdash;the Federal minimum wage doesn't even go as far as it did back in the 1950s. And as the cost of living goes up, the value of the minimum wage goes down over time. Just last year alone, workers earning the minimum wage basically got the equivalent of a $200 pay cut because the minimum wage stayed the same, but costs of everything else are going up. <p>I don't need to tell you this. You go shopping. [<i>Laughter</i>] So you're like, mm-hmm. [<i>Laughter</i>] Mm-hmm. [<i>Laughter</i>] For a typical minimum-wage worker, that's a month's worth of groceries. It's 2 months of electricity. It's a big deal to a lot of families. <p>So I brought a guy here today who knows a little bit about this: Tom Perez is America's Secretary of Labor&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;works for working families every day. I stole him from Governor O'Malley. [<i>Laughter</i>] He's&mdash;he came here from Maryland. But when he was Governor O'Malley's labor secretary here in Maryland, he helped implement the country's first Statewide living wage law. And that helped a lot of Maryland families. But there are more families in Maryland and across the country who put in long days, they've got hard jobs; they deserve higher wages. <p>And in the year since I first asked Congress to raise the Federal minimum wage, five States have passed laws to raise theirs. Governor O'Malley is trying to do it here in Maryland and lift the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. He says, \\"We all do better when we're all doing better.\\" He's right. Prince George's County, Montgomery County are banding together with DC to raise the regional minimum wage. And I'm here to support your efforts. [<i>Applause</i>] I'm here to support your efforts. And as I said last night, to every Governor, mayor, State legislator out there, if you want to take the initiative to raise your minimum wage laws to help more hardworking Americans make ends meet, then I'm going to be right there at your side. <p>While Congress decides whether it's going to raise the minimum wage or not, people outside Washington are not waiting for Congress. And I'm not either. So as a chief executive, I'm going to lead by example. In the coming weeks, I will issue an Executive order requiring Federal contractors to pay their federally funded employees on new contracts a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour. Because if you cook our troops' meals, wash their dishes, you shouldn't have to live in poverty. <p>So there's some steps businesses are taking on their own. There are steps that certain States and counties and cities are taking on their own. There are steps I'm going to take as President. But ultimately, Congress does have to do its part to catch up to the rest of the country on this. <p>And there's a reason why a wide majority of Americans support increasing the minimum wage. Look, most Americans who are working make more than the minimum wage. So it's interesting that the overwhelming number of Americans support raising the minimum wage. It's not that it's going to necessarily affect them personally right now, it's that they know, they understand, the value behind the minimum wage. If you work hard, you should be able to pay your rent, buy your groceries, look after your kids. If you put in a hard day's work, you deserve decent pay for it. That's a principle everybody understands, everybody believes. <p>So right now in Congress, there's a bill that would lift the Federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour&mdash;10-10. Ten-ten, it's easy. [<i>Laughter</i>] It will give more businesses more customers with more money to spend. I guarantee you, if workers have a little more money in their pocket, they'll spend more at Costco. And if Costco is seeing more customers, they'll hire some more folk. Everybody does better. <p>And the thing about it is, raising the minimum wage doesn't require new spending by the Federal Government. It doesn't require a big bureaucratic program. It would help a lot of Americans make ends meet. <p>So I need everybody here and everybody who's going to be watching, tell Congress to make this happen. Give America a raise. Making work pay means doing more to help Americans all across this country, but it also means improving the economy. Because one of the things that's been holding our economy back is wages and incomes being flat, which means consumers aren't spending as much, which means businesses don't have as many customers, which means they don't hire as much and they don't invest as much, and we don't get that liftoff on the economy that we could. <p>If we want to make work pay, we also have to help Americans save for retirement, and I'm going to be flying up to Pittsburgh this afternoon to talk about that. Making work pay means access to health care that's there when you get sick. And the Affordable Care Act means nobody can ever be dropped or denied coverage for a preexisting condition like asthma or cancer. You can't be charged more if you're a woman. You can't be charged just because your job makes your back hurt sometimes. Those days are over. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>More Americans are signing up for new private health insurance plans every day. Already, 3 million people have signed up. So if you know somebody who isn't covered, who doesn't have health insurance, call them up, sit them down, help them get covered at healthcare.gov by March 31. <p>So this is the opportunity agenda that I'm going to be talking about this year. I don't know&mdash;I hope Congress will be talking about it too. But I'm not going to wait. Because we've got to restore some economic security in a 21st-century economy, and that means jobs that are more plentiful, skills that are more employable, savings that are more portable, health care that's yours and can't be canceled if you get sick. <p>I just focused on one piece of that opportunity agenda today: raising the minimum wage. But these are real, practical, achievable solutions that can help shift the odds back in favor of working and middle class Americans who haven't been seeing some of the benefits of growth that we've seen over the last 4 years. <p>And before I grab a 10-pound barrel of pretzels and&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;500 golf balls&mdash; [<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;let me just leave you with something I heard from Costco's founder, Jim Sinegal, who's been a great friend of mine and somebody who I greatly admire. And Jim is rightly proud of everything he's accomplished. \\"But,\\" he said, \\"here's the thing about the Costco story. We did not build our company in a vacuum. We built it in the greatest country on Earth. We built our company in a place where anyone can make it with hard work, a little luck, and a little help from their neighbors and their country.\\" <p>That's what Jim said, a place where anyone can make it. That's who we are. That's our story. If we pull together, work together, put our shoulder to the wheel, keep moving forward, that's going to be our future as well and the future for our kids and our grandkids. <p>Thanks so much, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"17" "\"Hey! hello, everybody. Well, thank you, Mario, for that great introduction and your leadership. You just don't come to the Steel City without coming to U.S. Steel. I just got a great tour and had a chance to see a little bit about how you guys build America every single day. And I could not be prouder to be here. <p>I brought a few friends with me. We've got America's Treasury Secretary, Jack Lew. We've got a couple of guys who wake up and go to bat for Pennsylvania workers every single day, Senator Bob Casey and Congressman Mike Doyle. We've got the mayor of West Mifflin, Chris Kelly, in the house. Pittsburgh's new mayor, Bill Peduto, is here. And we've got Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald. And then we've got one of my good buddies who is always in my ear about working people&mdash;and I love this guy&mdash;the international president of the United Steelworkers, Leo Gerard, is here. And I also brought along our great friend, our former Ambassador to Ireland, and most importantly, chairman of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Dan Rooney in the house. <p>Now, most of all, it's great to be here with the men and women of U.S. Steel. This company helped build America, and over a hundred years later, you're still at it. You forge the pipes that transport cleaner burning natural gas. You manufacture the lightweight alloys that our automakers use to build fuel-efficient cars. You're part of one of the great turnaround stories of this economic recovery, the rebound of the American steel industry. And look, just every time I go to a steel plant, I remember, being a steelworker is hard work. But every single one of you is doing your part to make the country stronger. <p>And because of your efforts, businesses like U.S. Steel have now created 8 million new jobs over the past 4 years, 9,000 new jobs in the steel industry alone. Our unemployment rate is the lowest it's been in more than 5 years. Our deficits have been cut in half. Housing is rebounding. Manufacturing is adding jobs, not shrinking jobs, for the first time since the 1990s. We sell more of what we make here in America to other parts of the world than ever before. Business leaders are starting to realize that China is no longer the best place to invest and create jobs, America is&mdash;the U.S. of A.&mdash;which is why I said last night I believe this can be a breakthrough year for America. <p>After 5 years of hard work, after everything we did to dig ourselves out of the worst recession of our lifetimes, we're better positioned in this 21st century than any other country on Earth. And the question I posed to Congress yesterday is whether folks in Washington are going to help or they're going to hinder the progress we've been making, whether they're going to waste time creating new crises that slows down our economy or they're going to spend time creating new jobs and new opportunities? <p>And I don't know what their plans are, but I choose a year of action. Because too many Americans are working harder than ever just to get by, let alone get ahead. They still have the scars of the recession. But the truth is, the middle class have been taking it on the chin since way before the financial crisis hit. You know that. The economy now has been growing for 4 years. Corporate profits, stock prices, they've gone up, but folks' wages haven't risen in over a decade. <p>And that's why last night I laid out new steps we can take right now to speed up economic growth, strengthen the middle class, and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class. It's an opportunity agenda, because opportunity is what America is all about. And the agenda has four parts. Number one, more new jobs: jobs in American manufacturing, jobs in American energy, jobs in American innovation and technology. Number two, we've got to train more Americans with the skills that we need to fill those jobs. Number three, we've got to guarantee every child in America a world-class education. And number four, we've got to make sure hard work pays off. <p>Now, some of these ideas that I presented last night are going to require Congress to pass legislation. But America doesn't stand still. U.S. Steel hasn't stood still. I'm not going to stand still. So wherever I can take steps to expand opportunity for more families, regardless of what Congress does, that's what I'm going to do, because I am determined to work with all of you and citizens all across this country on the defining project of our generation, and that is to restore opportunity for every single person who is willing to work hard and take responsibility in this country. That's what I'm committed to doing. <p>Now, I've come to U.S. Steel today because I want to talk about the fourth part of that opportunity agenda, making hard work pay off for every single American: making sure jobs pay good wages, making sure affordable health care is there when you need it, making sure that after a lifetime of hard work you can retire with some dignity. <p>Today, women make up about half our workforce, but they still make 77 cents for every dollar a man makes. And as I said last night, that's wrong. In 2014, it is an embarrassment. Women deserve equal pay for equal work. They deserve to be able to have a baby without sacrificing a job. Moms and dads deserve to be able to take a day off for a sick kid or a sick parent. We've got to get rid of some of these workplace policies that belong back in the fifties, back in a \\"Mad Men\\" episode, I said. [<i>Laughter</i>] We've got to give every woman the opportunity she deserves, because when women succeed, America succeeds. And I'm really proud that there's a woman who is heading up this plant and doing some amazing work. So I was really glad to see that. <p>But women hold the majority of lower wage jobs. And they're not the only ones who have been stifled by stagnant wages. The truth is, wages and incomes for the average working American haven't gone up. Even though the economy is more productive, even though it's grown over the last two decades, the average person's salary&mdash;what they're taking home, their paycheck&mdash;it hasn't really grown. Now, Americans understand, we all understand, some people are going to earn more money than others. And we don't envy anybody who achieves success through their hard work. That's what we want for our kids. <p>Michelle and I were talking. Michelle's dad was a blue-collar worker, worked at a water filtration plant in Chicago. Her mom was a secretary. My mom was a single mom. When we were growing up, we weren't worrying about what rich people were doing. We weren't going around saying, oh, man, we don't have caviar for lunch&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and we're not vacationing down in some fancy place. We don't begrudge success to other folks. But we did expect&mdash;and I think most Americans still expect&mdash;that if you work hard, you should be able to make it. You don't have to make it the way some folks make it, but everybody should have enough to feel some security. <p>And Americans overwhelmingly agree that nobody who works full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty. If you're doing your responsibilities and working hard, you should be able to pay the rent, buy food, look after your family. <p>Now, today, the Federal minimum wage doesn't go as far as it did even in the 1950s. That's why some States and cities are raising their minimum wages on their own. And I support their efforts. And as I mentioned last night, as a chief executive, I'm going to lead by example. In the coming weeks, I'm issuing an Executive order requiring Federal contractors, folks doing business with the Federal Government, pay your federally funded employees a fair wage of at least 10 bucks and 10 cents an hour, because if you cook our troops' meals or you wash their dishes, you shouldn't have to live in poverty. <p>Of course, if we're going to reach millions more, then Congress is going to have to get on board. There's a bill in Congress right now to wage&mdash;that minimum wage to 10 bucks and 10 cents an hour. And I told Congress, say yes to that. Give America a raise. <p>But that's not all we have to do to grow our middle class. Making work pay also means access to health care that's there for you when you get sick. Now, the good news is if you work here at U.S. Steel, I know you've got good benefits. And that's why I'm a strong supporter of unions, because they fought for those benefits. <p>But as everybody here knows&mdash;and I'll bet you've got friends and family who haven't been so lucky and don't have those benefits. And what the Affordable Care Act means is that no one can ever again be dropped or denied coverage for a preexisting like&mdash;condition like asthma or cancer. You can't be charged more if you're a woman. You can't be charged more just because forging steel might hurt your backs, make it hurt sometimes. And if you don't have health insurance on the job, you can actually get affordable health insurance. <p>So the days when folks are just on their own, out of luck, those days are over. More Americans are signing up for new private health insurance plans every day. We're signing folks up for Medicaid. And if you know somebody who isn't covered, call them up, sit them down, help them get covered at healthcare.gov by March 31. We are going to get all of America covered. That's one of my commitments. <p>And finally&mdash;and that's what this little desk here is about&mdash;there's another thing we can all agree on. If you've worked hard all your life, you deserve a secure retirement. Some of the folks I met before I came here on the tour, some of these folks have been on the job 15 years, 20 years. I think your roller has been on the job 38 years. Let me tell you something, if you work 38 years, at the end of it, you should feel like you're going to retire with some security. <p>And a retirement used to be a three-legged stool. You used to have a pension, then you had your Social Security, then you had your own private savings. Right? And you put that all together, and you could retire. But today, most workers don't have a pension in America. Just half work for an employer that offers any kind of retirement plan. Social Security check is critical, but oftentimes, that monthly check, that's not enough. And while the stock market has doubled over the last 5 years, that doesn't help somebody if you don't have a 401(k). <p>So what I've asked Congress to do is work with me to give more people more retirement security. Let's fix an upside-down Tax Code that right now gives the wealthiest Americans big tax breaks to save, but does almost nothing for middle class folks, doesn't give them the same kinds of tax advantages. That's not fair. And we need to give every American access to an automatic IRA on the job so they can save at work. <p>Now, I'm hoping that Congress goes along with this, but I'm not going to wait for Congress. I could do more with Congress, but I'm not going to not do anything without Congress, not when it's about the basic security and dignity of American workers. So here's what I'm going to do today. This is what this little table is set up for. I'm going to sign a Presidential memorandum that directs the U.S. Treasury Secretary, Jack Lew, to create a new way for working Americans to start their own retirement savings. And as soon as I sign this, Jack Lew will get the memo. He is right here. So I'm going to be able to just&mdash;here, here's your memo. <p>And we're calling it \\"MyRA.\\" Not IRA, MyRA. And what it is, it's a new type of savings bond that we can set up without legislation that encourages Americans to begin to build a nest egg. And it's simple. Workers can contribute through automatic deductions in their paychecks, just like those of you who have an employer-sponsored pension fund can do. They can keep the same account even if they change jobs, so they can carry it over. It's safe. These accounts balance&mdash;account balances will never go down in value. They're backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government. And it's affordable. So you can open an account with as little as $25. You can contribute as little as $5 at a time. <p>But what that means is, for those of you who don't have a 401(k) on the job, don't have a pension on the job, don't have a mechanism to start saving&mdash;especially younger workers&mdash;you can get started now. And in an emergency, you can withdraw contributions without paying a penalty. So it's a pretty good deal. And what I'm hoping is that working Americans will take a look, because I want more people to have the chance to save for retirement through their hard work. And this is just one step that we can take to help more people do that. <p>So this is the opportunity agenda that's going to help restore some sense of economic security in this 21st-century economy. We want jobs that are more plentiful. We want skills that keep you employable. We want savings that are portable. We want health care that's yours and that's not going to be canceled when you really need it. We want every American who works hard and takes responsibility to retire with dignity after decades of honest work. These are real, practical, achievable solutions to help shift the odds back a little bit in favor of more working and middle class Americans, so that if they work hard, they can get ahead, and they can leave something for the next generation. <p>And that's something that U.S. Steel knows a little bit about. For over a hundred years, people throughout the Mon Valley and across this country have been punching in at plants just like this one. You've been keeping the furnaces blasting, keeping the cold mill rolling, carrying on the tradition of hard work and determination. We've got two-, three-generation steelworkers at this plant right here. And I know for a lot of you, this is more than a job. This is a team. This is a family that you're proud to be a part of. <p>Now, Robin Birk is with me today. Decades ago, her granddad worked for Union Switch and Signal in Pittsburgh, making parts for railroads. Her dad worked for U.S. Steel for over 30 years, rising to plant manager. Robin's been a safety manager here for 23 years. And I want to share something Robin said. She said: \\"When I was growing up, I would think about what my grandfather and father did for a living, and I always thought my brother would be the one who got to work here. But it ended up being me. Women before me maybe didn't have that opportunity.\\" <p>Now, Robin's dad Bernard, who just passed away a little more than a year ago, he was full of pride for this company. He used to say, \\"When we bleed, we bleed blue\\"&mdash;the color of U.S. Steel. <p>So that pride has run across generation. That's the pride that built this company. And that's the pride that built America. That's the spirit we all need today. That's the resilience, the grit, the determination, and the optimism that keeps the American Dream alive not just for this generation, but for future generations to come. <p>That's what I'm going to be fighting for this year, just like I was for the last 5 years, and for the next 3 years. And I expect all of you to join me in making sure that we deliver that promise to the next generation. <p>And now I'm going to sign this bill. Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. <p>[<i>At this point, the President signed the memorandum.</i>] <p>It's done. I'm going to give it to Jack right now. Here's Jack Lew. I'm going to give it to him. We're going to get it started. Thank you, everybody.\" "
"18" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Raiders. Thank you. Hello, everybody. Hey! Well, it is good to be in Nashville! And it's good to be here at Big Mac. <p>I want to thank Reverend Sinkfield for your words of prayer. I want to thank Ronald for the great introduction. We are very proud of him. He's going somewhere. And he looks very sharp in that bow tie. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to thank the mayor of Nashville, Karl Dean, for having us here today. Mr. Mayor. You've got two outstanding Members of Congress who are here, Steve Cohen and Jim Cooper. And I want to acknowledge one of the finest public servants that we've ever had and a native of&mdash;proud native of Tennessee, Mr. Al Gore is here as well. <p>To the superintendent and your outstanding principal and all the teachers and, most importantly, the students, as well as all the parents who are doing an outstanding job, I just want to say thank you. <p>I wanted to come here today because I've heard great things about this high school and all of you. But I also recognize, the past couple days have been hard and have tested people's spirits. Some of you lost a good friend. So I wanted you to know that Michelle and I have been praying for all of you and the community. And I know that all of us are sending prayers to those families that have been so directly impacted. It's been heartbreaking. <p>I'd been planning to come to this school for a while because you've made great strides. You've made great strides, and the reason you've made great strides is because you've worked hard together. And by the way, those of you who have seats, feel free to sit down. [<i>Laughter</i>] Those of you who don't, don't. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>You've been there for each other. In the weeks and months ahead, I hope you keep being there for each other, help each other through challenges and difficulties. This community cares about you. This country cares about you. And we want to celebrate what you've achieved, because the message I want to send here today is, we want every child to have every chance in life, every chance at happiness, every chance at success. <p>On Tuesday, I delivered my State of the Union Address. And&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. Now, what I was going to say right at the top was, \\"The state of the Union is cold.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] But what I instead focused on is a very simple but profound idea, the idea of opportunity. It's at the heart of who we are as Americans. It means that no matter who you are, no matter what you look like, no matter where you come from, if you work hard, if you live up to your responsibilities, you can make it in America. <p>And that's the chance that this country gave me. I'm not very different than a lot of the students who are here, except probably, I was more irresponsible. [<i>Laughter</i>] I was raised by a single mom, with the help of my grandmother and my grandfather. We didn't have a lot of money, and sometimes, my mom was struggling because she was raising two kids and also trying to go to school herself. <p>We lived overseas for a time, but my mother emphasized even then, even when I was 6, 7, 8 years old, that your ticket is an education. And because I was living overseas, she was worried that I'd fall behind. So she used to wake me up before sunrise to do my correspondence courses, to make sure I was keeping up with my American schooling, before I went to school over there. <p>And if you're 7 and 8 and you're waking up at 4:30, 5 in the morning, you don't feel real good. You're not happy. [<i>Laughter</i>] And so I'd grumble and complain, and she'd say, \\"Listen, this is no picnic for me either, buster.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] But she understood that if her son and later her daughter, my sister, got a good education, even if we didn't have a lot, then the world would open up to us. <p>And with that support structure that started at home, but then extended to teachers and communities and a country that was willing to give scholarships and folks who were willing to give me a helping hand and sometimes give me second chances when I made mistakes, through all of that, I was able to go to some of the best colleges in the country, even though we didn't have a lot of money. <p>Michelle, my wife, the daughter of a blue-collar worker and a secretary, was able to go to some of the best schools in the country. And we were able to achieve things that our parents and our grandparents could have never imagined, could have never dreamed of. And I want every young person in America to have that same chance, every single one. <p>And that's why, in my speech on Tuesday night, I laid out an agenda where we need to grow our economy for everybody, we need to strengthen the middle class, we've got to make it easier for folks to work their way into the middle class. An opportunity agenda that has four parts: more new jobs; making sure folks have the skills to fill those jobs; making sure that we are rewarding hard work with a living wage and incomes; and the thing that I'm here to talk about right here, guaranteeing every young person access to a world-class education, every single one. <p>Now, sometimes, we only hear the bad news. So I just want to report on some good news. We have made progress when it comes to education in America. Right now our high school graduation rate is the highest that it's been in 30 years. The dropout rate has been falling, and for example, the Latino dropout rate has been cut in half over the last 10 years. <p>When I came into office, we took on a financial aid system running through the banks that was good for the banks, but wasn't good for students. We reformed it, providing billions of more dollars to millions of more students. And now we've got more young people graduating from college than ever before. <p>And then, to spark reform, 5 years ago, we started a competition that we call Race to the Top to promote innovation and reform in America's schools. Tennessee was one of the first States to win that competition. And because of that commitment&mdash;bringing together educators and parents and businesses and elected officials at State and Federal levels&mdash;because of all that, you are actually the fastest improving State in the Nation. <p>You've given teachers more support. You've founded new ways to identify and reward the best teachers. You've made huge strides in helping young people learn the skills they need for a new economy, skills like problem-solving and critical thinking, science, technology, engineering, math. In Nashville alone, you've boosted graduation rates by almost 20 percent in about a decade. That's something you should be very proud of. <p>So I want us to take the lessons we've learned and are learning in terms of what's working and make sure more schools are able to do some of the things you're doing. I want to build on what works. But to do that, we've got to reach more kids, and we've got to do it faster. Because my attitude is, there's no child that we should let slip simply because of politics or because adults can't get their act together. We've got to make sure that we're reaching every single one of them as fast as we can. And right now we're not doing that. <p>So here's where we should start. Research shows that high-quality early education is one of the best investments we can make in a child's life. We know that. And it's a&mdash;not only is it good for the child, it's a smart investment. Every dollar you put into early childhood education, the Government will&mdash;taxpayers will save $7 because you have fewer dropouts, fewer teen pregnancies, fewer&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> Incarcerations. <p><i>The President.</i>&mdash;&mdash;incarcerations. Thank you. [<i>Laughter</i>] Folks will get better jobs, pay more taxes. So it's a win-win for everybody. <p>And last year I asked Congress, help States make high-quality pre-kindergarten available to every 4-year-old in America. Now, the good news is, 30 States have decided to raise some pre-K funding on their own. And school districts like this one have plans to open dedicated pre-K centers with space for hundreds of young kids. And we did get a little help from Congress earlier this month. But while we got a little help, we need more help. Because even with the efforts of your superintendent and folks who are working hard in this school district, there are still going to be some kids who could use the help, but aren't getting it. <p>So Congress, I'd like to see them act more boldly than they are. But while Congress decides if it's willing to give every child that opportunity, I'm not waiting. So we're going to bring business leaders from all across the country and philanthropists from all across the country who are willing to help work with school districts, mayors, Governors to make sure more young people every single year are getting access to the high-quality pre-K that they need. That's going to be a project over the next 3 years. <p>We also need to give students access to the world's information. Technology is not the sole answer for a child's education. Having a good teacher is what is most important, and having great parents is even more important than that. But in this modern, 21st-century economy, technology helps. It can be a powerful tool to leverage good teaching. <p>So last year, I pledged to connect 99 percent of our students to high-speed broadband over 5 years. And with help of the Federal Communications Commission, the FCC, we're making a downpayment on that goal by connecting more than 15,000 schools, 20 million students over the next 2 years, so that there is wireless in every classroom. <p>And we are going to hit that goal of&mdash;there's not going to be a child in a school in America that does not have the kind of wireless connection that allows them to stream in the information they need that can power their education. That's going to be a priority. We've got&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. And I want to acknowledge, by the way, we've got companies like Apple, Microsoft, Sprint, Verizon; they're going to help students and teachers use the latest tools to accelerate learning. <p>Now, we also need to encourage more schools to rethink not just what they teach, but how they teach it. And that's where what you're doing here is so important. If you're a student here, your experience is a little different from students at other high schools. Starting in 10th grade, you get to choose from one of four academies that allow you to focus on a specific subject area. <p>Local businesses are doing their part by giving students opportunities to connect the lessons you learn in the classroom with jobs that are actually out there to be filled. <p>So students in the Academy of Business and Finance, they're operating their own credit union here at the school and doing some work in a real one over the summer. If you choose Digital Design and Communication, you get to spend time in a TV studio designed by a local business partner. If you choose the Aviation and Transportation Academy, you get to learn how to operate a 3-D printer and work on your very own airplane. Now, that's pretty cool. I did not get my own plane until I was 47 years old. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member.</i> And it's big. <p><i>The President.</i> But&mdash;yes, it's a nice plane, but I've got to give it back. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's the only thing. It's a rental. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But the idea is simple, but powerful: Young people are going to do better when they're excited about learning, and they're going to be more excited if they see a connection between what they're doing in the classroom and how it is applied. If they see a connection between&mdash; all right, the math that I'm doing here, this connects to the business that's going on out there. The graphic design I'm doing here, I am learning now what that means in terms of marketing or working for a company that actually gets paid to do this, which means I might get paid to do it. And I'm seeing people who may open up for me entire new career options that I didn't even realize. <p>So that makes words on a page exciting and real and tangible. And then schools like this one teach you everything you need to succeed in college, but because of that hands-on experience, you're able to create pathways to make sure that folks also are able, if they choose not to go to a 4-year institution, potentially get a job sooner. <p>And it's working. Over the past 9 years, the graduation rate here has gone up 22 percent. [<i>Applause</i>] Twenty-two percent. Last year, attendance across the district, which includes 12 academy high schools, was higher than ever. Thousands of students are getting a head start on their future years before many of their peers do. And it's great for businesses because they're developing a pool of workers who already have the skills that they're looking for. <p>Now, every community is different, with different needs, different approaches. But if Nashville can bring schools and teachers and businesses and parents together for the sake of our young people, then other places can. So that's why my administration is already running a competition to redesign high schools through employer partnerships that combine a quality education with real-world skills and hands-on learning. <p>I want to encourage more high schools to do what you are doing. That's why we're also in the process of shaking up our system of higher education so that when you graduate from high school ready to succeed in college, it's easier to afford college. And we're also working to help more students pay off their student loan debt once they graduate. A quality education shouldn't be something that those other kids get, it's something that all kids get. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Including DREAMers. <p><i>The President.</i> Absolutely. <p>Now, the other day, I heard the story of a recent graduate here named Sara Santiago. Where is Sara? There's Sara right here. I want to&mdash;I hope I'm not embarrassing Sara. I'm going to tell her story. <p>Sara's parents came to America from Guatemala, and she struggled her freshman year&mdash;I think she'll admit it. In her own words, she was \\"one of the bad kids.\\" Now, she doesn't look that bad. [<i>Laughter</i>] I promise you, I was bad. [<i>Laughter</i>] You might not have been that bad, but probably, you weren't taking your studies that seriously. And then she took a broadcasting class with a teacher named Barclay Randall. Now&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. There's Mr. Randall right back there. Go ahead and wave, Mr. Randall. [<i>Applause</i>] That's Mr. Randall. Now, Mr. Randall is over there with the press right now because some of his students are covering this event; they're doing some reporting. So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>But when Sara was in Mr. Randall's class, he helped her discover this passion for filmmaking. And pretty soon, Sara's grades started to improve. So she won the school's best editing award. Then she got an internship with Country Music Television, one of your business partners. And then she was accepted to the prestigious Savanna College of Art and Design. And she gives credit to Mr. Randall for this. She says: \\"Mr. Randall gave me a second chance. He saw things I never saw in myself. He's the person who helped me change.\\" <p>Now, giving every student that chance, that's our goal. That's what America is all about. We work and study hard and chase our individual success, but we are also pulling for each other, and we've got each other's backs. And as a nation, we make the investment in every child as if they're our children. Because we're saying to ourselves, if every child is successful, then the world my child grows up in will be more successful. The America that my child grows up in will be more successful. <p>So there are some lessons that we've got to absorb as a nation. Where we can, we've got to start early. Get to kids when they're 3, 4 years old, because not every parent has got the same resources and we've got to help them get that good start for that child. We've got to make sure that we are supporting our teachers, because they are the most critical ingredient in a school. And we've got to show them how important they are, which means giving them the professional development they need, giving them the support that they need, and giving them the pay that they need. <p>We've got to make sure that our high schools engage our children. And not every child is going to go on the same path at the same speed, but we can restructure how our high schools operate to make sure every child is engaged. And the more we can link them to real hands-on experience, the more likely they are to be engaged. <p>And we've got to make college affordable for every young person in America. But we can do all that; we'll still be missing something if we don't capture the spirit that Mr. Randall showed with Sara. That investment in our children, nothing is more important. And it doesn't cost any money, the initial spirit. The spirit then can express itself by us putting more resources into schools that need it. <p>But that spirit that every child matters, that's something that we can all embrace. We help each other along in good times and bad. And if America pulls together now around our young people, if we do our part to make sure every single child can go as far as their passions and hard work will take them, then we will keep the American Dream alive not just for your generation, but for generations to come. <p>That's my goal. I hope it is yours too. <p>Thank you, Nashville, for the great job. Thank you, Raiders. I appreciate you. God bless you.\" "
"19" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. Hello, hello, hello. Well, it's good to be in Wisconsin! It's good to be in Waukesha. Now, I've always appreciated the hospitality that Packer Country gives a Bears fan. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, I remember when I was up here campaigning the first time, and there were some \\"Cheeseheads for Obama\\"&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and I felt pretty good about that. Neither of us feel that good about our seasons, but that's okay. There's always next year. <p>We have three of your outstanding elected officials with us here today. We've got Congresswoman Gwen Moore; we've got the mayor of Milwaukee, Tom Barrett; and we have Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele. And we've got your former Governor, Jim Doyle. And it's also good to see&mdash;I had a chance to see backstage somebody who was a huge part of my economic team before she became chancellor of the University of Wisconsin&mdash;Madison: Dr. Becky Blank is here. And we just want to give Becky a big round of applause. She said she missed Washington, but she doesn't really. [<i>Laughter</i>] She was just saying that to be nice. <p>I'm so proud of Reggie, and I'm grateful for the terrific introduction. I want to thank Jim for showing me around the plant. <p>I have come here to talk with you about something that I spent a lot of time on in my State of the Union Address on Tuesday: the idea that no matter who you are, if you are willing to work hard, if you're willing to take on responsibility, you can get ahead, the idea of opportunity here in America. <p>Now, we're at a moment where businesses like GE have created 8 million new jobs over the past 4 years. And that's good news. Our unemployment rate is the lowest that it's been in more than 5 years. Our deficits have been cut in half. Housing is rebounding. Manufacturing is adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s. We sell more of what we make here in America to other countries than we ever have before. <p>Today we learned that in the second half of last year, our economy grew by 3.7 percent. Well, we still have more work to do, but that's pretty strong. And our businesses led the way. Over the past year, the private sector grew faster than at any time in over a decade. <p>And that's why I believe this can be a breakthrough year for America. After 5 years of hard work, digging ourselves out of the worst recession of our lifetimes, we are now better positioned in the 21st century than any other country on Earth. We've got all the ingredients we need to make sure that America thrives. And the question for folks in Washington is whether they're going to help or they're going to hinder that progress, whether they're going to waste time creating new crises that slow things down or they're going to spend time creating new jobs and opportunity. <p>Because the truth is&mdash;and you know this in your own lives, and you see it in your neighborhoods and among your friends and family&mdash;even though the economy has been growing for 4 years, even though corporate profits have been doing very well, stock prices have soared, most folks' wages haven't gone up in over a decade. The middle class has been taking it on the chin even before the financial crisis, too many Americans working harder than ever just to get by, let alone get ahead. And then, there are too many Americans who still are out of work here in Wisconsin and around the country. So we've got to reverse those trends if we're going to be serious about giving opportunity to everybody. <p>And that's why, on Tuesday, I laid out some new steps that we can take right now to speed up economic growth and strengthen the middle class and build ladders of opportunity into the middle class. Some of the ideas I presented I'm going to need Congress for. But America cannot stand still, and neither will I. So wherever I can take steps to expand opportunity, to help working families, that's what I'm going to do, with or without Congress. I want to work with them, but I can't wait for them. We've got too much work to do out there, because the defining project of our generation&mdash;what we have to tackle right now, what has driven me throughout my Presidency, and what will drive me until I wave goodbye&mdash;is making sure that we're restoring opportunity to every single person in America. <p>Now, this opportunity agenda that I put forward has four parts. First part is creating more new jobs: jobs in American manufacturing, American exports, American energy, American innovation. And by the way, this plant represents all those things. You've seen new jobs being built in part because we've had this amazing energy boom in this country. And the engines that are built here, a lot of them are being utilized in that new energy production. We're exporting a whole bunch of these engines overseas. <p>The manufacturing that's taking place here isn't just good for this plant, it has spillover effects throughout the economy. And what's also true is, is that manufacturing jobs typically pay well. We want to encourage more of them. And there's also innovation going on at this plant. So the engines that were built 25 years ago aren't the same as the engines we're building today. <p>So the first thing is, let's create more new jobs. Number two, we've got to train Americans with the skills to fill those jobs. Americans like Reggie, we've got to get them ready to take those jobs. Number three, we've got to guarantee every child access to a world-class education, because that's where the foundation starts for them to be able to get a good job. <p>And then, number four, we've got to make sure hard work pays off. If you work hard, you should be able to support a family. You may not end up being wildly rich, but you should be able to pay your mortgage, your car note, look after your family, maybe take a vacation once in a while&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;no, especially when it's kind of cold. [<i>Laughter</i>] Yeah, yeah, yeah. At the State of the Union, I was going to start out by saying, the state of the Union is cold. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I decided that was not entirely appropriate. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So on Tuesday, I talked about what it will take to attract more good-paying jobs to America, everything from changing our Tax Code so we're rewarding companies that invest here in the United States instead of folks who are parking profits overseas, to boosting more natural gas production. But in this rapidly changing economy, we also have to make sure that folks can fill those jobs. And that's why I'm here today. <p>I know some folks in Wisconsin can remember a time, a few decades ago, when finding a job in manufacturing wasn't hard at all. If you basically wanted a job, you showed up at a factory, you got hired. If you worked hard, you could stay on the job. But our economy is changing. Not all of today's good jobs need a 4-year degree, but the ones that don't need a college degree do need some specialized training. We were looking at some of the equipment here. It's 5 million dollars' worth of equipment. GE is going to be a little nervous if they just kind of put you there on the first day and say, here, run this thing&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;because if you mess up, you mess up. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So that's a challenge for workers, and it's a challenge for companies who want to build things here and want to bring jobs back from overseas. As one of the top executives here put it, Brian White, \\"If we're going to have a manufacturing base in this country, we've got to find a way to have manufacturing employees.\\" <p>Now, the good news is that folks across Wisconsin have set out to do just that. This plant is a great example of that. That's why we're here, in addition to just, you seem like very nice people. [<i>Laughter</i>] But we're here because you're doing some really good stuff that everybody else needs to pay attention to. Together with a local high school, you started a youth apprenticeship program. So students spend 4 hours a day in the classroom, 4 hours on the shop floor. After 2 years, they leave with both a high school diploma and a technical certificate. <p>Then, you set up an adult apprenticeship program so that folks can earn while they learn. You're working with partners from the Wisconsin Regional Training Partnership to Mayor Barrett's manufacturing partnership, to more than 50 other employers, big and small, across the region in order to spot job openings months in advance and then design training programs specifically for the openings. You even helped set up a \\"schools to skills\\" program with a local business alliance to bring kids to factories and help inspire them to pursue careers in manufacturing. <p>And I just want to make a quick comment on that. A lot of parents, unfortunately, maybe when they saw a lot of manufacturing being offshored, told their kids, \\"You don't want to go into the trades, you don't want to go into manufacturing, because you'll lose your job.\\" Well, the problem is that what happened, a lot of young people no longer see the trades and skilled manufacturing as a viable career. But I promise you, folks can make a lot more, potentially, with skilled manufacturing or the trades than they might with an art history degree. Now, nothing wrong with an art history degree&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I love art history. So I don't want to get a bunch of e-mails from everybody. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm just saying, you can make a really good living and have a great career without getting a 4-year college education as long as you get the skills and the training that you need. <p>So back to what you guys are doing. All this work has paid off. It's one of the reasons why, over the past 4 years, you've grown your manufacturing workforce by nearly half. So what you're doing at this plant and across this region can be a model for the country, which is why I've asked Congress to fund more reliably proven programs that connect more ready-to-work Americans with ready-to-be-filled jobs. That's what we'd like to see from Congress. <p>Of course, there are a lot of folks who do not have time to wait for Congress. They need to learn new skills right now to get a new job right now. So that's why here today at GE, I'm making it official: Vice President Biden, a man who was raised on the value of hard work and is tenacious, is going to lead an across-the-board review of America's training programs. We've got a lot of programs, but not all of them are doing what they should be doing to get people filled for jobs that exist right now. And we've got to move away from what my Labor Secretary, Tom Perez, calls \\"train and pray.\\" You train workers first, and then you hope they get a job. We can't do that, partly because it costs money to train folks. And a lot of times young people, they take out loans, so they're getting into debt, thinking they've been training for a job. And then, suddenly, there's no job there. <p>What we need to do is look at where are the jobs and take a job-driven approach to training. And that's what you're doing here in Wisconsin. So we've got to start by figuring out which skills employers are looking for. Then we've got to engage the entire community. We've got to help workers earn the skills they need to do the job that exists. And then, we've got to make sure that we're continually following up and upgrading things, because companies are constantly shifting their needs. <p>So what we're going to do is, we're going to review all of Federal job training programs, soup to nuts. And then we're also going to be supporting local ones. I've asked Vice President Biden and top officials in the Federal Government to reach out to Governors, mayors, business leaders, labor leaders, Democratic and Republican Members of Congress. Let's find what programs are working best, and let's duplicate them and expand them. <p>And later this year, I'm going to ask Tom Perez, my Secretary of Labor, to apply those lessons as we conduct the next round of a national competition we're going to set up, challenging community colleges to partner with local employers and national industries to design job-driven training programs. And we're going to have at least one winner from every State. And we're going to invest nearly $500 million in the partnerships that show the most potential. So we're putting some real money behind this. <p>Now, we know that we've got to start training our younger workers better and that a worker's first job can set them on an upward trajectory for life. So we should do something as a country that you're doing right here, and that is, create more apprenticeship opportunities that put workers on a path to the middle class. Part of the problem for a lot of young people is, they just don't know what's out there. If you've never worked on a plant floor, you don't know what's involved, you don't know what it is. If you don't have a dad or a mom or an uncle or somebody who gives you some sense of that, you may not know how interesting the work is and how much you can advance. <p>So while we redouble our efforts to train today's workforce, we've got to make sure that we're doing everything we can to expand apprenticeships. And I'm going to call on American companies all across the country, particularly manufacturers, to set up more apprenticeship programs. <p>And we've got to make sure that once folks are through training, once they get a job, that the hard work pays off for every single American. I talked about this in my State of the Union. Incomes, wages have not gone up as fast as corporate profits and the stock market have gone up. And that's a problem for the economy as a whole, because if all the gains are just at the top, ordinary folks aren't doing better, then they're not shopping. They're not buying new cars; they're not buying new appliances; they're not buying the new home. And that depresses the entire economy. When there's money in the pockets of ordinary folks, everybody does better, including businesses. <p>Now, today, women make up half our workforce. They're making 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. <p><i>Audience member.</i> That's wrong! <p><i>The President.</i> That's wrong. Who said that? That's wrong. It's wrong. [<i>Applause</i>] It's an embarrassment. So I mentioned on Tuesday, women deserve equal pay for equal work. Women deserve to have a baby without sacrificing her job and should be able to get a day off when the kid gets sick. Dads need that too. <p>We've got to give women the opportunity&mdash;every opportunity that she deserves. As I said on Tuesday, when women succeed, America succeeds. And by the way, when women succeed, men succeed. Because I don't know about all the guys here, but when Michelle is doing good and happy, I'm happy too. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm just saying. But also, just the economics of it, because we now live in a society where if you've got two breadwinners, that sure helps make ends meet. So if a woman is getting cheated, that's a family issue for the whole family, not just for her. <p>Now, women hold a majority of lower wage jobs. But they're not the only ones who are getting stifled by stagnant wages. As Americans, we all understand some folks are going to make more money than others. And we don't actually envy their success. When they're worked hard, they make a lot of money, that's great. Michelle and I were talking; Michelle's dad was a blue-collar worker, worked at a water filtration plant down in Chicago. Mom was a secretary. My mom was a single mom. They never made a lot of money. They weren't worrying about what the rich and famous were doing. They weren't going around saying, well, I don't have a fur coat and a Ferrari. They just wanted to make sure that if they were working hard, they could look after their family. <p>And that's how I think most Americans, that's how we all feel. Americans overwhelmingly agree, nobody who works full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty. They shouldn't have to do it. <p>So this is why I've been spending some time talking about the minimum wage. Right now the Federal minimum wage doesn't even go as far as it did back in 1950. We've seen States and cities raising their minimum wages on their own, and I support these efforts, including the one that's going on right here in Wisconsin. As a chief executive, I'm going to lead by example. I talked about this on Tuesday. I'm going to issue an Executive order requiring Federal contractors to pay the federally funded employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour. Because if you're a cook or washing dishes for our troops on a base, you shouldn't have to live in poverty. <p>Of course, to reach millions more people, Congress is going to need to catch up with the rest of the country. There's a bill in Congress right now to raise the Federal minimum wage to $10.10&mdash;the 10-10 bill. It's easy to remember: 10-10. And they should say yes to it. Give America a raise. <p>Making work pay also means access to health care that's there when you get sick. The Affordable Care Act means nobody is going to get dropped from their insurance or denied coverage because of a preexisting condition like back pain or asthma. You can't be charged more if you're a woman. Those days are over. More Americans are signing up for private health insurance every day. So if you know somebody who isn't covered&mdash;the great thing about this shop is, because of strong union leadership and GE is a great company, most of the folks who work here, they've got good health insurance. But you've got friends, family members, maybe kids who are older than 26&mdash;because if they're younger than 26, they should be able to stay on your plan, thanks to the law that we passed, but if they don't have health insurance right now&mdash; call them up, sit them down, help them get covered at healthcare.gov by March 31. <p>So these things are all going to help advance opportunity, restore some economic security: more good jobs, skills that keep you employed, savings that are portable, health care that's yours and can't be canceled or dropped if you get sick, a decent wage to make sure, if you're working hard, it pays off. These are real, practical, achievable solutions to help shift the odds back in favor of more working families. <p>That's what all of you represent, just like the Americans who are on this stage. Several of these folks graduated from one of your training programs last year, including Reggie. And as you heard Reggie say, he feels like he \\"won the Super Bowl of life.\\" But just like the real Super Bowl, success requires teamwork. So as they earned the skills that put them on the path to the middle class, Reggie and folks in the program had to look out for each other. They had to help each other out. Sometimes, if one of them slipped, they had to come together and make sure nobody missed a beat. <p>And that's the attitude it's going to take for all of us to build the world's best trained workforce. That's the attitude it's going to take to restore opportunity for everybody who's willing to work hard. And it won't be easy, and sometimes, some folks will slip, but if we come together and push forward, everybody as a team, I'm confident we're going to succeed. We've seen it here in Wisconsin. We can make sure it happens all across the country. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless America. Thank you. And now I'm going to sign this Executive order to make sure we got everybody trained out there. <p>[<i>At this point, the President greeted event participants.</i>] <p><i>Audience member.</i> Obama! <p><i>The President.</i> Hey, I hear you out there. <p>[<i>The President continued to greet event participants.</i>] <p><i>Audience member. </i>Obama! <p><i>The President.</i> Hey, hey, nice to see you. <p>[<i>The President signed the memorandum on job-driven training for workers.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Ready to go. There you go. All right.\" "
"20" "\"Thank you, everybody. Everybody, please have a seat. <p>Well, first of all, let me just thank Erick for being here, for sharing his story, for his service to our country. I hope that listening to Erick here, everybody recognizes what a great success story this is, but also the notion that somebody with this kind of skill and talent was having difficulty finding a job indicates the challenge that we face. And I want to thank all of you&mdash;business leaders and philanthropists, elected officials, all levels and members of my Cabinet and the administration&mdash;not only for coming, but for committing to more success stories for people like Erick, making sure that everybody in this country who wants to work has a chance to get ahead and not just get a paycheck, but also the dignity and the structure that a job provides people. <p>On Tuesday, I delivered my State of the Union Address. And I said that while the economy is getting stronger and businesses like yours have created more than 8 million new jobs over the past 4 years, our unemployment rate is lower than it's been in over 5 years, we all know we've still got a lot more to do to build an economy where everybody who is willing to work hard and take responsibility can get ahead. We've got to do more to restore opportunity for every American. <p>And the opportunity agenda I laid out begins with doing everything we can to create new jobs here in America: jobs in construction and manufacturing, jobs in American innovation and American energy. There are steps we can take to streamline our Tax Code to incentivize companies to invest here. There are things that we can do to make sure that we are continuing to lead the world in innovation and basic research. There&mdash;we've got a whole lot of infrastructure we can build that could put people to work right away. We've got a couple trillion dollars' worth of deferred maintenance in America, and the ramifications of us taking that on would be significant. So we've got to grow faster and put more shoulders behind the wheel of expanding economic growth. <p>Step two is making sure that every American has the skills to fill those jobs. Step three, we've got to guarantee every child access to a world-class education, from early childhood to college, to a career. And step four, we've got to make sure that hard work pays off, with wages you can live on, savings you can retire on, health insurance that's there for you when you need it. <p>Now, today we're here to focus on that second point: connecting more ready-to-work Americans with ready-to-be-filled jobs so that folks who are out of work can apply the skills that they've already got. And getting people back on the job faster is one of our top priorities. But I have to confess, last month, Congress made that harder by letting unemployment insurance expire for more than a million people. And each week that Congress fails to restore that insurance, roughly 72,000 Americans will join the ranks of the long-term unemployed who have also lost their economic lifeline. <p>And for our fellow Americans who have been laid off through no fault of their own, unemployment insurance is often the only source of income they've got to support their families while they look for a new job. So when Erick was out of work, it's a lot harder to look for work if you can't put gas in the gas tank, if you're worried about whether there's food on the table for your kid. If Mom isn't making the rent and paying her phone bill, it's a lot harder for her to follow up with a potential employer. Unemployment insurance provides that extra bit of security so that losing your livelihood doesn't mean you lose everything that you've worked so hard to build. And that's true whether you've been out of work for 1 month or 6 months. <p>But folks who have been unemployed the longest often have the toughest time getting back to work. It's a cruel catch-22: The longer you're unemployed, the more unemployable you may seem. Now, this is an illusion, but it's one that unfortunately we know statistically is happening out there. According to one study, if you've been out of work 8 months, you're likely to get called back for an interview only about half as often as if you've been out of work 1 month, even with the identical r&eacute;sum&eacute;. So we are here tonight to say that's not right. Because we know there are folks like Erick, all across this country, who have enormous skills, enormous talents, enormous capacity. But they need a chance. <p>I invited Misty DeMars to my speech on Tuesday night. A mother of two young boys, she'd been steadily employed since she was a teenager, put herself through college, had never collected unemployment benefits, never depended on the Federal Government, extraordinarily impressive young woman. When she lost her job to budget cuts, she couldn't find another, she turned to unemployment insurance to make sure she and her husband could keep the new home they had just spent their life savings to buy. And as I said on Tuesday, she wrote to me and saying: \\"I'm confident I'll find a job. I will pay my taxes. I will raise our kids in the home that we purchased in a community that we love. Please give us this chance.\\" And I thought that spoke for so many Americans out there: Just give us this chance. <p>They're our neighbors, they're our friends: young and old; Black, White; men, women; Ph.D.'s and GEDs. The interesting thing, by the way, is statistically, the long-term unemployed are oftentimes slightly better educated, in some cases better qualified than folks who just lost their job. Just because you've been out of work for a while does not mean that you are not a hard worker. It just means you had bad luck or you were in the wrong industry or you lived in a region of the country that's catching up a little slower than others in the recovery. <p>And I've heard from too many of these folks who show up early; they will outwork anybody. They fill out 100 applications, 200 applications. They're sending out r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, still finding time to volunteer in their community or helping out at church. Sometimes, they have more experience, education, and skill than newly unemployed Americans. They just need that chance. <p>Somebody will look past that stretch of unemployment, put it in the context of the fact that we went through the worst financial and economic crisis in our lifetimes, which created a group of folks who were unemployed longer than normal. They just need employers to realize it doesn't reflect at all on their abilities or their value. It just means they've been dealing with the aftermath of this really tough job market that&mdash;and all they need is a fair shot. And with that shot, an out-of-work young person can get the critical experience he needs to improve his employment prospects for the rest of his life. With that shot, someone with decades of experience could get back in the game and show a younger worker the ropes. We can give them that shot. And that's what today is all about. <p>And we really don't have an alternative, because giving up on the unemployed will create a drag on our economy that we cannot tolerate. Giving up on any American is something America cannot do. And Erick, I think, made an important point during his early remarks. Oftentimes folks, no matter how skilled you are, how confident you are, you get discouraged. And that affects people's physical health. It affects their mental health. And over time, you can have a negative feedback, where it becomes harder and harder for folks to get back in the game because they're just getting so many discouraging messages. And that can have long-term impact, particularly if it's early on in a young person's career. <p>So while Congress decides whether or not it's going to extend unemployment insurance for these Americans, we're going to go ahead and act. We know what works, and we're going to go ahead and see what we can do without additional legislation to make some serious dents in the long-term unemployment problem. <p>We know what works for employers and employees alike. I spoke on Tuesday about Andra Rush, the head of Detroit Manufacturing Systems. She was with us at the State of the Union, sitting with the First Lady. When she was staffing up her new factory, she worked with the local American Jobs Centers&mdash;federally funded&mdash;to hire people who were out of the job, but ready to work. On average, they'd been unemployed for 18 months. Today, she says, they are some of her best employees. <p>Greg Merrity is here today. Greg has been working in sales for 30 years. When he lost his job in December 2011, for the first time in his life, he found himself struggling to capitalize on decades of work experience. After months of sending out r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, pounding the pavement, Greg's unemployment insurance ran out. And he began, like Erick described, to start feeling hopeless and start feeling useless. Then last year, he got hooked up with an organization called Skills for Chicagoland's Future, which actually got its start thanks in part to the great work of Penny Pritzker, our Secretary of Commerce, as well as my former Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel. <p>And so this intermediary trains folks like Greg with the skills they need to get placed right away in one of the local companies. And just 2 weeks after enrolling, Greg was back on the job, helping people get signed up for the health insurance they need. And Greg said, \\"SCF made me feel relevant again, like I have something to offer.\\" <p>So today more than 80 of the Nation's largest businesses, over 200 small and medium-sized businesses are announcing their commitment to a set of best practices, like Greg and Misty and Erick can access and feel as if they can have a partner in getting back on the job and making the contributions that we know they can make. And so I want to thank all the companies who have made this commitment. <p>With the support of Andrew Liveris and Ursula Burns, chairing the Business Council, and Randall Stephenson at the Business Roundtable, as well as the Society for Human Resource Management, we've engaged employers of all sizes, all around the country&mdash;including many who are here today&mdash;to commit to a set of inclusive hiring policies, from making sure recruiting and screening practices don't disadvantage folks who have been out of work to establishing an open-door policy that actively encourages all qualified applicants. <p>And of course, it's only right that the Federal Government lead by example. So today I am directing every Federal agency to make sure we are evaluating candidates on the level, without regard to their employment history. Because every job applicant deserves a fair shot. <p>And I just had a chance to meet with some of the CEOs who are making these commitments. Some of them are already participating with what's going on in Chicago. And they had some great ideas about what they know works. <p>For example, one of the things that we're going to have to examine is the impact of credit histories on the long-term unemployed. If you've been out of work for 18 months, you may have missed some bills. That can't be a barrier then for you getting to work so you can pay your bills. But unfortunately, we're setting up some, in some cases, perverse incentives and barriers. But in some cases what I heard from the CEOs is, it was just a matter of let's pay attention to this. Let's see if we're doing everything we can to look at every candidate on the merits. <p>And I was really grateful to all of them for stepping up in this way. And I'm confident that as a consequence of this initiative we're going to see some progress all across the country. <p>Going back to Greg, his life was turned around because of a partnership that really cares, not just because he got a fair shot, but because he had advocates who helped him earn the skills he needed to land a job that made sense for him. And so that's why we're excited to have programs like Chicagoland's Future and Platform 2 Employment and many others that are represented in this room. As important as it is for the businesses to make these commitments, it's great to have these intermediaries and nonprofits who are also able to show success, even with folks who have been out of work for a long, long time. <p>And my administration is going to partner with the business community and the nonprofit sector. I've asked Joe Biden to lead an across-the-board reform of all our training programs, working with Secretary of Labor Tom Perez, Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker, to make sure that our job training programs have a single mission: train Americans with the skills employers need and then match them to the good jobs that need to be filled right now. That's what we have to prioritize. <p>And today I'm announcing that the Department of Labor is going to put forward $150 million in a Ready To Work Partnership competition to support more partnerships that we know work&mdash;innovative collaborations between local governments, major employers, nonprofits&mdash;all designed to help workers get the skills they need and build bridges to the jobs that require them. <p>So even though our economy is getting stronger, it's not going to be enough until those gains translate into better opportunities for ordinary folks like Erick who are&mdash;have the skills, have the desire, just need a chance. We're going to keep on knocking down barriers to reemployment so more of the nearly 4 million long-term unemployed Americans can regain the stability and security that a good job brings their families&mdash;and by the way, so that they have more money to spend on local businesses, which will lift the entire economy up and create a virtuous cycle instead of a negative one. <p>We're going to keep encouraging employers to welcome all applicants. You never know who is going to have the great next idea to grow your business. We're going to keep building new ladders of opportunity to&mdash;for every American to climb into the middle class. It's good for our economy, but it's also good for our people. <p>We are stronger, as I said on Tuesday, when America fields a full team. So I just want to thank all the businesses here for your commitments, all the nonprofits here for the work that you're already doing on the ground. We are going to scale this up. We are going to make this happen. Most of all, I want to thank Erick and some of the other folks who have experienced success, because&mdash;I told Erick before we came out here&mdash;when folks see him doing well, that gives them hope, and it reminds us that we can't afford to let such incredible talent be wasting away. We've got to get those folks back in the game, and that's what I'm committed to doing, and I know Joe is as well. <p>So thank you very much. I'm now going to sign our new Federal commitment. I appreciate you. And after this, I think you guys still have some more work to do. All right? <p>[<i>At this point, the President signed the memorandum.</i>] <p>There you go. All right. Thank you, everybody.\" "
"21" "\"Hi, everybody. This week, I delivered my State of the Union Address. Today here's the three-minute version. <p>After 4 years of economic growth with 8 million new private sector jobs, our unemployment rate is the lowest it's been in more than 5 years. And with the economy speeding up, companies say they intend to hire more people this year. <p>But while those at the top are doing better than ever, average wages have barely budged. Inequality has deepened. Too many Americans are working harder and harder just to get by. And too many still aren't working at all. <p>Our job is to reverse those trends. It's time to restore opportunity for all people: the idea that no matter who you are, if you work hard and live up to your responsibilities, you can make it if you try. <p>The opportunity agenda I laid out on Tuesday has four parts. This week, I took them on the road. Job one is more new jobs: jobs in construction and manufacturing, jobs in innovation and energy. In Wisconsin, I talked with plant workers at GE about part two: training more Americans with the skills to fill those new jobs. In Tennessee, I talked with students about part three: guaranteeing every child access to a world-class education, from early childhood, through college, and right into a career. And with steelworkers in Pittsburgh and retail workers in Maryland, I laid out part four: making sure hard work pays off for men and women, with wages you can live on, savings you can retire on, and health insurance that's there for you when you need it. <p>These ideas will strengthen the middle class and help more people work their way into the middle class. Some of them will require Congress. But wherever I can take steps to expand opportunity for more families on my own, I will. I'm going to ask business leaders, education leaders, and philanthropic leaders to partner with us to advance these goals. <p>And every single day, I'm going to fight for these priorities: to shift the odds back in favor of more working and middle class and to keep America a place where you can always make it if you try. <p>Thanks. Have a great weekend. And enjoy the Super Bowl.\" "
"22" "\"Hello, everybody. Thank you so much. Well, can everybody please give Nelson a big round of applause for the outstanding job that he did? So Nelson just told me backstage he plans to be on&mdash;plans on being a Navy SEAL. So I was really nice to him now so he doesn't mess with me later. [<i>Laughter</i>] We are very proud of him, proud of all the students who are here today. <p>I want to thank Principal Richardson for the great job that he's doing. And I want to thank all the wonderful teachers who are here at Buck Lodge Middle School. Go, Vikings! <p>I brought along some people who very much care about the future of these young people. We've got America's Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, in the house. We've got the FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler and two of his fellow Commissioners who are here, doing great work. Congressman Steny Hoyer is in the house. County Executive Rushern Baker is here. And we've got some business leaders who've made some very big commitments today, because they know that your education is the very best investment that all of us can make in America. <p>Now, last week, in my State of the Union Address, I spent some time talking about opportunity for everybody, which is at the heart of this country, the idea that no matter who you are, no matter what you look like&mdash;if you have a chair feel free to sit down. [<i>Laughter</i>] That wasn't actually my line, but I thought&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. But at the core of America, the essence of it, what makes us exceptional, is this idea: No matter what you look like, where you come from, what your last name is, if you're willing to work hard, if you're willing to live up to your responsibilities, you can make it here in America. <p>But each generation has to work hard to make sure that dream of opportunity stays alive for the next generation. And the opportunity agenda that I laid out last week will help us do that. It's focused on four areas: number one, more new jobs; number two, training folks with the skills to fill those jobs; number three, making sure our economy rewards hard work with decent wages and economic security; and number four, the piece I'm here to talk about today, guaranteeing every child access to a world-class education. Every child. Not just some, but everybody. <p>Now, I'm only standing here today because my education gave me a chance. I'm not so different than a lot of these young people. I was raised by a single mom, with the help of my grandma and my grandpa. We didn't have a lot of money, and for a while, my mother was working and going to school at the same time as she was raising a couple of kids. And there were times where times were tight. But with a family who loved me and with some hard work on my part&mdash;although it wasn't always consistent, as my mother and my grandparents would point out&mdash;and then ultimately, with the help of scholarships and student loans, I was able to go to college. I was able to go to law school. And an entire worlds of opportunity opened up to me that might not otherwise have been available. <p>So the country invested in me. My parents invested in me, my grandparents invested in me, but my country invested in me. And I want America to now invest in you, because in the faces of these students, these are future doctors and lawyers and engineers, scientists, business leaders. We don't know what kinds of products, services, good work that any of these students may do. But I'm betting on them, and all of us have to bet on them. <p>So, 5 years ago, we set out to change the odds on all of our kids. Our Race to the Top challenge has helped raise expectations and performance in States all across the country. Our high school graduation rate is the highest that it's been in more than 30 years. That's an achievement. The dropout rate among Latino students has been cut in half since 2000, really big deal. We reformed our student loan programs so that more young people are able to afford to go to college, and now we've got more young people earning a college degree than ever before. <p>Teachers and principals across the country are working hard to prepare students like you with the skills you need for a new economy, not just the basics of reading and writing and arithmetic, but skills like science and technology, engineering, critical thinking, creativity, asking, what do you think about that idea and how would you do things differently? <p>Now, we still have more work to do to reach more kids and reach them faster. And some of the ideas that I've presented will require Congress to act. But while Congress decides what it's going to do, I said at the State of the Union&mdash;and I want to repeat here today&mdash;I will act on my own. Wherever I have the opportunity to expand opportunity for more young people, wherever I have a chance to make a difference in their lives, I'm going to act. [<i>Applause</i>] I'm going to act. <p>So, in this year of action, we're going to work with States and communities to help them make high-quality pre-K available to more young children. We know it's a good investment. We want to keep working to partner high schools with colleges and employers to offer real-world education experiences that can lead directly to jobs and careers. And we want to do more to make sure no middle class kid is priced out of a college education and obviously no poor kid is priced out of a college education. That's got to be a priority for us. <p>But today we're here to announce some big strides that we're making to put the world and outer space at every child's fingertips, whether they live in a big city or a quiet suburb or in rural America. <p>Last year, I launched something called ConnectED, a new initiative to close the technology gap in our schools and connect 99 percent of America's students to high-speed broadband Internet within 5 years. Now, this is something we can do without waiting for Congress. We do need some help though. So we picked up the phone, and we started asking some outstanding business leaders to help bring our schools and libraries into the 21st century. Today, thanks to the leadership of some of these companies, we've got some big announcements to make. <p>But first, I want you to know why it matters that we make sure technology is available to every child. Technology is not the entire answer, by the way, when it comes to educational excellence. We've got to make sure we've got outstanding teachers. We've got to make sure that parents are doing what they need to do. We need young people to make the effort and to have high expectations for themselves. But technology can help; it's a tool, it's just one more tool. <p>So today, the average American school has about the same Internet bandwidth as the average American home, but it serves 200 times as many people. All right? Think about it. So you've got the same bandwidth, but it's a school, it's not your house. Only around 30 percent of our students have true high-speed Internet in the classroom. In countries like South Korea, that's a hundred percent. Now, we shouldn't give that kind of competitive advantage over to other countries. We want to make sure our young people have the same advantages that some child in South Korea has right now. In a country where we expect free Wi-Fi with our coffee, we should definitely demand it in our schools. <p>Now, here at Buck Lodge, you are showing how we can use technology to teach our young people in innovative ways. And by the way, the principal told me that part of how this got started was some of the stimulus dollars that we put in place almost 5 years ago now. But every student here has access to their own iPad. And you don't just write papers or take tests; they're animating movies, they're designing blogs, they're collaborating on multimedia projects. In the word of an eighth grader, Annie Gomez, she says, \\"You can learn even more, you can take in more, and then you know more about the world.\\" <p>And new technologies are helping teachers. So in Mr. Jeter's science class, students take quizzes on their tablets; he then can check the answers in real time, and he can figure out who needs extra help. In Ms. Galinat's language arts class, students learn vocabulary not just with flashcards, but with online video. In Ms. Stover's math class&mdash;I was just over with Ms. Stover&mdash;students bring their tablets home to watch lectures about concepts like ratios and rational numbers and then use the next day's classroom time applying those concepts to the real world. So technology allows teachers here to spend more time being creative, less time teaching to the test, giving continual feedback, being able to pinpoint where a young person is having trouble because they're able to see their work right away in a pretty efficient way. <p>And I will say, when I was just in a classroom, there was a lesson plan that was organized around the <i>Curiosity</i> Rover on Mars. And these&mdash;the young people there were doing some amazing stuff, making their own iBooks with video and multimedia. And I was&mdash;as I was walking out, I was talking to Steny Hoyer about how I remember using glue sticks&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and scissors to cut stuff out, and it didn't look very good. [<i>Laughter</i>] These guys were making books you could publish. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But it makes learning exciting; it makes it interesting. If you're studying science and you are actually seeing the engineers who built Rover talk about what it is&mdash;or the <i>Curiosity</i> Rover &mdash;talking about what they're doing and how they did it and being able to see the Rover on the Martian landscape, it makes vivid and real math and science in a way that is more interesting to students, which means that they're more likely to be engaged and can potentially do better. <p>And this is how it should be for every student and every teacher at every school and library in the country. That's how it should be for everybody, not just some. <p>Today, almost 8 months after we launched ConnectED, we can announce some very big commitments that are going to go a long way towards realizing that vision where every child has the access to the technology that they can use to help them learn. So, under Tom Wheeler's leadership, the FCC is announcing a downpayment of $2 billion to connect more than 15,000 schools and 20 million students to high-speed broadband over the next 2 years&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;15,000 schools, 20 million students. It won't require a single piece of legislation from Congress. It won't add a single dime to the deficit. <p>And even better, some of America's biggest tech companies have decided to join this effort, with commitments worth than&mdash;worth more than three-quarters of a billion dollars. So let me just give you some examples. <p>Apple will donate a hundred million dollars' worth of iPads, MacBooks, and other products to schools across the country. That's an enormous commitment. Sprint will provide free wireless service for up to 50,000 low-income high school students over the next 4 years so their 21st-century education isn't confined to the classroom. AT&T will donate over $100 million worth of wireless service to middle school students so that they can continue to do homework when they get home. <p>Autodesk will make its 3-D design software available for free to every high school in the country. Microsoft will offer products like Windows to students and teachers at a deep discount and provide 12 million free copies of Office to our schools. O'Reilly Media and Safari Books Online will donate more than a hundred million dollars' worth of eBooks that will help students learn technology skills like coding and web design. And finally, because no technology will ever be as important as a great teacher, Verizon will expand a program to help train educators to use all these new tools in all 50 States. <p>So I want to thank all the business leaders who are here today for stepping up. Why don't you stand up? Let's give them a big round of applause. We're very proud of them. Thank you. [<i>Applause</i>] <p>Now, this is an extraordinary commitment by these business leaders, but they're business leaders, so they're not just doing it out of the goodness of their heart. They want the country to do well, but they also understand that they want educated customers. They want customers who are able to get good jobs, who are going to be using these tools in the future. They want that next young architect coming out of here to be familiar with using that iPad so that they're designing buildings and using their products. <p>They know that the entire economy will be lifted if more of our young people are doing better. So they're doing good, but it will also help them succeed from a bottom-line perspective by this kind of participation. They are united in their support of young people like you, even though sometimes they compete against each other, because all of us have a stake in your education and in your future. <p>And that's why we have to build on this progress together. Later this year, I'm going to ask Congress to do its part and give teachers using cutting-edge technologies the training they deserve, because it's important. As I said before, technology is not a silver bullet. It's only as good as the teachers who are there using it as one more tool to help inspire and teach and work through problems. <p>And although I've noticed that these days when I visit schools, most teachers are much younger than I am&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I'm getting on in years, obviously, which means that I'm not always as familiar with iPads and technology as I need to be&mdash;we want every teacher in every school to understand, from soup to nuts how, you can potentially use this technology. And that oftentimes requires a training component that makes sure that the technology is not just sitting there, but is actually used and incorporated in the best way possible. <p>So I'm going to ask every business leader across America to join us in this effort. Ask yourself what you can do to help us connect our students to the 21st century. Ask yourselves what you can do to support our teachers and our parents and give every young people every shot at success. <p>And we can make this happen. And just imagine what it will mean for our country when we do. Imagine what it could mean for a girl growing up on a farm to be able to take AP Biology or AP Physics, even if her school is too small to offer it, because she's got the access to technology that allows her to take those classes online. Imagine what it means for a boy with an illness that confines him sometimes to home where he can join his classmates for every lesson with FaceTime or Skype. Imagine what it means for educators to spend less time grading tests and papers, more time helping young people learn. Imagine more businesses starting here and hiring here because they know for a fact that the young people here are going to be equipped with the skills that are better than anybody else on Earth. <p>That's the future we're building. That's what these companies are investing in. And if America pulls together now&mdash;if we do our part to make sure every young person can go as far as their passion and their hard work will take them, whether it's to Mars or to the bottom of the ocean or to anywhere on this planet where you've got an Internet connection&mdash;if we commit ourselves to restoring opportunity for everybody, then we can keep the American Dream alive for generations to come. <p>That's our main project. That's our main obligation. That's why I ran for President. That's what I'm going to be working on for the next 3 years. <p>Thank you for all the work that you're doing here at this outstanding school. God bless you. God bless America. Thank you.\" "
"23" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Spartans! Go Green! <p><i>Audience members.</i> Go White! <p><i>The President.</i> [<i>Laughter</i>] Oh, thank you so much. Everybody, have a seat here. <p>The&mdash;it's good to be at Michigan State. Thank you, Ben, for that wonderful introduction. Give Ben a big round of applause. He's got his beautiful family right here. How did Dad do? Was he pretty good? Where&mdash;yes, there he is. He did good? I thought he did great. <p>It is good to be in East Lansing. It's good to be with all of you here today. I'm here because I've heard about all the great things that you're doing. And I want to thank Mayor Triplett and President Simon for hosting us. <p>I am also here to do some scouting on my brackets. [<i>Laughter</i>] I just talked to Coach Izzo; Spartans are looking pretty good. I know things were a little wild for a while, had some injuries. But the truth is that Coach Izzo, he always paces so that you peak right at the tournament. [<i>Applause</i>] That's a fact. Then I got a chance to meet Mark Dantonio. All right. So you've already got a Rose Bowl victory. You guys are&mdash;you're greedy. [<i>Laughter</i>] You want to win everything. <p>But it's wonderful to be here. I love coming to Michigan. Mainly, I love coming to Michigan because of the people. But I also love coming here because there are few places in the country that better symbolize what we've been through together over these last 4, 5 years. <p>The American auto industry has always been the heartbeat of the Michigan economy and the heart of American manufacturing. So when that heartbeat was flatlining, we all pulled together, all of us&mdash;autoworkers who punched in on the line, management who made tough decisions to restructure, elected officials like Gary Peters and Mark Schauer who believed that&mdash;[a<i>pplause</i>]&mdash;folks who believed that rescuing America's most iconic industry was the right thing to do. <p>And today, thanks to your grit and your ingenuity and dogged determination, the American auto industry's engines are roaring again, and we are building the best cars in the world again. And some plants are running three shifts around the clock, something that nobody would have imagined just a few years ago. So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>I just had lunch with Detroit's new mayor, Mike Duggan. He told me if there's one thing that he wants everybody to know, it's that Detroit is open for business. And I have great confidence that he's going to provide the leadership that we need. Really proud of him. The point is, we've all had to buckle down. We've all had to work hard. We've had to fight our way back these past 5 years. And in a lot of ways, we are now better positioned for the 21st century than any other country on Earth. <p>This morning we learned that our businesses in the private sector created more than 140,000 jobs last month, adding up to about 8&frac12; million new jobs over the past 4 years. Our unemployment rate is now the lowest it's been since before I was first elected. The&mdash;companies across the country are saying they intend to hire even more folks in the months ahead. And that's why I believe this can be a breakthrough year for America. <p>And I've come here today to sign a bill that, hopefully, means folks in Washington feel the same way, that instead of wasting time creating crises that impede the economy, we're going to have a Congress that's ready to spend some time creating new jobs and new opportunities and positioning us for the future and making sure our young people can take advantage of that future. <p>And that's important, because even though our economy has been growing for 4 years now, even though we've been adding jobs for 4 years now, what's still true&mdash;something that was true before the financial crisis, it's still true today&mdash;is that those at the very top of the economic pyramid are doing better than ever, but the average American's wages, salaries, incomes haven't risen in a very long time. A lot of Americans are working harder and harder just to get by, much less get ahead, and that's been true since long before the financial crisis and the great recession. <p>And so we've got to reverse those trends. We've got to build an economy that works for everybody, not just a few. We've got to restore the idea of opportunity for all people, the idea that no matter who you are, what you look like, where you came from, how you started out, what your last name is, you can make it if you're willing to work hard and take responsibility. That's the idea at the heart of this country. That's what's at stake right now. That's what we've got to work on. <p>Now, the opportunity agenda I laid out in my State of the Union Address is going to help us do that. It's an agenda built around four parts. Number one, more new jobs in American manufacturing, American energy, American innovation, American technology. A lot of what you're doing here at Michigan State helps to spur on that innovation in all sorts of areas that can then be commercialized into new industries and to create new jobs. <p>Number two, training folks with the skills to fill those jobs, something this institution does very well. <p>Number three, guaranteeing access to a world-class education for every child, not just some. That has to be a priority. That means before they even start school, we're working on pre-K that's high quality and gets our young people prepared and then takes them all the way through college so that they can afford it, and beyond. <p>Number four, making sure our economy rewards honest work with wages you can live on and savings you can retire on and, yes, health insurance that is there for you when you need it. <p>Now, some of this opportunity agenda that I put forward will require congressional action, it's true. But as I said at the State of the Union, America does not stand still; neither will I. And that's why, over the past 2 weeks, I've taken steps without legislation&mdash;without congressional action&mdash;to expand opportunity for more families. We've created a new way for workers to start their own retirement savings. We've helped to make sure all of our students have high-speed broadband and high-tech learning tools that they need for this new economy. <p>But I've also said I'm eager to work with Congress wherever I can, because the truth of the matter is, is that America works better when we're working together. And Congress controls the purse strings at the Federal level, and a lot of the things that we need to do require congressional action. <p>And that is why I could not be prouder of our leaders who are here today. In particular, I could not be prouder of your own Debbie Stabenow, who has done just extraordinary work. So we all love Debbie for a lot of reasons. She's been a huge champion of American manufacturing, but really shepherded through this farm bill, which was a very challenging piece of business. She worked with Republican Senator Thad Cochran, who I think was very constructive in this process. We had Representatives Frank Lucas, a Republican, working with Collin Peterson, a Democrat. We had a terrific contribution from our own Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack and&mdash;who deserves a big round of applause. <p>And so Congress passed a bipartisan farm bill that is going to make a big difference in communities all across this country. And just so they don't feel left out, I want to recognize one of your Congressmen, who's doing an outstanding job, Dan Kildee, and somebody who was just a wonderful mentor to me when I was in the Senate and has been just a great public servant, not just for your State, but for the entire country, Carl Levin. He's always out there, especially when it comes to our men and women in uniform. We're very proud of him. <p>And while we're at it, we got a couple of out-of-towners: Pat Leahy from Vermont&mdash;there are a lot of dairy farms up there, so he had something to do with it; and Amy Klobuchar from Minnesota. All that cold air is blowing from Minnesota down into&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>Now, despite its name, the farm bill is not just about helping farmers. Secretary Vilsack calls it a jobs bill, an innovation bill, an infrastructure bill, a research bill, a conservation bill. It's like a Swiss Army knife. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's like Mike Trout; it's like&mdash;for those of you who know baseball. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's somebody who's got a lot of tools. It multitasks. It's creating more good jobs, gives more Americans a shot at opportunity. And there are two big ways in which it does so. <p>First, the farm bill lifts up our rural communities. Over the past 5 years, thanks to the hard work and know-how of America's farmers, the best in the world, we've had the strongest stretch of farm exports in our history. And when I'm traveling around the world, I'm promoting American agriculture. And as a consequence, we are selling more stuff to more people than ever before, supports about 1 million American jobs. What we grow here and that we sell is a huge boost to the entire economy, but particularly the rural economy. <p>Here at Michigan State, by the way, you are helping us to do even more. So I just got a tour of a facility where you're working with local businesses to produce renewable fuels. You're helping farmers grow crops that are healthier and more resistant to disease. Some students are even raising their own piglets on an organic farm. When I was in college, I lived in a pigsty&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but I didn't work in one. That's&mdash;so I'm impressed by that. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's no joke, by the way. [<i>Laughter</i>] So your hygiene improves as you get older. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So we're seeing some big advances in American agriculture. And today, by the way, I'm directing my administration to launch a new Made in Rural America initiative to help more rural businesses expand and hire and sell more products stamped \\"Made in the U.S.A.\\" to the rest of the world, because we've got great products here that need to be sold, and we can do even more to sell around the world. <p>But even with all this progress, too many rural Americans are still struggling. Right now 85 percent of counties experience what's called persistent poverty. Those are in rural areas. Before I was elected President, I represented Illinois, home of a couple of your Big Ten rivals, but also a big farming State. And over the years, I've seen how hard it can be to be a farmer. There are a lot of big producers who are doing really well, but there are even more small farms, family farms, where folks are just scratching out a living and increasingly vulnerable to difficulties in financing and all the inputs involved; farmers sometimes having to work off the farm, they've got a couple of jobs outside the farm just to get health care, just to pay the bills, trying to keep it in the family; and it's very hard for young farmers to get started. <p>And in these rural communities, a lot of young people talk about how jobs are so scarce, even before the recession hit, that they feel like they've got to leave in order to have opportunity. They can't stay at home, they've got to leave. <p>So that's why this farm bill includes things like crop insurance, so that when a disaster like the record drought that we're seeing across much of the West hits our farmers, they don't lose everything they've worked so hard to build. This bill helps rural communities by investing in hospitals and schools, affordable housing, broadband infrastructure, all the things that help attract more businesses and make life easier for working families. <p>This bill supports businesses working to develop cutting-edge biofuels, like some of the work that's being done here at Michigan State. That has the potential to create jobs and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It boosts conservation efforts so that our children and grandchildren will be able to enjoy places like the Mississippi River Valley and Chesapeake Bay. <p>It supports local food by investing in things like farmers markets and organic agriculture, which is making my wife very happy. And when Michelle is happy, I don't know about everybody being happy, but I know I'm happy. [<i>Laughter</i>] And so it's giving smaller producers, local producers, folks like Ben, the opportunity to sell more of their products directly, without a bunch of processing and distributors and middlemen that make it harder for them to achieve. And it means that people are going to have healthier diets, which is, in turn, going to reduce incidents of childhood obesity and keep us healthier, which saves us all money. <p>It does all this while reforming our agricultural programs, so this bill helps to clamp down on loopholes that allowed people to receive benefits year after year, whether they were planting crops or not. And it saves taxpayers hard-earned dollars by making sure that we only support farmers when disaster strikes or prices drop. It's not just automatic. <p>So that's the first thing this farm bill does: It helps rural communities grow, it gives farmers some certainty, it puts in place important reforms. <p>The second thing this farm bill does that is huge is help make sure America's children don't go hungry. Now&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;and this is where Debbie's work was really important. One study shows that more than half of all Americans will experience poverty at some point during their adult lives. Now, for most folks, that's when you're young and you're eating ramen all the time. But for a lot of families, that&mdash;it's a crisis hits, you lose your job, somebody gets sick, strains on your budget; you have a strong work ethic, but it might take you 6 months, 9 months, a year to find a job. And in the meantime, you've got families to feed. <p>That's why, for more than half a century, this country has helped Americans put food on the table when they hit a rough patch or when they're working hard but aren't making enough money to feed their kids. They're not looking for a handout, these folks, they're looking for a hand up, a bridge to help get them through some tough times. <p>And we sure don't believe that children should be punished when parents are having a tough time. As a country, we're stronger when we help hard-working Americans get back on their feet, make sure that children are getting the nutrition that they need so that they can learn what they need in order to be contributing members of our society. <p>And that's the idea behind what's known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. A large majority of SNAP recipients are children or the elderly or Americans with disabilities. A lot of others are hard-working Americans who need just a little help feeding their families while they look for a job or they're trying to find a better one. And in 2012, the SNAP program kept nearly 5 million people&mdash;including more than 2 million children&mdash;out of poverty. Think about that: 5 million people. <p>That's why my position has always been that any farm bill I sign must include protections for vulnerable Americans, and thanks to the good work of Debbie and others, this bill does that. And by giving Americans more bang for their buck at places like farmers markets, we're making it easier for working families to eat healthy foods, and we're supporting farmers like Ben who make their living growing it. So it's creating new markets for produce farmers, and it means that people have a chance to directly buy from their farmers the kind of food that's going to keep them healthy. <p>And the truth is, a lot of folks go through tough times at some point in their lives. That doesn't mean they should go hungry, not in a country like America. So investing in the communities that grow our food, helping hard-working Americans put that food on the table, that's what this farm bill does, all while reducing our deficits through smart reforms. <p>It doesn't include everything that I'd like to see, and I know leaders on both sides of the aisle feel the same way. But it's a good sign that Democrats and Republicans in Congress were able to come through with this bill, break the cycle of shortsighted, crisis-driven, partisan decisionmaking, and actually get this stuff done. That's a good sign. <p>And that's the way you should expect Washington to work. That's the way Washington should continue to work. Because we've got more work to do. We've got more work to do to potentially make sure that unemployment insurance is put in place for a lot of folks out there who need it. We've got more work to do to pass a minimum wage. We've got more work to do to do immigration reform, which will help farmers like Ben. <p>So let's keep the momentum going here. And in the weeks ahead, while Congress is deciding what's next, I'm going to keep doing everything I can to strengthen the middle class, build ladders of opportunity in the middle class. And I sure hope Congress will join me, because I know that's what you're looking for out of your elected officials at every level. <p>So thank you, everybody. God bless you. I'm now going to sign this farm bill. <p>Hold on one second, I forgot to mention, Marcia Fudge was here. I wasn't sure whether she came to the event. I knew she flew in with me. So she does great work&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;out of the great State of Ohio. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>At this point, the President sat down to sign the bill.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Everybody can see? <p><i>Audience members.</i> No. <p><i>The President.</i> Oh-oh. Hey, guys, you got to sit down for a second so the big fancy cameras back there can&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. I mean, we appreciate you taking pictures, but&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. All right, I'm about to start signing. <p>[<i>The President signed the Agricultural Act of 2014</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> This was good work. I'm going to use every pen. There you go. Hey!\" "
"24" "\"Hi, everybody. In my State of the Union Address, I talked about the idea of opportunity for all. Opportunity is the idea at the heart of this country: that no matter who you are or how you started out, with hard work and responsibility, you can get ahead. <p>I ran for President to restore that idea, and I'm even more passionate about it today. Because while our economy has been growing for 4 years and those at the top are doing better than ever, average wages have barely budged. Too many Americans are working harder than ever just to get by, let alone get ahead, and that's been true since long before the recession hit. <p>We've got to reverse those trends. We've got to build an economy that works for everyone, not just a fortunate few. And the opportunity agenda I laid out last week will help us do that. <p>It's an agenda with four parts. Number one, more new jobs. Number two, training folks with the skills to fill those jobs. Number three, guaranteeing every child access to a world-class education. And number four, making sure that hard work pays off, with wages you can live on, savings you can retire on, and health insurance that's there when you need it. <p>I want to work with Congress on this agenda wherever I can. But in this year of action, whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, I will. I've got a pen, and I've got a phone: a pen to take executive action and a phone to rally citizens and business leaders who are eager to create new jobs and new opportunities. And we've already begun. <p>In Wisconsin, I ordered an across-the-board reform of our training programs to train folks with the skills employers need and then match them to good jobs that need to be filled right now. In Pittsburgh, I directed the Treasury to create MyRA, a new way for working Americans&mdash;even if you're not wealthy&mdash;to start your own retirement savings. <p>In Maryland, I rallied the leaders of some of America's biggest tech companies to help us make sure all our kids have access to high-speed Internet and up-to-date technology to help them learn the skills they need for the new economy. And at the White House, I brought together business leaders who have committed to helping more unemployed Americans find work, no matter how long they've been looking. And I directed the Federal Government to make hiring decisions the same way: based on whether applicants can do the job, not when they last had a job. <p>So when you hear me talking about using my pen and my phone to make a difference for middle class Americans and those working to get into the middle class, that's what I mean. And I'm going to keep asking students and parents and business leaders to help, because there are millions of Americans outside Washington who are tired of stale political arguments, ready to move this country forward, and determined to restore the founding vision of opportunity for all. <p>That's what I'm all about. Thanks, have a great weekend. And to our Olympians in Sochi, go Team U.S.A.!\" "
"25" "\"<i>President Obama.</i> Good evening, everybody. <i>Bonsoir</i>. Please, have a seat. I have now officially exhausted my French. [<i>Laughter</i>] Michelle and I are so honored to welcome you to the White House as we host President Hollande and his delegation for this historic state visit between our nations, the first in nearly 20 years. <p>I think we have a translation. Is that correct? No? You don't want me to translate. [<i>Laughter</i>] Apparently not. <p>At our press conference today, I quoted Alexis de Tocqueville, that son of France who in 1831 set out across our young country and chronicled our American democracy. And those who have&mdash;are familiar with de Tocqueville are always amazed by how well he understood this nation of ours and captured its spirit as well as anybody ever has. And tonight I'd like to share some of his lesser known observations. <p>About American dining, de Tocqueville wrote, \\"The absence of wine at our meals at first struck us as very disagreeable; and we still can't understand the multitude of things that [Americans] succeed in introducing into their stomachs.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] So some things do not change. When Fran&ccedil;ois came here years ago as a student to study our fast food, I suspect he said the same thing. <p>About the White House, de Tocqueville's traveling companion wrote, \\"The President of the United States occupies a palace that in Paris would be called a fine private residence.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] And he wrote&mdash;and I very much can relate to this&mdash;\\"The power of the King of France would be nil if it were modeled after the power of the President.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] And the King did not have to deal with the filibuster. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, Americans took lessons from France as well. One young American lawyer went to Paris and was deeply moved to see White and Black students studying together. And that young American was Charles Sumner, who&mdash;inspired by what he saw in France&mdash;became one of our greatest abolitionists, helped to end slavery, and is one of the reasons that all of us can be here this evening as full citizens, free and equal. <p>Now, it is true that we Americans have grown to love all things French: the films, the food, the wine. Especially the wine. [<i>Laughter</i>] But most of all, we love our French friends because we've stood together for our freedom for more than 200 years. Tonight I again want to pay tribute to President Hollande for the principled leadership and personal friendship and courage that he has shown on the world stage. Thank you, Fran&ccedil;ois. <p>We started this visit yesterday at Monticello. And I'd like to end where we began. Thomas Jefferson wrote: \\"So ask the traveled inhabitant of any nation, in what country on Earth would you rather live? Certainly, in my own, where [are] my friends, my relations, and the earliest and sweetest affections and recollections of my life.\\" But Jefferson added, \\"Which would be your second choice? France.\\" Of course. <p>And so I propose a toast: To our friend and partner President Hollande, to all of our friends from France who are here today, <i>vive la France,</i> God bless America, and long live the alliance between our great nations. <i>&Agrave; votre sant&eacute;!</i> Cheers. <p>[<i>At this point, a</i> <i>toast was offered.</i>] <p><i>President Obama</i>. Please, Fran&ccedil;ois. Cheers! <p>[<i>President Hollande spoke in English as follows</i>.] <p><i>President Hollande. </i>Mr. President, dear Michelle, Members of the Congress and French Parliament, ladies and gentlemen: I hope that translation exists. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Mr. President, I would like to thank you for the warm welcome that you have extended to me and my delegation. France and the United States of America are bound by ties of history: great history of French citizens such as Lafayette, who fought alongside the heroes of independence to allow your dream of freedom to prevail; the glorious history of the Americans who came to fight on French soil during the First World War and, then in June 1944, to liberate the European continent from Nazi oppression. <p>This afternoon it was a great moment and a great honor to award your Unknown Soldier with the insignia of the French Legion of Honor and to award medal to six glorious veterans of the Second World War. I promise we shall never forget them. <p>More recently, after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack, France shared Americans' pain. On that frightful day, someone has warned, we were all Americans. This is the very reason why we endured together in Afghanistan. <p><i>Monsieur le Pr&eacute;sident,</i> now I will speak French. <p>[<i>President Hollande spoke in French, and then concluded his remarks in English and French as follows.</i>] <p><i>President Hollande.</i> I raise my glass in honor of the United States of America, of the President Barack Obama, Michelle: Long live the United States! <i>Vive la France et vive l'amiti&eacute; </i><i>entre la France et les &Eacute;tats-Unis. </i><p>[<i>A toast was offered</i>.<i> President Hollande's preceding remarks were then translated by an interpreter as follows.</i>] <p><i>President Hollande.</i> Our two countries share universal values, and we have feelings for one another. We love Americans, although we don't always say so. And you love the French, but you're sometimes too shy to say so. [<i>Laughter</i>] Too withdrawn. But we share the same universal values: freedom, democracy, respect for the law. These principles guide our action. <p>Ever since I took office at the Presidency, we have been defending them together. In Mali, the French Armed Forces were able to rely on the efficient support awarded by the U.S. soldiers and equipment. In the Central African Republic, your support has accompanied our operation aiming at restoring security in this country, torn by its actions and violence between religions. <p>Together, we have removed the unacceptable threat of an Iranian nuclear weapon, and we have succeeded in reaching an interim agreement. In Syria, we together removed&mdash;through resorting to the threat of force&mdash;the threat of a worsening situation, and we managed to force the regime of Bashar al-Asad to accept the destruction of his stockpiles of chemical weapons. And again, together, we are looking resolutely together for a political outcome so desperately needed. <p>Together, the French and the Americans also want to work for growth and to introduce new rules that will prevent financial crises and enable us to fight more efficiently against tax evasion. First results are here, and the strength and robustness of the American economy is a source of hope for all developed countries. Provided that we open up our markets and intensify our trade, we will succeed. <p>Together, we will also rise to the challenge of climate change. Paris will be hosting the climate change conference in 2015. It is up to us to convince our major partners to take the necessary steps before it is too late. And I know again that I can count on your commitment. <p>Mr. President, the relations between our two countries have reached an exceptional level of closeness and confidence, and there is one simple reason for that: We share the same vision of the world, and we show mutual respect. The United States of America and France are two great nations. What is expected of them is to keep a promise, a promise of freedom and the promise of progress, and also to keep a dream alive&mdash;that same dream made by Jefferson, Washington, Lafayette, and the French revolutionaries&mdash;a dream to change the world. By uniting our forces, by united&mdash;uniting our talents, we will be able to keep the flame of hope alive. <p>I raise my glass to the President of the United States of America and to Michelle Obama. Long live the United States! Long live France!\" "
"26" "\"<i>The President. </i>Thank you so much. Everybody, have a seat. Have a seat. <p><i>Audience member</i>. Awesome!<i> </i><p><i>The President</i>. [<i>Laughter</i>] Well, welcome to the White House, everybody. I know you had to come here before you go buy some shovels and some salt. [<i>Laughter</i>] It sounds like we may get a little snow. But I very much appreciate everybody being here. I want to thank, first and foremost, the workers who are with me here this afternoon. [<i>Applause</i>] Hey! And I want to thank two champions for all hard-working Americans. We've got Secretary of Labor Tom Perez; he's in the house. Where is Tom? Right here. Tom is right here. I didn't know where he was. And we've got an outstanding Congressman&mdash;who's used to snow because he's from Minnesota&mdash;Congressman Keith Ellison. <p>Now, it's been just over 2 weeks since I delivered my State of the Union Address, and I said this year would be a year of action, and I meant it. Over the past 14 days, I've ordered an across-the-board reform of our job training programs to train folks with the skills that employers need and then match them up with good jobs that are ready to be filled right now. <p>I've directed the Treasury to create something we're calling MyRA, sort of like an IRA, but it's MyRA. And that's a new way for Americans to start saving for retirement. And you can start with as little as 25, $50 and start building up a little bit of a nest egg and get tax benefits for doing so. <p>We've rallied the leaders of some of America's biggest high-tech companies to help us make sure that all of our kids have access to high-speed Internet and up-to-date technology in their classroom so that they're learning the skills that they need for the new economy. <p>We brought together business leaders who are committed to hiring more unemployed Americans, particularly long-term unemployed, who oftentimes are discriminated against. They're in a catch-22: They haven't had a job for a while, and then the employer is not willing to look at their r&eacute;sum&eacute; because they haven't had their job for a while. <p>So the point is, I'm eager to work with Congress whenever I can find opportunities to expand opportunity for more families. But wherever I can act on my own, without Congress, by using my pen to take executive actions or picking up the phone and rallying folks around a common cause, that's what I'm going to do. <p>And so that brings me to the issue we're going to talk about today. After the worst economic crisis in generations, our economy has been growing for the past 4 years. And our businesses have created 8&frac12; million new jobs. Unemployment rate has come down. But while those at the top are doing better than ever&mdash;corporate profits have been high, stock market has been high&mdash;average wages have barely budged. So you've got too many Americans who are working harder than ever before just to get by, but they can't seem to get ahead, can't seem to make all the ends meet. <p>And that's been true since long before the recession hit. We've got to reverse those trends. We've got to build an economy that works for everybody, not just the fortunate few. And we've got to restore opportunity for everybody so that no matter who you are, no matter how you started out, no matter what you look like, no matter what your last name is, you can get ahead in America if you're willing to work hard and take responsibility for your life. All right? <p>So the opportunity agenda I've laid out is going to help us do just that. Part one of this agenda is more new jobs that pay a good wage, jobs in manufacturing and exports and energy and innovation. Part two, we've got to train the folks with the skills to fill those jobs. Part three, we've got to make sure every child gets a world-class education. And part four, we've got to make sure that the economy rewards hard work for every American. <p>Making hard work pay off with economic security and decent wages and benefits is what we're about here today. It means making sure women earn equal pay for equal work. It means making sure workers have the chance to save for a dignified retirement. It means access to affordable health insurance that gives you the freedom to change jobs or be your own boss and the peace of mind that it will be there for you when you get sick and you need it most. <p>So if you know anybody who doesn't have health insurance right now&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;send them to healthcare.gov. The website is working. [<i>Laughter</i>] Sign them up. You can get health care for less than your cell phone bill for a lot of folks. <p>But it also means that, in the wealthiest nation on Earth, nobody who works full time should have to live in poverty. Nobody. Not here in America. <p>Now, it was 1 year ago today&mdash;1 year ago today&mdash;that I first asked Congress to raise the Federal minimum wage, a Federal minimum wage that in real terms is worth about 20 percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan took office. Twenty percent less, a fifth less. <p>So this afternoon I've invited some of the folks who would see a raise if we raised that Federal minimum wage. They happened to join me here at the White House. And like most workers in their situation, they're not teenagers&mdash;they look like teenagers, some of them are very young looking. [<i>Laughter</i>] But they're not teenagers taking on their first job. They're adults; average age is 35 years old. A majority of lower wage jobs are held by women. Many of them have children that they're supporting. These are Americans who work full time, often to support a family, and if the minimum wage had kept pace with our economic productivity, they'd already be getting paid well over $10 an hour. <p>Instead, the minimum wage is still just $7.25. And when Congress refuses to raise it, it loses value; because there's a little bit inflation, everything else starts costing a little bit more. Even though inflation has been pretty low, it's still costing a little bit more each year. That means each dollar isn't going as far and they've got a little bit less. So over the past year, the failure of Congress to act was the equivalent of a $200 pay cut for these folks: for a typical minimum wage worker. That's a month worth of groceries, maybe 2 months' worth of electricity. It makes a big difference for a lot of families. <p>Now, the good news is that in the year since I first asked Congress to raise the minimum wage, six States went ahead and passed laws to raise theirs. [<i>Applause</i>] We appreciate that. You got more States and cities and counties that are taking steps to raise their minimum wage as we speak. And a lot of companies are doing it too, not out of charity, but because they've discovered, it's good business. <p>Two weeks ago, I visited a Costco store in Maryland. Now, Costco is a very profitable company. Its stock has done great. It's expanded all over the place. But their philosophy is, higher wages are a smart way to boost productivity and reduce turnover. If employees are happy and feel like the company is invested in them, then they're going to do more for the company. They're going to go above and beyond. <p>And when I was over at the Costco store, I was meeting folks who had started off as&mdash;at the cash register and now were in supervisory positions and had been there for 20 years. And you could see the kind of pride that they had in the company because the company cared about them. I even received a letter the next day from a woman who saw my visit on TV; she decided to apply a job for Costco. [<i>Laughter</i>] She said, let me apply for a job at Costco. They look like they do a good job. <p>So across the country, owners of small and large businesses are recognizing that fair wages and higher profits go hand in hand; it's good for the bottom line. And as America's chief executive, I agree. So while Congress decides what it's going to do&mdash;and I hope this year, and I'm going to work this year and urge this year that they actually pass a law&mdash;today I'm going to do what I can to help raise working Americans' wages. <p>So today I'm issuing an Executive order requiring Federal contractors to pay their employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;$10.10 an hour. <p>Now, this will make a difference for folks. Right now there's a dishwasher at Randolph Air Force Base in Texas making $7.76 an hour&mdash;$7.76 an hour. There's a fast food worker at Andrews, right down the street, making $8.91 an hour. There's a laundry worker at Camp Dodge in Iowa making $9.03 an hour. Once I sign this order, starting next year, as their contracts come up, each of them and many of their fellow coworkers are going to get a raise. And by the way, that includes folks who get paid in tips. They'll get a raise too. So a tip wage has gone up even slower than the regular minimum wage. <p>So just as it's good for companies across the country, this will be good for America's bottom line, for contractors and for taxpayers. The opponents of the minimum wage have been using the same arguments for years, and time and again, they've been proven wrong. Raising the minimum wage is good for business, and it's good for workers, and it's good for the economy. Put some more money in these folks' pockets, that means they got some money to go shop, which in turn means the business has more customers, which means they may hire more workers and make more of a profit. <p>And let's not forget, not only is it good for the economy, it's the right thing to do. There's a simple moral principle at stake: If you take responsibility and you work as hard as these folks work, if you work full time, you shouldn't be living in poverty. Not in America. We believe that. <p>And this Executive order will cover Americans with disabilities, because this principle doesn't just apply to some of us, it applies to all of us. <p>So I'm going to keep doing whatever I can to raise working Americans' wages. And I would ask any business leader out there, any Governor, any mayor, any local leader listening, do what you can to raise your employees' wages, to work to raise the wages of citizens in your jurisdiction. They'll support these efforts. A majority of Americans&mdash;not just Democrats, not just Independents, but Republicans too&mdash;support raising the minimum wage. It's the right thing to do. So that's something Congress should keep in mind this year. <p>There's a bill right now in front of both the House and the Senate that would boost America's minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, just like I'm doing with this executive action. It's easy to remember: 10-10. Ten-ten. Let's get that done. Raise the Federal minimum wage to 10.10 wouldn't just raise wages for minimum wage workers, its effect would lift wages for about 28 million Americans. It would lift millions of Americans out of poverty immediately. It would help millions more work their way out of poverty, without requiring a single dollar in new taxes or spending. It's the right thing to do. <p>Just last month, 600 economists, including 7 Nobel Prize winners, wrote the leaders of Houses of Congress to remind them that the bill before Congress would have little or no negative effect on hiring, on jobs. So it's not going to depress the economy. It will boost the economy. <p>[<i>At this point, a baby in the audience made a sound resembling \\"Yes!\\"</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Yes! [<i>Laughter</i>] It will give more businesses more customers with more money to spend. It will grow the economy for everybody. So&mdash;yeah! [<i>Laughter</i>] He's excited about it. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So Members of Congress have a pretty clear choice to make right now: Raise our workers' wages, grow our economy, or let wages stagnate further and give workers what amounts to another pay cut this year. Restore unemployment insurance for Americans still looking for that job or expose them further to hardship. Members of Congress, you can help people make progress in their own lives, or you can hinder that progress. <p>And every American deserves to know where your elected representative stands on this issue. So ask your Senator, ask your Representative in the House, \\"Do you support raising the Federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour?\\" If they say yes, tell them, \\"Good job.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] They don't hear that that often, so&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;give them a pat on the back, give them a hug, let them know, \\"Way to go.\\" That's the right thing to do. If they say no, be polite; I mean, don't just yell at them, but say, \\"Well, why not?\\" Ask them to reconsider siding with an overwhelming majority of Americans. Encourage them to say yes. Give America a raise. <p>So I'm about to sign this Executive order. When you hear me talking about my pen and my phone to make a difference for middle class Americans and those working to get into the middle class, this is exactly what I mean. I'm going to do what I can. Congress should do what it needs to do. I will not give up on this fight, no matter how long it takes. America deserves a raise. Working families deserve to know some more economic security in their own lives. <p>We've got to create new jobs, strengthen the middle class, build new ladders of opportunity for folks working their way into the middle class, just like these folks are doing right here. There are millions of Americans who could just use a little bit of boost, millions of Americans outside of Washington who are tired of the old, stale political arguments or tired of folks just looking out for people who can afford big lobbyists and big campaign contributions. There are folks out there who want to see us restore an economy that works for everybody and get back to our founding vision of opportunity for all. <p>So I know you guys will work with me. But go out there and organize some more. Thank you, everybody. Let's give Americans a raise right now. I'm going to sign this. <p>[<i>The President signed the Executive order.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> All right, it's done. Thank you.\" "
"27" "\"Thank you, everybody. Everybody, sit down. Sit down. Well, it is good to see you. Joe, thank you for the wonderful introduction. Let me be the first to say, Happy Valentine's Day to our fearless leader, Nancy Pelosi. I mean, Paul will, hopefully, get you more than just a thank you. <p>To Steny, to Jim, Xavier; Steve Israel, who is doing an extraordinary job under very difficult circumstances; Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who is putting in more miles than just about anybody I know; and all of you: It's great to see you. <p>We just saw each other at the White House fairly recently, so I'm not going to give a long speech here. I want to spend most of my time answering some more questions. But let me just make a couple observations since we saw each other. First of all, I stated in our State of the Union that the single most important thing we have to do&mdash;not just as a party, but as a country&mdash;is make sure that there's opportunity for every single person; that we are focused every single day in this town&mdash;or in Washington&mdash;on making sure that if you're willing to work hard, if you're willing to take responsibility, that you can get ahead. It doesn't matter where you live, what circumstances you were born into, what you look like, who you love, you should be able to make it here in America. <p>And as I said at the State of the Union, I want to work with Congress to make that happen, but I'm not going to wait, because there's too much to do. And America does not believe in standing still. America insists on moving forward. <p>We laid out some very specific ways that we can move the country forward, breaking them down into a few categories: number one, creating more good jobs that pay good wages; number two, making sure that folks are trained to fill those good jobs; number three, making sure that our kids have the best education in the world; and number four, making sure that hard work pays off, that people aren't poor if they're working full time, that they have some semblance of retirement security, that they can count on health care if, heaven forbid, something happens to them. <p>And already, just in the last couple of weeks, we've put forward a range of executive actions that are going to make a difference. So yesterday, for example, I had a chance to be with a group of minimum wage workers for Federal contractors. These are folks who are washing dishes or cleaning clothes on our Armed&mdash;our military bases, our facilities, and sometimes, the debates on Capitol Hill get so abstract, and to be next to folks&mdash;average age, by the way, 35. These aren't teenagers, these are folks who are looking after families and trying to raise kids. And to see what it would mean to them for us to have a Federal minimum wage of $10.10 an hour and how much relief that would give them and how committed they were to the American Dream and getting ahead and just hoping that somebody was standing up for them, it reminded me of why I'm a Democrat. And it reminded me of why I'm so proud of this caucus, because you're standing up on behalf of them. <p>And so we signed the Executive order. These folks are going to get a raise. And what I said yesterday is that now it's time for Congress to act, because America deserves a raise. I pointed out yesterday, as I pointed out at the State of the Union, that the majority of low-wage workers are women, which is why we're going to keep on pushing to make sure that we have equal pay for equal work and we have sensible family policies. Because as I said at the State of the Union, when women succeed, America succeeds. I still believe that. <p>We've traveled to manufacturing plants up in Wisconsin to talk about how we can continue to accelerate advanced manufacturing and technology in this country. And we've got some great possibilities to create hubs that keep us on the cutting edge. We've signed Executive orders to advance the kind of job training that is going to help people get trained for the jobs that actually exist and link up businesses with our community colleges. We've already, through executive action, set up a new retirement account, MyRA, that allows folks to get a starter retirement, because a whole lot of people don't have 401(k)s to save. <p>Across the board, we're moving. But as I said at the State of the Union, and I want to repeat today, we can get a whole lot more done if we've got Congress working with us. And this caucus has shown time and time again under the most difficult circumstances the kind of courage and unity and discipline that has made me very, very proud. <p>And I was just talking to Nancy before I came out here. The fact that we are no longer going to see, I believe, anybody try to hold our Government hostage and threaten the full faith and credit of the United States of America in order to contract policy concessions, the fact that we were able to pass a clean debt limit is just one example of why, when you guys are unified, you guys stick together, this country is better off. And I could not be more thankful and more appreciative and prouder of what you're doing. <p>Just a couple of more points. Number one, you've seen reports over the last couple of days that we actually slightly exceeded our targets for ACA signups and enrollments this past month, in the month of January. We now have well over 3&frac12; million people who have signed up and are getting insurance through the marketplaces for the first time. That does not count the close to 7 million folks who have signed up for Medicaid because of the law that you passed or the 3 million young people who are staying on their parents' plans. We're starting to see data already that the uninsured rate is coming down. We are going to keep on pushing on this to make sure that here in America, everybody can enjoy the kind of financial security and peace of mind that good quality health insurance provides. <p>And I just want to say thank you for all of you hanging in there tough on an issue that I think, 10 years from now, 5 years from now, we're going to look back and say this was a monumental achievement that could not have happened had it not been for this caucus. <p>And finally, there are some big things that we have to do that I cannot do through executive action, where we have to get Congress and where the American people are on our side. A Federal minimum wage law is one of them. Another, though, is making sure that we've got a smart immigration policy in this country that grows our economy, gets people out of the shadows, makes sure that our businesses are thriving. That's got to be a top priority. We're going to have to keep on working on that. <p>And I believe, frankly, that there are folks on the other side of the aisle who genuinely want to see this done, but they're worried, and they're scared about the political blowback. And look, everybody here is an elected official, and we can all appreciate the maneuverings that take place, particularly in an election year. But when it comes to immigration reform, we have to remind ourselves that there are people behind the statistics, that there are lives that are being impacted, that punting and putting things off for another year, another 2 years, another 3 years, it hurts people. It hurts our economy. It hurts families. <p>And part of what I'd like to think makes us Democrats is not simply some abstract ideological set of beliefs, but the fact that we're reminded every single day that we're here to help a whole bunch of folks out there&mdash;our neighbors, our friends, our communities&mdash;who are struggling still and need our help. And they're counting on us. The good thing is, they've got some outstanding Members of Congress who are willing to fight for them regardless of the political cost, starting with your leader Nancy Pelosi. <p>I'm grateful for you. And I'm looking forward to making sure that this year we keep on making progress even if we continue to get a little resistance from the other side. The American people know that we could be breaking out if Washington gets its act together, and it's important for us to lead that process. All right? <p>Thank you very much.\" "
"28" "\"I wanted to come here basically to listen. We're all equally dependent upon California producers for so many of products in our lives. As you know, Michelle wants us to use more of your products, not less. In fact, I think her \\"Let's Move!\\" initiative has met with some of the producers to talk about how we can get our kids eating more produce, more nuts, and more healthy foods. And because of the huge economic impact of what you do not just on California, but the Nation overall, there is a national concern around the drought that is facing California. <p>Now, as I'm sure Tom has shared with you and, I think, many of you know firsthand, we've been monitoring this for quite some time, and a whole host of our agencies have been coming in to interact with all of you and find ways that we can provide some immediate relief. But the truth of the matter is, is that this is going to be a very challenging situation this year, and frankly, the trend lines are such where it's going to be a challenging situation for some time to come. <p>And as we were flying over those beautiful mountains of yours that are the source of traditionally so much water in this area and despite the rain and snow that had come just over the last few days, it was still looking fairly bare; it gives you a sense that the baseline of water throughout the West, not just California, is going to be probably lower than what we've been accustomed to over the last hundred years. And that means we're going to have to make some decisions about how we conserve better, how we allocate water better, how we recycle water better, and how we cooperate more effectively not just in this State, but throughout the region and around the country. <p>Now, water politics in California traditionally, I know, has been pretty heated&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and I told the Governor I'm not going to wade into this, because I want to get out of here alive on Valentine's Day. [<i>Laughter</i>] So my goal today&mdash;and I think, my administration's goal generally&mdash;is to try to facilitate and work with a whole range of stakeholders at the local levels and see how we can find common ground that points us in the new direction moving forward. <p>But I will say this: I think there's a tendency, historically, to think of water as a zero-sum game, where either the agricultural interests are getting it or urban areas are getting it; it's North, it's South. Given what we anticipate to be a significant reduction in the overall amount of water, we're going to have to figure out how to play a different game. And if the politics are structured in just such a way where everybody is fighting each other and trying to get as much as they can, my suspicion is, is that we're going to not make much progress, particularly because Jim Costa told me, if you want to guarantee yourself a job in California, become a water rights lawyer. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So what we can't afford, I think, is just years of litigation and no real action. And our hope is, is that we can convene a conversation that helps us move forward. <p>So I'm glad to be here. Even though I'm only going to be here for a little over an hour, what I am at the outset making a commitment to all of you is, is that we are going to stay on top of this, because it has national implications not only for our economy, but we're also going to have to make sure that we weave in this issue of water in the West with the broader issues of climate change that are having an impact all across the country in different ways. There's a connection between drought in the West and hurricanes along the Atlantic and coastal erosion. And what this all means is we're going to have to start rethinking our infrastructure and what are the projects that 50 years from now, 100 years from now, our children and grandchildren are going to be able to say, we had the foresight to deal with these problems in a serious way. <p>And that's not going to be happening overnight. We'll try to get immediate relief right now, but we also have to have this larger conversation.\" "
"29" "\"Well, first of all, I want to thank Joe and Maria Del Bosque and their beautiful daughters for showing Governor Brown and me around their farm. <p>Joe has got an incredible story. The son of a migrant farmworker, farm work is how he put himself through college. He's been a farmer for most of his life. He started by going around to other folks' land and saying, I'll grow some cantaloupes for you and&mdash;as long as you pay me for what we produce, and over the years, was able to develop this amazing business and not only start growing cantaloupes, but almonds and cherries and all kinds of other good stuff. <p>He's&mdash;there are three things that make farming work in California, according to Joe: soil, water, and people. And in the little free time they have, Joe and Maria work to improve the health and safety of farmworkers. There are a lot of people who are dependent on him year round and a lot of people who work seasonally with Joe and Maria, and their livelihoods depend on the functioning of these farms. <p>But today we're here to talk about the resource that's keeping more and more California farmers and families up at night, and that is water or the lack of it. <p>As anybody in this State could tell you, California is living through some of its driest years in a century. Right now almost 99 percent of California is drier than normal, and the winter snowpack that provides much of your water far into the summer is much smaller than normal. And we could see that as we were flying in. Jim and Barbara and Dianne and I were flying over the mountain ranges and could see, even though there was a little bit of snow that just came in the last couple of days, that it's nothing like it is normally. <p>Now, while drought in regions outside the West is expected to be less severe than in other years, California is our biggest economy, California is our biggest agricultural producer, so what happens here matters to every working American, right down to the cost of food that you put on your table. <p>And that's why, last month, Governor Brown declared a state of emergency, directing State officials to prepare for drought conditions. And together, our administrations launched a coordinated response. Secretary Vilsack, who is here today, declared 27 counties as primary natural disaster areas, making farmers and ranchers eligible for emergency loans. And over the past 2 weeks, his team at USDA and Mike Connor's team at the Interior Department have released new funds for conservation and irrigation, announced investments to upgrade water infrastructure, and partnered with California to stretch the water supply as much as possible. <p>Today I want to announce new actions that we can take together to help these hardworking folks. First, we're accelerating a hundred million dollars of funds from the farm bill that I signed last week to help ranchers. For example, if their fields have dried up, this is going to help them feed their livestock. Second, last week we announced $20 million to help hard-hit communities, and today we're announcing up to $15 million more for California and other States that are in extreme drought. Third, I'm directing the Interior Department to use its existing authorities, where appropriate, to give water contractors flexibility to meet their obligations. And fourth, I'm directing all Federal facilities in California to take immediate steps to curb their water use, including a moratorium on water usage for new, nonessential landscaping projects. <p>A bipartisan bill written by your outstanding Senators, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, as well as your own outstanding Representative and almond farmer, Jim Costa, includes similar ideas. And I hope that Congress considers the legislation that they have crafted soon, work through some of the concerns that have been expressed. Let's make sure that we're getting some short-term relief to folks, but also long-term certainty for people who are going to be harmed by this drought. <p>Now, these actions will help, but they're just the first step. We have to be clear: A changing climate means that weather-related disasters like droughts, wildfires, storms, floods are potentially going to be costlier and they're going to be harsher. Droughts have obviously been a part of life out here west&mdash;in the West since before any of us were around, and water politics in California have always been complicated, but scientific evidence shows that a changing climate is going to make them more intense. <p>Scientists will debate whether a particular storm or drought reflects patterns of climate change. But one thing that is undeniable is that changing temperatures influence drought in at least three ways. Number one, more rain falls in extreme downpours, so more water is lost to runoff than captured for use. Number two, more precipitation in the mountains falls as rain rather than snow, so rivers run dry earlier in the year. Number three, soil and reservoirs lose more water to evaporation year round. <p>What does all this mean? Unless and until we do more to combat carbon pollution that causes climate change, this trend is going to get worse. And the hard truth is, even if we do take action on climate change, carbon pollution has built up in our atmosphere for decades. The planet is slowly going to keep warming for a long time to come. So we're going to have to stop looking at these disasters as something to wait for; we've got to start looking at these disasters as something to prepare for, to anticipate, to start building new infrastructure, to start having new plans, to recalibrate the baseline that we're working off of. <p>And everybody, from farmers to industry, to residential areas, to the north of California and the south of California and everyplace in between, as well as the entire Western region are going to have to start rethinking how we approach water for decades to come. <p>And as I said when I was meeting with the town hall group, we can't think of this simply as a zero-sum game. It can't just be a matter of, there's going to be less and less water so I'm going to grab more and more of a shrinking share of water. Instead, what we have to do is all come together and figure out how we all are going to make sure that agricultural needs, urban needs, industrial needs, environmental and conservation concerns are all addressed. And that's going to be a big project, but it's one that I'm confident we can do. <p>Part of the climate action plan that I put forward last summer is designed to protect critical sectors of our economy and prepare the United States for the effects of climate change that we're just not going to be able to avoid. So last week, for example, the USDA announced seven new climate hubs to help farmers and ranchers adapt their operations to a changing climate, one of which will be at UC Davis, focused on resilience for California's specialty crops. <p>The budget I sent to Congress&mdash;the budget that I send to Congress next month will include $1 billion in new funding for new technologies to help communities prepare for a changing climate, set up incentives to build smarter, more resilient infrastructure. And finally, my administration will work with tech innovators and launch new challenges under our Climate Data Initiative, focused initially on rising sea levels and their impacts on the coasts, but ultimately focused on how all these changes in weather patterns are going to have an impact up and down the United States&mdash;not just on the coast, but inland as well&mdash;and how do we start preparing for that. And that has to be work that we do together. This cannot be a partisan endeavor. <p>One of the great things about that town hall that I just came out of: Not everybody agreed on anything&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;except people did agree that we can't keep on doing business as usual. That's what people did understand: that there has to be a sense of urgency about this. <p>And issues like the Federal Government helping States to build infrastructure to adapt and ensure economic development and that families and workers are able to prosper, there's nothing new about that. We just saw a photograph of President Kennedy and current Governor Brown's dad building some of the aquifers that have been so important to the economy of this State for decades. If we were able to do that then, we should be able to do it now. It's just a matter of us making sure that we're not putting politics ahead of trying to get things working. <p>Our work with Governor Brown and his administration is going to continue. Californians have all had to come together and already make sacrifices, big and small, to help your neighbors and your State get through this. The good news is, California is always on the cutting edge. Already, you use water far more efficiently than you did decades ago. You do it smarter. Joe was explaining just how this drip irrigation that you see in this region has made many of these farms much more efficient when it comes to water utilization. And so we know that we can innovate and meet this challenge, but we've got to start now. We can't wait. <p>So I want to make sure that every Californian knows&mdash;whether you're NorCals, SoCal, here in the Central Valley&mdash;your country is going to be there for you when you need it this year. But we're going to have to all work together in the years to come to make sure that we address the challenge and leave this incredible land embodied to our children and our grandchildren in at least as good shape as we found it. <p>So thank you very much, everybody, for the great work that you guys do. And I've already told the Governor as well as all your outstanding representatives here that our administration is going to stay on this and we are prepared to cooperate with local, State officials throughout. And that's not just in California, because we're going to see some similar problems in places like Colorado, Nevada, some of the neighboring Western States, and so part of the conversation is also going to have to be a regional conversation. <p>But this is something that I'm very committed to. We're going to make sure to get it done, working together. Thank you so much, everybody. <p><i>Audience members</i>. Thank you, Mr. President. <p><i>The President</i>. All right.\" "
"30" "\"Hi, everybody. In this year of action, I said I'd do everything in my power to expand opportunity for more Americans. And this week, I took action to lift more workers' wages by requiring Federal contractors to pay their employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour. These are workers who serve our troops' meals, wash their dishes, care for our veterans, Americans who work hard and will get a raise as these contracts come up. This will be good for contractors, for taxpayers, and for America's bottom line. <p>We know why this is important. Our economy has been growing for 4 years. Our businesses have created 8&frac12; million new jobs. But while those at the top are doing better than ever, average wages have barely budged. Too many Americans are working harder than ever just to get by, let alone get ahead. And that's been true since long before the recession hit. <p>That's why we've got to build an economy that works for everybody, not just a fortunate few. We've got to restore opportunity for all, the notion that no matter who you are or how you started out, with hard work and responsibility, you can get ahead in America. <p>The opportunity agenda I've laid out is built on more new jobs that pay good wages, better training for folks to fill those jobs, a smarter education for our kids, and making sure honest work is rewarded. And the action I took this week will reward hard work for more Americans. <p>But to finish the job, Congress needs to act. In the year since I first asked Congress to raise the minimum wage, six States have passed laws to raise theirs. More States, cities, counties, and companies are taking steps to join them. An overwhelming majority of Americans support raising a minimum wage that's worth about 20 percent less than when Ronald Reagan took office. <p>Right now there's a bill in Congress that would boost America's minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. That's easy to remember: 10-10. And remember, the average worker who would get a raise if Congress acts is about 35 years old. Most low-wage jobs are held by women. And raising the minimum wage wouldn't just raise their wages, its effect would lift wages for about 28 million Americans. It would lift millions of Americans out of poverty and help millions more work their way out of poverty, without requiring a single dollar in new taxes or spending. It will give more businesses more customers with more money to spend, and that means growing the economy for everyone. <p>You deserve to know where the people who represent you stand on this issue. If they don't support raising the Federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, ask them, why not? The opponents of raising folks' wages have deployed the same old arguments for years, and time and again, they've been proven wrong. Let's prove them wrong again and give America a raise. Let's make opportunity easier to come by for every American who's willing to work for it. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"31" "\"<i>The President.</i> Well, good morning, everybody. <p><i>Audience members</i>. Good morning. <p><i>The President</i>. It is good to be here. And I want to thank Jack Jacobs and all the folks at Safeway for having us here today at this busy distribution center, where delivery trucks get everything from Doritos to diapers where they need to go. And by the way, I have a little soft spot for Safeway in my heart, because some of you know I went to high school in Hawaii and I was living with my grandparents, and our main grocery store was Safeway. It was right down the way. And so my grandmother would send me out to go shopping at Safeway, and everybody there always treated me very well. So I very much appreciate the good work you guys do. <p>And I want to thank all the workers and businesspeople and labor leaders and environmental leaders who are here today as we take another big step to grow our economy and reduce America's dependence on foreign oil. <p>Now, in my State of the Union Address, I said that this would be a year of action, and I meant it. So over the past 3 weeks, I've acted to require Federal contractors to pay their employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour, because we believe in a higher minimum wage. I've ordered an across-the-board reform of job training programs so we can train workers with the skills that employers actually need and match them to the good jobs that are out there right now needing to be filled. I directed the Treasury Secretary to create something we're calling a MyRA. It's a new way to help working Americans start saving for retirement. And we've brought together business leaders who've committed to helping more unemployed Americans find work, no matter how long they've been looking. <p>So the point is, I'm eager to work with Congress wherever I can, but whenever I can act on my own to expand opportunity for more Americans and help build our middle class, I'm going to do that. <p>And all of you, I think, understand that although the economy has been doing better, we've spent the past 5 years fighting our way back from the worst recession of our lifetimes. Now, the economy is growing. Our businesses have created over 8&frac12; million new jobs over the past 4 years. The unemployment rate is actually the lowest it's been in over 5 years. But the trends, the long-term trends, that have hurt middle class families for decades have continued: folks at the top doing better than ever before; average wages and incomes have barely budged. Too many Americans are working harder than ever just to keep up. <p>So our job is to not only get the economy growing, but also to reverse these trends and make sure that everybody can succeed. We've got to build an economy that works for everybody, not just the fortunate few. Opportunity for all, that's the essence of America. No matter who you are, no matter where you come from, no matter how you start out, if you're willing to work hard and take responsibility, you can succeed. <p>So I've laid out an opportunity agenda to help us do that. Part one is create more new jobs that pay good wages, jobs in manufacturing, energy, exports, innovation. Part two, we've got to train folks with the skills they need to fill those jobs. Part three, we've got to guarantee every child access to a world-class education. Part four is making sure that the economy rewards hard work with equal pay for equal work and wages you can live on, savings you can retire on, health insurance you can count on that's there for when you need it. <p>Now, there are very few factors that are helping grow our economy more, bringing more good jobs back to America than our commitment to American manufacturing and American energy. And that's why we're here today. <p>Five years ago, we set out to break our dependence on foreign oil. And today, America is closer to energy independence than we've been in decades. For the first time in nearly 20 years, America produces more oil here at home than we buy from other countries. Our levels of dangerous carbon pollution that contributes to climate change has actually gone down even as our production has gone up. And one of the reasons why is because we dedicated ourselves to manufacturing new cars and new trucks that go farther on a gallon of gas. And that saves families money, it cuts down harmful pollution, and it creates new advances in American technology. <p>So for decades, the fuel efficiency standards of our cars and trucks was stuck in neutral even as other kinds of technology leapt forward. And that left families and businesses and our economy vulnerable to fluctuations in oil prices. Every time oil prices shot up, the economy got hurt. Our automakers were in danger of being left in the dust by foreign automakers. Carbon pollution was going unchecked, which was having severe impacts on our weather. <p>And that's why, after taking office, my administration worked with automakers, autoworkers, environmental advocates, and States across the country, and we put in&mdash;we set in motion the first-ever national policy aimed at both increasing gas mileage and decreasing greenhouse gas pollution for all new cars and trucks sold in the United States. And as our automakers retooled and prepared to start making the world's best cars again, we aimed to raise fuel economy standards to 35.5 miles per gallon for a new vehicle by 2016. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Wow! <p><i>The President.</i> Yeah, wow. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>That was an increase of more than 8 miles per gallon over what cars had averaged at the time. And what we were clear about was, if you set a rule, if you set a clear goal, we would give our companies the certainty that they needed to innovate and outbuild the rest of the world. They could figure it out if they had a goal that they were trying to reach. And thanks to their ingenuity and hard work, we're going to meet that goal. <p>Two years later, we've already seen enormous progress, and we're building on that progress by setting an even more ambitious target: We're going to double the distance our cars and light trucks can go on a gallon of gas by 2025. We're going to double it. And that means&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;that's big news. Because what it means is, you've got to fill up every 2 weeks instead of every week, and that saves the typical family more than $8,000 at the pump over time. I'm assuming you can use $8,000&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that you're not paying at the gas station. And in the process, it cuts American oil consumption by 12 billion barrels. <p>So we let the automakers decide how they were going to do it. We set the goal, and we said go figure it out. And they invested in innovative and cost-effective technologies. And some are already making cars that beat the target of nearly 55 miles per gallon. They've got plug-in hybrids. They've got electric vehicles. They're taking advantage of the investments that the Recovery Act made and American advances in battery technology. So cars are getting better, and they're getting more fuel efficient all the time. <p>And for anybody who said this couldn't be done or that it would hurt the American auto industry, the American auto industry sold more cars last year than any time since 2007. And since we stepped in to help our automakers retool&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;since we stepped in to help the automakers retool, the American auto industry has created almost 425,000 new jobs. <p>So we raised fuel efficiency, helped consumers, helped improve air quality, and we're making better cars than ever, and the automakers are hiring folks again for good jobs all across the country. More plants are running at full capacity&mdash;some are even running three shifts, 24 hours a day&mdash;churning out some of the most high-tech, fuel-efficient, high-performance cars in the world. <p>And that's a story of American ingenuity, American grit, and everybody has a right to be proud of it. But today we're taking the next step. <p>Heavy-duty trucks account for just 4 percent of all the vehicles on the highway. I know when you're driving sometimes, it feels like it's more&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but they're only 4 percent of all the vehicles. But they're responsible for about 20 percent of carbon pollution in the transportation sector. So trucks like these are responsible for about 20 percent of our on-road fuel consumption. And because they haul about 70 percent of all domestic freight&mdash;70 percent of the stuff we use, everything from flat-screen TVs to diapers, to produce, to you name it&mdash;every mile that we gain in fuel efficiency is worth thousands of dollars of savings every year. <p>So that's why we're investing in research to get more fuel economy gains. And thanks to a partnership between industry and my administration, the truck behind me was able to achieve a 75-percent improvement in fuel economy over the last year&mdash;75 percent. That's why I call this Super Truck. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's impressive, this one right here as well. I mean, these are&mdash;first of all, they're really big. [<i>Laughter</i>] But you can see how they're&mdash;how they've redesigned the truck in order for us to save fuel economy. <p>And improving gas mileage for these trucks are going to drive down our oil imports even further. That reduces carbon pollution even more, cuts down on businesses' fuel costs, which should pay off in lower prices for consumers. So it's not just a win-win, it's a win-win-win. You've got three wins. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>In 2011, we set new standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks to take effect this year and last until 2018. Three weeks ago, in my State of the Union Address, I said we'd build on that success. Today I'm directing the Secretary of Transportation, Anthony Foxx, who is right here, former mayor of Charlotte, and Gina McCarthy, the Administrator of the EPA&mdash;two outstanding public servants&mdash;their charge, their goal, is to develop fuel economy standards for heavy-duty trucks that will take us well into the next decade, just like our cars. And they're going to partner with manufacturers and autoworkers and States and other stakeholders, truckers, to come up with a proposal by March of next year, and they'll complete the rule a year after that. <p>And businesses that buy these types of trucks have sent a clear message to the nearly 30,000 workers who build them: We want trucks that use less oil, save more money, cut pollution. So far, 23 companies have joined our National Clean Fleets Partnership to reduce their oil consumption or replace their old fleets of trucks with more fuel-efficient models. And collectively, they operate about 1 million commercial vehicles nationwide. <p>So this is a lot of companies, and some of them are competitors. And if rivals like PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, or UPS and FedEx, or AT&T and Verizon&mdash;if they can join together on this, then maybe Democrats and Republicans can do the same. [<i>Applause</i>] Maybe Democrats and Republicans can get together. <p>So when you see these companies' new electric- or natural gas-powered delivery or garbage trucks, it's due to this partnership. And the reason we're here is because Safeway was an early leader on this issue. By improving the aerodynamics of its trucks, investing in larger trailers, more efficient tires, Safeway has improved its own fuel efficiency. And the results are so solid that Safeway now encourages all the companies it hires to ship its products to do the same. <p>So to help our businesses and manufacturers meet this new goal, we're offering new tax credits, both for companies that manufacture heavy-duty, alternative fuel vehicles and those that build fuel infrastructure so that trucks running on biodiesel or natural gas or hybrid electric technology, they'll have more places to fill up. <p>Let me say this: The goal we're setting is ambitious, but these are areas where ambition has worked out really well for us so far. Don't make small plans, make big plans. And anybody who had dire predictions for the auto industry, said we couldn't do it, manufacturers couldn't bring jobs back to America&mdash;every time they say, that they're proven wrong. Every time somebody says you can't grow the economy while bringing down pollution, it's turned out, they've been wrong. Anybody who says we can't compete when it comes to clean energy technologies like solar and wind, they've had to eat those words. You can't bet against American workers or American industry. You can't bet against America. Otherwise, you're going to lose money every time, because we know how to do this when we set broad, ambitious goals for ourselves. <p>So from day one, we've known we had to rebuild our economy and transition to a clean energy future, and we knew it wouldn't be easy or quick, and we've got a lot of work to do on both counts. But the economy is growing. We're creating jobs. We're generating more clean energy. We're cutting our dependence on foreign oil. We're pumping out less dangerous carbon pollution. If we keep going down this road, then we're going to have a future full of good-paying jobs. <p>We've got assembly lines that are humming with the components of a clean energy age. We got more of the best trucks and cars in the world designed and engineered and made in America. <p>If we keep on going, we're going to leave a better future for our children. And I'm proud of Safeway and all its workers for helping to show us the way. If it can be done here, it can be done all across the country. <p>So congratulations to all of you. Thank you, and God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"32" "\"Hello, everybody. Thank you. Thank you so much. Everybody, have a seat. Have a seat. Well, it is wonderful to see all of you. It is always a great weekend when the Governors come into town. And tonight we're with some of the best and a few of their better halves. And I'm so grateful to all of you for all the great work you're doing. <p>And I'm grateful for the people who are here to support our outstanding Governors. I want to thank our DGA chair, Peter Shumlin, for the great work that he's doing up in Vermont. His neighbor Maggie Hassan, who is the vice chair, and the first time I saw her was another State senator just like me. And she's doing great up in New Hampshire, so we are very, very proud of her. <p>I'm not going to give a long speech because I think we want to make this more of a conversation. I want to take out some time for questions and answers. But the main thing I wanted to do is just to say thank you for all of you coming out and supporting Democratic Governors. <p>And Peter alluded to this, but let me underscore it. Folks here in Washington like to talk abstractions. You get into a lot of ideological debates. The problem for Governors is that they actually have to do something and they just can't talk. And they have to be practical. They have to understand a wide range of issues that are affecting a wide range of constituents. And the work that these Governors do each and every day are having a concrete impact in helping to shape the debate in ways that are extraordinary. <p>And the challenge we have sometimes in politics is that the national politicians and the national races get all the attention. But so often, the action&mdash;how our policies are actually impacting our constituents day to day&mdash;are being determined by Governors and State legislatures. <p>And if there's one message I want to deliver today to every Democrat and every person who's interested in supporting Democratic policies, it's that you got to pay attention to the States. You have to stay focused on what's happening in the States, and you have&mdash;you especially have to pay attention to what's happening in the States during midterm elections. Because we know how to win national elections, but all too often, it's during these midterms where we end up getting ourselves into trouble, because, I guess, we don't think it's sexy enough. But the fact of the matter is, is that that's where so much of the action is. <p>And Democratic Governors are testing ideas, and they are innovating and implementing critical policies all across the board. And that's work that obviously is made tougher when you don't always have a Congress that is cooperating. And what binds together all these Democratic Governors is a pretty simple idea, and that's the idea of opportunity: the idea that if you work hard in this country, no matter who you are, where you come from, what you look like, what your last name is, you can make it. <p>And we recognize as Democrats and you recognize as Governors that government can't do it all or shouldn't&mdash;you shouldn't even try to do it all. But government has a critical role to play in helping provide communities and families the tools they need to succeed, if they're willing to work hard, if they're acting responsibly. <p>And that's as important as ever today, because what we are seeing right now is the economy is slowly healing from what was the worst crisis since the Great Depression. We've now created over 8.5 million jobs since the depths of the recession. Businesses are optimistic this year. CEOs say they want to start reinvesting. We've got an unemployment rate that is as low as it's been since 2005 and is continuing to drop. <p>But despite all that, for ordinary families&mdash;for a whole lot of the constituents of these Governors here&mdash;folks are still worried. They're still anxious, in part because if they do have a job, their wages and their incomes have flatlined for over a decade now. They don't feel as if they're getting ahead. In fact, they feel like they're working harder and harder just to stay in place or to avoid slipping back. <p>And if you look at it statistically&mdash;everybody here knows some of the numbers&mdash;folks at the very top are doing better and better, but ordinary folks, that middle class that's always been the core of our society and made America different, they're still feeling squeezed. And so everything we do this year, next year, the year after that, and as long as we have the opportunity to serve has to be focused on how are we expanding opportunity; how are we growing that middle class; how are we building an economy that is good for everybody, not just some; how are we making sure that folks, whatever their station in life, can succeed if they're willing to work hard. <p>And fortunately, we've got a bunch of Democratic Governors who have been willing to implement what I've called an opportunity agenda and that I talked about in the State of the Union. Number one, that we're creating more good jobs out here through manufacturing and clean energy and making sure that we're rebuilding our infrastructure&mdash;our bridges, our roads, our ports&mdash;all across the country. Number two, making sure that we are giving every child in this country the best education they can get, because we know in the 21st century, that's what it's going to take for them to compete. Number three, training folks throughout their lives with the skills they need to get those good jobs. Number four, making sure that work pays, that if you're out working hard, you're not in poverty and you have a chance to get ahead. <p>And those simple precepts should be guiding everything that we do this year and for years to come, and that's what we should be talking about as we're supporting incumbent Democratic Governors and candidates for Democratic Governors across the country, open seats. <p>Now, unfortunately, State by State, Republican Governors are implementing a different agenda. They're pursuing the same top-down, failed economic policies that don't help Americans get ahead. They're paying for it by cutting investments in the middle class, oftentimes doing everything they can to squeeze folks who are bargaining on behalf of workers. Some of them, their economies have improved in part because the overall economy has improved, and then they take credit for it instead of saying that Obama had anything to do with it. I get that. There's nothing wrong with that. But they're making it harder for working families to access health care. In some States, they're making it harder even for Americans to exercise their right to vote. <p>And we've got a Congress that prefers to say no rather than yes right now. They don't have an affirmative agenda. Their main strategy is to just try to do nothing and see if they can&mdash;falsely&mdash;give people a sense that somehow the policies that we're trying to pursue aren't working for them. <p>So the good news is that we are now talking about the issues that are on the minds of people every single day around the kitchen table. And I'll just give you a couple ideas&mdash;couple of examples of where I see significant progress all across the country, even if it hasn't been realized in every State. <p>Number one is on the minimum wage. You've got three out of four Americans support raising the minimum wage. The majority of not just Democrats, but Independents and Republicans, think it's important for us to make sure that if you work full time, you're not in poverty. And we've been seeing businesses around the country that are starting to recognize it's good for their bottom lines to do right by their employees. Yesterday the Gap became the latest business to raise wages for its U.S. employees. <p>But even though more than half of Republicans in America support raising the minimum wage, Republicans in Congress don't want to vote for it, even though the current proposal in Congress would give more than 16 million Americans a raise. So I recently required Federal contractors to pay their employees a wage of at least $10.10 an hour. We've got Democratic Governors that are doing their part. <p>So last year, Jerry Brown signed America's first 10-dollar-an-hour minimum wage into law in California. Dan Malloy in Connecticut and Martin O'Malley in Maryland, who are both here tonight, they are fighting to raise their States' wages as well. It's no surprise then that most of the States that have a higher minimum wage, higher than the Federal minimum wage, are governed by Democrats. <p>Republican Governors are out of touch with their own citizens on this. Just last November, you had a ballot initiative to raise the minimum wage in New Jersey. Governor Christie opposed it. It got 60 percent of the vote because voters understood this is the right thing to do and it will be good for the economy, not bad for the economy. It will be good because suddenly workers now have a little more money in their pockets and they're out there and businesses have more customers. <p>And when it comes to making sure that Americans have access to affordable health care, we're seeing the same pattern. Peter alluded to it. Right now we've already got close to 4 million Americans who have signed up for exchanges. We've got 3 million Americans who were able to stay on their parent's plan because of the law. We've got close to 7 million Americans who have access to health care for the first time because of Medicaid expansion. So we've already got well over 10 million Americans just in the first few months, despite problems with healthcare.gov in the first month and a half, who suddenly have the financial security that, in some cases, they've never known before. <p>And we're doing it while reducing the costs, the health care inflation that's out there and that's been plaguing us and hurting our businesses, our families, and our economies for a very long time. We've seen now three consecutive years of the lowest increase in health care inflation in the last 50, even as we're covering more people. <p>Now, as you know, there have been a lot of Governors and State legislators that are still resisting doing right by their people. But the good news is, is that we've got a bunch of Democratic Governors who are willing to take on this fight. Terry McAuliffe in Virginia, I know that he is fighting this good fight. And we want to make sure that all across the country, we are supporting Governors who are saying, I'm going to set politics aside, I'm going to do what's right for my constituents. <p>And ultimately, that's what the American people are interested in. They're not interested in ideological battles. What they're interested in is action that is focused on their lives, on their hopes, on their aspirations. That's what they want us to focus on each and every day. And that's what we are offering: more jobs, better training, better education, better pay, more ladders of opportunity for folks who currently don't have opportunity. That's what our agenda is about, and it is an agenda that resonates with the American people. <p>But we're going to need your help to make sure that it moves forward. And we wouldn't be able to do that unless we had already some outstanding Democratic Governors who are here and have made me very proud. They are great partners with me. <p>I appreciate Peter's sentiment. In some cases, in some States, there are some fierce battles when you expand something like health care. The fact that you guys on the frontlines are willing to stand up courageously means the world to me. More importantly, it's going to mean the world to your constituents and future generations. <p>So thank you, everybody. Appreciate it. I'm proud of you.\" "
"33" "\"Well, it is wonderful to have America's Governors in town, and Michelle and I look forward to hosting with their spouses our annual Governors' reception here and dinner. And it's always a great opportunity to exchange ideas and hear what's happening at the local level. <p>Today we did bring our Democratic Governors to the White House to spend some time talking about a couple of issues that are of critical importance to our constituencies and, I think, to the country. And one of those is the issue of the minimum wage and what we can do to give America a raise. <p>Many of the Governors in this room are pushing to raise their State minimum wages to benefit more working families and help to grow their economies. Governors Abercrombie, Governor Inslee, Governor Malloy, Governor O'Malley, Governor Patrick, Governor Quinn all focused on this in their State of the State addresses. <p>And in my State of the Union Address, obviously, I promised that I would do what I could as the head of the executive branch of the Federal Government and have already signed an Executive order saying that if you want to do business with the Federal Government as a Federal contractor, then you need to be paying your employees $10.10 an hour. We don't want somebody who is washing dishes for our troops or helping in some ways to care for them to be living in poverty when they're working full time. <p>And what we've discovered in looking at this issue is, is that increasingly, businesses recognize that raising wages for their employees is a smart business decision because they end up having lower turnover rates, higher productivity, higher morale, folks stay longer and are more focused on the job rather than having to worry about whether or not they can pay their bills at the end of the month. <p>And this is not just good policy, it also happens to be good politics. Because the truth of the matter is, the overwhelming majority of Americans think that raising the minimum wage is a good idea. That is true for Independents, that is true for Democrats, and it's true for Republicans. So in fact, where we've seen some of these issues going to referendum, for example, in New Jersey, even though the Republican Governor opposed it, it passed by 60 percent. <p>And the reason that this is important is not because everybody is going to be benefiting from a hike in the minimum wage. The truth is, is that most working Americans make more than the minimum wage already. But people, I think, instinctually understand that part of what this country should be about is if you're working hard and taking responsibility, that you can get ahead and that you can look after your family. And raising the minimum wage will help up to 16 million Americans, and that's a big deal. And that could give a boost to our economy as a whole. <p>So I'm going to continue to press Congress to pass a Federal minimum wage bill that goes up to $10.10 an hour, being sponsored currently by Senators Harkin and Representatives Miller. I'm going to be seeking Republicans who are game to work with us and prepared to work with us on this issue. As I said at the State of the Union, it's not something that requires a big bureaucracy, and it doesn't require a lot of Federal spending. All it requires is for us to stake out a claim on behalf of American workers that's consistent with our values as a nation. <p>And I'm going to be interested in hearing of the efforts of the Governors in this room to see what they can do to make sure that America gets a raise. <p>So I appreciate their presence. We've got a lot of other issues on the plate, but I wanted to highlight that one because I think it's something that is on a lot of people's minds: How can we boost people's incomes and wages if they're working hard so they can get ahead? <p>Thank you so much, everybody. Thank you, guys.\" "
"34" "\"Hi, everybody. Restoring the idea of opportunity for all requires a year of action from all of us. Wherever I can act on my own, I will. And whenever I can ask more Americans to help, I'll do that too. <p>In my State of the Union Address, for example, I asked more business leaders to take action to raise their employees' wages. Because even though our economy is growing and our businesses have created about 8&frac12; million new jobs over the past 4 years, average wages have barely budged. <p>So it's good news that, earlier this week, one of America's largest retailers, the Gap, decided to raise wages for its employees beginning this year. Their decision will benefit about 65,000 workers in the U.S. That means more families will be able to raise their kids, finish their studies, or keep up on their bills with a little less financial stress and strain. <p>And Gap's CEO explained their decision simply. He said, \\"[It's] right for our brands, good for our people, and beneficial to our customers.\\" And he's right. Raising Americans' wages isn't just a good deed, it's good business and good for our economy. It helps reduce turnover, it boosts productivity, and it gives folks some more money to spend at local businesses. <p>And as a chief executive myself, that's why I took action last week to lift more workers' wages by requiring Federal contractors to pay their employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour. <p>In the year since I first asked Congress to raise the minimum wage, six States have passed laws to raise theirs, and more States are working on it as we speak. But only Congress can finish the job and lift Americans' wages across the country. <p>Right now there's a bill before Congress that would boost America's minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. It's easy to remember: 10-10. That bill would lift wages for more than 16 million Americans without requiring a single dollar in new taxes or spending. But even though a majority of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans across the country support raising the minimum wage, Republicans in Congress don't want to give it a vote. <p>Hard-working Americans deserve better than \\"no.\\" Let's tell Congress to say \\"yes.\\" Pass that bill. Give America a raise. Because here in America, no one who works hard should have to live in poverty, and everyone who works hard should have a chance to get ahead. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"35" "\"Good evening, everybody. Please have a seat. Have a seat. Well, welcome to the White House. Everybody looks fabulous. I am truly honored to be one of Michelle Obama's guests tonight here at dinner. [<i>Laughter</i>] I want to thank all the Governors and their better halves for being here tonight, especially your chair, Mary Fallin, and your vice chair, John Hickenlooper. <p>Tonight we want to make sure that all of you make yourselves at home, to which I'm sure some of you are thinking, that's been the plan all along. [<i>Laughter</i>] But keep in mind what a wise man once wrote: \\"I am more than contented to be Governor and shall not care if I never hold another office.\\" Of course, that was Teddy Roosevelt. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I guess plans change. <p>I look forward to working with each of you not just in our meetings tomorrow, but throughout this year, what I hope to be a year of action. Our partnership on behalf of the American people on issues ranging from education to health care to climate change run deep, deeper than what usually hits the front page. <p>Being here tonight, I'm thinking about moments that I've spent with so many of you during the course of the year: with Governor Patrick at a hospital in Boston, seeing the survivors of the Boston bombing, seeing them fight through their wounds, determined to return to their families, but also realizing that a lot of lives were saved because of the preparations that Federal and State and local officials had carried out beforehand; with Governor Fallin at a firehouse in Moore, thanking first responders who risked their lives to save others after a devastating tornado, but once again seeing the kind of State-Federal cooperation that's so vital in these kinds of circumstances; spending time with Governor O'Malley at the Naval Academy graduation last spring and looking out over some of our newest sailors and marines as they join the greatest military in the world; and reminding ourselves that on national security issues, the contributions of the National Guard obviously are extraordinary, and all of you work so closely with them. <p>So if there's one thing in common in the moments like these, it's that our cooperation is vital to make sure that we're doing right by the American people. And what's common also is the incredible resilience and the goodness and the strength of the American people that we're so privileged to serve. And that resilience has carried us from the depths of the worst economic crisis in our lifetimes to what I am convinced can be a breakthrough year for America and the American people. <p>That, of course, will require that we collectively take action on what matters to them: jobs and opportunity. And when we've got a Congress that sometimes seems to have a difficult time acting, I want to make sure that I have the opportunity to partner with each of you in any way that I can to help more Americans work and study and strive and make sure that they see their efforts and their faith in this country rewarded. <p>I know we'll talk more about areas where we can work together tomorrow. So tonight I simply would like to propose a toast: To the families that support us, to the citizens that inspire us, and to this exceptional country that has given us so much. Cheers. <p>[<i>At this point, a toast was offered.</i>] <p>And with that, I would like to invite your chair, Governor Mary Fallin, to say a few words. Mary.\" "
"36" "\"Thank you so much. Everybody, please have a seat. <p>Welcome to the White House. I know that you've already been doing a lot of work, and I'm glad to be able to come here and engage in a dialogue with all of you. I want to thank Mary and John for their leadership at the NGA. I want to thank my outstanding Vice President, Joe Biden, who is very excited, I think, about the jobs initiative and is going to be&mdash;the job training initiative and, I think, is going to be doing a great job on that. <p>Michelle and I had a wonderful time hosting you guys last night, and I hope all the spouses enjoyed it. And I know Alex enjoyed it. [<i>Laughter</i>] One good thing about living here is that you can make all the noise you want and nobody is going to complain. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I enjoyed watching some of you with your eyes on higher office size up the drapes&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and each other. <p>We don't have a lot of time today, so I want to be very brief, go straight to Q&A and discussion. We're at a moment when our economy is growing; our businesses have now created over 8.5 million new jobs over the past 4 years. But as I've said several times, the trends that have battered the middle class for a couple of decades now are still there and still have to be addressed. Those at the top are doing very well. Ordinary families still feeling squeezed. Too many Americans are working harder than ever and just barely getting by. <p>And reversing these trends are going to require us to work together around what I'm calling an opportunity agenda based on four things: number one, more good jobs that pay good wages; number two, training more Americans to be able to take the jobs that are out there right now and the jobs that are created; number three, guaranteeing access to a world-class education for every American child all across our 50 States and our Territories; and making sure that hard work pays off, with wages that you can live on, savings that you can retire on, health insurance that you can count on. <p>And all of this is going to take some action. So far, just in the past few weeks, I've acted to lift the wages of workers who work for Federal contractors to pay their&mdash;make sure their employees are getting paid at least $10.10 an hour. We've ordered an across-the-board reform of our job training programs, much of it aligned with some of the work that Mary has done during her tenure as head of the NGA. We directed our Treasury to create a new way for Americans to start saving for retirement. We've been able to rally America's business leaders to help more of the long-term unemployed find work and to help us make sure that all of our kids have access to high-speed Internet and high-tech learning tools in the classroom. <p>The point is, this has to be a year of action. And I'm eager to work with Congress wherever I can. My hope is, is that despite this being an election year, that there will be occasions where both parties determine that it makes sense to actually get some things done in this town. But wherever I can work on my own to expand opportunity for more Americans, I'm going to do that. And I am absolutely convinced that the time is right to partner with the States and Governors of&mdash;all across the country on these agendas, because I know that you guys are doing some terrific work in your own States. <p>There may not be much of an appetite in Congress for doing big jobs bills, but we can still grow SelectUSA. Secretary Pritzker's team has put together a terrific formula where we're attracting investors from all around the world to see America as an outstanding place to invest. And I mentioned this at the State of the Union, for the first time last year, what we're seeing is, is that world investors now see America as the number-one place to do business rather than China. And it's a sign of a lot of things converging, both on the energy front, worker productivity, our innovation, our research, our ease of doing business. And a lot of that work is as a consequence of steps we've taken not just at the Federal level, but also at the State level. So we've got to take advantage of that. <p>Secretary Pritzker has been helping a Belgian company create jobs in Stillwater, Oklahoma, helping an Austrian company create jobs in Cartersville, Georgia. So we can do more of this, and we'd really want to engage with you over the next several months to find ways that we can help market America and your States to businesses all around the world and bring jobs back. <p>Since I called on Congress to raise the minimum wage last year, six States have gone ahead and done it on their own. Last month, I asked more business leaders to raise their workers' wages. Last week, Gap said it would lift wages for about 65,000 of its employees. Several of you are trying to boost wages for your workers. I'm going to do everything I can to support those efforts. <p>While Congress decides what it's going to do on making high-quality pre-K available to more kids, there is bipartisan work being done among the folks in this room. You've got Governors like Robert Bentley and Jack Markell, Susana Martinez, Deval Patrick, all expanding funding or dedicating funds to make that happen in their States. And we want to partner with you. This year, I'll pull together a coalition of philanthropists, elected officials, and business leaders, all of whom are excited and interested in working with you to help more kids access the high-quality pre-K that they need. <p>And while Congress talks about repealing the Affordable Care Act or doing this or doing that to it, places like California and Kentucky are going gangbusters and enrolling more Americans in quality, affordable health care plans. You've got Republican Governors here&mdash;I won't name them in front of the press, because I don't want to get you all in trouble&mdash;who have chosen to cover more people through new options under Medicaid. And as a result, millions of people are going to get help. <p>States that don't expand Medicaid are going to be leaving up to 3.4&mdash;5.4 Americans&mdash;million Americans uninsured. And that doesn't have to happen. Work with us to get this done. We can provide a lot of flexibility. Folks like Mike Beebe in Arkansas have done some terrific work designing programs that are right for their States, but also provide access to care for people who need it. And I think Kathleen Sebelius, a former Governor herself, has shown herself willing to work with all of you to try to find ways to get that done. <p>On the West Coast, you've got Governors Brown, Inslee, Kitzhaber who are working together to combat the effects of climate change on their States. We've set up the task force of Governors and mayors and tribal leaders to help communities prepare for what we anticipate are going to be intensifying impacts of climate change. And we're setting up climate hubs in seven States across the country to help farmers and ranchers adapt their operations to a changing environment. <p>In the budget that I'll send to Congress next week, I'm going to propose fundamentally reforming the way Federal Governments fund wildfire suppression and prevention to make it more stable and secure, and this is an idea that's supported by both Democrats and Republicans. <p>And finally, I want to thank those of you who have worked with Michelle and Jill Biden on their Joining Forces initiative to support our military families. At your meeting here 2 years ago, they asked for your help to make it easier for servicemembers and their spouses to carry licenses for professions like teaching or nursing from State to State, rather than have to get a new one every time they were reassigned. At the time, only 12 States had acted to make this easier for spouses; only 9 had acted to make it easier for servicemembers. Today, 42 States have passed legislation to help spouses; 45 States have made it easier for servicemembers. We've got a few States remaining. Let's get it done for everybody, because it's the right thing to do for those men and women who are working every day to make sure we stay free and secure. <p>And the point is, even when there is little appetite in Congress to move on some of these priorities, at the State level, you guys are governed by practical considerations. You want to do right by your people, and you see how good policy impacts your citizens, and you see how bad policy impacts your citizens, and that means that there's less room for posturing and politics and more room for getting stuff done. <p>We want to work with you. And I'm committed to making sure that every single member of my Cabinet, every single person in the White House, every single member of my team will be responsive to you. We won't agree on every single issue every single time, but I guarantee you that we will work as hard as we can to make sure that you succeed. Because when you succeed, the people in your States succeed and America succeeds, and that's our goal. <p>So thank you very much, and I look forward to having a great discussion. All right? Thank you, everybody.\" "
"37" "\"Hello, everybody! Everybody, please have a seat. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hey! Thank you. <p>Well, welcome to the White House, everybody. We've got some pretty cool stuff up here, and we also have people here who can explain what it all is. But thank you so much for being here. We've got, first and foremost, some people who I'm proud to call friends and have been fighting on behalf of American workers every single day. <p>We've got the Governor of the great State of Illinois; Pat Quinn is here in the house. We've got somebody who is responsible for trimming my trees and potholes in front of my house&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and shoveling snow. And I haven't been back for a while; I don't know how it's going, but I'm assuming he's handling his business. The mayor of the great city of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel is here. We've got Phil LaJoy, who's the supervisor of Canton Township, Michigan, who is here. There he is. Good job, Phil. <p>And we've got some outstanding Members of Congress who are here, especially someone who just announced that this would be his last term in Congress, but is somebody who so many of us have learned from, have admired. He is a man who has, every single day of his life in office, made sure that he was fighting on behalf of people who really needed help. And he is going to be very missed. John, you are not just the longest serving Member of Congress in American history, you're also one of the very best. Michigan's own John Dingell is here. So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. And we are better off because of John's service, and we're going to miss you. <p>Now, today I am joined by researchers who invent some of the most advanced metals on the planet, designers who are modeling prototypes in the digital cloud, folks from the Pentagon who help to support their work. Basically, I'm here to announce that we're building Iron Man. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm going to blast off in a second. [<i>Laughter</i>] We've been&mdash;this has been a secret project we've been working on for a long time. [<i>Laughter</i>] Not really. Maybe. It's classified. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But keeping America at the cutting edge of technology and innovation is what is going to ensure a steady stream of good jobs into the 21st century. And that's why we're here today: to take new action to put America at the forefront of 21st-century manufacturing. <p>Now, this is a moment when our economy is growing, and it has been growing steadily for over 4 years now. Our businesses have created about 8&frac12; million new jobs over the past 4 years. The unemployment rate is the lowest it's been in over 5 years. Our manufacturing sector is adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s. So there's some good news to report, but the trends that have battered the middle class for decades have become, in some ways, even starker. While those at the top are doing better than ever, average wages have barely budged. Too many Americans are working harder than ever just to keep up. And it's our job to reverse those trends. <p>We've got to build an economy that works for everyone, not just a fortunate few. We've got to restore opportunity for all people. That's the essence of America: No matter who you are, where you come from, what you look like, how you started out, if you are willing to work hard and take responsibility, you can get ahead in America. <p>So I've been talking now for months about an opportunity agenda. And let me break it down into four parts. Number one, more good jobs that pay good wages: jobs in American manufacturing, rebuilding our infrastructure, innovation, energy. Number two, training workers with the skills they need to fill those jobs. Number three, guaranteed access to a world-class education for every child in America. And number four, making sure that hard work pays off with wages you can live on and savings you can retire on and health insurance you can count on when you need it. <p>Now, I'm looking forward to working with Congress wherever they're willing to do something on any of these priorities. And I have to say that the Members of Congress who are here all care deeply about these issues. But let's face it, sometimes, it's hard to get moving in Congress. We've got a divided Congress at this point. And so, in this year of action, wherever I can act on my own to expand opportunity for more Americans, I'm going to seize that opportunity. <p>And that's why we're here today. Already, my administration has launched two hubs for high-tech manufacturing. One is in Youngstown, Ohio, and it's focused on 3-D printing, an entirely new way by which the manufacturing process can accelerate and supply chains get stitched together and you integrate design and all the way through production in ways that are&mdash;can potentially be revolutionary. We've also focused on energy-efficient electronics in Raleigh, North Carolina. And what happens at each of these hubs is, we're connecting leading businesses to research universities so they're able to ensure that America leads the world in the advanced technologies that are going to make sure that we're at the forefront when it comes to manufacturing. <p>Now, my friend Congressman Tim Ryan, who's here today, helped&mdash;where's Tim? I just saw him, there he is&mdash;helped us get the first of these hubs off the ground. There's growing bipartisan momentum now behind these efforts. We've got two Republicans and two Democrats&mdash;Roy Blunt and Sherrod Brown in the Senate and Tom Reed and Joe Kennedy in the House&mdash;that have written bills that would help us create a true network of these hubs all across the country. <p>So I'm really encouraging Congress to pass these bills. They're good ideas. And what they do is not only help link up our top researchers with our best businesspeople, but suddenly, they become a focal point of opportunity, and businesses around the country and around the world start seeing, huh, if I'm interested in digital technologies, that's the place I should locate. If I'm interested in 3-D printing, let me go there. And so you get a virtuous cycle that can take place. And Congress, I think, has an opportunity to really expand these in a significant way. <p>In the meantime, while Congress decides on what it's going to do, we're going to go ahead and take some action to launch more of these hubs this year. And today we're announcing the next two advanced manufacturing hubs. One is in the Detroit area, and the other is in Chicago, Illinois. <p>Now, let me describe a little more why this is so important. For generations of Americans, manufacturing was the ticket to a good middle class life. We made stuff. And the stuff we made, like steel and cars and planes, made us the economic leader of the world. And the work was hard, but the jobs were good. And if you got on an assembly plant in Detroit or in a steel plant in Youngstown, you could buy a home. You could raise kids. You could send them to college. You could retire with some security. And those jobs didn't just tell us how much we were worth, they told us how we were contributing to the society and how we were helping to build America and gave people a sense of dignity and purpose. If they saw a Boeing plane or one of the Big Three cars rolling off the assembly line, they said, you know what, I made that. And they were iconic. And people understood that's what it made&mdash;what it meant for something to be made in America. <p>Now, advances in technology have allowed manufacturers to do more with less. Global competition means a lot of good manufacturing jobs went overseas. There was just more competition. Folks caught up to us, and they, in some cases, just copied what we were doing with lower wages, so the competition was fierce. And in the 2000s alone, we lost about one-third of all American manufacturing jobs, and the middle class suffered for it. <p>Now, the good news is, today, our manufacturers have added more than 620,000 new manufacturing jobs over the last 4 years. That's the first sustained manufacturing growth in over 20 years. But the economy has changed. So if we want to attract more good manufacturing jobs to America, we've got to make sure we're on the cutting edge of new manufacturing techniques and technologies. <p>And I just have to emphasize here that&mdash;because you'll hear some people say, well, why are manufacturing jobs so special, and this is a service economy. Nobody believes that we're going to duplicate all the manufacturing jobs that existed back in the forties and the fifties, just because the economy has changed. You go into an auto plant now, it's different then it was. Fewer people can make more cars. <p>But keep in mind that when we have manufacturing in this country, what ends up happening is that, first of all, there are a whole lot of suppliers to those manufacturers, so that one plant may be deceptive. It doesn't tell you all the companies all across the country that are working on behalf of those manufacturers. The services that are provided to those manufacturers, the advertising that's connected to it, and the architects and the designers and the software engineers&mdash;all those things may not be counted as manufacturing. But by us having those hubs of manufacturing, it has a ripple effect throughout the economy. <p>So we've got to focus on advanced manufacturing to keep that manufacturing here in the United States. That's what's going to help get the next Stark Industries off the ground. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So today&mdash;by the way, my Commerce Secretary, Penny Pritzker, is not here because she's in Silicon Valley meeting with business leaders and talking about how together we can work together to spur economic growth. <p>The point is, I don't want the next big job-creating discovery to come from Germany or China or Japan. I want it to be made here in America. <p>And&mdash;this is one last point I'm going to make about this&mdash;typically, a lot of research and development wants to be colocated with where manufacturing is taking place. Because if you design something, you want to see how is it working and how is it getting made and then tinker with it and fix it and try something different. So if all the manufacturing is somewhere else, the lead we've got in terms of design and research and development, we'll lose that too. That will start locating overseas. And we will have lost what is the single most important thing about American economy, and that is innovation. <p>So that's what all these hubs are about. They're partnerships that bring together companies and universities to develop cutting-edge technology, train workers to use that technology, and then make sure that the research is translated into real-world products made by American workers. <p>So the first hub, in Michigan, is going to focus on developing advanced lightweight materials. Detroit has already helping lead the American comeback in manufacturing. Since we stepped in to help our automakers retool, the American auto industry has created almost 425,000 new jobs. And they've already begun using new high-strength steel to make lighter cars that use less gas, save money, help save the planet, cars are still safe, because of these new metals. <p>And that's just one example of the incredible things these new metals can do. You're seeing the same thing when it comes to lighter armored vehicles for our troops, planes and helicopters that can carry bigger payloads. If you look at some of the new planes that Boeing is manufacturing, they look lighter; even though they have the same capacity, they use less fuel. Wind turbines that generate more power at less cost. Prosthetic limbs that help people walk again who never thought they could. So we believe there's going to be an incredible demand for these metals, both for&mdash;both from the military and from the private sector, and we want to make sure they're made right here in America. We want our workers to have those jobs. So that's what our first hub is going to do, focus on making these cool metals. <p>Second hub, based in Chicago, but keep in mind, this is a consortium of more than 40 companies, 23 universities, labs like Northwestern and University of Illinois, and nearly 200 small businesses. A number of other States are participating in these&mdash;in this consortium. It's funded by a $70 million award led by the Defense Department, but the State and its businesses raised $250 million in private funding commitments to help win this bid and make it happen. <p>So this Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation [Institute; White House correction.] is going to be headquartered not far from downtown Chicago, on Goose Island, where there's also a very superior beer in case you are&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I'm just letting you know. [<i>Laughter</i>] A little hometown plug there. Feel free to use that, Goose Island. [<i>Laughter</i>] And it's going to focus on using digital technology and data management to help manufacturers turn their ideas into real-world products faster and cheaper than before. And it will include training to help more Americans earn the skills to do these digital manufacturing jobs. <p>And this is critical: The country that gets new products to market faster and at less cost, they'll win the race for the good jobs of tomorrow. And if you look at what's happening in manufacturing, a lot of it is much more specific. Right? Companies want to keep their inventories low. They want to respond to consumer demand faster. And what that means is, is that manufacturers who can adapt, retool, get something out, change for a particular spec of a particular customer, they're going to win the competition every time. <p>And we want that country that is specialized in this to be us, the United States of America. We want suppliers to be able to collaborate with customers in real time, test their parts digitally, cut down on the time and money that they spend producing expensive prototypes. We want our manufacturers to be able to custom-design products tailored to each individual consumer. We want our troops to be able to download digital blueprints they can use to 3-D print new parts and repair equipment right there in the field. And these are all ambitious goals, but this is America. That's what we do; we're ambitious. We don't make small plans. <p>Now, that doesn't mean we're going to be able to make all these happen overnight. This stuff takes time. And we also know these manufacturing hubs have the potential to fundamentally change the way we build things in America. So 10 years from now, 20 years from now, imagine our workers manufacturing materials that used to be science fiction: a sheet of metal that's thinner than paper, but is strong as steel. Or our workers being able to design a product using these materials entirely on a computer, they bring it to market, less money, hire folks to build it right here, sell it all over the world. That's what the next generation of American manufacturing could look like. <p>But to get there, we can't stop at just four of these hubs. I'm really excited about these four hubs; the only problem is, Germany has 60 of them. Germany has 60 of them. Part of the reason Germany has been able to take the lead in certain manufacturing areas is because they've invested in these hubs and then they invest in the training of the workers for these very precise machines and tools, and that means that that cuts into our market share when it comes to manufacturing around the world. <p>So we can't let Germany have 60 and us have four. We've got to do better. So I'm hoping that we can get these outstanding Members of Congress to push this through so I can sign a bill. But without waiting for Congress, we can launch four new manufacturing hubs this year. That's our intention. My Department of Energy is announcing the competition for the first of these new hubs today. So to businesses and universities or civic leaders who are watching, start forming those partnerships now. Turn your community into a global center for creating high-tech jobs. <p>We can't turn the clock back to earlier, easier times when thousands of Americans would just punch in at a single factory and pound out the products for the industrial age. But thanks in part to our investment and most importantly to the collaboration of some of these outstanding institutions and leaders, factories that once went dark are turning their lights on again. More assembly lines are churning out the cars that the world wants to buy, humming with components of the clean energy age. If we stay focused on winning this race, we will make sure the next revolution in manufacturing is an American revolution. And we'll make sure that opportunity for all is something that's made in the U.S.A. <p>Thanks very much, everybody. Congratulations. Good job. Keep it up.\" "
"38" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, OFA! Hey! Well, it is good to see all of you. Thank you. Everybody, sit down, sit down, sit down. The&mdash;everybody give Joshua a big round of applause. I thought he did an excellent job. His parents and family, who are with him here today, are very proud. They get a little, special seat. This is nice. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>The&mdash;well, it is great to see all of you. And I could not be prouder of everything that you've done. I just always get excited when I have a chance to see OFA because what I know is that each and every day you are out there in your communities, talking to your friends, talking to your neighbors, talking to your coworkers. And that's how change is made. That's how this country continues to constantly evolve so that it's a little bit fairer and more people have opportunity because wonderful folks, day in, day out, are out there doing their small part to make our democracy work. So I am really, really proud of all of you, and it is great to see all of you. <p>I&mdash;4 weeks ago tonight, actually, I delivered my State of the Union Address. [<i>Applause</i>] Yes. And I focused on some ideas that have been at the heart of this journey dating back to 2007, when some of you may have gotten involved in the campaign for the first time. That was back when I had no gray hair&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> You look good! <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you, thank you. [<i>Applause</i>] Thank you. Michelle thinks so too. Michelle thinks so too. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I didn't wear a tie back then, which I miss. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But when we talked about our vision, about why I was running and why so many folks at a grassroots level were getting involved all across the country, there were some basic principles, some basic tenets. And at the core of it was this idea of opportunity, the idea that in America, it shouldn't matter where you started, it shouldn't matter what you look like, where you come from, who you love, what your last name is, what you worship. What matters is you willing to work hard. What matters is your willingness to take responsibility for yourself and your family and your community and your Nation. And if you are willing to do those things, you should be able to get ahead. <p>It doesn't mean that everybody is suddenly wildly rich. It means that you can make it. It means that you've got some basic security. It means that you can afford a home and that you can send your kids to college and make sure they get a good education. And you can retire with dignity and respect, and you've got health care you can count on. And you can pass on a sense of hope and optimism to your children. That was what we fought for. <p>And the problem at the time obviously was not just that that idea had been betrayed or was not being fully realized for decades; it was also that we were in the midst of one of the worst financial crises&mdash;we didn't fully know it when I was running&mdash;but we ended up being in one of the first&mdash;the worst financial crises in our history. <p>And so we've spent a lot of time now digging back, digging out of that&mdash;fighting back and digging out of that hole. And it's been challenging, and it's been tough. And some of you in your own personal lives, you've seen the effects of it. Some folks here may have lost their home during that crisis. Some folks here may have lost their jobs during that crisis. Some folks here may have seen someone else in their family suffer from the effects of that Great Recession. <p>And the good news is, is that over the course of the last 4&frac12; years, we have seen the economy grow. We've seen our businesses create more than 8.5 million new jobs. We've seen&mdash;the auto industry has come roaring back. We've seen manufacturing creating jobs consistently for the first time since the 1990s. We've got a lot of work behind us clearing away the rubble of that crisis. <p>And so I believe that this year we are poised potentially to see a breakout year for America. There's no country on Earth that is better positioned to take advantage of the future than us. We've got the best businesses, the best workers, the best universities, the best scientists, the most innovative economy on Earth. <p>But&mdash;and here's the catch, and this is what I talked about at the State of the Union Address&mdash;what we've still seen, even as we've recovered from the recession, is this long-term trend that has not yet been reversed in which we've got folks at the very top doing better than ever and working class families, middle class families, folks struggling to get into the middle class have continued to have to work harder and harder and harder just to get by. And more of those ladders of opportunity into the middle class have been taken away. <p>And as I said at the State of the Union, our job, our generational task is to reverse those trends and get back to a point where our economy is growing in a broad-based way, an economy in which everybody feels the benefits, an economy in which everybody feels more secure. That's what we're fighting for. That's what we're fighting for. <p>And so I put forward then what we called an opportunity agenda. And it's pretty simple; we can break it down into four component parts. Number one, more good jobs that pay a good wage, because we know that work is not just a matter of a paycheck, it also gives people a sense of purpose and dignity and shape to their lives. Number two, making sure that everybody who doesn't have a job is trained in the skills they need to get those good jobs. Number three, a world-class education for every child in America; not just some, but every child in America. And number four, that work pays, so that if you're working full time, you're not in poverty; so that you're bringing home enough to cover your bills; that you have some semblance of security; that you have some savings that you can retire on; so that you've got health care that you can count on. <p>Now, what I've also said is, look, I want to work with Congress wherever possible. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, folks shouldn't laugh at that. There are a lot of folks in Congress who I think want to get some stuff done, but unfortunately, not enough to break through some of this gridlock. We're going to see this year, an election year, whether they can move forward on some of these priorities. But what I also said is this is going to be a year of action, so I'm not going to wait. Where Congress does not act and I've got a chance to help middle class Americans and folks trying to get in the middle class, we're going to go ahead and act without them. <p>And over the past 4 weeks, we've tried to show what that means, because we've moved on all four areas of this opportunity agenda. <p>[<i>At this point, the President sneezed</i>.] <p><i>Audience members</i>. Bless you! <p><i>The President. </i>I've been working so hard I might be getting a cold. [<i>Laughter</i>] I actually think I'm okay. I'm just&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Get covered! [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Got to get covered. That's right. Got to get covered. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So just I'll give you a couple of examples. We've launched new hubs to help bring 21st-century manufacturing jobs back to America, to our shores. We ordered reforms in our job training system so that folks are being trained for jobs that actually exist and so that when you get trained, you know that there's a job out there for you. <p>We rallied business leaders to help make sure that there's the fastest possible broadband in every classroom in America. And we've already gotten that started with billions of dollars in commitments that are going to be going into classrooms. And we're going to help teachers so that they're trained to help these students take advantage of these new technologies. <p>I signed, as many of you know, an Executive order saying that if you want a contract with the Federal Government, you've got to pay your workers $10.10 an hour. They deserve fair pay. <p>So we've made some progress, but we've got more to do. And as usual, I need your help. You guys are going to be the key to helping to drive some of this agenda not just next month, not just over the next 6 months, but over the course of this year. Because we want to be able to look back and say we've made some progress on this opportunity agenda. <p>So let me just talk to you about what I really want you to focus on. Number one, let's make sure we're giving America a raise. [<i>Applause</i>] Let's make sure we're giving America a raise. One thing that Americans across the board agree on is, if you work full time in the wealthiest nation on Earth, you shouldn't be in poverty. You shouldn't be in poverty. And in the year since I first asked Congress to raise the minimum wage, six States have gone ahead and raised theirs. More are working on it. I just met with the Governors this past weekend. You've got a whole bunch of Governors who are saying we need to raise this minimum wage. <p>In my State of the Union Address, I called on business leaders to start raising their minimum wage. And last week, the Gap announced that it was going to raise its base wage for 65,000 of its employees, which was good news, obviously, for them. This should not be hard to do. <p>Three-quarters of Americans support raising the minimum wage, not just Democrats; Independents, Republicans support raising the minimum wage. Unfortunately, so far we have seen Republicans in Congress not even want to vote on it, even though the current proposal would potentially provide more income for 16 million Americans. <p>Now, I know that OFA volunteers from coast to coast held a day of action last week to let people know it makes no sense to block a vote on raising the minimum wage, telling people how to fight back. This is really important. Three-quarters of your neighbors, your friends, your coworkers agree with us on this. We just have to get them activated. <p>It doesn't involve a big, new Government program. It doesn't involve a big, new bureaucracy. It doesn't involve new Federal spending. All it involves is Congress taking a vote, and three-quarters of the American people say it's the right thing to do. And it won't just be good for those families, it will be good for our economy as a whole, because when ordinary families have more money in their pockets, they go out and spend it. And when they go out and spend it, that means business has more customers, and that means more profits, and that means they can hire more workers. And the whole economy starts going up. <p>So this is good for our economy, and it's good for everybody. But I'm going to need all of you to keep on pushing on that front. <p>The second thing: I could not be prouder of the work that you've done to help America get covered. Joshua told you his story. He is an example that is duplicated all across the country. Because of you, we now have 4 million Americans who have signed up for quality, private health insurance through the marketplace exchanges. Four million people have already signed up because of you&mdash;4 million. [<i>Applause</i>] Four million, 4 million. That's on top of the 3 million young people who have been able to get coverage by staying on their parent's plan, and on top of the millions of Americans who are signing up to get Medicaid for the first time. <p>So you've already, because of the work that you've done, made sure that people all across America are getting better coverage. And that is also in addition to the seniors who have gotten discounts on their prescription drugs because we've closed the doughnut hole and all the people who already had health insurance, but now don't have to face lifetime limits now aren't going to be&mdash;because of some fine print&mdash;left out in the lurch when they actually need their health insurance. It doesn't count all the preventive care that's suddenly available to everybody. <p>And those things are making a difference in people's lives right now, and you've done that. But we've got more work to do. The fact is, is that we want everybody covered, not just some. That was always the intention, and everybody now has the opportunity to get covered. But let's face it, a combination of a implacable opposition that has spent hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars, spreading misinformation on this plan, you combine that with, let's face it, the website didn't work for the first month, and all those things combined mean that a lot of people who really could use this coverage are still unsure or dissuaded or haven't checked it out for themselves. <p>And we've got to make sure that they know that this will pay off for them; that the majority of people out there, if they actually check their plans, when you combine it with the tax credits, can get health insurance for a hundred dollars or even less, in some cases, less than the cost of their cell phone bill or their cable bill. And they'll have that security, that peace of mind. It means women can't be charged more than men just because they're women. It means that if you've got a preexisting condition, you don't have to worry about being able to get coverage if you lose your job anymore. <p>So everybody here has got a story. A lot of you, you got involved in the first place because of this health care issue, a lot of you are&mdash;because I know. I was&mdash;I met you on the campaign trail in some cases, and you came up and told me about a story of how painful and difficult an illness in the family had been and not knowing how you were going to pay for coverage, how you were going to pay for the care for a loved one. <p>So you all know this, and you can tell these stories in ways that are outside of politics. Politicians, if they're talking here in Washington, people discount them. I'll just be honest with you. People, they just assume, you know what, everybody is just yacking and trying to win an election. And so that's why misinformation can thrive. <p>But when they hear from their friends and their neighbors and their coworkers like you and you're able to say, hey, here, check it out, take a look on the website&mdash;if you reach out to your Republican friend who can't stand Obama, but is basically a nice person and they just&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but they watch the wrong newscast or&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. You all know those folks. I mean, some uncle or cousin, you love them to death, but they come in with all this information that's just wrong, and you're shaking your head, but you decide you don't want to get in an argument with them because you haven't seen them in a while and you miss them. [<i>Laughter</i>] Right? Everybody has got those folks. You know them. <p>So if you're able to reach out to them, and you just say, hey, take a look, here, here, let's get on the website. There's the price. There's the plan. Here's the tax credit. Here's what it will cost for you. Come on, Uncle Joe, I know you don't have health insurance. You may not like the President, but this really is a good deal. [<i>Laughter</i>] They'll listen to you, right? <p>And then there are some folks actually who do like me, but they just don't know. [<i>Laughter</i>] Because they're not paying attention. Because they're on one of the other channels that has \\"Real Housewives\\" or something. [<i>Laughter</i>] They really don't know that there's this health care plan out there. <p>So what you need to do is to continue what you're doing and reach out with your teams in your respective cities, States, towns, counties, because right now we've only got a few weeks left. March 31, that's the last call. If folks aren't signed up by March 31, they can't sign up again until the next open enrollment period with the 2015 rates. So if they want health insurance now, they need to sign up now. And we're going to make a big push these last few weeks. But as I said, I can talk, my team can talk here in Washington, it's not going to make as much of a difference as if you are out there making the case. <p>The work you're doing is God's work. It is hard work. You don't have the prerogative to just go around and say no to everything. You don't have the prerogative to just be cynical. You don't think that the country moves forward just on its own. You understand that it happens because ordinary people come together to do some extraordinary things. And let other people root for failure or refight the old battles. Our job is to make sure that this law works for everybody and to keep up the long fight to restore opportunity for all. <p>So let's get that minimum wage done and give America a raise. Let's get people signed up and make sure that everybody has coverage. Let's keep going on all the issues of equity and equal pay for equal work and making sure that families have security and that we're bringing jobs back to America and our kids are getting the education they need and that college is affordable. Let's keep working on these issues. <p>I never promised you it was going to be easy. I never did. And I always have to remind people that. [<i>Laughter</i>] Progress is hard. But progress is possible, and it's possible because of you. And that's why I couldn't be prouder of you. All right? <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"39" "\"Well, it is good to see all of you. And I've had a chance to hug you and catch up. So now it's all business. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Let me start by thanking Jim Messina and Jon Carson and all the OFA staff for the great work that they do each and every day. I've gotten a lot of compliments from a lot of you about the quality of the OFA staff, and I actually concur that they are terrific and passionate about the work that we're doing out there. <p>I just had a chance to talk to some of the leaders from States and communities all across the country who are pounding the pavement and talking to their neighbors and talking to their friends. And the levels of enthusiasm and energy that they projected was inspiring, and it really reminds me of why what I do in the White House matters, because I got folks like that&mdash;out on the ground, out in communities every single day&mdash;that are counting on me to give voice to the incredible work that they're doing, but also the values that they represent. <p>And I want to thank all of you. As I look around the room, I would not be President if it were not for this room. And there are a lot of people here who are new friends, but there are also some folks here who supported me way back in the day when I had no gray hair and I didn't wear a tie. Somebody just showed me a picture the other day, and I looked really young. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Most of this is just going to be a conversation. I want to spend time on questions and answers and dialogue and discussion. But let me just make a couple of quick comments. <p>Number one, as I said at the State of the Union Address, I genuinely think this year can be a breakout year for America. We have now really consolidated the recovery. If you look at the statistics&mdash;8.5 million new jobs, unemployment rate the lowest it's been since before I was elected; you've got manufacturing coming back; we've made progress on energy, fuel efficiency, carbon emissions reductions; making steady progress in terms of reforming our education system&mdash;we're actually poised to make the 21st century the American century, just like the 20th century was. <p>And Alan Solomont is over here nodding his head. Alan was representing the United States and did an outstanding job in Spain. And one of the remarkable things that I think he will affirm is that everybody outside of the United States actually thinks that we're doing a remarkable job, that our economic growth is the envy of most of the developed world. And yet that's not always reflected in people's moods here in the States. <p>And there's a reason for that. Our growth has been uneven. Those of us at the very top have disproportionately benefited from productivity gains, technology, globalization. Middle class families, working class families, still feel like they're struggling every single day to get by. And the ladders of opportunity for folks who want to work their way into the middle class are not as robust as they used to be. And so, even in the midst of recovery, there's still a lot of anxiety out there. <p>And what I said in the State of the Union was that we have to be focused like a laser on building back up an opportunity society in which everybody feels like if they work hard and if they're responsible, they can get ahead. And that means more jobs; that means making sure people are trained for the jobs that are out there. It means making sure kids get a world-class education. It means that work pays and that not only are they getting a decent paycheck that can support their families, but that they've got retirement security and health care security and all the things that give them a stable platform to live their lives and make sure their kids succeed. So we're doing that. <p>And I've also said that Congress may not be willing to break gridlock during a Presidential year. I'm going to look for every opportunity to work with them. But if they're not, we're just going to go ahead and do some work. <p>So just one example: Today at the White House, we announced two more advanced manufacturing hubs, one in Detroit and one in Chicago, where we are going to take cutting-edge research that's being done on advanced metallurgy and digital technology. And consortiums of universities and businesses are coming together to bring jobs back to the United States of America, attract investment. And we didn't have to do that with some legislation, although there is some legislation pending in Congress that could expand it. <p>We did the same thing to make sure Federal contractors are paying their employees $10.10 an hour. We're doing the same thing when it comes to making sure that we've got high-speed broadband in every classroom in America. I already have a commitment that's going to mean millions of students, about 20 million students, 15,000 schools across America, are going to be wired for broadband. We're doing that in conjunction with the FCC and the private sector. And so we're just going to keep on looking for ways in which we can realize the values that we've been fighting for, for a long time. <p>But as all of you know because you were involved in 2008 or 2012, it doesn't work if we don't have folks on the ground who are speaking out on behalf of these issues and these values. Politics has become so toxic and information is so contested and people are separated from how they get news, that oftentimes to break through, what's necessary is the validation of a neighbor or a friend or a coworker or a family member. And that's where OFA comes in, because it's able to, in very concrete terms, help to generate people's energy and mobilize their interest around these issues in ways that are not abstract, but are very concrete and very specific and that reach people where they live, at the kitchen table, and at the water cooler at work. And that grassroots work that is done also then energizes me and informs the issues that we're going to try to lift up over the course of the next year. <p>So I just want to say to all of you, what you're doing is really important, and we really appreciate it. And you don't always&mdash;it's not always flashy. It's often at the ground level, but it makes a difference. <p>And one final example of that difference that's being made is when it comes to the Affordable Care Act. Obviously, nowhere has there been more misinformation, nowhere are just basic facts more contested. But as a consequence of some of the folks that have been doing this work on the ground, as of today, we've signed up more than 4 million people through the exchanges. That's 4 million people who have the security of health care, in many cases for the very first time. And that doesn't count the 3 million who are already able to get health insurance because they're staying on their parent's plan. That doesn't count the millions who have been able to sign up through Medicaid. And we're not done yet. <p>So when you've got grassroots folks who are committed and energized like they are, it makes a difference. And whatever issues you care about, whether it's climate change or women's reproductive health or foreign policy or education or access to higher education, having folks who are willing to fight for what they believe in connected to what we do here is really powerful and important. And they couldn't do it without you. <p>So I just wanted to say thank you to all of you.\" "
"40" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, St. Paul! Oh, it is good to be back in Minnesota. <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. That's why I came here. It's great to see you. <p>Although, can I just say that when we got off the plane, Secretary Foxx, who is from North Carolina, turned to me, and he said, this is the coldest I've ever been in my life. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, we were only out there for like a minute&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;which goes to show how soft these folks from North Carolina are when it comes to the weather. [<i>Laughter</i>] I, on the other hand, am from Chicago. I walked off those stairs, I was, like, this is balmy, this is great. [<i>Laughter</i>] February in Minnesota, can't beat it. Cannot beat it. <p>Now, in addition to Secretary Foxx, who I want to&mdash;give him a big round of applause for that introduction. You've two champions for the people of Minnesota who are here today. You've got Representative Betty McCollum and Representative Keith Ellison. You've got your mayor, Chris Coleman, in the house. The new mayor of Minneapolis, Betsy Hodges, is here. And my great friend, who actually told me I was running for President before I knew I was running for President, R.T. Rybak. Love that name. Where's R.T.? He's around here somewhere. <p>Now, I want to thank everybody who showed me around Union Depot and gave me a preview of this new light-rail line. It is fantastic. And I also just want to say&mdash;even though he's not here today&mdash;I want to say to everybody how Michelle and I have been keeping in our thoughts and prayers one of the great Americans that we know, as well as a great Minnesotan, Walter Mondale. <p>Now, like millions of Americans, I've spent some time with Minnesotans lately&mdash;because I was watching the Olympics. [<i>Laughter</i>] Minnesota sent 19 athletes to the games. Now, that's tied for second most of any State, and they did us all proud. It is not shocking that Minnesotans might be pretty good at the Winter Olympics. [<i>Laughter</i>] What is particularly interesting is that, once again, the tiny town of Warroad proved that it really is Hockeytown, USA, thanks to T.J. Oshie and Gigi Marvin, who we're just so proud of. And T.J.'s shootout performance against the Russians, I must say, I enjoyed a lot. I tweeted at him about it. <p>So we've spent some time over the last few weeks on hockey, but I'm not here to talk about hockey. By the way, I cannot play hockey. [<i>Laughter</i>] I grew up in Hawaii. We do not have hockey in Hawaii. But I'm here to talk about what you're doing in the Twin Cities and how you're helping to create new jobs and new opportunities for every American. <p>We are at a moment when our economy is growing. Our businesses have created about 8&frac12; million new jobs in the past 4 years. Unemployment is at the lowest it's been in over 5 years; in Minnesota, it's lower than it's been in 6&frac12; years. And by the way, you've got a great Governor who I served with in the Senate, Mark Dayton, who is helping to make that happen. <p>So in a lot of ways, things are looking up. But in some ways, the trends that had been battering middle class families for a long time have gotten even starker, because those at the top are doing better than ever, while wages and incomes for a lot of families have barely budged. And too many families are working harder than ever just to keep up. So as I said at the State of the Union Address a few weeks back, our job is to reverse those trends. We've got to build an economy that works for everybody. We've got to restore opportunity for all people so that no matter who you are, where you come from, what you look like, you can get ahead if you work hard and you're responsible. <p>And so I laid out an opportunity agenda that has four parts. Number one, good jobs that pay good wages in manufacturing, in energy, in innovation, and infrastructure. Number two, train folks with the skills they need to get those good jobs, something that your Senator, Al Franken, is doing great work on every single day. He cares a lot about that job training issue. Number three, guaranteeing every child has access to a world-class education. And number four, making sure that hard work is rewarded with wages you can live on and savings you can retire on and health care you can count on. That's what we're fighting for. <p>Minnesota is helping to lead the way on these issues. Your State legislature is poised to raise your minimum wage this year. In my State of the Union Address, I called for a new women's economic agenda. It's actually a family economic agenda: equal pay for equal work, paid sick leave, and more. And there are leaders in your State legislature that are working hard at this because they know when women succeed, America succeeds. <p>So on all these issues, we're reaching out to Members of Congress, looking to see if they're willing to work with us on some of these priorities. But what I also said at the State of the Union is, in this year of action, whenever I can partner directly with States or cities or business leaders or civic leaders to act on this opportunity agenda, I'm going to go ahead and do it. We can't wait. We've got to move. We've got to get things going. Too many families are counting on it. <p>So yesterday I launched new hubs to attract 21st-century manufacturing jobs to America. And today I'm here to launch a new competition for 21st-century infrastructure and the jobs that come with it, because any opportunity agenda begins with creating more good jobs. And one of the fastest and best ways to create good jobs is by rebuilding America's infrastructure: our roads, our bridges, our rails, our ports, our airports, our schools, our power grids. We've got a lot of work to do out there, and we've got to put folks to work. <p>One of the most difficult things about the financial crisis we went through was the housing bubble bursting, and construction workers were hammered harder than just about anybody. And while we've cut the unemployment rate for construction workers almost in half since 2010, too many are still looking for jobs at a time when we've got so much that we could put them to work on rebuilding. We've got ports that aren't ready for the next generation of supertankers. We've got more than a hundred thousand bridges that are old enough to qualify for Medicare. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Everybody knows&mdash;and nobody knows better than Minnesotans&mdash;when we've gone through a winter like this, roads are wrecked, full of potholes all across the country. <p>Now, other countries are not waiting to rebuild their infrastructure. They're trying to outbuild us today so they can outcompete us tomorrow. As a percentage of GDP, countries like China, Germany, they're spending about twice what we're spending in order to build infrastructure because they know that if they have the fastest trains on the planet or the highest rated airports or the busiest, most efficient ports, that businesses will go there. <p>But we don't want businesses to go there. We want them to come here to Minnesota. We want them to come here to the United States of America. And that means the best airports and the best roads and the best trains should be right here in America. <p>At a time when companies are saying they intend to hire more people this year, we need to make that decision easier for them. And we can create jobs at the same time, rebuilding our transportation systems, our power grids, our communications networks, all the things that commerce relies on and that help get workers to those jobs. <p>So the bottom line is, there's work to be done, workers ready to do it. Rebuilding our infrastructure is vital to business. It creates good-paying jobs that, by the way, cannot be outsourced. This is one of Congress's major responsibilities: helping States and cities fund new infrastructure projects. <p>And the reason&mdash;part of the reason I'm focused on this is, Congress has an important deadline coming up. If Congress doesn't finish a transportation bill by the end of the summer, we could see construction projects stop in their tracks, machines sitting idle, workers off the job. <p>So next week, I'm going to send Congress a budget that funds rebuilding our transportation infrastructure in a more responsible way, by doing it over 4 years, which gives cities and States and private investors the certainty they need to plan major projects. Projects like repairing essential highways and bridges, building new transit systems in fast-growing cities and communities so folks who live there can get to work and school every day and spend less time sitting in traffic. And we're going to have to construct smarter, more resilient transportation systems that can withstand the worst impacts of climate change, like bigger surges of water that we've seen in recent floods. <p>So all told, my transportation budget will support millions of jobs nationwide. And we'll pay for these investments in part by simplifying the Tax Code. We're going to close wasteful tax loopholes, lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs here at home, stop rewarding companies for sending jobs to other countries, use the money we save for&mdash;in this transition to create good jobs with good wages rebuilding America. It makes sense. [<i>Applause</i>] It makes sense. <p>Now, I'll be honest with you, there are leaders in both parties who are willing to reach across the aisle in Congress when it comes to American infrastructure. They know how important it is. And infrastructure didn't use to be a partisan issue; it shouldn't be Democrat or Republican. Everybody uses roads, everybody uses ports, airports. Unfortunately, time and again over the past few years, there have been some Republicans in Congress who have refused to act on commonsense proposals that will create jobs and grow our economy. Partly, it's not that they're&mdash;I guess, they don't like roads, they just don't want to pay for them. It doesn't work that way. You've got to come up with a way to get these projects going. <p>So while Congress is deciding what it's going to do next, I'm just going to go ahead and do what I can to create more good jobs. And that's why I came here to St. Paul. [<i>Applause</i>] That's why I came here to St. Paul. <p>Because this project symbolizes what's possible. Union Depot was renovated and expanded with the help of what we call TIGER grants. These are competitive grants that we created as part of the Recovery Act, also known as the stimulus, which actually worked despite what everybody claims. So the idea is, if a city or State comes up with a plan to modernize transportation infrastructure that will have a significant impact on economic activity and if they line up other sources of funding to help pay for it, they can win a TIGER grant and the Federal Government becomes a partner with these local communities. <p>So far, these grants have given a boost to 270 infrastructure projects across all 50 States. And you heard Secretary Foxx talk about&mdash;these grants are helping cities like L.A. and States like North Carolina, and they helped you rebuild this depot into a hub that will bring different modes of transportation together under one roof instead of scattered across the city. Amtrak is going to be here. The new Metro Green Line will be here. Bus lines will be here. <p>And I just had a chance to take a look at some of those spiffy new trains. [<i>Laughter</i>] They are nice. They&mdash;and they're energy efficient. They're going to be reliable. You can get from one downtown to the other in a little over 30 minutes instead of when it's snowing being in traffic for 2 hours. The trains were made in California, which meant folks were put to work here in the United States building them. <p>And here's the best part of it: Not only have you made a more efficient transportation system, cutting down commutes, saving on gas, reducing carbon pollution, but this depot has also helped to boost economic development in Lowertown St. Paul. Just across the street, the old downtown post office building is becoming apartments and shops. All told, more than 4,000 jobs were created for this project. And we're seeing businesses crop up and new development crop up all along the line. <p>So everybody is winning. And in part because of some flexibility that we showed during the planning process, the line is also going to stop in some poor neighborhoods that oftentimes have difficulty getting to the places where there are jobs. So it's going to help folks who are willing to work hard, try getting to the middle class, it helps them get access&mdash;helps people get access to opportunity that, up until this point, had a tough time. <p>So we know this works. Today we're kicking off the next round of competition for TIGER grants. Mayors and Governors, city councils, State legislatures, all of you who are watching here today: If you've got a great idea for your city or your State, then let us know your plan. If it will encourage economic activity and support local businesses and help put people to work, then your country is interested in partnering with you. <p>And TIGER grants aren't the only way that we can help cities like St. Paul and Minneapolis rebuild their infrastructure. You've got&mdash;Federal funding helped to build the Green Line; that's going to make it easier than ever to travel between the two cities. You've got more than 5,000 construction workers from all over Minnesota helping to build it. Nearly 200 police officers, train operators, maintenance workers are being hired. And that's not counting all the jobs that are being created from the offices and the apartment buildings that are going to be built along the line. Because the trains stopped at neighborhoods that have access to public transportation, those folks are going to work. And all of this can be duplicated all across the country. <p>But unfortunately, funding for these projects are going to be in jeopardy unless Congress passes this new transportation bill. So I want everybody to understand. Now, the good news is, Keith Ellison, Betty, they're already on board. They know this needs to happen. Al Franken, all over it. Some Democrats and Republicans are already working together to make sure transportation doesn't&mdash;funding doesn't run out. And we're seeing some glimmers of hope, because this new round of TIGER grants was the result of bipartisan cooperation. That's what needs to happen when we work together. <p>But we're going to need your voices telling a story around the country about why this is so important. Roads and bridges should not be a partisan issue. More Americans should have access to the kind of efficient, affordable transit you're going to have with the Green Line. There's no faster way or better way for Congress to create jobs right now and to grow our economy right now and have a positive impact on our economy for decades than if we start more projects and finish more projects like this one. <p>Let's create more good jobs, build smarter schools, better airports, faster railways, better broadband networks. Let's educate our kids and our workers better. Let's rebuild an economy where everybody who is willing to work hard has a chance to get ahead. <p>This is the beginning, not the end. We've got a lot more rail we got to lay. We've got a lot more roads we've got to travel. Let's get going, Minnesota. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"41" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat. Well, good afternoon, everybody. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Good afternoon. <p><i>The President.</i> Welcome to the White House. And thank you, Christian, for that outstanding introduction. And thank you for cheering for the White Sox, which is the right thing to do. [<i>Laughter</i>] Like your parents and your teachers, I could not be prouder of you. I could not be prouder of the other young men who are here today. But just so we're clear&mdash;you're only excused for 1 day of school. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I'm assuming you've got your assignments with you so that you can catch up, perhaps even on the flight back. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>As Christian mentioned, I first met Christian about a year ago. I visited the Hyde Park Academy in Chicago, which is only about a mile from my house. And Christian was part of this program called Becoming a Man. It was a program that Mayor Rahm Emanuel introduced to me. And it helps young men who show a lot of potential, but may have gotten in some trouble to stay on the right path. <p>They get help with schoolwork, but they also learn life skills like how to be a responsible citizen and how to deal with life's challenges and how to manage frustrations in a constructive way and how to set goals for themselves. And it works. One study found that, among young men who participate in the B.A.M. program, arrests for violent crimes dropped 44 percent, and they were more likely to graduate from high school. <p>So as Christian mentioned, during my visit, they're in a circle, and I sat down in the circle, and we went around, led by their counselor, and guys talked about their lives, talked about their stories. They talked about what they were struggling with and how they were trying to do the right thing and how sometimes they didn't always do the right thing. And when it was my turn, I explained to them that when I was their age, I was a lot like them. I didn't have a dad in the house. And I was angry about it, even though I didn't necessarily realize it at the time. I made bad choices. I got high without always thinking about the harm that it could do. I didn't always take school as seriously as I should have. I made excuses. Sometimes, I sold myself short. <p>And I remember when I was saying this&mdash;Christian, you may remember this&mdash;after I was finished, the guy sitting next to me said, \\"Are you talking about you?\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] I said, \\"Yes.\\" <p>And the point was, I could see myself in these young men. And the only difference is that I grew up in an environment that was a little bit more forgiving, so when I made a mistake, the consequences were not as severe. I had people who encouraged me&mdash;not just my mom and grandparents, but wonderful teachers and community leaders&mdash;and they'd push me to work hard and study hard and make the most of myself. And if I didn't listen, they said it again. And if I didn't listen, they said it a third time. And they would give me second chances and third chances. They never gave up on me, and so I didn't give up on myself. <p>I told these young men my story then, and I repeat it now, because I firmly believe that every child deserves the same chances that I had. And that's why we're here today: to do what we can, in this year of action, to give more young Americans the support they need to make good choices and to be resilient and to overcome obstacles and achieve their dreams. <p>And this is an issue of national importance. It's as important as any issue that I work on. It's an issue that goes to the very heart of why I ran for President. Because if America stands for anything, it stands for the idea of opportunity for everybody, the notion that no matter who you are or where you came from or the circumstances into which you are born, if you work hard, if you take responsibility, then you can make it in this country. That's the core idea. <p>And that's the idea behind everything that I'll do this year and for the rest of my Presidency. Because at a time when the economy is growing, we've got to make sure that every American shares in that growth, not just a few. And that means guaranteeing every child in America has access to a world-class education. It means creating more jobs and empowering more workers with the skills they need to do those jobs. It means making sure that hard work pays off with wages you can live on and savings you can retire on and health care that you can count on. It means building more ladders of opportunity into the middle class for anybody who's willing to work hard to climb them. <p>Those are national issues. They have an impact on everybody. And the problem of stagnant wages and economic insecurity and stalled mobility are issues that affect all demographic groups all across the country. My administration's policies&mdash;from early childhood education to job training to minimum wages&mdash;are designed to give a hand up to everybody, every child, every American willing to work hard and take responsibility for their own success. That's the larger agenda. <p>But the plain fact is, there are some Americans who, in the aggregate, are consistently doing worse in our society: groups that have had the odds stacked against them in unique ways that require unique solutions, groups who've seen fewer opportunities that have spanned generations. And by almost every measure, the group that is facing some of the most severe challenges in the 21st century in this country are boys and young men of color. <p>Now, to say this is not to deny the enormous strides we've made in closing the opportunity gaps that marred our history for so long. My presence is a testimony to that progress. Across this country, in government, in business, in our military, in communities in every State, we see extraordinary examples of African American and Latino men who are standing tall and leading and building businesses and making our country strong. Some of those role models who have defied the odds are with us here today: the Magic Johnsons or the Colin Powells, who are doing extraordinary things; the Anthony Foxxes. <p>Anthony, yesterday he and I were talking about how both of us never knew our dads and shared that sense of both how hard that had been, but also how that had driven us to succeed in many ways. So there are examples of extraordinary achievement. We all know that. We don't need to stereotype and pretend that there's only dysfunction out there. But 50 years after Dr. King talked about his dream for America's children, the stubborn fact is that the life chances of the average Black or Brown child in this country lags behind by almost every measure, and it's worse for boys and young men. <p>If you're African American, there's about a one-in-two chance you grow up without a father in your house&mdash;one in two. If you're Latino, you have about a one-in-four chance. We know that boys who grow up without a father are more likely to be poor, more likely to underperform in school. <p>As a Black student, you are far less likely than a White student to be able to read proficiently by the time you are in fourth grade. By the time you reach high school, you're far more likely to have been suspended or expelled. There's a higher chance you end up in the criminal justice system and a far higher chance that you are the victim of a violent crime. Fewer young Black and Latino men participate in the labor force compared to young White men. And all of this translates into higher unemployment rates and poverty rates as adults. <p>And the worst part is, we've become numb to these statistics. We're not surprised by them. We take them as the norm. We just assume this is an inevitable part of American life, instead of the outrage that it is. That's how we think about it. It's like a cultural backdrop for us, in movies and television. We just assume, of course, it's going to be like that. But these statistics should break our hearts. And they should compel us to act. <p>Michelle and I are blessed with two beautiful daughters. We don't have a son. But I know if I had a son, on the day he was born, I would have felt everything I felt with Malia and Sasha: the awe, the gratitude, the overwhelming sense of responsibility to do everything in my power to protect that amazing new life from this big world out there. And just as our daughters are growing up into wonderful, beautiful young women, I'd want my son to feel a sense of boundless possibility. I'd want him to have independence and confidence, and I'd want him to have empathy and compassion. I'd want him to have a sense of diligence and commitment and a respect for others and himself, the tools that he'd need to succeed. <p>I don't have a son, but as parents, that's what we should want not just for our children, but for all children. And I believe the continuing struggles of so many boys and young men&mdash;the fact that too many of them are falling by the wayside, dropping out, unemployed, involved in negative behavior, going to jail, being profiled&mdash;this is a moral issue for our country. <p>It's also an economic issue for our country. After all, these boys are a growing segment of our population. They are our future workforce. When, generation after generation, they lag behind, our economy suffers. Our family structure suffers. Our civic life suffers. Cycles of hopelessness breed violence and mistrust. And our country is a little less than what we know it can be. So we need to change the statistics, not just for the sake of the young men and boys, but for the sake of America's future. <p>And that's why, in the aftermath of the Trayvon Martin verdict, with all the emotions and controversy that it sparked, I spoke about the need to bolster and reinforce our young men and give them the sense that their country cares about them and values them and is willing to invest in them. And I'm grateful that Trayvon's parents Sybrina and Tracey are here with us today, along with Jordan Davis's parents Lucia and Ron. <p>In my State of the Union Address last month, I said I'd pick up the phone and reach out to Americans willing to help more young men of color facing especially tough odds to stay on track and reach their full potential so America can reach its full potential. That's what today is all about. <p>After months of conversation with a wide range of people, we've pulled together private philanthropies and businesses, mayors, State and local leaders, faith leaders, nonprofits, all who are committed to creating more pathways to success. And we're committed to building on what works. And we call it \\"My Brother's Keeper.\\" <p>Now, just to be clear, \\"My Brother's Keeper\\" is not some big, new Government program. In my State of the Union Address, I outlined the work that needs to be done for broad-based economic growth and opportunity for all Americans: manufacturing hubs, infrastructure spending. I've been traveling around the country for the last several weeks talking about what we need to do to grow the economy and expand opportunity for everybody. And in the absence of some of those macroeconomic policies that create more good jobs and restore middle class security, it's going to be harder for everyone to make progress. And for the last 4 years, we've been working through initiatives like Promise Zones to help break down the structural barriers&mdash;from lack of transportation to substandard schools&mdash;that afflict some of this country's most impoverished counties, and we'll continue to promote these efforts in urban and rural counties alike. <p>So those are all Government initiatives, Government programs that we think are good for all Americans, and we're going to keep on pushing for them. But what we're talking about here today with \\"My Brother's Keeper\\" is a more focused effort on boys and young men of color who are having a particularly tough time. And in this effort, Government cannot play the only&mdash;or even the primary&mdash;role. We can help give every child access to quality preschool and help them start learning from an early age, but we can't replace the power of a parent who's reading to that child. We can reform our criminal justice system to ensure that it's not infected with bias, but nothing keeps a young man out of trouble like a father who takes an active role in his son's life. <p>In other words, broadening the horizons for our young men and giving them the tools they need to succeed will require a sustained effort from all of us. Parents will have to parent and turn off the television and help with homework. Teachers will need to do their part to make sure our kids don't fall behind and that we're setting high expectations for those children and not giving up on them. Business leaders will need to create more mentorships and apprenticeships to show more young people what careers are out there. Tech leaders will need to open young eyes to fields like computer science and engineering. Faith leaders will need to help our young men develop the values and ethical framework that is the foundation for a good and productive life. <p>So we all have a job to do. And we can do it together: Black and White, urban and rural, Democrat and Republican. So often, the issues facing boys and young men of color get caught up in long-running ideological arguments about race and class and crime and poverty, the role of government, partisan politics. We've all heard those arguments before. But the urgency of the situation requires us to move past some of those old arguments and focus on getting something done and focusing on what works. It doesn't mean the arguments are unimportant, it just means that they can't paralyze us. And there's enough good will and enough overlap and agreement that we should be able to go ahead and get some things done, without resolving everything about our history or our future. <p>Twenty years ago, Congresswoman Frederica Wilson started a program in the Miami public school system&mdash;you don't, well, feel free to stand up&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;to help young boys at risk of dropping out of school. Today, it serves thousands of students in dozens of schools. <p>As mayor of New York, Mayor Bloomberg, Michael Bloomberg, who's here today, started a Young Men's Initiative for African American and Latino boys because he understood that in order for America to compete, we need to make it easier for all our young people to do better in the classroom and find a job once they graduate. <p>A bipartisan group of mayors called Cities United has made this issue a priority in communities across the country. Senator Mike Lee, a leader of the Tea Party, has been working with Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat from my home State of Illinois, to reduce disparities in our criminal justice system that have hit the African American and Latino communities especially hard. <p>So I want to thank everybody who's been doing incredible work, many of the people who are here today, including Members of Congress, who have been focused on this and are moving the needle in their communities and around the country. <p>They understand that giving every young person who's willing to work hard a shot at opportunity should not be a partisan issue. Yes, we need to train our workers, invest in our schools, make college more affordable, and government has a role to play. And yes, we need to encourage fathers to stick around and remove the barriers to marriage and talk openly about things like responsibility and faith and community. In the words of Dr. King, it is not either-or, it is both-and. <p>And if I can persuade Sharpton and O'Reilly to be in the same meeting&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;then it means that there are people of good faith who want to get some stuff done, even if we don't agree on everything. And that's our focus. <p>While there may not be much of an appetite in Congress for sweeping new programs or major new initiatives right now, we all know we can't wait. And so the good news is, folks in the private sector who know how important boosting the achievement of young men of color is to this country, they are ready to step up. <p>Today I'm pleased to announce that some of the most forward-looking foundations in America are looking to invest at least $200 million over the next 5 years&mdash;on top of the $150 million that they've already invested&mdash;to test which strategies are working for our kids and expand them in cities across the country. <p>Many of these folks have been on the frontlines in this fight for a long time. What's more, they're joined by business leaders, corporate leaders, entrepreneurs who are stepping forward to support this effort as well. And my administration is going to do its part. So today, after my remarks are done, I'm going to pen this Presidential memorandum directing the Federal Government not to spend more money, but to do things smarter, to determine what we can do right now to improve the odds for boys and young mens of color and make sure our agencies are working more effectively with each other, with those businesses, with those philanthropies, and with local communities to implement proven solutions. <p>And part of what makes this initiative so promising is that we actually know what works and we know when it works. Now, what do I mean by that? Over the years, we've identified key moments in the life of a boy or a young man of color that will, more often than not, determine whether he succeeds or falls through the cracks. We know this&mdash;we know the data. We know the statistics. And if we can focus on those key moments, those life-changing points in their lives, you can have a big impact, you can boost the odds for more of our kids. <p>First of all, we know that during the first 3 years of life, a child born into a low-income family hears 30 million fewer words than a child born into a well-off family. And everybody knows babies are sponges, they just soak that up. A 30-million-word deficit is hard to make up. And if a Black or Latino kid isn't ready for kindergarten, he's half as likely to finish middle school with strong academic and social skills. So by giving more of our kids access to a high-quality early education and by helping parents get the tools they need to help their children succeed, we can give more kids a better shot at the career they're capable of and the life that will make us all better off. So that's point number one, right at the beginning. <p>Point number two, if a child can't read well by the time he's in third grade, he's four times less likely to graduate from high school by age 19 than one who can. And if he happens to be poor, he's six times less likely to graduate. So by boosting reading levels, we can help more of our kids make the grade, keep on advancing, reach that day that so many parents dream of&mdash;until it comes close, and then you start tearing up&mdash;and that's when they're walking across the stage, holding that high school diploma. <p>Number three, we know that Latino kids are almost twice as likely as white kids to be suspended from school. Black kids are nearly four times as likely. And if a student has been suspended even once by the time they're in ninth grade, they are twice as likely to drop out. <p>And that's why my administration has been working with schools on alternatives to the so-called zero-tolerance guidelines, not because teachers or administrators or fellow students should have to put up with bad behavior, but because there are ways to modify bad behavior that lead to good behavior, as opposed to bad behavior out of school. We can make classrooms good places for learning for everybody without jeopardizing a child's future. And by building on that work, we can keep more of our young men where they belong: in the classroom, learning, growing, gaining the skills they need to succeed. <p>Number four, we know that students of color are far more likely than their White classmates to find themselves in trouble with the law. If a student gets arrested, he's almost twice as likely to drop out of school. By making sure our criminal justice system doesn't just function as a pipeline for underfunded schools to overcrowded jails, we can help young men of color stay out of prison, stay out of jail. And that means, then, they're more likely to be employable and to invest in their own families and to pass on a legacy of love and hope. <p>And finally, we know young Black men are twice as likely as young White men to be disconnected: not in school, not working. We've got to reconnect them. We've got to give more of these young men access to mentors. We've got to continue to encourage responsible fatherhood. We've got to provide more pathways to apply to college or find a job. We can keep them from falling through the cracks and help them lay a foundation for a career and a family and a better life. <p>In the discussion before we came in, General Powell talked about the fact that there are going to be some kids who just don't have a family at home that is functional, no matter how hard we try. But just an adult&mdash;any adult&mdash;who's paying attention can make a difference. Any adult who cares can make a difference. <p>Magic was talking about being at a school in Chicago, and rather than going to the school, he brought the school to the company, Allstate, that was doing the work. And suddenly, just that one conversation meant these young men saw something different. A world opened up for them. It doesn't take that much. But it takes more than we're doing now. <p>And that's what \\"My Brother's Keeper\\" is all about: helping more of our young people stay on track, providing the support they need to think more broadly about their future, building on what works, when it works, in those critical life-changing moments. And when I say, by the way, building on what works, it means looking at the actual evidence of what works. There are a lot of programs out there that sound good, are well intentioned, well inspired, but they're not actually having an impact. And we don't have enough money or time or resources to invest in things that don't work, so we've got to be pretty hardheaded about saying if something is not working, let's stop doing it. Let's do things that work. And we shouldn't care whether it was a Democratic program or a Republican program or a faith-based program or&mdash;if it works, we should support it. If it doesn't, we shouldn't. And all the time recognizing that my neighbor's child is my child, that each of us has an obligation to give every child the same chance this country gave so many of us. <p>So in closing, let me just say this. None of this is going to be easy. This is not a 1-year proposition. It's not a 2-year proposition. It's going to take time. We're dealing with complicated issues that run deep in our history, run deep in our society, and are entrenched in our minds. And addressing these issues will have to be a two-way bargain. Because no matter how much the community chips in, it's ultimately going to be up to these young men and all the young men who are out there to step up and seize responsibility for their own lives. <p>And that's why I want to close by speaking directly to the young men who are here today and all the boys and young men who are watching at home. Part of my message, part of our message in this initiative is, \\"No excuses.\\" And government and private sector and philanthropy and all the faith communities, we all have a responsibility to help provide you the tools you need. We've got to help you knock down some of the barriers that you experience. That's what we're here for. But you've got responsibilities too. <p>And I know you can meet the challenge&mdash;many of you already are&mdash;if you make the effort. It may be hard, but you will have to reject the cynicism that says the circumstances of your birth or society's lingering injustices necessarily define you and your future. It will take courage, but you will have to tune out the naysayers who say that the deck is stacked against you, you might as well just give up or settle into the stereotype. <p>It's not going to happen overnight, but you're going to have to set goals, and you're going to have to work for those goals. Nothing will be given to you. The world is tough out there; there's a lot of competition for jobs and college positions. And everybody has to work hard. But I know you guys can succeed. We've got young men up here who are starting to make those good choices because somebody stepped in and gave them a sense of how they might go about it. <p>And I know it can work because of men like Maurice Owens, who's here today. I want to tell Moe's story just real quick. When Moe was 4 years old, he moved with his mom Chauvet from South Carolina to the Bronx. Now, his mom didn't have a lot of money, and they lived in a tough neighborhood. Crime was high. A lot of young men ended up in jail or worse. But she knew the importance of education, so she got Moe into the best elementary school that she could find. And every morning, she put him on a bus; every night, she welcomed him when he came home. <p>Shetook the initiative; she eventually found a sponsorship program that allowed Moe to attend a good high school. And while many of his friends got into trouble, some of it pretty serious, Moe just kept on getting on the bus and kept on working hard and reaching for something better. And he had some adults in his life that were willing to give him advice and help him along the way. And he ended up going to college. And he ended up serving his country in the Air Force. And today, Moe works in the White House, just two door down from the Oval Office, as the Special Assistant to my Chief of Staff. And Moe never misses a chance to tell kids who grew up just like he did that if he can make it, they can too. <p>Moe and his mom are here today, so I want to thank them both for this incredible experience. Stand up, Moe, and show off your mom there. [<i>Applause</i>] Good job, Moe. So Moe didn't make excuses. His mom had high expectations. America needs more citizens like Moe. We need more young men like Christian. We will beat the odds. We need to give every child, no matter what they look like, where they live, the chance to reach their full potential. Because if we do&mdash;if we help these wonderful young men become better husbands and fathers and well-educated, hardworking, good citizens&mdash;then not only will they contribute to the growth and prosperity of this country, but they will pass on those lessons on to their children, on to their grandchildren. We'll start a different cycle. And this country will be richer and stronger for it for generations to come. <p>So let's get going. Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. <p>[<i>At this point, the President signed the memorandum on creating and expanding ladders of opportunity for boys and young men of color.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> All right.\" "
"42" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. <p>Over the last several days, the United States has been responding to events as they unfold in Ukraine. Now, throughout this crisis, we have been very clear about one fundamental principle: The Ukrainian people deserve the opportunity to determine their own future. Together with our European allies, we have urged an end to the violence and encouraged Ukrainians to pursue a course in which they stabilize their country, forge a broad-based government, and move to elections this spring. <p>I also spoke several days ago with President Putin, and my administration has been in daily communication with Russian officials, and we''ve made clear that they can be part of an international community''s effort to support the stability and success of a united Ukraine going forward, which is not only in the interest of the people of Ukraine and the international community, but also in Russia''s interest. <p>However, we are now deeply concerned by reports of military movements taken by the Russian Federation inside of Ukraine. Russia has a historic relationship with Ukraine, including cultural and economic ties and a military facility in Crimea, but any violation of Ukraine''s sovereignty and territorial integrity would be deeply destabilizing, which is not in the interest of Ukraine, Russia, or Europe. <p>It would represent a profound interference in matters that must be determined by the Ukrainian people. It would be a clear violation of Russia''s commitment to respect the independence and sovereignty and borders of Ukraine and of international laws. And just days after the world came to Russia for the Olympic Games, it would invite the condemnation of nations around the world. And indeed, the United States will stand with the international community in affirming that there will be costs for any military intervention in Ukraine. <p>The events of the past several months remind us of how difficult democracy can be in a country with deep divisions. But the Ukrainian people have also reminded us that human beings have a universal right to determine their own future. <p>Right now the situation remains very fluid. Vice President Biden just spoke with Prime Minister&mdash;the Prime Minister of Ukraine to assure him that in this difficult moment, the United States supports his government''s efforts and stands for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and democratic future of Ukraine. I also commend the Ukrainian Government''s restraint and its commitment to uphold its international obligations. <p>We will continue to coordinate closely with our European allies, we will continue to communicate directly with the Russian Government, and we will continue to keep all of you in the press corps and the American people informed as events develop. <p>Thanks very much.\" "
"43" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello. My name is Shelly Ortiz and&mdash;oh, wrong page. [<i>Laughter</i>] All right, then, I was just teasing. I knew I wasn't Shelly Ortiz. [<i>Laughter</i>] Everybody give Shelly a big round of applause for the great work. Thank you so much. Thanks for not only the introduction, but for the beautiful video that you made about your dad. <p><i>Shelly Ortiz.</i> Thank you. <p><i>The President</i>. Us dads, we get pretty touched by stuff like that. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And I am thrilled that all of you are with us for our first-ever White House Student Film Festival. And I know we're running a little bit late. It's not because the projector was not working. It was because of me. But I appreciate all of you guys being here and your patience. <p>The Academy Awards are not until Sunday, but as you can see, we've brought the Oscars to the White House a little bit early. And I want to thank our partners: FOX, National Geographic, and the American Film Institute. We've got the red carpet, we've got the big screens, the opening monologue. The only difference is nobody asks what you're wearing. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And we've got Bill Nye the Science Guy and Neil deGrasse Tyson from the Hayden Planetarium, who might even give you a sneak peak of his new show, \\"Cosmos,\\" if everybody behaves themselves. And I saw the original version&mdash;I'm a little older than all of you&mdash;and it was spectacular and wonderful, and I know this is going to be not just as good, but even better. And so we're thrilled with that. And we're putting on a big show here because we're honoring some remarkable filmmakers. <p>I've said before, I believe, and I hope all of us believe, that every child in America deserves a world-class education, especially in science and technology and engineering and math, because it's skills like these that made us an economic superpower and built our middle class. We also need folks who are studying the arts because our film industry is a huge generator of jobs and economic power here in the United States, and it tells us our story and helps us to find what's&mdash;our common humanity. <p>And it's skills like these that allowed NASA to announce the other day that we've discovered more than 700 new planets. [<i>Applause</i>] That's cool. I mean, we didn't make the planets, but we&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;we found out that they were there. And one of the ways that we deliver the best education in the world is by empowering our students with the best technology in the world. <p>To help inspire us, we invited students from across the country to send their videos about how their schools use technology today, how they might use it in the future. So kids got to&mdash;got their cameras out and went to work. And we received about 2,500 videos&mdash;2,500. And we watched them all. I did not personally watch them all, but the White House watched them all. <p>And today the Oscar goes to all of you. Because among all the incredible videos we received, yours stood out. And in my official capacity as President, let me just say, these movies are awesome. Like all great movies, yours do something special: They tell a story. They help us understand, in this case, the amazing things that are going on in classrooms and how technology is empowering our students and broadening their imaginations and challenging them to dream bigger and reach further. <p>Now, here is the spoiler alert: There is some wonderful stuff going on out there. So even before you have seen some of these films, you need to know that what these filmmakers have displayed is the incredible innovation and creativity of this generation coming up. <p>You've got Gabrielle Nafie and Miles Pilchik from Science Tech Kids in New York. [<i>Applause</i>] Hey! They showed us that their class isn't just dreaming about going into space, they're actually going into space. They designed density experiments and used a 3-D printer to build tiny satellites to hold them. And then they actually launched a giant balloon that carried their satellites up to the edge of space&mdash;very cool&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Gabrielle Nafie.</i> Thank you. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i>&mdash;&mdash;so they could collect the data. When I was in elementary school, I was not launching satellites into space. <p>You've got Alex Emerson, who showed how his sixth&mdash;his eighth-grade class at Brookwood School in Massachusetts changed the definition of pen pals by video chatting with students in Uganda. And one of the things they did was collaborate on cook stoves that help families in rural areas cook safer and with cleaner energy. <p>And it doesn't stop with what's possible today. These videos show how students are imagining the future: classrooms that are fully accessible to classmates with disabilities, individualized learning platforms that you can carry around in your pocket. And that's the kind of creativity and imagination we want all of our young people to embrace. <p>We cannot wait to see more of that innovative spirit later this year when we host our first-ever White House Maker Fair. We've already&mdash;we already have a White House Science Fair. This new event is going to highlight how Americans young and old&mdash;tinkerers and inventors&mdash;-are imagining and designing and building tools and machines that will open our minds and power our economy. <p>We want to bring this spirit&mdash;including more technology&mdash;into the classroom. And that's why I launched something we're calling ConnectED, our initiative to close the technology gap in our schools and connect 99 percent of America's students to high-speed broadband Internet within 5 years. Because when the average American school has about the same Internet bandwidth as the average American home, but serves 200 times as many people, that means our students are at a disadvantage. And when less than 30 percent of our students have access to true high-speed Internet in their classroom, while in South Korea students have a hundred percent, that's like waving the white flag when it comes to our global competition. But here's what I think: In a country where we expect free Wi-Fi at our coffee shops, then we should demand it in our schools and in our libraries. <p>So this is not something we can do alone. And as a consequence, I picked up the phone and started asking business leaders to help bring our schools and libraries into the 21st century. They did not just answer the call, they came up huge. So earlier this month, some of our biggest technology companies committed to more than $750 million in computers and software and broadband access to put our kids and classrooms on the cutting edge of technology. <p>Today I'm proud to announce that more companies are getting on board. Prezi will provide over a hundred million dollars in presentation products to help students develop ready-to-work skills in slideshows and creative communication. So give them a big round of applause. We're very proud of them for that. <p>And Adobe will make available, for free, more than $300 million in creating&mdash;creative and teaching software so that kids can turn their ideas into films and graphics, and teachers can deliver lessons electronically. So give Adobe a big round of applause. [<i>Applause</i>] Proud of them. Thank you. <p>If you're quick at math, which I know you are, then you'll see that this means we've delivered over $1 billion in technology commitments to our schools, which isn't too shabby for 1 month. But there's still more to do, and we need even more companies to get on board. Because, thanks to innovative schools and teachers and students like all of you, we know what school might look like in the century ahead: classrooms wired to space, and students who are fluent in coding and web design, teachers collaborating on projects with peers around the world. We've always imagined giving every child the chance to learn like that. And with these private sector partners, we're helping to make it a reality. <p>So let me leave you with a wonderful example of the difference that technology can make. Kyle Weintraub is a seventh grader at David Posnak Jewish Day School in Florida. And last year, he was diagnosed with lymphoma, had to move to Pennsylvania for treatment. In the past, that meant Kyle would have had to leave his school and his friends behind. But every day, Kyle puts on his school uniform, and without even leaving his room in Pennsylvania, he goes to school in Florida because he has a special robot with a high-tech video feed that goes to class for him. And even as he's getting medical treatment and fights to get better, Kyle can keep up with his studies, controlling his robot from his computer at home. And through a video feed, Kyle can see his classmates; they can see him. So the robot doesn't just have a name, they just say, \\"Hey, Kyle.\\" <p>And he can look around the classroom, move down the hallways, even sit with his friends at lunch. And I know the teachers think this is just extraordinary as well, because if there's one thing you don't want to do, is start a food fight with a robot. [<i>Laughter</i>] So everybody kind of seems to be better behaved when Kyle's robot is around. Kyle is here today. He did not bring his robot, but everybody give Kyle a big round of applause. <p>Kyle's story is just one example of what's possible when we put our extraordinary technologies to work for our students and our schools. And that's what this film festival is about. So to all the young filmmakers out there, remember, you are much better at this than all that adults. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's your imagination and your creativity and your innovation and your dreams that are going to help this country move forward. <p>Keep up the great work. We could not be prouder of you. Your parents are proud of you, I know that, but I am too. And America is counting on you. <p>So with that, let's start the show. All right? Thank you, guys.\" "
"44" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Democrats! Are you fired up? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Ready to go! <p><i>The President.</i> You'd better be ready to go. All right, everybody have a seat. Have a seat. Take a load off. [<i>Laughter</i>] Oh, I've got to&mdash;I see a lot of friends here. It is good to see all of you. <p>Let me begin by thanking Debbie Wasserman Schultz for being the outstanding leader that she is, not just for the people of Florida, but being an outstanding leader for this party. We're very proud of her. Our CEO, Amy Dacey, is here doing a terrific job already. Hit the ground running. I want to thank all the Governors and mayors and legislators and State party leaders and DNC members in the house and to all the DNC officers who are up here with me today. And all of them are just great friends and such incredible leaders who are moving the needle on behalf of justice, equity, and economic growth every single day. So we're really proud of them. And thank you to the millions of Americans in all 50 States who help our party thrive at the grassroots&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Q. </i>Puerto Rico! <p><i>The President. </i>&mdash;&mdash;and Puerto Rico&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;every single day. Thank you. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Well, it's Friday. It's after 5 o'clock. So this is now officially happy hour with the Democratic Party. I can do that. It is an executive action. I have the authority. [<i>Laughter</i>] Henry is picking up the tab. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Democrats, for more than 200 years, our country, our success, our progress, our people&mdash;all of it has been grounded, it's been based, rooted in a basic promise: the promise of opportunity for all. It means that here in America, what matters isn't what we look like, what our last name is, who we love, how we started out. What matters is the strength of our work ethic, the scope of our dreams, our willingness to take responsibility not only for ourselves and our families and our immediate community, but for all people; that we take responsibility for each other. That's what makes America the place that it is, a place where you can make it if you try. That's what makes it a beacon for people from all around the world. <p>It's what this country was built on. And it is the idea that this party is built on. And that's why, with your help, I ran for President, so we could keep that promise alive for this generation and for generations to come. And together, we have made progress. <p>Today, after the worst crisis of our lifetimes, our businesses have created half&mdash;8&frac12; million new jobs over the past 4 years. A housing market that was reeling is now rebounding. An auto industry that was flatlining is now booming. A manufacturing sector that lost one-third of its jobs in the previous decade is now adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s. Troops that were fighting two wars are coming home. Rather than create jobs in other countries, more companies are choosing to create jobs and invest right here in the United States of America. We're producing more energy than ever before, and we are reducing the climate pollution that threatens the future of our children and our grandchildren. <p>So we've made progress, and that's why I believe this can be a breakthrough year for America. After 5 years of grit and determined effort, no other country is better positioned for the 21st century. And that's not just my opinion. If you talk to big investors, you talk to CEOs, you talk to the leaders of other countries, and they look at us, and they say, you have so much going for you. <p>But we all know we've still got more to do. We've got work to do. Because the trends that have battered the middle class for decades have not been reversed; in some cases, they've grown starker. After 4&frac12; years of economic growth, corporate profits and stock prices have rarely been higher. Those at the top have never done better. But average wages have barely budged. Too many middle class families are working harder than ever, but they're treading water. And too many families can't seem to work their way into the middle class at all. The ladders of opportunity are now eroding. <p>And our job is to reverse those trends. Our job is to rebuild an economy that grows for the many, not just the few: an economy where working Americans feel secure in their jobs and their homes and their finances. Our job, not just as Democrats, but as Americans, is to restore opportunity for all. That's why we're in this. Those are our values. <p>And obviously, this is an election year. But an election that's 8 months away shouldn't stop us from making progress right now. There are things we can be doing right now to help the American people, and we shouldn't be doing nothing because there's an election coming up. <p>I've said I want to work with Congress wherever I can, and there are places where the parties can work together to get things done. But I've also said and shown that in this year of action, wherever I can act on my own to expand opportunity for more Americans, I will. That's what I owe the American people. That's what we all owe the American people. <p>Now, me saying that, that I'm going to go ahead and do things to help middle class families, has gotten Republicans in Congress all stirred up, as if they'd prefer to do nothing. But we're going to keep moving forward on the agenda the American people elected us to move forward on. <p>And the fact is, we've got a fundamental disagreement with the other side. And that's okay; this is a democracy, that's how it works. But we have a fundamental disagreement about what we need to do now to secure our future. And don't get me wrong, I consider&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> Mr. Obama! <p><i>The President. </i>&mdash;&mdash;I consider Republicans patriots who love this country just as much as we do. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Tell us about your plans for nuclear war with Russia! <p><i>The President.</i> I'm sorry, who's that back there? [<i>Laughter</i>] What the heck are you talking about? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience members.</i> Obama! Obama! Obama! <p><i>The President.</i> No, no, don't worry about it. [<i>Laughter</i>] We're okay. We're&mdash;have a seat. I don't know anything about that plan. [<i>Laughter</i>] I don't know what you've been reading. [<i>Laughter</i>] Let me return to what I was talking about. See, he thought happy hour started earlier. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, don't get me wrong, I think the Republicans are patriots; they love this country just like we do. They love their kids, they love their communities, but they just keep on offering a theory of the economy that, time and again, has failed America. They think we should give more tax breaks to those at the top and invest less in things like education and research. I'm not making that up. Go on their website. That's what they think. They think we should let big banks and credit card companies and insurers do only what's best for their bottom line without responsibility to their customers or their communities. <p>Despite what we saw in 2007, 2008, and the consequences of that crisis, they think we should drastically reduce or eliminate the safety net for more people. We're seeing that right now played out in the debate about unemployment insurance. They'll even shut down the Government or threaten the full faith and credit of our country when they don't get their way. And if we do all these things, they are convinced that the economy will thrive and jobs and prosperity will trickle down to everybody. That's what they believe. And they have a right to hold those beliefs. <p>But the American people know better, because what they're offering is not a new theory. It's a theory they presented in the runup to the Great Depression. It's a theory they expounded in the runup to the crisis in 2008. It's a theory they just repeated in the election in 2012. And the American people said, no thanks, we don't have confidence in that theory. And just because this theory has a history doesn't mean it should have a future. It's time to retire this theory. It doesn't work. [<i>Applause</i>] Doesn't work. <p>And that's why the outcome of this election is so important. It won't just set the direction of this country for the next 2 years, it will set the direction for this country for years to come. And the choice could not be clearer: opportunity for a few or opportunity for all. That's what this election is about. <p>As Democrats, we have a different idea of what the future looks like, an idea rooted in our conviction that our economy grows best not from the top down, but from the middle out. That's what an opportunity agenda offers. Opportunity for all begins with access to a good job. Next week, I will send Congress a budget that will create new jobs in manufacturing and energy and innovation and infrastructure. And we'll pay for every dime of it by cutting unnecessary spending, closing wasteful tax loopholes. <p>Now, Republicans have a different view. Just last month, R.T., their party actually made it a part of their platform to let folks at the very top play by a different set of rules and avoid paying their fair share by stashing their money in overseas tax havens, a practice that also adds billions of dollars to our deficits every year. <p>As Democrats, we believe that instead of more tax breaks for the few, we should make investments that grow the economy for everyone. That's what we believe. <p>Opportunity for all means guaranteeing every young person access to a world-class education. Four years ago&mdash;I'll just give you an example&mdash;4 years ago, we took on a student loan system that gave billions of taxpayer dollars to big banks as part of the student loan system, even as there were young people out there who weren't getting the help they needed to go to school. So we used the savings to help more students afford college. Today, more young people are earning college degrees than ever before. <p>You would think Republicans would say, you know what, that's a good idea. Good for you, Mr. President. [<i>Laughter</i>] But no: The Republicans still want to return that money to the banks. <p>As Democrats, we're fighting to make sure that more Americans can afford higher education, whether it's technical training, community colleges, a 4-year university. That's what we believe. That's what we're fighting for. <p>Opportunity for all means building an economy that rewards hard work for every American, not only with a paycheck that supports a family, but with equal pay for equal work and health care when we get sick and secure retirements even if we're not rich and the chance to hand down some hope and optimism to our kids. <p>At a time when women make up half of our workforce, it's an outrage that women can still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. This isn't 1954, it's 2014. A woman deserves equal pay for equal work. She deserves to have a baby without sacrificing her job. A mother deserves to take a day off to care for a sick kid or a sick parent without running into hardship, and a father does too. And every woman deserves to control her own health care choices&mdash;not her boss, not her insurer, not anybody in Congress. <p>I don't know why we're still arguing about this. [<i>Laughter</i>] I saw that some Republicans in Congress brought in outside aides to teach them how to talk to women. [<i>Laughter</i>] It is unclear how they've gotten this far without that particular skill. [<i>Laughter</i>] But talking the talk ain't walking the walk. The problem isn't how they talk about their policies, the problem is their policies. They have to decide which side they're on, what they believe in. Because we know what side we're on. As Democrats, we believe that when women succeed, America succeeds. That's what we think. <p>As Americans, we believe that no one should work full time and have to raise their family in poverty. In the year since I first asked Congress to raise the minimum wage, six States have passed laws to raise theirs, and more are working to join them. And more businesses are choosing to do it too. Last week, the Gap made a smart business decision to raise wages that will benefit about 65,000 workers in the United States. They think it's a good business practice. <p>I took action to lift more workers' wages by requiring Federal contractors to pay their employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour. Because if you're cooking our troops' meals or washing their dishes, this country should pay you a wage you can live on. <p>So it's time to raise a minimum wage that is worth less than it was when Ronald Reagan was in office. And the American people are way ahead of Congress on this. A majority of Americans support raising the minimum wage. But Republicans in Congress, surprisingly enough, oppose raising the minimum wage. Some of them want to scrap it entirely. A House Republican said the other day: \\"I think it has outlived its usefulness. I would vote to repeal the minimum wage.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] You had a Senate Republican said it has never worked. And when the Republican leader in the Senate was asked if they should hold a vote at all, he said, \\"I would hope not.\\" Think about that. <p>Tell that to the millions of folks out there who are working so hard every day, and at the end of the month, they just can't stretch that paycheck to pay all their bills. Tell that to the women who are most likely to hold lower wage jobs. Tell that to the average minimum wage worker who's 35 years old. When I signed that Executive order to make sure that Federal contractors paid a minimum wage, we had a group of those workers who were going to be impacted. And these weren't teenagers, these were folks with families doing hard work, hard jobs that are necessary and that we benefit from. And higher wages are good for them, and they're good for their families, and they're good for our economy. <p>And it gives businesses more customers with more money to spend, and the economy grows for everybody. And those employers, because they've got more customers and are making more profits, now decide to hire more workers. It is a virtuous cycle that we can create. It is time to give America a raise or elect more Democrats who will do it. <p>Of course, for years now, rather than focusing on creating jobs or raising wages or helping more young people afford college, Republicans in Congress have been obsessed with one thing above all else. No, not Ted Nugent. [<i>Laughter</i>] They have been obsessed with repealing the Affordable Care Act. You know what they say: \\"Fiftieth time is the charm. [<i>Laughter</i>] Maybe when you hit your 50th repeal vote, you will win a prize. Maybe if you buy 50 repeal votes, you get 1 free. [<i>Laughter</i>] We get it. We understand. We get you don't like it. I got it. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>For 5 years, Republicans in Congress have been talking about offering a serious plan of their own, their alternative. You can go back and look at every year&mdash;2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013&mdash;every year: \\"Our alternative plan is right around the corner.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"We're just about to put it on the floor.\\" \\"We're going to have a vote.\\" \\"We're still in the drafting process.\\" Every year. I'm sure it's coming any day now. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>The reason they don't do it, of course, is that we already took the best ideas that are out there about bringing down costs and covering more people. Yes, there have been some disruptions. Yes, we lost that first month out of the gate. And we've worked hard to fix problems that have come up without any cooperation from them; in fact, they've complained when we fix them. They say, how dare you fix the things we were complaining about? [<i>Laughter</i>] Have you noticed that? They'll complain about something, and then we take steps to fix it: \\"You're a tyrant.\\" \\"You're overreaching.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] You're laughing, but it's true. I'm not making this stuff up. <p>But millions of Americans are more secure and will be more secure because of what we did. Millions of Americans. Because as Democrats, we believe that no hard-working American should ever go broke just because they get sick. And this week, we topped 4 million Americans who have signed up for new private insurance plans, which is on top of the 3 million young people who have gotten coverage by staying on their parent's plan and the millions of Americans who have gotten coverage through Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Plan and the millions of seniors who have gotten discounts on their prescription drugs. <p>And thanks to the Affordable Care Act, no American&mdash;not one, zero&mdash;can ever again be dropped or denied coverage just because of a preexisting condition like asthma or cancer. And no woman can ever again be charged more for just being a woman. <p>I wish sometimes you could see the letters that we get from folks who write to me. Small-business people who say, I didn't vote for you, I don't really like you, but I'm saving money. Folks who say, I did not have insurance and found out I had a potentially fatal disease, and because of the Affordable Care Act, I can write you here today. That's not something to repeal. That's something to celebrate. That's something to build on. <p>I've said before, you want to work on us&mdash;on ways that we can make this better, I'm happy to listen. But Republicans can flirt with taking away these protections and the peace of mind that millions of Americans are now getting. If they want, they can vote to have seniors pay more for their medicine again. If they want to stand up and assert that they're going to let women get charged more again and tell more parents that you're on your own again, that's their prerogative. <p>But as Democrats, we're going to keep working to make this law work even better, and we're going to keep working, family by family and block by block and neighborhood by neighborhood, on campuses and in churches, to get more Americans covered with the economic security and peace of mind that quality, affordable health insurance provides. We will not apologize for it. It's the right thing to do. <p>So the bottom line is, the Republican Party can keep telling the country what they're against: They're against the Affordable Care Act. They're against the minimum wage. They're against equal pay laws. They're against commonsense immigration reform. They're against the very existence of climate change. [<i>Laughter</i>] But, Democrats, we're going to keep telling America what we're for, from giving America a raise to getting America covered. Because the people we serve are not interested in leaders who are rooting for failure, and they're not interested in leaders who are only interested in refighting the old ideological battles. They want us focused on their lives and their hopes and their aspirations and their kids. <p>And the last thing they can afford is a Congress that gives free rein back to mortgage companies and credit card companies and insurers and big banks that we're finally holding accountable. The ability to make your own choices rather than have powerful interests make them for you is too important to our future to be undone by politicians who are stuck in the past. In some States, they're so far in the past they're even pushing laws to legalize segregation based on sexual orientation.<B> <p></B>As Democrats, we've let the other side define the word \\"freedom\\" for too long. Let me tell you something. Freedom doesn't mean the ability to ask, \\"What's in it for me?\\" Freedom is not: \\"I've got no obligations to anybody. I've got no responsibility for anybody.\\" It's not freedom when powerful interests can use the fine print to trick you into buying a home you can't afford or hit you with hidden fees or rate hikes or drop your health insurance without warning. That's not freedom. <p>Freedom is the peace of mind of knowing that if you got sick, you won't lose everything. Freedom is the ability to change jobs and start a new business, chase a new idea without fear of losing your health insurance. Freedom is signing for that new home and knowing it can't be taken from you because you actually understand what you're signing. Freedom is getting that new credit card and knowing the stakes and understanding how you're going to manage it; enrolling in college and knowing what you'll owe once you graduate. <p>Freedom is the knowledge that your future in this country is secure: You're not going to be treated like a second-class person once we fix our broken immigration system. That's freedom. Freedom is the ability to go into a store or a restaurant without the fear that you'd be refused service because of who you are or who you love. <p>So we're not ceding that word. Freedom for the most powerful interests to do whatever they want&mdash;that's, I suppose, one form of freedom. But freedom for ordinary Americans to honestly pursue their dreams, that's what we believe. That's the choice we face right now: opportunity for a few or opportunity for all. <p>And Republicans in Congress have already given America a measuring stick. The top Republican in the House said America should judge them not on how many laws they pass&mdash;which isn't a lot&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but on how many they repeal. That's what they said. And the top Republican in the Senate said his top priority wasn't to create jobs or expand opportunity, but to beat me. <p>So let's look at the scorecard. They're 0 for 2. [<i>Applause</i>] They're 0 for 2. This November, let's make them 0 for 3. What do you think, Donna? Let's make them 0 for 3. <p>That's where all of you come in. That's where the DNC can make a difference. Because when Democrats have everybody on the field, we cannot lose. That's just a fact. That's just the raw numbers. When Democrats vote, we win. There are more folks who believe in what we stand for than believe in what they stand for. <p>And the other side knows that. And their models are constructed based on the idea that Americans will sit out this election. Because they look at the past, and in the past, it's true. A lot of Democrats don't vote during midterms. We just don't. Young people, African Americans, Latinos&mdash;we just, oftentimes, don't vote during midterms. And the Republicans say this. One top Republican&mdash;one Republican in one State assembly said: \\"A lot of minorities and a lot of younger people will not turn out in a non-Presidential year. It's a great year for Republicans!\\" That's a quote. It's a great year for Republicans: A whole bunch of people aren't voting. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Everybody laughs when I say these things. This is what they say. Look it up. Which explains why some in their party are always trying to make it harder for people to vote. And that's a big difference between our parties. We believe that more voices don't make America weaker; more voices make us stronger, it makes us better. We're greater together. <p>And that's why the DNC isn't just protecting the right to vote, you're registering more people to vote. You're expanding the electorate, not constricting it. You're building on the data and technology infrastructure we've built over a decade. You're pushing back on the lies and misinformation from those who can't win on the truth. And you're supporting our State parties and building our grassroots, because we are Democrats, and we believe that change comes not from the top down, but from the bottom up. <p>We're the party of Tom Jefferson, who declared that all men are created equal. We're the party of Franklin Roosevelt, who believed in basic measures of security and dignity for every American and who saved freedom and democracy from being extinguished here on Earth. <p>We're the party of John F. Kennedy, who summoned us to serve and who believed that a rising tide should lift all boats and who proved that we lead the world not only through the force of our arms, but the enduring strength of our values. <p>And we're the party of Bill Clinton, a party that has proved that with smart choices we can grow our economy and shrink our deficits and invest in our people, a party that believes in opportunity for all and responsibility from all. That's who we are as Democrats. <p>And if we stay focused on what we believe, and if we speak to America's hopes over their fears, if we inspire them rather than divide them and respond to their challenges with the same urgency they feel in their own lives, we won't just win in November, we'll win for America and for our future. <p>Thank you very much, DNC. I love you. God bless. God bless America.\" "
"45" "\"Hi, everybody. In my State of the Union Address, I said that the best measure of opportunity is access to a good job. And after the worst recession of our lifetimes, our businesses have created 8&frac12; million new jobs in the last 4 years. <p>But we need to do more to make America a magnet for good jobs for the future. And in this year of action, where Congress won't do that, I will do whatever I can to expand opportunity for more Americans. This week, I took two actions to attract new jobs to America: jobs in American manufacturing and jobs rebuilding America's infrastructure. <p>Here's why this is important. In the 2000s alone, we lost more than one-third of all American manufacturing jobs. One in three. And when the housing bubble burst, workers in the construction industry were hit harder than just about anybody. The good news is, today, our manufacturers have added more than 620,000 jobs over the last 4 years; that's the first sustained growth in manufacturing jobs since the 1990s. <p>Still, the economy has changed. And if we want to attract more good manufacturing jobs to America, we've got to make sure we're on the cutting edge of new manufacturing technologies and techniques. And in today's global economy, first-class jobs gravitate to first-class infrastructure. <p>That's why, on Tuesday, I launched two new high-tech manufacturing hubs, places where businesses and universities will partner to turn groundbreaking research into real-world goods made in America. So far, we've launched four of these hubs, where our workers can master 3-D printing, energy-efficient electronics, lightweight metals, and digital manufacturing, all technologies that can help ensure a steady stream of good jobs well into the 21st century. <p>Then, on Wednesday I launched a new competition to build 21st-century infrastructure: roads and bridges, mass transit, more efficient ports, and faster passenger rail. Rebuilding America won't just attract new businesses, it will create good construction jobs that can't be shipped overseas. <p>Of course, Congress could make an even bigger difference in both areas. Thanks to the leadership of a bipartisan group of lawmakers, there's a bill in Congress right now that would create an entire network of high-tech manufacturing hubs all across the country. And next week, I'll send Congress a budget that will rebuild our transportation systems and support millions of jobs nationwide. <p>There's a lot we can do if we work together. And while Congress decides what it's going to do, I'm going to keep doing everything in my power to rebuild an economy where everyone who works hard has the chance to get ahead and where we're restoring our founding vision of opportunity for all. <p>Thanks, everybody, and have a great weekend.\" "
"46" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Connecticut! Go Blue Devils! [<i>Laughter</i>] It is good to be back in Connecticut. I want to thank your wonderful Governor, Dan Malloy, for that introduction. I want to thank your president, Jack Miller, for inviting me here today. <p>We've got members of your student government behind me. You know, the&mdash;I couldn't help but notice your Student Government Association logo, which has a gavel and a pitchfork, which is pretty intense. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I wish some folks in Congress used the gavel more. [<i>Laughter</i>] Less pitchfork. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We also have some members of your nonstudent government. One of our finest members of our Cabinet, who just cares so much about working families and is working tirelessly every single day, Secretary of Labor Tom Perez is here. We've got all five of Connecticut's Representatives in Congress, including CCSU alum John Larson, in the house. Another proud CCSU alum, Erin Stewart, your mayor, is here, along with Mayor Segarra and the other mayors and legislators from all across Connecticut. <p>And today we're doing something a little different than usual. Usually, when I hit the road and talk with folks like all of you, I've got a Governor with me. But you are special. So we decided one Governor wasn't enough. [<i>Laughter</i>] So in addition to Governor Malloy, we've got Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, Peter Shumlin of Vermont. This is like a Governor supergroup. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's like the Justice League of Governors. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'd call them the New England Patriots, but that name is already taken. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience members. </i>We love you, Mr. President! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back! I love you. Now&mdash;but we can't just spend the whole day talking about how we love each other. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's not why I came. We are here today because each of us cares deeply about creating new jobs and new opportunities for all Americans. And we're at this interesting moment in our economy. Our economy has been growing. Our businesses have created 8&frac12; million new jobs over the past 4 years. The unemployment rate is the lowest it's been in over 5 years. Those are all things that we should be proud of. <p>But there are some trends out there that have been battering the middle class for a long, long time, well before this great recession hit. And in some ways, some of those trends have gotten worse, not better. The nature of today's economy with technology and globalization means that there are folks at the top who are doing better than ever, but average wages have barely budged. Average incomes have not gone up. Too many Americans are working harder than ever just to keep up. <p>So as I said at my State of the Union Address, we've got to reverse those trends. It is a central task for all of us to build an economy that works for everybody, not just for some. That's what every one of these Governors and Tom Perez believes in. That's what we got into public service for. I hope Dan and Peter don't mind me sharing this: While we were driving over here, they were talking about the fact that when they were growing up, both of them had dyslexia. And because of this&mdash;the incredible, fierce love of their parents, but also because there were some folks there to help them, they achieved these&mdash;made these extraordinary achievements. Now, I wasn't in the car with Deval, but Deval is a close friend of mine. He's got a similar story, grew up on the South Side of Chicago&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member</i>. Whoo! <p><i>The President.</i> South Side! [<i>Laughter</i>] And came from a very modest background. But somebody gave him a chance. Me, Tom Perez, so many of us understand that at the heart of America, the central premise of this country is the chance to achieve your dreams if you work hard, if you take responsibility; that it doesn't matter where you start, it's where you finish. <p>And in America, we believe in opportunity for all. We believe that our success shouldn't be determined by the circumstances of our birth. It's determined by each of us. But also by a society that's committed to everybody succeeding. So that it doesn't matter what you look like, where you come from, what your last name is, who you love, what matters is the strength of your work ethic and the power of your dreams and your willingness to take responsibility for yourself, but also for the larger society. That's what makes America the place that it is, why it continues to be a beacon, attracting people from all around the world, the idea that you can make it here if you try. <p>Now, there's been a lot of news about foreign affairs around the world over the last several days, but also for the last couple years. And one of the things that you see, a trend you see&mdash;it doesn't matter whether it's in Central Europe or in the Middle East or Africa&mdash;individuals want a chance to make it if they try. And what makes us special is, we already do that when we're at our best. But we've got some work to do to match up our ideals with the reality that's happening on the ground right now. <p>And the opportunity agenda that I've laid out is designed to help us restore that idea of opportunity for everybody for this generation: the generation of young people who are studying here and are about to enter the workforce. And it's got four parts. Part one is something that I know the seniors here are very interested in, which is more good jobs that pay good wages. <p>We can't be satisfied with just recovering the jobs that were lost during the recession. We've got to rebuild our economy so it's creating a steady supply of good jobs today and well into the future, jobs in high-tech manufacturing and in energy and in exports and in American innovation. So that's job number one. <p>Job number two is training more Americans with the skills they need to fill those good jobs so that our workforce is prepared for the jobs of tomorrow. Part three: guaranteeing every young person in this country access to a world-class education, from pre-K all the way to a college education like the one you're getting here. <p>And that's why over the past 5 years, working with the outstanding congressional delegation from Connecticut, we've been able to make sure that grant dollars are going farther than before. We took on a student loan system that gave billions of taxpayer dollars to the big banks, and we said let's use those to give more students directly the help they need to afford to go to college. <p>That's why we're offering millions of young people the chance to cap their monthly student loan payments at 10 percent of their income. So you need to check that out. Go to the website of the Department of Education and find out how you may be eligible for that. <p>And today, more young people are earning college degrees than ever before. Of course&mdash;and I know your president won't disagree with this&mdash;we've also got to do more to rein in the soaring costs of college and help more Americans who are trapped by student loan debt. The bottom line, though, is whether it's technical training, community college, 4-year university, no young person should be priced out of a higher education. [<i>Applause</i>] Shouldn't happen. <p>Now, there is a fourth part of this agenda. By the way, I just noticed, if you've got chairs, feel free to sit down. [<i>Laughter</i>] I know the folks here don't have chairs, but I don't want you&mdash;and if you're standing up, make sure to bend your knees so you don't faint, you know. [<i>Laughter</i>] All right, I just wanted to check on you. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, point number four, the fourth component of this opportunity agenda, is making sure that if you are working hard, then you get ahead. And that means making sure women receive equal pay for equal work. When women succeed, America succeeds. I believe that. You happy with that, Rosa? Rosa agrees with that. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>It means making sure that you can save and retire with dignity. It means health insurance that's there when you're sick and you need it most. And you guys are doing a great job implementing the Affordable Care Act here in Connecticut. If any of you know a young person who is uninsured, help them get covered at healthcare.gov. The website works just fine now. [<i>Laughter</i>] They've got until March 31 to sign up, and in some cases, it's going to cost less than your cell phone bill. So check it out, healthcare.gov. <p>And making work pay means wages and paychecks that let you support a family. [<i>Applause</i>] A wage, a paycheck that lets you support a family. <p>Now, I want to be clear about this because sometimes in our debates with our friends on the other side of the political spectrum, this may not be clear, so let me just repeat it once again. As Americans, we understand that some folks are going to earn more than others. We don't resent success, we are thrilled with the opportunities that America affords. Somebody goes out there, starts a business, invents a new product, provides a new service, that's what drives our economy. That's why this free market economy is the most dynamic on Earth. We're thrilled with that. Everybody agrees on that. But what we also believe is that nobody who works full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty. That violates a basic sense of who we are. And that's why it's time to give America a raise. It is time to give America a raise. [<i>Applause</i>] Now is the time. Now is the time. <p>A year ago I asked Congress to raise the minimum wage, the Federal minimum wage. Since that time, six States have passed laws to raise theirs, including right here in Connecticut. On January 1, tens of thousands of folks across this State got a raise, and Governor Malloy is working to lift their wages even higher. Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Washington State, other States, counties, cities across the country are working to raise their minimum wage as we speak. <p>The Governors here today&mdash;Governor Chafee of Rhode Island, Governor Malloy, Governor Patrick of Massachusetts, Governor Shumlin of Vermont&mdash;and a Governor who couldn't be here today, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire&mdash;all are fighting to give hard-working folks in these great New England States a raise of their own. And they've formed a regional coalition to raise the minimum wage. If they succeed in their efforts, New England will have some of the highest minimum wages in the country. <p>And they're not stopping there. These four Governors are here to&mdash;in support of raising America's minimum wage, the Federal minimum wage, to $10.10 an hour&mdash;$10.10 an hour. <p>Now, raising wages is not just a job for elected officials. In my State of the Union Address, I asked more business leaders to do what they can to raise their workers' wages, because profitable companies like Costco have long seen higher wages as good business. It's a smart way to boost productivity, to reduce turnover, to instill loyalty in your employees. And by the way, they do great. Their stocks do great. They are highly profitable. It's not bad business to do right by your workers, it's good business. [<i>Applause</i>] It's good business. <p>Two weeks ago, the Gap decided to raise its base wages, and that's going to boost wages for 65,000 workers in the United States. Last week, I read about Jaxson's; it's an ice cream parlor in Florida that's been in business since 1956. They just announced they would lift workers' wages to at least $10.10 an hour, without cutting back on hiring. Two weeks ago, an Atlanta small-business owner named Darien Southerland wrote me to share a lesson his granny taught him: If you treat your employees right, they'll treat you right. Vice President Biden paid Darien's business a visit just yesterday. You got to listen to your grandmother. [<i>Laughter</i>] That is some wise advice. <p>And I agree with these business leaders as well. So what I did as President, I issued an Executive order requiring Federal contractors: If you're doing business with the Federal Government, pay your employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour, which will be good for America's bottom line. <p>And let me tell you who was affected. I did&mdash;when I was signing the bill&mdash;or the Executive order, we had some of the workers who were going to be affected. You've got folks who are cooking the meals of our troops or washing their dishes or cleaning their clothes. This country should pay those folks a wage you can live on. <p>So this is good for business, it is good for America. Because even though we're bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States, creating more good jobs in education and health care and business services, there will always be airport workers, there are always going to be fast-food workers, there are always going to be hospital workers, there are going to be retail salespeople, hospitality workers, people who work their tails off every day. People working in nursing homes, looking after your grandparents or your parents. Folks who are doing all the hard jobs that make our society work every single day. They don't have anything flashy out there. And you know what, they're not expecting to get rich, but they do feel like, if they're putting in back-breaking work every day, then at least at the end of the month, they can pay their bills. <p><i>Audience member</i>. I know that's right! <p><i>The President.</i> They deserve an honest day's pay for an honest day's work. <p>Working Americans have struggled through stagnant wages for too long, so my goal is&mdash;and the goal of everybody on this stage&mdash;is to help lift wages, help lift take-home pay in any way we can. And that's why I've done everything I can to lift wages for hard-working Federal contractors. It's why I've asked business owners to raise their wages. It's why I'm supporting elected officials at the local level, Governors. What every American wants is a paycheck that lets them support their families, know a little economic security, pass down some hope and optimism to their kids. And that's worth fighting for. So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>But I want to make one last point. If we're going to finish the job, Congress has to get on board. [<i>Applause</i>] Congress has to get on board. And this is interesting. This should not be that hard, you'd think. [<i>Laughter</i>] Because nearly three in four Americans, about half of all Republicans, support raising the minimum wage. The problem is, Republicans in Congress oppose raising the minimum wage. Now, I don't know if that's just because I proposed it. [<i>Laughter</i>] Maybe I should say I oppose raising the minimum wage and they'd be for it. That's possible. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But right now there's a bill in front of both the House and the Senate that would boost America's minimum wage to $10.10. Ten&mdash;it's easy to remember: 10-10. Ten dollars, ten cents an hour. Just passing this bill would help not only minimum wage workers; it would lift wages for about 200,000 people just right here in Connecticut. It would lift wages for about 1 million New Englanders. It would lift wages for nearly 28 million Americans across this country. It would immediately raise millions of people out of poverty. It would help millions more work their way out of poverty, and it doesn't require new taxes, doesn't require new spending, doesn't require some new bureaucracy. And here's one last point: It turns out, what happens if workers got a little more money in their pockets? <p><i>Audience members.</i> They spend it! <p><i>The President.</i> They spend a little more money, which means that suddenly, businesses have more customers, which means they make more profits, which means they can hire more workers, which means you get a virtuous cycle&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> It's common sense! <p><i>The President.</i> It's common sense. That's what I'm trying to say. That's all I'm trying to say. [<i>Laughter</i>] Common sense, exactly. That's all. It's just common sense. That's all it is. It's common sense. [<i>Applause</i>]<i> </i>Common sense. It's just common sense. That's all I'm saying. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, right now Republicans in Congress don't want to vote on raising the minimum wage. Some have actually said they just want to scrap the minimum wage. They&mdash;one of them said, \\"I think it's outlived its usefulness. . . . I'd vote to repeal the minimum wage.\\" One of them said it's \\"never worked.\\" Now&mdash;some even said it only helps young people. Now&mdash;as if that's a bad thing; I think we should want to help young people. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'd like to see them try putting themselves through college on a low-wage work-study job. But actually&mdash;or I'd like to see them supporting a family making less than $15,000 a year. <p>But here's the truth about who it would help. Most people who would get a raise if we raise the minimum wage are not teenagers on their first job. Their average age is 35. A majority of lower wage jobs are held by women. These Americans are working full time, often supporting families, and if the minimum wage had kept pace with our economy's productivity, they'd already be earning well over $10 an hour. Today. Instead, it's stuck at $7.25. Every time Congress refuses to raise it, it loses value because the cost of living goes higher, minimum wage stays the same. Right now it's worth 20 percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan took office. And since&mdash;over the last year, since I asked Congress to do something and they didn't do it, that was an equivalent of a $200 pay cut for the average minimum wage worker, because it didn't keep pace with inflation. That's a month of groceries for the average minimum wage worker. That's 2 months' worth of electricity. This is not a small thing, this is a big deal. It makes a big difference in the lives of a lot of families. <p>So Members of Congress have a choice to make. It is a clear choice: Raise workers' wages, grow our economy, or let wages stagnate further, give workers what amounts to another pay cut. Fortunately, folks in Connecticut have really a good delegation, so your Senators and Representatives are already on board. They're all on board. They're fighting the good fight. But anybody who is watching at home, you deserve to know where your elected official stands. So just ask them, \\"Do you support raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour?\\" If they say yes, say, \\"Thanks.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"Great job.\\" We need encouragement too, elected officials. [<i>Laughter</i>] If they say no, you should be polite&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but you should say, \\"Why not?\\" Ask them to reconsider. Ask them to side with the majority of Americans. Instead of saying no, for once, say yes. It's time for $10.10. It's time to give America a raise. <p>I want to close by sharing a story of a guy named Doug Wade, who is here today. Where's Doug? I'm going to embarrass Doug. Stand up. There's Doug, right here. Doug had a chance to meet Secretary Perez in Hartford last week. Doug is the president of Wade's Dairy down in Bridgeport. So his great-grandfather Frank&mdash;is that right? Frank?&mdash;started the family business in 1893&mdash;1893. One of the secrets to their success is that they treat their employees like part of the family. So Doug pays his own workers fairly. <p>But he goes a step further than that. He writes editorials, he talks to fellow business leaders, he meets with elected officials to make the case for a higher minimum wage for everybody. And keep in mind, Doug spent most of his life as a registered Republican. This is not about politics, this is about common sense. It's about business sense. And Doug, we were talking backstage, Doug showed me a paystub because he&mdash;it describes his own story. When he was flipping burgers back in 1970, his employer paid him the minimum wage, but it went 25 percent farther than it does today. So Doug speaks from experience when he says that \\"Things like the minimum wage raise the bar for everybody.\\" And he's still got that paycheck. And it looks like the paycheck I got when I was working at Baskin-Robbins. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>The point that Doug and his family and his business represents is, we believe in hard work, we believe in responsibility, we believe in individual initiative, but we also come together to raise the bar for everybody; to make sure our fellow citizens can pursue their own dreams as well; that they can look after their kids and lift them up. We look out for each other. That's who we are. That is our story. <p>There are millions of Americans like Doug, and like all of you, who are tired of the old political arguments, ready to raise the bar a little higher. Let's move this country forward. Let's move it up. Let's go further. That's what I'm going to do as President as long as I have the honor of serving in this office, and I need your help. Let's go out there and give America a raise. <p>God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"47" "\"Hello, everybody! Welcome to the White House for the latest in our series celebrating the music that has shaped our American story. And as someone who always shares this house with brilliant, creative, talented, somewhat stubborn women&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I think Women's History Month is the perfect time to honor a few more: the Women of Soul. <p>This is a really good lineup. And I want to thank our performers for this evening. They are fantastic. We've got Tessanne Chin here. We've got Melissa Etheridge. We've got Aretha Franklin. We've got Ariana Grande. Miss Patti LaBelle. Janelle Monae. And Miss Jill Scott. That is a lineup. I can't wait. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Finally, I want to make a quick public service announcement. When Aretha Franklin first walked into Fame Studio in 1967, most of the other musicians had never heard her sing live before. When they did, one of them said: \\"The floors rumbled and the walls shook. My brain shook. It was magic.\\" So my advice to everyone tonight is simple: Hang on. [<i>Laughter</i>] The Queen of Soul is in the building. If she blows your mind, it will be okay. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But that's what soul music does. It makes us move, and it makes us feel. To quote Jill Scott, \\"Soul music is about reaching and touching people on a human level.\\" <p>For many of the performers here tonight, it all began on Sunday morning. Growing up in Detroit, Aretha sang at her father's church and recorded her first album at that church when she was just 14 years old. Patti LaBelle was painfully shy&mdash;I cannot believe that, but this is what I have been told&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;until she sang a solo in front of the congregation and got a standing ovation. That's when she realized she could do something special. <p>Eventually, artists like Aretha and Patti began mixing gospel with R&B and rock and pop. Instead of singing about love and pain, forgiveness and acceptance to a church audience, they sang about them to the world. And the world had never heard anything like it. <p>When Aretha first told us what \\"R-S-P-E-C-T\\"&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;meant to her, she had no idea it would become a rallying cry for African Americans and women and then everyone who felt marginalized because of what they looked like or who they loved. They wanted some respect. Later, when somebody asked her why it had such an impact, she said, \\"I guess everybody just wants a little respect.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Today, they still do. Aretha had already won 11 Grammys by the time Janelle Monae was born. But as a teenager struggling to make it in New York, Janelle worked as a maid, singing for the other women as they cleaned houses together. And she says the experience inspired her to write music for people like them, \\"because they need it the most.\\" <p>And when Melissa Etheridge was growing up, she fell in love with artists who had something to say. She remembers thinking, \\"I can't wait until I get up there and sing the truth.\\" <p>And ultimately, that's what soul is all about: telling some truth. And tonight we're in for a healthy dose of truth&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;from some of the finest voices there are. <p>So without further ado, I'd like to introduce a true American treasure, the one and only Miss Patti LaBelle.\" "
"48" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. Before Jay takes some of your questions, I wanted to provide a brief update on our efforts to address the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. <p>Since the Russian intervention, we've been mobilizing the international community to condemn this violation of international law and to support the people and Government of Ukraine. This morning I signed an Executive order that authorizes sanctions on individuals and entities responsible for violating the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine or for stealing the assets of the Ukrainian people. <p>According to my guidance, the State Department has also put in place restrictions on the travel of certain individuals and officials. These decisions continue our efforts to impose a cost on Russia and those responsible for the situation in Crimea. And they also give us the flexibility to adjust our response going forward based on Russia's actions. <p>We took these steps in close coordination with our European allies. I've spoken to several of our closest friends around the world, and I'm pleased that our international unity is on display at this important moment. Already, we've moved together to announce substantial assistance for the Government in Kiev, and today in Brussels, our allies took similar steps to impose costs on Russia. I am confident that we are moving forward together, united in our determination to oppose actions that violate international law and to support the Government and people of Ukraine. <p>And that includes standing up for the principle of state sovereignty. The proposed referendum on the future of Crimea would violate the Ukrainian Constitution and violate international law. Any discussion about the future of Ukraine must include the legitimate Government of Ukraine. In 2014, we are well beyond the days when borders can be redrawn over the heads of democratic leaders. <p>While we take these steps, I want to be clear that there is also a way to resolve this crisis that respects the interests of the Russian Federation, as well as the Ukrainian people. Let international monitors into all of Ukraine, including Crimea, to ensure the rights of all Ukrainians are being respected, including ethnic Russians. Begin consultations between the Government of Russia and Ukraine, with the participation of the international community. Russia would maintain its basing rights in Crimea, provided that it abides by its agreements and respects Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. And the world should support the people of Ukraine as they move to elections in May. <p>That's the path of deescalation, and Secretary Kerry is engaged in discussions with all of the relevant parties, including Russia and Ukraine, to pursue that path. But if this violation of international law continues, the resolve of the United States and our allies and the international community will remain firm. Meanwhile, we've taken steps to reaffirm our commitment to the security and democracy of our allies in Eastern Europe and to support the people of Ukraine. <p>One last point: There's been a lot of talk in Congress about these issues. Today, once again, I'm calling on Congress to follow up on these words with action, specifically to support the IMF's capacity to lend resources to Ukraine and to provide American assistance for the Ukrainian Government so that they can weather this storm and stabilize their economy, make needed reforms, deliver for their people, all of which will provide a smoother pathway for the elections that have already been scheduled in May. <p>Today the world can see that the United States is united with our allies and partners in upholding international law and pursuing a just outcome that advances global security and the future that the Ukrainian people deserve. That's what we're going to continue to do in the days to come until we have seen a resolution to this crisis. <p>Thanks very much. And Jay and Ben and others will be happy to take your questions.\" "
"49" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hey! [<i>Applause</i>] Hello, Miami! Hello, 'Cuda Nation! Thank you. [<i>Applause</i>] Hello! It is good to be here at Coral Reef Senior High. You guys are just happy because it's warm down here all the time. [<i>Laughter</i>] I don't know if you're aware of this, but the rest of the country is cold. [<i>Laughter</i>] Ha! Listen, the&mdash;Michelle and I are so grateful for the warm welcome. It is great to be here. I want to thank some people who are doing outstanding work. <p>First of all, your superintendent, Superintendent Carvalho, is doing great work. We're really proud of him. Your principal, Principal Leal, is doing great work. All the Coral Reef teachers and staff, you guys are all doing a great job. And you're doing what is necessary to help young people get ready for college and careers. So that's why we're here. We are proud of what's being done at this school. <p>I want to mention a few other folks who are here who are fighting on behalf of the people of South Florida every day. We've got Congressman Joe Garcia is here. We've got Congresswoman Frederica Wilson here. We've got Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez. Your former Governor, Charlie Crist, is here. <p>And most of all, I want to thank the people that Michelle and I came all the way down here to see, and that is the students of Coral Reef. We had heard great things about your school. We had heard great things about the students. We wanted to come down here and just see what was going on. And Michelle just&mdash;Michelle and I just had a chance to visit with some of your classmates who are going through some of the scholarship applications, and we had a chance to talk to them and hear what their plans were. And first of all, Michelle and I looked, and we said, these must be actors playing students, because they were all smart and good-looking and organized. [<i>Laughter</i>] And you asked them, what are you going to do? And they're&mdash;well, I'm going to be applying to business school, and then I'm going to start a company, and then I&mdash;when I was your age, I didn't know what I was doing. I was lucky if I had gotten out of bed on time. [<i>Laughter</i>] So you guys are ahead of the game. <p>And we're here to tell you that you've got to keep up the good work, because by working hard every single day, every single night, you are making the best investment there is in your future. And we want to make sure you've got everything, all the tools you need to succeed. We want every young person to have the kinds of teachers and the kind of classes and the kind of learning experiences that are available to you here at Coral Reef. Because that's the best investment we can make in America's future. <p>Now, keep in mind, Michelle and I, we're only here today because of the kind of education that we got. That was our ticket to success. We grew up a lot like many of you. I was raised by a single mom; she was a teenager when I was born. We moved around a lot, and we did not have a lot of money. But the one thing she was determined to see was that my sister and I would get the best education possible. <p>And she would press me. Sometimes, she'd make me wake up, do my lessons before I even went to school. She was not going to let me off the hook. And at the time, I wasn't happy about it, but now I'm glad she pressed me like that. Because, thanks to my mother and my grandparents, and then great teachers and great counselors who encouraged me, and a country that made it possible for me to afford a higher education, I was able to go to college and law school. <p>And then when I met Michelle, I saw that&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. There were a couple of things I noticed. I noticed she was smart. I noticed she was funny; she's funny, she's funnier than I am. [<i>Laughter</i>] Obviously, I noticed she was cute, yes. Obviously, I noticed that. [<i>Laughter</i>] But one of the things I also realized was, even though we had grown up in very different places, her story was a lot like mine. Her dad worked at a city water plant. He didn't go to college. He was a blue-collar worker. Michelle's mom&mdash;my mother-in-law, who I love to death&mdash;she was a secretary. No one in her family had gone to college. But because she had worked hard and her parents understood the value of education and she had great teachers and great opportunities and because the country was willing to invest to make sure that she was able to pay for college, she ended up going to some of the best universities in the country. <p>So the point is, she and I have been able to achieve things that our parents, our grandparents would have never dreamed of. And that's the chance this country should give every young person. That's the idea at the heart of America. <p>What makes this country great, what makes it special when you look around, and Miami is a great example of it, you've got people coming from everywhere, every background, every race, every faith. But what binds us together is this idea that if you work hard, you can make it, that there's opportunity for all. The belief that no matter who you are, no matter where you come from, no matter what your last name is, if you are responsible and put in the effort, you can succeed. There's no limit to what you can do. That's what America is all about. <p>Opportunity is what drew many of your parents and grandparents to America. And we've got to restore that idea for your generation so that everybody has the same chance Michelle and I did. That's why we're working on what we call an opportunity agenda: to create more jobs and train more workers with new skills; to make sure hard work is rewarded with a paycheck that supports a family; to make sure that everybody can get health care when they need it so that nobody has to get into financial trouble because somebody in the family gets sick. <p>And for the students here, a lot of you, you may not think about these issues all the time. You're spending a lot of time on homework and sports and this and that. But you also oftentimes see your own family struggling, and you worry about it. And one of the single most important parts of our opportunity agenda is making sure that every young person in America has access to a world-class education&mdash;a world-class education. So that's why we are here. <p>I believe we should start teaching our kids at the earliest ages. So we're trying to help more States make high-quality preschool and other early learning programs available to the youngest kids. I believe that our K-through-12 system should be the best in the world. So we started a competition called Race to the Top to encourage more States like Florida to raise expectations for students like you, because when we set high expectations, every single one of you can meet them. You're recruiting and preparing the best teachers. You are turning around low-performing schools. You're expanding high-performing ones. You're making sure every student is prepared for college or a career. <p>I believe that every student should have the best technology. So we launched something we called ConnectED to connect our schools to high-speed Internet. And I want to congratulate Miami-Dade and your superintendent, because you have achieved your goal of installing Wi-Fi in every single one of your schools. <p>So the good news is, in part because of some of these reforms we've initiated, when you add it all up, our Nation's high school graduation rate is the highest on record. The dropout rate has been dropping, and among Latino students, it's been cut in half since 2000. Miami-Dade's graduation rate is higher than it's ever been. That's all because of the efforts of so many people, including the parents and students who have been putting in the effort. It's because of the teachers and administrators and staff who are doing such a great job. You should be proud. We're making progress. [<i>Applause</i>] We're making progress. <p>Yes, you guys&mdash;by the way, you can all sit down. I didn't realize everybody was still standing up. Sit down. Take a load off. You guys can't sit down, though, because you don't have chairs. You guys stay standing; although, bend your knees so you don't faint. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But here's the key thing, Coral Reef: We still have more work to do, all of us: elected officials, principals, teachers, parents, students. Because, as Michelle says, education is a two-way street. Folks like us have to work hard to give you the best schools and support that you need. But then you've got to hold up your end of the bargain by committing to your education. That means you've got to stretch your minds. You've got to push through subjects that aren't always easy. And it means continuing your education past high school, whether that's a 2-year or a 4-year college degree or getting some professional training. <p>So I want to talk about an easy step that high school students like you can take to make college a reality. And it's something you already know here at Coral Reef, but I'm speaking to all the young people out there who may be watching. It's called FAFSA, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. <p>It is a simple form. It used to be complicated; we made it simple. It doesn't cost anything. That's why it's&mdash;the word \\"free\\" is right there in the name. [<i>Laughter</i>] It does not take a long time to fill out. Once you do, you're putting yourself in the running for all kinds of financial support for college: scholarships, grants, loans, work-study jobs. <p>For the past 5 years, we've been working to make college more affordable. We took on a college loan system that gave billions of dollars of taxpayer money to big banks to manage the student loan system. We said, we don't need the banks; let's give the money directly to students, we can help more students. We can help more students that way. So we expanded the grants that help millions of students from low-income backgrounds pay for college. We're offering millions of people the chance to cap their student loan payments at 10 percent of their incomes once they graduate. <p>Today, more young people are earning college degrees than ever before. That's a great thing. [<i>Applause</i>] That is a great thing. But we still need to do more to help rein in the rising cost of tuition. We need to do more to help Americans who feel trapped by student loan debt, because no striving, hard-working, ambitious, young American should ever be denied a college education just because they can't afford it. Nobody. <p>Unfortunately, there are still a lot of young people all across the country who say the cost of college is holding them back. Some of you may have sat around the kitchen table with your parents wondering about whether you'll be able to afford it. So FAFSA is by far the easiest way to answer that question. And I know the Barracudas know all about FAFSA. Last year, you had the second highest completion rate of any large high school in the State. You should be proud of that. Your teachers and parents should be proud of that. <p>But last year, almost half of high school graduates in Florida didn't fill out the FAFSA form. <p><i>Audience members</i>. Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> That ain't right. [<i>Laughter</i>] Not only is it not right, but it also ain't right. [<i>Laughter</i>] And as a result, they lost out on over $100 million in Pell grants. Think about that: A hundred million dollars that could have helped Florida students help pay for college was just left on the table. That's just in Florida. Nationwide, over 1 million high school students did not fill out the FAFSA form. That happens every year. <p>So my challenge today to every high school student in America: Fill out the form. Even if you think you might not qualify for financial aid, fill out the form. You might qualify. <p>And we're making it easier than ever. We put the FAFSA form online. We made it shorter. It takes about half an hour to fill out. And it could change the rest of your life. We've updated it to save your parents a lot of hassle as well. And today I'm announcing another improvement. <p>Today I'm directing the Department of Education to tell every Governor that, starting today, they can, if they choose, confidentially let high school administrators know which students have filled out the FAFSA form and which haven't. So that way, if Principal Leal wants to check in with the seniors&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience members</i>. Woo. <p><i>The President.</i> I know, everybody is, like, whoa. [<i>Laughter</i>] I know she's already on top of stuff, but this way, she can&mdash;she could check, and seniors who had not filled it out, she could then help them answer the questions and figure out what's holding her back&mdash;what's holding them back. <p>Anybody will be able to go online and find out the number of students who have filled out the form at each high school, so we can track it. So if you want to have a friendly competition with Palmetto High or Miami Killian to see who can get a higher completion rate on your FAFSA, you can do that. You achieved the second highest rate in the State, but I mean, if you want to settle for number two, that's okay; you might be able to get number one. <p><i>Audience members</i>. No! <p><i>The President.</i> Huh? I'm just saying, you could go for number one. [<i>Applause</i>] <p>So these are things I can do on my own, but I'm here to also tell you I need&mdash;I could use some help from folks in Washington. There are some things I don't need Congress's permission for, and in this year of action, whenever I see a way to act to help expand opportunity for young people, I'm just going to go ahead and take it. [<i>Applause</i>] I'm just going to go ahead and do it. <p>So earlier this year, Michelle and I hosted a College Opportunity Summit, where over 150 colleges and universities and nonprofits made commitments to help more low-income students get to college and graduate from college. But I'm also willing to work with anybody in Congress&mdash;Democrat, Republican, doesn't matter&mdash;to make sure young people like you have a shot to success. <p>So a few days ago, I sent my budget to Congress. And budgets are pretty boring, but the stuff inside the budgets are pretty important. And my budget focuses on things like preschool for all; like redesigning high schools so students like you can learn real-world skills that businesses want; like preparing more young people for careers in some of the fields of the future, in science and technology and engineering and math, to discover new planets and invent robots and cure diseases&mdash;all the cool stuff that we adults haven't figured out yet. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>These are not just the right investments for our schools, they're the right priorities for our country. You are our priority. We've got to make sure we have budgets that reflect that you are the most important thing to this country's success. If you don't succeed, we don't succeed. <p>We've got to make sure all of you are prepared for the new century, and we've got to keep growing our economy in other ways: attracting new high-tech jobs, reforming our immigration system, something Congressman Garcia is fighting for. And the rest of Congress needs to stop doing nothing, do right by America's students, America's teachers, America's workers. Let's get to work. Let's get busy. We've got work to do. All of us have work to do: teachers, school counselors, principals, superintendents, parents, grandparents. <p>We all have work to do, because we want to see you succeed, because we're counting on you, Barracudas. All of you. And if you keep reaching for success&mdash;and I know you will, just based on the small sampling we saw of students here&mdash;if you keep working as hard as you can and learning as much as you can, and if you've got big ambitions and big dreams, if you don't let anybody tell you something is out of your reach, if you are convinced that you can do something and apply effort and energy and determination and persistence to that vision, then not only will you be great, but this country will be great. Our schools will be great. <p>I want us to have the best educated workforce in America. And I want it to be the most diverse workforce in the world. That's what I'm fighting for. That's what your superintendent and your principal are fighting for, and I hope that's what you fight for yourselves. Because when I meet the students here at Coral Reef, I am optimistic about the future. Michelle and I walked out of that classroom, and we said, you know what, we're going to be in good hands, we're going to do okay, because these young people are coming, and nobody is going to stop them. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"50" "\"Hi, everybody. This week, I traveled to New England, where I was joined by four Governors who are working to raise the minimum wage in each of their States. And they've also joined me in calling on Congress to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10 an hour. Because it would give nearly 800,000 Americans in their States a raise and lift wages for about 28 million people across the country. <p>So these Governors aren't waiting for Congress to make up its mind. And in my State of the Union Address, I asked America's business leaders to go ahead and do what they could to raise their employees' wages too. And increasingly, it's not just large companies like Costco or the Gap that choose to pay their employees higher starting wages. <p>It's smaller businesses like Jaxson's, a family-owned ice cream parlor in South Florida. They answered the call and raised their wages so that more than 70 employees would earn at least $10.10 an hour, without cutting back on hiring. <p>And 2 weeks ago, an Atlanta small-business owner named Darien Southerland wrote me to share a lesson his grandmother taught him: that if you treat your employees right, they'll treat you right. And Vice President Biden paid him a visit this week. <p>I agree with these business owners, which is why I issued an Executive order requiring Federal contractors to pay their employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour. It's good for our bottom line. And working Americans have struggled through stagnant wages for far too long. <p>A clear majority of Americans support raising the minimum wage because we believe that nobody who works full time should have to live in poverty. About half of all Republicans support raising the minimum wage too. It's just too bad they don't serve in Congress. Because the Republicans who do serve in Congress don't want to vote on the minimum wage at all. Some even want to get rid of it completely. Seriously. <p>That's why what business leaders and everyday Americans are doing to raise wages is so important. Because change doesn't come from Washington, change comes to Washington. I've always believed that, and it's true in this case too. Outside Washington, Americans are ready to put aside old political arguments and move this country forward. The American people are way ahead of Congress on this issue, and we've just got to let Congress know that. It's time for \\"10-10.\\" It's time to give America a raise. And it's time to restore opportunity for all. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"51" "\"Hello, everybody. Hello! Hey! Everybody, have a seat. Look it: She's taking selfies. [<i>Laughter</i>] Sit down. [<i>Laughter</i>] Sit down. I caught you. [<i>Laughter</i>] Well, I've already said hi to everybody, so I'm going to keep my remarks pretty short. <p>Welcome to the White House. It is nice to be outside for a change, and spring break is under way for a lot of schools, and so we thought this was the perfect time to invite a bunch of college kids over to wreak havoc on the White House. What could go wrong? <p>This is an incredible group. I had a chance to meet many of you earlier. We've got golfers. We've got runners. We've got soccer players. We've got everything in between. We've even got some volleyball-playing Anteaters. [<i>Laughter</i>] And the West Virginia rifle team is here, although the Secret Service is not sure whether we checked them before they came in. We've got the Minnesota women's hockey team, which includes a few players who competed for Team U.S.A. in Sochi. Yay! <p>We've got three schools that sent a pair of teams here today. The Tar Heels, we've got women's lacrosse and women's soccer. For Princeton, we've got fencing and field hockey. For USC, we have men's and women's water polo. <p>We've got a lot of champs here today. I want to make sure everybody gets their due. So on the women's side, let's give it up for the Kansas track and field team, the Oklahoma softball team, the Stanford tennis team. And on the men's side, we've got the Alabama golf team, the UC&mdash;Irvine volleyball team, Colorado cross country, Duke lacrosse, Indiana soccer, Oklahoma cross country, Virginia tennis, and the Yale hockey squad. <p>Now, no matter what sport you play and no matter where you come from, for the rest of your lives, every single one of you is going to be able to call yourselves a national champion. And you know that a title like that means not just performing your best when the spotlight is on and the game is underway, but also pushing yourself even harder when nobody is watching: dragging yourself out of bed for early morning weight-lifting sessions and gutting out the preseason two-a-days. It means cracking the books, I hope, on those late-night bus rides home and making sure to leave time to study when everybody else is out having fun. And it means that after practice, when other folks might turn off the lights and head home, you ask the janitor to keep the lights on so you can run another drill&mdash;or two or three. <p>And that's the championship spirit that we're celebrating today, not just the trophies in the display case back home, but the drive and the toughness and the teamwork that put them there. <p>And at a time when legendary conferences are being reshuffled and too many schools have been forced to cut sports, athletes like all of you remind us that at their core, college athletics are supposed to be about a lot more than just network ratings. They're about the shy freshman who develops into a team captain, the underdog who learns how to play in the spotlight and learns how to slay the giant, the role player who fights through an injury to play on Senior Day. It's about playing a game that you love, even if you're not on a full scholarship or even if the only folks cheering you on are your mom and dad. And at their best, college sports teach us about giving back to our communities. <p>So athletes from these teams have spent time visiting local children's hospitals, volunteering with the Special Olympics, and speaking to young people about bullying. You've helped raise awareness for efforts like Habitat for Humanity and Read Across America and LGBT rights. <p>And that's the kind of ethic that shows, this is not just about winning, it's about learning how to lift other people up. That's what makes a true champion. And that's what will serve you well no matter what path you choose in the years ahead, whether as a coach or an athlete or a doctor or a teacher or an entrepreneur. Our country needs young people like you to keep giving your best and to keep bringing out the best in those around you. That's how we keep making progress and moving forward. And that's why we're all looking forward to seeing what all of you accomplish in the years ahead. <p>And I'm particularly proud of two things. One, it's traditional to bring football and basketball teams here. I think that for all these outstanding athletes and sports, it's important to acknowledge that your investment and time and effort and dedication is just as significant. And you may not always be on television all the time, but what you guys do is remarkable, and you are truly great athletes. <p>The second thing is, I can't tell you how proud I am of the young women here. There was a time when college women's athletics was relegated to second status. And all of you here are showing the incredible strides that we've made over the last couple of decades. And it means that Malia and Sasha and my nieces, they all know how important athletics is in their lives. And you guys have really paved the way. So we're really proud of you for that. <p>I want to congratulate all of you on your championship season. I hope that you guys enjoyed your time at the White House. I want to wish all of you the best of luck in the time ahead. For those of you who are returning, coming back, good luck next season. And for those of you who are graduating, Godspeed. <p>All right? I hope you guys had a good time. Take care of yourselves. Congratulations.\" "
"52" "\"<i>The President</i>. As some of you know, in my State of the Union Address, I talked about taking any actions that I could to ensure that this incredible gift of American lands, the natural bounty that has been passed on to us from previous generations, is preserved for future generations. And I pledged to act wherever I could to make sure that our children, our grandchildren are going to be able to look upon this land of ours with the same wonder as we have. <p>Today I'm taking the important step by designating the Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands as a national monument. I want to thank the lawmakers who supported this proclamation, including Representatives Jared Huffman and Mike Thompson, as well as Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer. <p>And I also want to recognize Larry Stornetta, who is here&mdash;there is Larry right here&mdash;whose family helped care for this land and sold part of the ranch so the public could access it. <p>We are talking about over 1,600 acres of incredible coastline in California that reflects the incredible diversity of flora and fauna. It is a place where scientists do research, where people who just want to experience the great outdoors can take advantage of it. It is a huge economic boost for the region. California tourism obviously is important, and the California coastline, I think, is as big of an attraction as there is. <p>And so for us to make sure that this is going to be properly preserved, that it is going to be cherished, that the Federal protections will be available, I think is going to make all the difference. <p>And one of the great things about the way we've done our national monument designations is that we've made sure that all the stakeholders are involved throughout this process. We talk to local communities. We talk to local business interests. We talk to Native American tribes. We make sure that anybody who may have some impact, their voice is heard. And unanimously, in this part of the country, people believe that this is the right thing to do, and I certainly do. <p>So it's a great pleasure for me to be able to sign this designation. I want to congratulate all the people behind me who worked so hard to make this happen. And I told them that I'm always looking for an excuse to get outside. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I hope I get a chance to roam around this amazing landmark sometime in the future. All right? <p>And with that, I'm going to sign this proclamation. <p>[<i>At this point, the President signed the proclamation.</i>] <p>There's a special trick to this&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p><i>Audience member</i>. Yes. We wondered how it worked. <p><i>The President</i>. There we go. Congratulations. Thank you, everybody.\" "
"53" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you so much. Please. Thank you, guys. Please have a seat. Thank you very much. <p>Well, welcome to the White House. Before I get started, I just want to acknowledge somebody who is working so hard on behalf of America's workers each and every day, our outstanding Secretary of Labor, Tom Perez. So give him a big round of applause. There you go. Tom must have brought some of his family with him. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>The&mdash;we've got a lot of honored guests here. We've got middle class workers who rely on overtime pay. We've got business owners who believe in treating their employees right, both because it's the right thing to do, but also because it's good business. And thanks to the hard work and resilience of Americans like the ones who are here today, our economy has been growing for a number of years now. <p>Our businesses have created more than 8&frac12; million new jobs over the last 4 years. The unemployment rate is at the lowest it's been in over 5 years. But in many ways, the trends that have really battered middle class families for decades have gotten worse, not better. Those at the top are doing better than ever, but for the average family, wages have barely budged. And too many Americans are working harder and harder just to get by. <p>So we've got to reverse those trends. We've got to build an economy that works for everybody, not just for a few. And we've got to restore the basic notion of opportunity that is at the heart of the American experience: opportunity for everyone&mdash;the belief that here in America, it doesn't matter where you started, if you are willing to work hard and act responsibly, you've got a chance to get ahead. <p>So at my State of the Union at the beginning of the year, I laid out an opportunity agenda to give more Americans a chance to succeed. It's got four parts. Number one, making sure we're creating more good jobs that pay good wages. Number two, making sure that we're training more Americans with the skills that are needed to fill those jobs. Number three, making sure every child in America gets a world-class education. And number four, which is what I'm going to be focusing on today, making sure that our economy rewards the hard work of every American. <p>Now, making work pay means making sure women earn equal pay for equal work. It means giving women the chance to have a baby without sacrificing jobs or a day off to care for a sick child or parent without worrying about making ends meet. It means making sure every American has access to quality, affordable health care that's there when you need it. So if there's somebody out there that you know that doesn't have health insurance, make sure they go on healthcare.gov&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;before March 31. That's a priority. And it means wages and paychecks that help to support a family. <p>Profitable corporations like Costco see paying higher wages as way to reduce turnover and boost productivity. And I've asked business owners to do what they can to give their employee a raise. As some of you saw, I was at the Gap yesterday in&mdash;or the day before yesterday in Manhattan, and fortunately, Malia and Sasha liked the sweaters I bought them. [<i>Laughter</i>] But part of what I wanted to highlight was the fact that, on its own, the Gap decided to give a raise to 64,000 employees across the country. <p>I've now called on Congress to give America a raise by raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. And in this year of action, while Congress decides what it's going to do, whether it's going to do anything about this issue&mdash;and I hope that it does, and I know Democrats are pushing hard to get minimum wage legislation passed&mdash;I'm going to do what I can on my own to raise wages for more hard-working Americans. So a few weeks ago, I signed an Executive order requiring Federal contractors to pay their employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour. Today I'm going to use my pen to give more Americans the chance to earn the overtime pay that they deserve. <p>Now, overtime is a pretty simple idea: If you have to work more, you should get paid more. And if you want to know why it's so important, just ask some of the folks here who are behind me. Nancy Minor works at an oil refinery in Pennsylvania. Nancy, raise your hand. There you go. [<i>Laughter</i>] Yes, give Nancy a big round of applause. So for the last 16 years, Nancy has been a single mom raising and educating four kids on her own, and that is not easy, as you might imagine. She's been able to do it, though, thanks in part to her overtime pay. <p>For more than 75 years, the 40-hour workweek and the overtime that comes with it have helped countless workers like Nancy get ahead. And it means that when she's asked to make significant sacrifices on behalf of her company, which she's happy to do, they're also looking out for her, recognizing that that puts a strain on her family and&mdash;having to get a babysitter and all kinds of things, adjustments that she has to make. It's just fair. It's just the right thing to do. <p>Unfortunately, today, millions of Americans aren't getting the extra pay they deserve. That's because an exception that was originally meant for high-paid, white-collar employees now covers workers earning as little as $23,660 a year. So if you're making $23,000, you know, typically, you're not high in management. Right? If your salary is even a dollar above the current threshold, you may not be guaranteed overtime. It doesn't matter if what you do is mostly physical work like stocking shelves, it doesn't matter if you're working 50 or 60 or 70 hours a week; your employer doesn't have to pay you a single extra dime. <p>And I think that's wrong. It doesn't make sense that in some cases this rule actually makes it possible for salaried workers to be paid less than the minimum wage. It's not right when business owners who treat their employees fairly can be undercut by competitors who aren't treating their employees right. If you're working hard, you're barely making ends meet, you should be paid overtime. Period. Because working Americans have struggled through stagnant wages for too long. <p>Every day, I get letters from folks who just feel like they're treading water. No matter how hard they're working&mdash;they're putting in long hours, they're working harder and harder just to get by, but it's always, at the end of the month, real tight. Workers like the ones with me here today, they want to work hard. They don't expect a free lunch, and they don't expect to be fabulously wealthy, they just want a chance to get ahead. <p>So today I'm taking action to help give more workers that chance. I'm directing Tom Perez, my Secretary of Labor, to restore the commonsense principle behind overtime: If you go above and beyond to help your employer and your economy succeed, then you should share a little bit in that success. And this is going to make a real difference in the lives of millions of Americans, from managers in fast food and retail to office workers, cargo inspectors. And we're going to do this the right way: We're going to consult with both workers and businesses as we update our overtime rules. We're going to work to simplify the system so it's easier for employers and employees alike. With any kind of change like this, not everybody is going to be happy, but Americans have spent too long working more and getting less in return. <p>So wherever and whenever I can make sure that our economy rewards hard work and responsibility, that it makes sure that it's treating fairly the workers who are out there building this economy every day, that's what I'm going to do. What every American wants is a paycheck that lets them support their families, experience a little bit of economic security, pass down some hope and optimism to their kids. That's what we're going to be fighting for. That's what I'm going to be fighting for as long as I'm President of the United States. <p>And with that, I'm going to sign this memo. And I want to thank everybody for being here, especially the folks standing behind me. All right? <p>Gather round. Now, don't fall off of there. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Event participant.</i> That's all right, I got workman's comp. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>At this point, the President signed the memorandum.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> I've got to make sure I use every pen. There you go. All right.\" "
"54" "\"Hi, everybody. In this year of action, I'm doing everything I can, with or without Congress, to expand opportunity for more Americans. This week, I ordered a review of our Nation's overtime rules, to give more Americans the chance to earn the overtime pay they've worked for. <p>Here's why this matters. Our businesses have created 8.7 million new jobs over the past 4 years. But in many ways, the trends that have battered the middle class for decades have grown even starker. While those at the top are doing better than ever, average wages have barely budged. Too many Americans are working harder than ever just to keep up. <p>We've got to build an economy that works for everybody, not just for the fortunate few. We know from our history that our economy grows best from the middle out, when growth is more widely shared. So we've got to restore opportunity for all: the idea that with hard work and responsibility, you can get ahead. <p>Now, for more than 75 years, the 40-hour workweek and the overtime protections that come with it have helped countless workers climb the ladder of success. But today, an overtime exception originally meant for highly paid employees now applies to workers who earn as little as $23,660 a year. It doesn't matter if you do mostly physical labor or if you work 50, 60, even 70 hours a week. Your employer may not have to pay you a single extra dime. <p>In some cases, this rule makes it possible for workers earning a salary to actually be paid less than the minimum wage. And it means that business owners who treat their employees fairly can be undercut by competitors who don't. That's not right. So we're going to update those overtime rules to restore that basic principle that if you have to work more, you should be able to earn more. And we'll do it by consulting workers and businesses and simplifying the system so it's easier for everyone. <p>Americans have spent too long working more and getting less in return. So wherever and whenever I can make sure that our economy rewards hard work and responsibility, that's what I'm going to do. Because what every American wants is a paycheck that lets them support their families, know a little economic security, and pass down some hope and optimism to their kids. That's something worth fighting for. And I'll keep fighting for it as long as I'm President. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"55" "\"Good morning, everybody. In recent months, as the citizens of Ukraine have made their voices heard, we have been guided by a fundamental principle: The future of Ukraine must be decided by the people of Ukraine. That means Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected and international law must be upheld. <p>And so Russia's decision to send troops into Crimea has rightly drawn global condemnation. From the start, the United States has mobilized the international community in support of Ukraine to isolate Russia for its actions and to reassure our allies and partners. We saw this international unity again over the weekend, when Russia stood alone in the U.N. Security Council defending its actions in Crimea. And as I told President Putin yesterday, the referendum in Crimea was a clear violation of Ukrainian constitutions and international law and it will not be recognized by the international community. <p>Today I'm announcing a series of measures that will continue to increase the cost on Russia and on those responsible for what is happening in Ukraine. First, as authorized by the Executive order I signed 2 weeks ago, we are imposing sanctions on specific individuals responsible for undermining the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and Government of Ukraine. We're making it clear that there are consequences for their actions. <p>Second, I have signed a new Executive order that expands the scope of our sanctions. As an initial step, I'm authorizing sanctions on Russian officials, entities operating in the arms sector in Russia, and individuals who provide material support to senior officials of the Russian Government. And if Russia continues to interfere in Ukraine, we stand ready to impose further sanctions. <p>Third, we're continuing our close consultations with our European partners, who today in Brussels moved ahead with their own sanctions against Russia. Tonight Vice President Biden departs for Europe, where he will meet with the leaders of our NATO allies: Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. And I'll be traveling to Europe next week. Our message will be clear: As NATO allies, we have a solemn commitment to our collective defense, and we will uphold this commitment. <p>Fourth, we'll continue to make clear to Russia that further provocations will achieve nothing except to further isolate Russia and diminish its place in the world. The international community will continue to stand together to oppose any violations of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity, and continued Russian military intervention in Ukraine will only deepen Russia's diplomatic isolation and exact a greater toll on the Russian economy. <p>Going forward, we can calibrate our response based on whether Russia chooses to escalate or to deescalate the situation. Now, I believe there's still a path to resolve this situation diplomatically in a way that addresses the interests of both Russia and Ukraine. That includes Russia pulling its forces in Crimea back to their bases, supporting the deployment of additional international monitors in Ukraine, and engaging in dialogue with the Ukrainian Government, which has indicated its openness to pursuing constitutional reform as they move forward towards elections this spring. But throughout this process, we're going to stand firm in our unwavering support for Ukraine. As I told Prime Minister Yatseniuk last week, the United States stands with the people of Ukraine and their right to determine their own destiny. We're going to keep working with Congress and our international partners to offer Ukraine the economic support that it needs to weather this crisis and to improve the daily lives of the Ukrainian people. <p>And as we go forward, we'll continue to look at the range of ways we can help our Ukrainian friends achieve their universal rights and the security, prosperity, and dignity that they deserve. Thanks very much. And Jay, I think, will be available for questions. Thank you.\" "
"56" "\"<i>The President.</i> Good afternoon, everybody. Please be seated. Well, welcome to the White House. <p>The presentation of our Nation's highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor, is always a special occasion. But today it is truly historic. This is the single largest group of servicemembers to be awarded the Medal of Honor since the Second World War. And with several of these soldiers recognized for their valor during that war, this ceremony is 70 years in the making. As one family member has said, this is long overdue. <p>Many of these families&mdash;and I had a chance to meet all of them who are present here today&mdash;they've known these stories of heroism for decades. Still, they were pretty surprised when we called them to break the news about the Medal of Honor. Some of them thought it was a prank. [<i>Laughter</i>] Some of them thought it was a scam. A few of them thought it might be some trick to get their credit card number. [<i>Laughter</i>] When I called Melvin Morris, who we'll recognize in a moment for his actions in Vietnam, his first reaction was, \\"Oh, my God, what have I done?\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] When I told him it was all good&mdash;the Medal of Honor&mdash;I could hear through the phone, he almost passed out. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>You see, for their gallantry under fire each of these soldiers was long ago recognized with the Army's second highest award, the Distinguished Service Cross. But ask their fellow veterans, ask their families, and they'll tell you that their extraordinary deeds merited the highest recognition. And today we have the chance to set the record straight. <p>This ceremony reminds us of one of the enduring qualities that makes America great, that makes us exceptional. No nation is perfect, but here in America, we confront our imperfections and face a sometimes painful past, including the truth that some of these soldiers fought and died for a country that did not always see them as equal. So with each generation we keep on striving to live up to our ideals of freedom and equality and to recognize the dignity and patriotism of every person, no matter who they are, what they look like, or how they pray. <p>And that's why, more than a decade ago, Congress mandated a review to make sure that the heroism of our veterans wasn't overlooked because of prejudice or discrimination. Our military reviewed thousands of war records. They teamed up with veterans groups and museums to get this right. It was painstaking work, made even harder because sometimes, our servicemembers felt as if they needed to change their last names to fit in. That tells a story about our past. But ultimately, after years of review, these two dozen soldiers&mdash;among them Hispanic, African American, and Jewish veterans&mdash;were identified as having earned the Medal of Honor. This is the length to which America will go to make sure everyone who serves under our proud flag receives the thanks that they deserve. <p>So this is going to be a long ceremony. [<i>Laughter</i>] We're going to read all 24 citations because every one is a story of bravery that deserves to be told. But first, I want to take just a few minutes to describe the Americans behind these actions, the men these families know, the brilliant lives behind the smiling faces in those old photographs, and how they reflected all the beauty and diversity of the country that they served. They were Americans by birth and Americans by choice, immigrants, including one who was not yet even a citizen. They grew up in big city neighborhoods like Brooklyn, rural communities like Hooper, Nebraska, small towns like Puerto Rico. They loved to fish and play baseball. They were sons who made their parents proud and brothers who their siblings looked up to. They were so young, many in their early twenties. And when their country went to war, they answered the call. They put on the uniform and hugged their families goodbye. Some of them hugged the wives and children that they'd never see again. <p>They fought in the rocky hills of Italy, the blood-stained beaches of France, in the freezing mountains of Korea, the humid jungles of Vietnam. Their courage almost defies imagination. When you read the records of these individuals, it's unimaginable, the valor that they displayed. Running into bullets. Charging machine gun nests and climbing aboard tanks and taking them out. Covering their comrades so they could make it to safety. Holding back enemies, wave after wave, even when the combat was hand to hand. Manning their posts&mdash;some to their very last breaths&mdash;so that their comrades might live. <p>Of the 24 American soldiers we honor today, 10 never came home. One of them&mdash;Corporal Joe Baldonado, from the Korean War&mdash;is still missing, reminding us that, as a nation, we have a scared obligation to keep working to give the families of our missing servicemembers from all wars a full accounting of their loved ones. <p>Through their grief, the families of our fallen summoned the strength to carry on: wives whose hearts ached for their husbands, sons and daughters who grew up without their dad, nieces and nephews and grandchildren. And these families join us here today. And they know, more than most, that because others laid down their lives for us, we've been able to live our lives in freedom, pursue our dreams. So there's a legacy here born of sacrifice. <p>That includes a soldier's nephew, a kid from New York, who grew up to become one of the great rock stars of all time and who honors his uncle here today. It includes soldiers who came home and took different paths: some continuing to serve in uniform, some beginning new careers, some getting married and raising their kids, serving their communities, taking care of their fellow vets. <p>These veterans lived out their lives in the country that they helped to defend and doing what they love, like William Leonard, who at age 71 passed away in his backyard, sitting in his chair, listening to his beloved Yankees play on the radio. <p>And that's where this story might have ended. But Mitchel Libman, a friend of one of these soldiers and an Army vet himself, set out on a mission. He and his wife Marilyn spent years writing letters and working with Congress and our military to get this done. And so we thank all those who worked so hard for so long to bring us to this moment, especially Marilyn and Mitchel&mdash;now 83 years old&mdash;who I'd ask to stand so that we can all say thank you. <p>Finally, of these 24 soldiers, 3 remain with us and have joined us here today, men who remind us that sometimes, the heroes we seek are right in front of us, literally living right next door. <p>Most days, you can find Jose Rodela at his San Antonio home, a 76-year-old retiree who enjoys watching baseball on TV and working on his 1975 Chevy pickup and mowing the grass for his neighbors. Joe is such a humble guy&mdash;Jose is such a humble guy that he did not even mention the ceremony to his neighbors, who I think would be pretty shocked to turn on the news tonight&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and see that the guy who cuts their lawn is getting the Medal of Honor. [<i>Laughter</i>] Today we remember how 32-year-old Sergeant First Class Rodela fought through his wounds in Vietnam and rallied his men during 18 hours of constant combat. <p>Most days, you can find Melvin Morris at home in Port St. John, Florida, 72 years old, a retired salesman and a great-grandfather. You'll find him working on his boat, going fishing, reading the Bible, spending time with his beautiful wife Mary, married 53 years this month. You're going to have to give me some tips. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm&mdash;we're not that far along yet. [Laughter] Today we remember how 27-year-old Staff Sergeant Morris, one of our Nation's very first Green Berets&mdash;one of our very first Green Berets. Think about that. I mean, that's legendary&mdash;how Staff Sergeant Morris recovered a fallen comrade in Vietnam, took out several enemy bunkers and kept going even after he was shot three times. <p>And on most days, you can find Santiago Erevia at home in San Antonio. He's a 68-year-old retired postal worker. He's fixing up his house, typically, tending to the garden, going on walks with his wife, or doing some pushups to stay in shape. [<i>Laughter</i>] Today we remember how 23-year-old Specialist-4 Erevia, under a hail of bullets in Vietnam, gave first aid to his wounded comrades and singlehandedly destroyed four enemy bunkers. <p>These are extraordinary Americans. They are exemplary soldiers. And so I want to begin by welcoming Santiago Erevia to stage for the reading of the citation. <p>[<i>At this point, Lt. Cmdr. Tiffany F. Hill, USN, Navy Aide to the President, read the citation. The President then presented the medal, assisted by Lt. Col. S. Lee Meyer, USMC, Marine Aide to the President. After receiving the medal, S4 Erevia returned to his seat. Sfc. Melvin Morris was then called to the stage for the reading of the citation. Maj. Matthew Newell, USAF, Air Force Aide to the President, read the citation, and the President presented the medal. After receiving the medal, Sfc. Morris returned to his seat. M. Sfc. Jose Rodela was then called to the stage for the reading of the citation. Lt. Comdr. Hill read the citation, and the President presented the medal.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Before Jose returns to his seat, I just want to ask Santiago and Melvin to return to the stage, please. This is a remarkable moment. And as they come up, I'd like to recall&mdash;&mdash; <p>[<i>The President greeted S4 Erevia and Sfc. Morris as they returned to the stage.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> As they take their positions, I'd like to recall the words of a poet: <p>Though much is taken, much abides; and though <p>We are not now that strength which in old days <p>Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are; <p>One equal temper of heroic hearts, <p>Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will <p>To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield. <p>Santiago Erevia, Melvin Morris, Jose Rodela: In the thick of the fight, all those years ago, for your comrades and your country, you refused to yield. And on behalf of a grateful nation, we all want to thank you for inspiring us&mdash;then and now&mdash;with your strength, your will, and your heroic hearts. <p>Please give them a big round of applause. <p>Gentlemen, thank you. Please take your seats. We'll proceed with the rest of the ceremony. [<i>Medals were presented posthumously to the following individuals: S4 Leonard L. Alvarado, Sfc. Felix M. Conde-Falcon, S4 Ardie R. Copas, S4 Jesus S. Duran, Sgt. Candelario Garcia, Cpl. Joe R. Baldonado, Cpl. Victor H. Espinoza, Sgt. Eduardo C. Gomez, Pfc. Leonard M. Kravitz, Sgt. Juan E. Negron, M. Sgt. Mike C. Pena, Pvt. Demensio Rivera, Pvt. Miguel A. Vera, Sgt. Jack Weinstein, Pvt. Pedro Cano, Pvt. Joe Gandara, Pfc. Salvador J. Lara, Pfc. William F. Leonard, S. Sgt. Manuel V. Mendoza, Sgt. Alfred B. Nietzel, and 1st Lt. Donald K. Schwab. For each recipient, the citation was read, and the President then presented the medal to a surviving relative.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Ladies and gentlemen, it is very rare where we have the opportunity to reflect on the extraordinary courage and patriotism of such a remarkable collection of men. We are so grateful to them. We are so grateful to their families. It makes us proud, and it makes us inspired. And so, before we conclude the program, I would ask all those who have witnessed this extraordinary day to please rise and give these latest recipients of the Medal of Honor your warmest applause. <p>Chaplain, would you give us the benediction? <p>[<i>Maj. Gen. Donald L. Rutherford, USA, Army Chief of Chaplains, said a prayer.</i>] <p>Thank you so much, everybody. This concludes our program. But please have an opportunity to enjoy the White House. We are so grateful that all of you had a chance to come. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"57" "\"<i>The President.</i> Welcome to the White House. We are here to celebrate the life of an American hero. Cesar Chavez was a man who devoted this brief time that we have on Earth to making sure that this country lived up to some of its lofty ideals, the words of our founding, the idea that all of us are created equal; a man who organized others to widen the circle of opportunity not just for the people he knew, but for future generations. <p>And some of those future generations are here today. Cesar's son Paul is here. Some of his&mdash;there he is. I was looking for him. [<i>Laughter</i>] He's right there. Some of his children&mdash;some of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren are here. I did not have the honor of knowing Mr. Chavez, but I'd imagine that he'd be pretty proud to know that his granddaughter works in the White House. And not only does she know how to deliver an outstanding introduction&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but she also does just an extraordinary job carrying on his work organizing people, but now all across the country, to engage on issues that are of importance to all Americans. And Julie just does an extraordinary job. We're so proud of her. So thank you, Julie, for the great introduction. <p>A couple of other acknowledgements: I want to acknowledge an outstanding Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi. The great Dolores Huerta, our dear friend who cofounded the United Farm Workers along with Cesar. Rosario told me she is playing Dolores, and I thought I can see that; there's the same fire. I did have to say Rosario is a little taller. Just a little bit. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to thank the UFW's current president, Arturo Rodriguez, a great friend of ours. Thank you. And I want to thank Diego Luna and the entire cast of \\"Cesar Chavez.\\" The&mdash;I told him I loved \\"Y Tu Mam&aacute; Tambi&eacute;n.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] But we can't screen that at the White House. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's a great movie, but this is a little more family friendly here. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>This movie, this film tells the story of a man guided by an enormous faith: faith in a righteous cause and a loving God and the dignity of every human being. And it reminds us how, throughout our history, that faith has been tested and that it falls to ordinary Americans, ordinary people, to fight and restore that faith. <p>Cesar himself said that he spent his first 20 years working as an organizer without a single major victory. But he never gave up. He kept on going, and the world is a better place because he did. And that's one of the great lessons of his life. You don't give up the fight. No matter how long it takes, no matter how long the odds, you keep on going, fueled by a simple creed: <i>S&iacute;, se puede.</i> <p>Sometimes, people ask me&mdash;in fact, while we were backstage, somebody said, oh, you look pretty good. You look better than I expected. [<i>Laughter</i>] The implication being that there might be reason for me not to look good. [<i>Laughter</i>] But part of what sustains me and part of what I've said in the past&mdash;and some of you who have been in meetings with me and when we've experienced setbacks or frustrations on particular issues&mdash;I've tried to remind people, change is hard. It doesn't happen easily. It doesn't happen smoothly or painlessly. It happens because you put your shoulder behind the wheel and you keep on pushing. And then sometimes, it's going to roll back a little bit on you. And then you got to dig in, and you've got to push some more. <p>And Cesar Chavez understood that. You have to push, and you create this space. And sometimes, you won't even see all the victories that are achieved, but you've invested that time and that effort, and you've inspired others. And eventually, things change, and you pass the baton, and future generations then continue this process. <p>So we've got a lot of causes that are worth fighting for. We've got to keep fighting to make sure that every American has access to quality, affordable health care. We were very persistent about getting that website fixed. It's fixed now. [<i>Laughter</i>] And we've got more than 5 million people signed up. But we've got 2 more weeks to sign them up. So cuidadodesalud.gov&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;get on the website, spread the word. <p>We've got to keep fighting to make sure that our economy rewards the hard work of every American with a fair and living wage and equal pay for equal work. We've got to keep working to fix our broken immigration system. This is an example of where this is hard, but we've made progress, and we are going to get this done. This is going to happen. It's not a matter of if, just a matter of when. And I want it to happen now, so we are going to keep on pushing. <p>Mr. Chavez once said, \\"When you have people together who believe in something very strongly&mdash;whether it's religion or politics or unions&mdash;things happen.\\" And today, we've got labor leaders and CEOs and faith leaders and law enforcement, and they've come together, and they've said it's time to fix this broken immigration system. We've got Democrats and Republicans who have now passed in the Senate a comprehensive bill. And if we stay united, things will happen, things will get done. <p>And none of us can claim to know exactly what Cesar would have said about this fight or any other. But I do think he would want us to remember that the debates we have are less about policy than they are about people. They're about the lives of men and women and the young and not so young, who want nothing more than the chance to work hard, support their families, provide a future for their kids and their grandkids, earn their place in our American story. That's what this is all about. They're about our highest hopes and aspirations for this country that we love and the country that we leave for future generations. <p>As this film reminds us, that was the cause of Cesar Chavez's life, and I hope this afternoon, it's going to inspire all of us in the causes that we have to fight as well. <p>I cannot stay for the screening. I've been promised by our director that I'm&mdash;or producer or somebody is going to get me the CD. <p><i>Audience member.</i> DVD. <p><i>The President.</i> They're&mdash;whatever. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm a little technologically challenged. [<i>Laughter</i>] The DVD. [<i>Laughter</i>] The point is, I'm going to watch it this weekend. Michelle and the girls are on their way to China. It's very lonely at home, so nothing better than to see an inspiring film. And I'm really looking forward to seeing a chronicled life of one of my heroes and one of the people who inspired me to get into the work that I've gotten into. So thank you for sharing it with us. All right? <p>God bless. Thank you.\" "
"58" "\"Good morning, everybody. I wanted to provide an update on the situation in Ukraine and the steps that the United States is taking in response. <p>Over the last several days, we've continued to be deeply concerned by events in Ukraine. We've seen an illegal referendum in Crimea; an illegitimate move by the Russians to annex Crimea; and dangerous risks of escalation, including threats to Ukrainian personnel in Crimea and threats to southern and eastern Ukraine as well. These are all choices that the Russian Government has made, choices that have been rejected by the international community, as well as the Government of Ukraine. And because of these choices, the United States is today moving, as we said we would, to impose additional costs on Russia. <p>Based on the Executive order that I signed in response to Russia's initial intervention in Ukraine, we're imposing sanctions on more senior officials of the Russian Government. In addition, we are today sanctioning a number of other individuals with substantial resources and influence who provide material support to the Russian leadership, as well as a bank that provides material support to these individuals. <p>Now, we're taking these steps as part of our response to what Russia has already done in Crimea. At the same time, the world is watching with grave concern as Russia has positioned its military in a way that could lead to further incursions into southern and eastern Ukraine. For this reason, we've been working closely with our European partners to develop more severe actions that could be taken if Russia continues to escalate the situation. <p>As part of that process, I signed a new Executive order today that gives us the authority to impose sanctions not just on individuals, but on key sectors of the Russian economy. This is not our preferred outcome. These sanctions would not only have a significant impact on the Russian economy, but could also be disruptive to the global economy. However, Russia must know that further escalation will only isolate it further from the international community. The basic principles that govern relations between nations in Europe and around the world must be upheld in the 21st century. That includes respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, the notion that nations do not simply redraw borders or make decisions at the expense of their neighbors simply because they are larger or more powerful. <p>One of our other top priorities continues to be providing assistance to the Government of Ukraine so it can stabilize its economy and meet the basic needs of the Ukrainian people. As I travel to Europe next week to meet with the G-7 and other European and Asian allies, I once again urge Congress to pass legislation that is necessary to provide this assistance. And do it right away. Expressions of support are not enough. We need action. I also hope that the IMF moves swiftly to provide a significant package of support for Ukrainians as they pursue reforms. <p>In Europe, I'll also be reinforcing a message that Vice President Biden carried to Poland and the Baltic States this week: America's support for our NATO allies is unwavering. We're bound together by our profound Article 5 commitment to defend one another and by a set of shared values that so many generations sacrificed for. We've already increased our support for our Eastern European allies, and we will continue to strengthen NATO's collective defense, and we will step up our cooperation with Europe on economic and energy issues as well. Now, let me close by making a final point. Diplomacy between the United States and Russia continues. We've emphasized that Russia still has a different path available, one that deescalates the situation and one that involves Russia pursuing a diplomatic solution with the Government in Kiev, with the support of the international community. The Russian people need to know, and Mr. Putin needs to understand, that the Ukrainians shouldn't have to choose between the West and Russia. We want the Ukrainian people to determine their own destiny and to have good relations with the United States, with Russia, with Europe, with anyone that they choose. That can only happen if Russia also recognized the rights of all the Ukrainian people to determine their future as free individuals and as a sovereign nation, rights that people and nations around the world understand and support. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"59" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Valencia! Well, thank you so much. It is great to be back in Orlando. I'm glad some of you came to work while a lot of folks are pretending to work and watching&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;the tournament. I know there must be some Gators fans around here. They are an outstanding team. I put out my men's bracket. I've got them going to the Final Four. <p><i>Audience member.</i> They're going to win! <p><i>The President.</i> And they could win the whole thing, in which case, I won't win the billion dollars. [<i>Laughter</i>] You can only pick one winner. There are 63 colleges mad at me. [<i>Laughter</i>] But&mdash;so I understand there are some neighbors up the road in Gainesville who are not happy with me. [<i>Laughter</i>] There will be even more tomorrow when I release my women's bracket, because you can't please anybody. <p>But we've got some terrific elected officials here. I just want to, in particular, thank the mayor of Orlando, Buddy Dyer, who's been a great friend. And give him a big round of applause. And I want to thank the president of Valencia College, Sandy&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;where's Sandy? Sandy Shugart, there he is. We've got the president of the West Campus, who I just had an amazing conversation with, Falecia Williams. Where's Falecia? Right there. I want to thank everybody here at Valencia for having me. <p>A few years ago, I announced a new competition called the Aspen Prize to recognize exceptional community colleges, and lo and behold&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;your school, Valencia, was the very first school in the entire country to win this prize, and which&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. So between the students' hard work, the outstanding faculty, the administrators who are making sure everybody has what they need to succeed, Valencia graduates are leaving here ready for a career, ready to continue their education, ready to pursue their dreams, wherever they may lead. <p>And so this college represents what's best in America: the idea that here in this country, if you work hard, you can get ahead. And restoring that opportunity for every American, that's been our driving focus as a country. That's driven everything I've done since I came into office. <p>And today, we're at a moment when, after the first&mdash;after the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes, after just some devastating losses that people had&mdash;and their homes or their retirement accounts or their jobs&mdash;now we've seen businesses creating 8.7 million new jobs over the past 4 years. American manufacturers are adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s. In American energy, we're producing more oil here at home than we buy from other countries for the first time in two decades. We're generating more renewable energy. The housing market is rebounding, including here in Florida. Our high school graduation rate is the highest on record. [<i>Applause</i>] Absolutely. More young people are earning college degrees than ever before. <p>So even as we are digging ourselves out of the economic hole that we were in back in 2008, we've also worked to lay a new foundation for America's future growth. Now, here's the problem though. There are a bunch of good things happening, the economy is starting to grow, but some of the trends that have really battered middle class families and people who are working hard to get into the middle class for decades, those have not yet gotten better. Folks at the top are doing better than ever, but over the past 4 years, average wages have barely budged. So you've got too many Americans who are working harder than ever just to keep up. <p>And it's our job to reverse those trends. We've got to build an economy that works for everybody, not just for a few. We've got to restore opportunity for all people, the basic idea that no matter where you started, no matter what you look like, if you work hard, you can get ahead. America has got to be a place where, if you're responsible and you apply yourself, you can make it. <p>So what we've focused on is an opportunity agenda that has four parts. Part one is more good jobs that pay good wages, whether it's in manufacturing, in energy, in innovation and technology, in the service industries. And one of the things we've done in Orlando is focus on growing tourism. And Buddy knows this. Two years ago, I came here to announce an Executive order to track more foreign tourists to the United States, and last year spending by foreign tourists was up almost 10 percent. That is a huge boost to Florida. We've got to keep on taking those kinds of steps. <p>Part two of our opportunity agenda: We've got to train more Americans with the skills that they need to fill the jobs that are actually out there, not just today, but also tomorrow. <p>Part three you know something about: We've got to make sure every young person has access to a world-class education, from high-quality preschool for every 4-year-old to an affordable college education for all you striving young people. <p>And part four is making sure that our economy rewards the hard work of every American with wages that you can live on, savings you can retire on, health care that's there when you need it. <p>And in pursuit of this opportunity agenda, I'm going to work with Congress wherever I can. But Congress doesn't always&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;move the way we'd like, and so we're calling this a year of action. Wherever I see a chance to go ahead and expand opportunity for more Americans, I'm going to take it. I'm not going to wait for Congress. We've just got to go ahead and get it done. <p>I'll give you a couple of examples. In the past few weeks, I've used my executive authority to require Federal contractors to pay their employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour to make sure that folks, if they're working full time, aren't living in poverty. I've signed another Executive order to make sure that they're actually paid the overtime that they've earned, because everybody who works hard deserves that chance to get ahead. And if you work more, you should get paid a little more. <p>As part of making sure our economy rewards the hard work of every American, I'm also coming here today to make sure that our economy rewards the hard work of women. Now, I just want to be clear, I've got nothing against you men. [<i>Laughter</i>] We're working hard to make sure that you're doing the right thing too and that you're getting opportunity as well. But I've got a personal stake in seeing women get ahead. <p>First of all, women make up 80 percent of my household&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;if you count my mother-in-law. And I always count my mother-in-law. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I also personally know the challenges that women face in our economy, and there are some particular challenges that women face. I grew up the son of a single mom who struggled to put herself through school and make ends meet and raise my sister and me the right way. And she couldn't have done it if it weren't for my grandparents. And the most important breadwinner in my family was my grandmother, who worked her way up from being a secretary to being a vice president of a bank&mdash;never got a college degree&mdash;but then hit a glass ceiling at that local bank where she worked. So she'd train men to eventually be her boss, even though she knew a lot more than they did. <p>When Michelle and I had our girls, we gave everything we had to try to balance raising a family and chasing careers. But I'll be honest with you, it was harder for her than it was for me. Because when she was with the girls, she'd feel guilty about, am I doing everything I need to be doing on the job. When she was at work, she'd feel bad about, are the girls missing me, and I know Barack is messing up somehow. [<i>Laughter</i>] So she's calling to check. <p>And so today, obviously, we're lucky, and Michelle and I usually get to have dinner with the girls every night, and they're doing great. And the highlight of every day for me is sitting with them at the dinner table. And I want to make sure my daughters are getting the same chances as men. I don't want them paid less for doing the same job as some guy is doing. When they have children, I want to make sure that they're not having to quit their jobs or in some other fashion be hampered because we don't have the kinds of policies in this country that support them. <p>My point is&mdash;and I'm saying now to the men&mdash;we've all got a stake in this. Women make up about half of our workforce. Over half of Valencia's students, 56 percent, are women. In fact, for more than two decades, women have earned over half of the higher education degrees awarded in this country. So that means soon, for the first time, America's highly educated workforce will be made up of more women than men. <p>But the thing is, our economy hasn't caught up to that reality yet. So we've got too many women who work hard to support themselves and their families, including the 20 percent of women enrolled in college who are trying to raise kids while earning a degree, and they're facing unfair choices or outdated workplace policies that are holding them back. That has to change, because it holds all of us back. <p>When women make less than men, that hurts their families, including their partners, their husbands, their kids. They've got less to get by on. It hurts businesses because now they&mdash;their customers have less to spend. When a job doesn't offer adequate family leave to care for a new baby or an ailing parent, that burdens men and children. When any of our citizens can't fulfill their potential for any reason that doesn't have to do with their talent or their character or their work ethic, well, that's holding us back. We do better when everybody participates, when everybody's talents are put to use, everybody has a fair shot. <p>And I had a wonderful conversation before I came out here with Carolyn, and we had a group of other women, including Dr. Williams, and you should just have heard these stories. I mean, I don't know if Dr. Williams has shared her story, but her mom was blind and raised her, a single mom. And she had to go to school and get a job, and when her child was born prematurely, her blind mother comes down to provide childcare because that's the only way you could manage it. <p>You had another young woman describing what it's like when you've got two&mdash;you've got twins, preemie babies, and she's having to quit her job because there's no childcare available, and how she needed WIC and other programs to support her even though she had a loving husband who was helping out. <p>So this is a family agenda. But it starts with making sure every woman is getting a fair shot. It's time for a woman's economic agenda that grows our economy for everybody. Now, that begins with making sure women receive equal pay for equal work. This is a really simple principle. This should not be confusing. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's not that complicated. <p>Today, more women are their family's main breadwinner than ever before. But on average, women are still earning just 77 cents on every dollar that a man does. Women with college degrees may earn hundreds of thousands of dollars less over the course of her career than a man at the same educational level. And that's wrong. This isn't 1958, it's 2014. That's why the first bill I signed into law was called the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, and it made sure that it was easier for women to sue if they weren't being paid the same as men. <p>And in the coming weeks, Congress will have a chance to go even further by voting yes or no on what's called the Paycheck Fairness Act. Right now a majority of the Senators support that bill, but so far, Republicans have blocked it. We've got to get them to change their minds and join us in this century&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;because a woman deserves equal pay for equal work. It's pretty straightforward. <p>And Congress should not stop there. A woman deserves workplace policies that protect her right to have a baby without losing her job. It's pretty clear that if men were having babies&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;we'd have different policies. Right? I mean, we know that; that's for certain. A woman deserves to take a day off to care for a sick child or a parent without running into hardship. <p>So Congress needs to act so that Americans join every other advanced nation on Earth by offering paid leave to folks who work hard every day. It's time to do away with some of these workplace policies that belong in a \\"Mad Men\\" episode. [<i>Laughter</i>] We've got to make sure that every woman has the opportunities that she deserves, because when women succeed, America succeeds. I truly believe that. <p>And on the ride over here, we were talking about some of the best practices of companies that are highly successful. It turns out that if you give families&mdash;you give your workers some flexibility so that if they've got a sick child or a sick parent, they can have a little time off, that those employees are more productive, the companies do better, you have less turnover. So it's good business practice. It's the right thing to do. <p>At a time when women hold the majority of low-wage jobs, Congress is going to get a chance to vote yes or no on whether millions of women who work hard all day deserve a raise. There's a bill before Congress that would raise the Federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. That would lift wages for nearly 28 million Americans across the country. And again, it would be good for business. Because what happens is more customers have more money to spend. It will grow the economy for everybody. It's time for Congress to join the rest of the country. It's time for&mdash;we're calling it the 10-10 campaign. Give America a raise. And that, in particular, will help the disproportionate number of women who are in lower wage jobs. <p>And on each of these issues, Members of Congress will have to choose between helping women and families get ahead or holding them back. Part of our challenge is fewer than 20 [percent of; White House correction.] seats in Congress are held by women. I think we're all clear that Congress would get more done if you kind of evened that out a little bit. I'm pretty confident about that. <p>But in the meantime, we're going to keep making the case as to why these policies are the right ones for working families and for businesses. So over the next few months, my administration is going to host a series of roundtable discussions like the one I had in different parts of the country just to hear stories about issues like workplace flexibility and opening up new leadership opportunities for women. And it's all going to lead up to the first-ever White House Summit on Working Families that we're going to be holding this summer. And maybe some of you will participate, because we want to hear your stories. <p>Now, let me close by mentioning one last policy that's benefiting millions of women right now, and that is the Affordable Care Act. I know there's a lot of politics around it. I know there are a lot of TV ads around that don't always accurately reflect what's going on. But right now, despite the fact that the website was really bad for the first month&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;it's now fixed&mdash;more than 5 million Americans have signed up for plans at healthcare.gov. More than 5 million. More than 3 million young people have gained coverage because this law lets you stay on your parent's plan until you turn 26. So I'll bet there are some young people right now who have health insurance in this auditorium because of the law. <p>And thanks to this law, no American&mdash;zero&mdash;can ever again be denied health insurance because of a preexisting condition. Not to mention, no woman can ever again be charged more for just being a woman. <p>Now, this is something that people don't realize. Before we passed Obamacare, it was routine for insurance companies to charge women significantly more than men for health insurance. It's just like the drycleaners. [<i>Laughter</i>] You send in a blouse, I send in a shirt, they charge you twice as much. [<i>Laughter</i>] But the same thing was happening in health insurance. And so we've banned that policy for everybody, not just folks who were getting health insurance on the exchange. But if you were getting health insurance on the job, they can't discriminate against women in that same fashion. Not to mention tens of millions of women have gained access to free preventive care like mammograms and contraceptive care. The point is, no woman should have to put off the potentially lifesaving care she needs just because money is tight. <p>And in the roundtable I just had, there were at least three, four folks in that roundtable&mdash;the majority of the women I just talked to&mdash;had an instance in their lives where either because of a sick child or a premature baby or an ailing parent, they would be bankrupt had they not had health insurance. Broke. So when you hear folks talking about Obamacare and I'm not using it because I've got health insurance or I'm healthy, well, yes, you don't need health insurance until you need health insurance. [<i>Laughter</i>] It seems like a drag until you actually confront what life does to all of us at some point. Some unexpected thing happens, and you want to make sure that you've got that support. <p>Now, none of that has stopped Republicans from Congress from spending the last few years not focused on legislation to create jobs or raise wages or help more young people afford college. They've taken 50 votes to try to repeal or undermine this law&mdash;50. You know what they say, the 50th time is the charm. [<i>Laughter</i>] Fifty times. And it's not just to try to improve the law or here's a particular problem. No, we just want to scrap it so that millions of people who now have health insurance, we want them to go back to not having health insurance. <p>Well, that's not going to happen. They can keep wasting their time repealing&mdash;trying to repeal the ACA; we're going to keep working to make this law work better because every person and every woman deserves to control her own health care choices, not her boss, not her insurer, surely not Congress. <p>So there's an important deadline coming up, by the way. This is now the last call for 2014. If you've been thinking about buying one of the new plans on healthcare.gov&mdash;and a large proportion of people, the majority, in fact, may be able to buy health insurance for as little as a hundred bucks or less a month, less than your cable or your cell phone bill. I saw everybody had a cell phone. [<i>Laughter</i>] But the deadline to get covered this year is March 31, which is just 11 days away. So if you are uninsured, check out your new choices at healthcare.gov. Many of you will be able to get covered for a hundred dollars a month or less. If you're already covered, then help get a friend covered, because that's part of what America is about: taking responsibility for working to achieve our own dreams; also coming together to help our fellow citizens pursue and secure their own dreams as well. <p>There are just such amazing stories of the women that I talked with before I came out here. Every one of them, at some point, had made a major sacrifice on behalf of their families. One woman had a severely autistic son, took 12 years off to raise her three kids, including this son, before now going back to school and being able to teach once again. Just like my mom. Just like my grandma. I didn't fully appreciate at the time the sacrifice they were making. I was talking about how I used to complain to my mom when she was going to school and working, why are we eating the same thing every night? [<i>Laughter</i>] Because she was doing so much and then coming home and still taking the time to make sure that I had a decent meal. <p>That's what built this country, those kinds of sacrifices. And we've got to make sure that we as a country are helping people who are so courageous and so brave and working so hard, all those moms and grandmas and young women like Carolyn who are trying to start their own businesses. <p>We've come a long way together over these past 5 years, but we've got to do more to restore opportunity for everybody. Whether you're a man or a woman, whether you are Black, White, Latino, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, with or without a disability, all of us have something to offer. All of us have a place in this American story. And as long as I have the privilege of being President, I'm going to keep working to make sure every single one of us have a chance to succeed. Or as you say here at Valencia, \\"We Say You Can.\\" <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\" "
"60" "\"<i>Dorood.</i> As you and your families gather around the Nowruz table, I want to extend my best wishes on this new spring and new year. As always, this holiday is a chance to give gratitude for your blessings and to reflect on our hopes for the year ahead. <p>As I have every year as President, I want to take this opportunity to speak directly to the people and leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Since taking office, I've offered the Iranian Government an opportunity: If it meets its international obligations, then there could be a new relationship between our two countries, and Iran could begin to return to its rightful place among the community of nations. <p>Last year, you, the Iranian people, made your voice heard when you elected Dr. Hassan Rouhani as your new President. During his campaign, he pledged to strengthen Iran's economy, improve the lives of the Iranian people, and engage constructively with the international community, and he was elected with your strong support. <p>Last fall, I spoke with President Rouhani. It was the first conversation between an American President and an Iranian leader since 1979. I conveyed to President Rouhani my deep respect for the Iranian people, just as he expressed his respect for the American people. And I told him that I firmly believe that we can address the serious disagreements between our governments, reduce distrust, and begin to move beyond our difficult history. <p>Since then, we've made progress. For years, the international community has had concerns that Iran's nuclear program could lead to Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon, which would be a threat to the region and to the world. Under the initial agreement we reached in November, the Iranian Government has agreed to limit key parts of its nuclear program. Along with our international partners, the United States is giving Iran some relief from sanctions. Now we're engaged in intensive negotiations in the hopes of finding a comprehensive solution that resolves the world's concerns with the Iranian nuclear program. <p>As I've said before, I'm under no illusions. This will be difficult. But I'm committed to diplomacy because I believe there is the basis for a practical solution. Iran's highest officials, including Supreme Leader Khamenei, have said that Iran is not developing nuclear weapons. So there is a chance to reach an agreement if Iran takes meaningful and verifiable steps to assure the world that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only. Iran would have access to peaceful nuclear energy. And we will have addressed&mdash;peacefully, with diplomacy&mdash;one of the greatest challenges to international peace and security. <p>A comprehensive agreement on the nuclear issue&mdash;and an Iran that upholds universal rights at home and abroad&mdash;would help move Iran along the new path that so many Iranians seek. After all, throughout your history, the talents and genius of the Iranian people have led to great achievements in literature and the arts, science and technology. But the economic hardship that so many Iranians have endured in recent years&mdash;because of the choices of Iranian leaders&mdash;has deprived your country and the world of the extraordinary skills and contributions you have to offer. And you deserve better. <p>If Iran meets its international obligations, we know where the path of dialogue and greater trust and cooperation can lead. It will mean more opportunities for Iranians to trade and forge ties with the rest of the world. It means more economic growth and jobs for Iranians, especially young Iranians who dream of making their mark in the world. It will mean more opportunities for Iranian students to travel abroad and build new partnerships that help you realize your incredible potential. In short, real diplomatic progress this year can help open up new possibilities and prosperity for the Iranian people for years to come. <p>That's the message the Iranian people sent at the ballot box last year. I hope that the entire Iranian Government hears that message too. Because for the first time in many years, we have the opportunity to start down a new path. And if Iran seizes this moment, this Nowruz could mark not just the beginning of a new year, but a new chapter in the history of Iran and its role in the world, including a better relationship with the United States and the American people, rooted in mutual interest and mutual respect. <p>Thank you, and <i>Eid-eh Shoma Mobarak.</i>\" "
"61" "\"Hi, everybody. This week, I visited a community college in Florida, where I spoke with students about what we need to do to make sure our economy rewards the hard work of every American. More specifically, I spoke about making sure our economy rewards the hard work of women.<p>Today, women make up about half of our workforce and more than half of our college graduates. More women are now their family's main breadwinner than ever before.<p>But in a lot of ways, our economy hasn't caught up to this new reality yet. On average, a woman still earns just 77 cents for every dollar a man does. And too many women face outdated workplace policies that hold them back, which in turn holds back our families and our entire economy.<p>A woman deserves to earn equal pay for equal work and paid leave that lets you take a day off to care for a sick child or parent. Congress needs to act on these priorities.<p>And when women hold most lower wage jobs in America, Congress needs to raise the minimum wage. Because no woman who works full time should ever have to raise her children in poverty.<p>Now, the good news is that in the year since I first called on Congress to raise the minimum wage, six States have passed laws to raise theirs. More States, counties, and cities are working to raise their minimum wages as we speak. Small businesses like St. Louis-based Pi Pizzeria are raising their wages too, not out of charity, but because it's good for business. And Pi, by the way, makes a really good pizza. In this year of action, I've signed an Executive order requiring Federal contractors to pay their employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour.<p>But if we're truly going to reward the hard work of every American, Congress needs to join the rest of the country and pass a bill that would lift the Federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. This wouldn't just raise wages for minimum wage workers, its effects would lift wages for nearly 28 million Americans across this country. It will give businesses more customers with more money to spend and grow the economy for everybody. So call up your Member of Congress and let them know it's time for \\"10–10.\\" It's time to give America a raise.<p>A true opportunity agenda is one that works for working women. Because when women succeed, America succeeds. We do better when everyone participates and when everyone who works hard has the chance to get ahead. That's what opportunity means, and it's why I'll keep fighting to restore it.<p>Thanks, everybody, and have a great weekend.\" "
"62" "\"Well, thank you very much, Mark. Let me begin just by saying that&mdash;to Prime Minister Rutte and all the people here in the Netherlands who were involved in organizing this summit, you did an extraordinary job. And I think we would all agree that this was as well designed and well executed as any international summit that we've attended. And so we're very grateful, and you've set a high bar for the work that needs to be done in Chicago. <p>Two things I want to do is, is number one, just remind everybody what has been accomplished. In previous summits, as a consequence of the work that's been done collectively, 12 countries and 2 dozen nuclear facilities around the world have rid themselves entirely of highly enriched uranium and plutonium. Dozens of nations have boosted security at their nuclear storage sites, built their own countersmuggling teams, or created new centers to improve nuclear security and training. The IAEA is stronger. More countries have ratified the treaties and international partnerships at the heart of our efforts. <p>And at this particular summit, we've seen such steps as Belgium and Italy completing the removal of their excess supplies of highly enriched uranium and plutonium so that those supplies can be eliminated. In a major commitment, Japan announced that it will work with the United States to eliminate hundreds of kilograms of weapons-usable nuclear material from one of their experimental reactors, which would be enough for a dozen nuclear weapons. Dozens of other nations have agreed to take specific steps towards improving nuclear security in their own countries and to support global efforts. <p>So what's been valuable about this summit is that it has not just been talk, it's been action. And that is because of the leadership that has been shown by heads and state&mdash;of government and heads of government that have participated in this effort, as well as the extraordinary work of Foreign Ministers and sherpas and others who have helped to move this process forward. <p>I'm looking forward to hosting all of you in the United States in 2016. We had a good discussion this afternoon about how we should conceive of this summit 2 years from now. The consensus, based on what I heard, was that we should recognize this next summit will be a transition summit in which heads of state and government are still participating, but that we are shifting towards a more sustainable model that utilizes our ministers, our technical people, and we are building some sort of architecture that can effectively focus and implement on these issues and supplement the good work that is being done by the IAEA and others. <p>So I see two tasks before us over the next 2 years. Number one is, we have to set very clearly what are the actionable items that we've already identified that we know can get done if we have the political will to do them, and let's go ahead and get them done so that in 2016 we can report out that we have made extraordinary progress and achieved many of the benchmarks and targets that we had set at the very first Nuclear Security Summit. In other words, I think it is important for us not to relax, but rather, accelerate our efforts over the next 2 years, sustain momentum so that we finish strong in 2016. And I&mdash;my team will be contacting all of you to find out specific ways in which you think we can move the ball forward over the next 2 years. The second thing we'll be doing is soliciting ideas from each of you about the ultimate architecture that should be constructed to ensure that beyond 2016 we are able to keep this process alive and effective and that we are able to sync up the efforts of the Nuclear Security Summit with existing institutions like the IAEA, Interpol, the United Nations, some of the treaties that are already in force. <p>All of you have important views on that, and we're going to want to make sure that you provide them so that by the time we get to 2016, we have a well-thought-out process that can be ratified at that meeting. <p>So I cannot thank you enough for the extraordinary efforts that all of you have already made. I cannot guarantee that the videos will be as good at the Washington conference as they have been here. We may not be as creative and imaginative as Mark and his team have been. But I promise you that we will continue to stay focused on this very important issue, and we look forward to your contributions in 2016 in the United States. <p>Thank you very much, Mark. <p><i>Prime Minister Rutte</i>. We can now officially hand over the chair of the NSS, sir. <p><i>President Obama. </i>Here we go. All right. <p><i>Prime Minister Rutte</i>. But you can see there's missing parts in all of yesterday. And now it's again missing. <p><i>President Obama.</i> Okay. I just want to make sure this is not radioactive. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>[At this point, Prime Minister Rutte symbolically handed over the Nuclear Security Summit chairmanship to President Obama.] </i><p><i>Prime Minister Rutte</i>. No, no, no. It is not. [<i>Inaudible</i>] Good luck.\" "
"63" "\"Thank you. Please, please have a seat. Good evening. <i>Goede avond. Bonsoir. Guten abend.</i> Thank you, Laura, for that remarkable introduction on&mdash;before she came out she told me not to be nervous. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I can only imagine&mdash;I think her father is in the audience, and I can only imagine how proud he is of her. We're grateful for her work, but she's also reminding us that our future will be defined by young people like her. <p>Your Majesties, Mr. Prime Minister, and the people of Belgium: On behalf of the American people, we are grateful for your friendship. We stand together as inseparable allies, and I thank you for your wonderful hospitality. I have to admit, it is easy to love a country famous for chocolate and beer. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Leaders and dignitaries of the European Union, representatives of our NATO alliance, distinguished guests: We meet here at a moment of testing for Europe and the United States and for the international order that we have worked for generations to build. <p>Throughout human history, societies have grappled with fundamental questions of how to organize themselves, the proper relationship between the individual and the state, the best means to resolve inevitable conflicts between states. And it was here in Europe, through centuries of struggle&mdash;through war and Enlightenment, repression and revolution&mdash;that a particular set of ideals began to emerge: the belief that, through conscience and free will, each of us has the right to live as we choose; the belief that power is derived from the consent of the governed and that laws and institutions should be established to protect that understanding. And those ideas eventually inspired a band of colonialists across an ocean, and they wrote them into the founding documents that still guide America today, including the simple truth that all men&mdash;and women&mdash;are created equal. <p>But those ideals have also been tested, here in Europe and around the world. Those ideals have often been threatened by an older, more traditional view of power. This alternative vision argues that ordinary men and women are too small-minded to govern their own affairs, that order and progress can only come when individuals surrender their rights to an all-powerful sovereign. Often, this alternative vision roots itself in the notion that, by virtue of race or faith or ethnicity, some are inherently superior to others, and that individual identity must be defined by \\"us\\" versus \\"them,\\" or that national greatness must flow not by what a people stand for, but what they are against. <p>In so many ways, the history of Europe in the 20th century represented the ongoing clash of these two sets of ideas, both within nations and among nations. The advance of industry and technology outpaced our ability to resolve our differences peacefully, and even among the most civilized of societies on the surface, we saw a descent into barbarism. <p>This morning, at Flanders Field, I was reminded of how war between peoples sent a generation to their deaths in the trenches and gas of the First World War. And just two decades later, extreme nationalism plunged this continent into war once again, with populations enslaved and great cities reduced to rubble and tens of millions slaughtered, including those lost in the Holocaust. It is in response to this tragic history that, in the aftermath of World War II, America joined with Europe to reject the darker forces of the past and built a new architecture of peace. Workers and engineers gave life to the Marshall plan. Sentinels stood vigilant in a NATO alliance that would become the strongest the world has ever known. And across the Atlantic, we embraced a shared vision of Europe, a vision based on representative democracy, individual rights, and a belief that nations can meet the interests of their citizens through trade and open markets, a social safety net, respect for those of different faiths and backgrounds. <p>For decades, this vision stood in sharp contrast to life on the other side of an Iron Curtain. For decades, a contest was waged, and ultimately, that contest was won not by tanks or missiles, but because our ideals stirred the hearts of Hungarians who sparked a revolution, Poles in their shipyards who stood in Solidarity, Czechs who waged a Velvet Revolution without firing a shot, and East Berliners who marched past the guards and finally tore down that wall. <p>Today, what would have seemed impossible in the trenches of Flanders, the rubble of Berlin, a dissident's prison cell&mdash;that reality is taken for granted: a Germany unified, the nations of Central and Eastern Europe welcomed into the family of democracies. Here in this country, once the battleground of Europe, we meet in the hub of a union that brings together age-old adversaries in peace and cooperation. The people of Europe, hundreds of millions of citizens&mdash;east, west, north, south&mdash;are more secure and more prosperous because we stood together for the ideals we share. <p>And this story of human progress was by no means limited to Europe. Indeed, the ideals that came to define our alliance also inspired movements across the globe, among those very people, ironically, who had too often been denied their full rights by Western powers. After the Second World War, people from Africa to India threw off the yoke of colonialism to secure their independence. In the United States, citizens took freedom rides and endured beatings to put an end to segregation and to secure their civil rights. As the Iron Curtain fell here in Europe, the iron fist of apartheid was unclenched, and Nelson Mandela emerged upright, proud, from prison to lead a multiracial democracy. Latin American nations rejected dictatorship and built new democracies, and Asian nations showed that development and democracy could go hand in hand. <p>The young people in the audience today&mdash;young people like Laura, were born in a place and a time where there is less conflict, more prosperity, and more freedom than any time in human history. But that's not because man's darkest impulses have vanished. Even here, in Europe, we've seen ethnic cleansing in the Balkans that shocked the conscience. <p>The difficulties of integration and globalization, recently amplified by the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes, strained the European project and stirred the rise of a politics that too often targets immigrants or gays or those who seem somehow different. <p>While technology has opened up vast opportunities for trade and innovation and cultural understanding, it's also allowed terrorists to kill on a horrifying scale. Around the world, sectarian warfare and ethnic conflicts continue to claim thousands of lives. And once again, we are confronted with the belief among some that bigger nations can bully smaller ones to get their way, that recycled maxim that might somehow makes right. <p>So I come here today to insist that we must never take for granted the progress that has been won here in Europe and advanced around the world, because the contest of ideas continues for your generation. And that's what's at stake in Ukraine today. Russia's leadership is challenging truths that only a few weeks ago seemed self-evident: that in the 21st century, the borders of Europe cannot be redrawn with force; that international law matters; that people and nations can make their own decisions about their future. <p>To be honest, if we defined our interests narrowly, if we applied a cold-hearted calculus, we might decide to look the other way. Our economy is not deeply integrated with Ukraine's. Our people and our homeland face no direct threat from the invasion of Crimea. Our own borders are not threatened by Russia's annexation. But that kind of casual indifference would ignore the lessons that are written in the cemeteries of this continent. It would allow the old way of doing things to regain a foothold in this young century. And that message would be heard not just in Europe, but in Asia, in the Americas, in Africa, and the Middle East. <p>And the consequences that would arise from complacency are not abstractions. The impact that they have on the lives of real people&mdash;men and women just like us&mdash;have to enter into our imaginations. Just look at the young people of Ukraine who were determined to take back their future from a government rotted by corruption, the portraits of the fallen shot by snipers, the visitors who pay their respects at the Maidan. There was the university student, wrapped in the Ukrainian flag, expressing her hope that \\"every country should live by the law.\\" A postgraduate student, speaking of her fellow protestors, saying, \\"I want these people who are here to have dignity.\\" Imagine that you are the young woman who said, \\"There are some things that fear, police sticks, and tear gas cannot destroy.\\" <p>We've never met these people, but we know them. Their voices echo calls for human dignity that rang out in European streets and squares for generations. Their voices echo those around the world who at this very moment fight for their dignity. These Ukrainians rejected a government that was stealing from the people instead of serving them and are reaching for the same ideals that allow us to be here today. <p>None of us can know for certain what the coming days will bring in Ukraine, but I am confident that eventually, those voices&mdash;those voices for human dignity and opportunity and individual rights and rule of law&mdash;those voices ultimately will triumph. I believe that over the long haul, as nations that are free, as free people, the future is ours. I believe this not because I'm naive, and I believe this not because of the strength of our arms or the size of our economies, I believe this because these ideals that we affirm are true, these ideals are universal. <p>Yes, we believe in democracy, with elections that are free and fair, and independent judiciaries and opposition parties, civil society and uncensored information so that individuals can make their own choices. Yes, we believe in open economies based on free markets and innovation and individual initiative and entrepreneurship and trade and investment that creates a broader prosperity. And yes, we believe in human dignity: that every person is created equal, no matter who you are or what you look like or who you love or where you come from. That is what we believe. That's what makes us strong. <p>And our enduring strength is also reflected in our respect for an international system that protects the rights of both nations and people: a United Nations and a Universal Declaration of Human Rights; international law and the means to enforce those laws. But we also know that those rules are not self-executing; they depend on people and nations of goodwill continually affirming them. And that's why Russia's violation of international law&mdash;its assault on Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity&mdash;must be met with condemnation. Not because we're trying to keep Russia down, but because the principles that have meant so much to Europe and the world must be lifted up. Over the last several days, the United States, Europe, and our partners around the world have been united in defense of these ideals and united in support of the Ukrainian people. Together, we've condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine and rejected the legitimacy of the Crimean referendum. Together, we have isolated Russia politically, suspending it from the G-8 nations and downgrading our bilateral ties. Together, we are imposing costs through sanctions that have left a mark on Russia and those accountable for its actions. And if the Russian leadership stays on its current course, together, we will ensure that this isolation deepens. Sanctions will expand. And the toll on Russia's economy, as well as its standing in the world, will only increase. <p>And meanwhile, the United States and our allies will continue to support the Government of Ukraine as they chart a democratic course. Together, we are going to provide a significant package of assistance that can help stabilize the Ukrainian economy and meet the basic needs of the people. Make no mistake: Neither the United States nor Europe has any interest in controlling Ukraine. We have sent no troops there. What we want is for the Ukrainian people to make their own decisions, just like other free people around the world. <p>Understand, as well, this is not another cold war that we're entering into. After all, unlike the Soviet Union, Russia leads no bloc of nations, no global ideology. The United States and NATO do not seek any conflict with Russia. In fact, for more than 60 years, we have come together in NATO, not to claim other lands, but to keep nations free. What we will do&mdash;always&mdash;is uphold our solemn obligation, our Article 5 duty to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our allies. And in that promise, we will never waver; NATO nations never stand alone. <p>Today, NATO planes patrol the skies over the Baltics, and we've reinforced our presence in Poland. And we're prepared to do more. Going forward, every NATO member state must step up and carry its share of the burden by showing the political will to invest in our collective defense and by developing the capabilities to serve as a source of international peace and security. <p>Of course, Ukraine is not a member of NATO, in part because of its close and complex history with Russia. Nor will Russia be dislodged from Crimea or deterred from further escalation by military force. But with time, so long as we remain united, the Russian people will recognize that they cannot achieve security, prosperity, and the status that they seek through brute force. That's why, throughout this crisis, we will combine our substantial pressure on Russia with an open door for diplomacy. I believe that, for both Ukraine and Russia, a stable peace will come through deescalation: direct dialogue between Russia and the Government of Ukraine and the international community, monitors who can ensure that the rights of all Ukrainians are protected, a process of constitutional reform within Ukraine, and free and fair elections this spring. <p>So far, Russia has resisted diplomatic overtures, annexing Crimea and massing large forces along Ukraine's border. Russia has justified these actions as an effort to prevent problems on its own borders and to protect ethnic Russians inside Ukraine. Of course, there is no evidence&mdash;never has been&mdash;of systemic violence against ethnic Russians inside of Ukraine. Moreover, many countries around the world face similar questions about their borders and ethnic minorities abroad, about sovereignty and self-determination. These are tensions that have led in other places to debate and democratic referendums, conflicts and uneasy coexistence. These are difficult issues, and it is precisely because these questions are hard that they must be <p>addressed through constitutional means and international laws so that majorities cannot simply suppress minorities and big countries cannot simply bully the small. <p>In defending its actions, Russian leaders have further claimed Kosovo as a precedent, an example they say of the West interfering in the affairs of a smaller country, just as they're doing now. But NATO only intervened after the people of Kosovo were systematically brutalized and killed for years. And Kosovo only left Serbia after a referendum was organized not outside the boundaries of international law, but in careful cooperation with the United Nations and with Kosovo's neighbors. None of that even came close to happening in Crimea. <p>Moreover, Russia has pointed to America's decision to go into Iraq as an example of Western hypocrisy. Now, it is true that the Iraq war was a subject of vigorous debate not just around the world, but in the United States as well. I participated in that debate, and I opposed our military intervention there. But even in Iraq, America sought to work within the international system. We did not claim or annex Iraq's territory. We did not grab its resources for our own gain. Instead, we ended our war and left Iraq to its people and a fully sovereign Iraqi state that could make decisions about its own future. <p>Of course, neither the United States nor Europe are perfect in adherence to our ideals, nor do we claim to be the sole arbiter of what is right or wrong in the world. We are human, after all, and we face difficult decisions about how to exercise our power. But part of what makes us different is that we welcome criticism, just as we welcome the responsibilities that come with global leadership. <p>We look to the east and the south and see nations poised to play a growing role on the world stage, and we consider that a good thing. It reflects the same diversity that makes us stronger as a nation and the forces of integration and cooperation that Europe has advanced for decades. And in a world of challenges that are increasingly global, all of us have an interest in nations stepping forward to play their part, to bear their share of the burden, and to uphold international norms. <p>So our approach stands in stark contrast to the arguments coming out of Russia these days. It is absurd to suggest&mdash;as a steady drumbeat of Russian voices do&mdash;that America is somehow conspiring with Fascists inside of Ukraine or failing to respect the Russian people. My grandfather served in Patton's army, just as many of your fathers and grandfathers fought against fascism. We Americans remember well the unimaginable sacrifices made by the Russian people in World War II, and we have honored those sacrifices. <p>Since the end of the cold war, we have worked with Russia under successive administrations to build ties of culture and commerce and international community, not as a favor to Russia, but because it was in our national interests. And together, we've secured nuclear materials from terrorists. We welcomed Russia into the G-8 and the World Trade Organization. From the reduction of nuclear arms to the elimination of Syria's chemical weapons, we believe the world has benefited when Russia chooses to cooperate on the basis of mutual interests and mutual respect. <p>So America, and the world and Europe, has an interest in a strong and responsible Russia, not a weak one. We want the Russian people to live in security, prosperity, and dignity like everyone else, proud of their own history. But that does not mean that Russia can run roughshod over its neighbors. Just because Russia has a deep history with Ukraine does not mean it should be able to dictate Ukraine's future. No amount of propaganda can make right something that the world knows is wrong. In the end, every society must chart its own course. America's path or Europe's path is not the only ways to reach freedom and justice. But on the fundamental principle that is at stake here&mdash;the ability of nations and peoples to make their own choices&mdash;there can be no going back. It's not America that filled the Maidan with protesters, it was Ukrainians. No foreign forces compelled the citizens of Tunis and Tripoli to rise up; they did so on their own. From the Burmese parliamentarian pursuing reform to the young leaders fighting corruption and intolerance in Africa, we see something irreducible that all of us share as human beings, a truth that will persevere in the face of violence and repression and will ultimately overcome. <p>For the young people here today, I know it may seem easy to see these events as removed from our lives, remote from our daily routines, distant from concerns closer to home. I recognize that both in the United States and in much of Europe, there's more than enough to worry about in the affairs of our own countries. There will always be voices who say that what happens in the wider world is not our concern, nor our responsibility. But we must never forget that we are heirs to a struggle for freedom. Our democracy, our individual opportunity, only exist because those who came before us had the wisdom and the courage to recognize that our ideals will only endure if we see our self-interest in the success of other peoples and other nations. <p>Now is not the time for bluster. The situation in Ukraine, like crises in many parts of the world, does not have easy answers nor a military solution. But at this moment, we must meet the challenge to our ideals&mdash;to our very international order&mdash;with strength and conviction. <p>And it is you, the young people of Europe, young people like Laura, who will help decide which way the currents of our history will flow. Do not think for a moment that your own freedom, your own prosperity, that your own moral imagination is bound by the limits of your community, your ethnicity, or even your country. You're bigger than that. You can help us to choose a better history. That's what Europe tells us. That's what the American experience is all about. <p>I say this as the President of a country that looked to Europe for the values that are written into our founding documents, and which spilled blood to ensure that those values could endure on these shores. I also say this as the son of a Kenyan, whose grandfather was a cook for the British, and as a person who once lived in Indonesia as it emerged from colonialism. The ideals that unite us matter equally to the young people of Boston or Brussels or Jakarta or Nairobi or Krakow or Kiev. <p>In the end, the success of our ideals comes down to us, including the example of our own lives, our own societies. We know that there will always be intolerance. But instead of fearing the immigrant, we can welcome him. We can insist on policies that benefit the many, not just the few; that an age of globalization and dizzying change opens the door of opportunity to the marginalized and not just a privileged few. Instead of targeting our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters, we can use our laws to protect their rights. Instead of defining ourselves in opposition to others, we can affirm the aspirations that we hold in common. That's what will make America strong. That's what will make Europe strong. That's what makes us who we are. <p>And just as we meet our responsibilities as individuals, we must be prepared to meet them as nations. Because we live in a world in which our ideals are going to be challenged again and again by forces that would drag us back into conflict or corruption. We can't count on others to rise to meet those tests. The policies of your government, the principles of your European Union, will make a critical difference in whether or not the international order that so many generations before you have strived to create continues to move forward or whether it retreats. And that's the question we all must answer: What kind of Europe, what kind of America, what kind of world will we leave behind? And I believe that if we hold firm to our principles and are willing to back our beliefs with courage and resolve, then hope will ultimately overcome fear, and freedom will continue to triumph over tyranny, because that is what forever stirs in the human heart. <p>Thank you very much.\" "
"64" "\"<i>The President.</i> For the press, I just wanted to let everybody know Dr. Al Muneef was a recipient of the International Women of Courage Award that the State Department annually presents to women who are doing extraordinary work around the world advocating on behalf of women, children, and families. She was not able to attend because of family health issues, but we were aware of the fact that we'd be able to see her here today to personally present the award. <p>I'm doing this on behalf of Michelle Obama, who normally is the presenter, and I know that Dr. Al Muneef is disappointed that it's me instead of Michelle, appropriately so. [<i>Laughter</i>] But Dr. Maha Al Muneef has been able to not only set up services here in the Kingdom, but also, more importantly in some ways, been able to pass laws providing protections for women and children for domestic abuse and to provide a safe space and shelter for those who are suffering from domestic abuse. <p>And so to see the kind of progress that's been made, her ability to work with the Kingdom to persuade many that this is an issue that is going to be important to the society over the long term, I think makes this award fully justified. And so we're very, very proud of you and grateful for all the work you're doing here, and I'm looking forward to seeing you do even more wonderful things in the future. <p><i>Dr. Al Muneef.</i> Thank you.

"65" "\"<i>The President</i>. Hello, everybody! <p><i>Audience members</i>. Hello! <p><i>The President</i>. Everybody, have a seat. Have a seat. I've got a few things to say here. <p>First of all, it's great to see you as we kick off the 2014 baseball season. Now, I thought I invited the Red Sox here today, but there must be a mistake, because I don't recognize all these clean-shaven guys. [<i>Laughter</i>] There's one guy, a couple guys, who decided they thought the beard was working for them. <p>But beards or no beards, it is an honor to welcome the 2013 World Series Champion Boston Red Sox to the White House. I have to say, you all have some fanatical fans. [<i>Laughter</i>] And many of them occupy my administration and the White House. Look at my White House Photographer. He's been thinking about this day all week. I got my Press Secretary there. I am surrounded by Red Sox fans. And I know that there&mdash;all the Members of Congress from the New England delegation, who are equally fanatic. <p>Back in 2004, watching the Red Sox win the World Series was a novelty. But over the past 10 years, this clubhouse has the winningest championship record in baseball&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;three World Series titles in a decade, under the leadership of John Henry, Tom Werner, Larry Lucchino, and their partners. And since they won this one at Fenway, the diehards can finally declare that the Curse has definitively been broken. <p>Obviously, all the wins were sweet for Red Sox fans, but I think for the Nation as a whole, there was something about this particular squad that was special and will go down in history, not just because they went from worst to first, but because they symbolized the grit and the resilience of America's&mdash;one of America's iconic cities during one of its most difficult moments. <p>Nearly 1 year ago, hundreds of thousands gathered on a beautiful spring day to run and cheer the historic Boston Marathon. But a senseless act of terror turned celebration into chaos and joy into anguish. Four young people lost their lives. Hundreds were injured. The city was rocked. But under the guiding hand of somebody who I consider one of the finest public servants that America has known, Mayor Tom Menino of Boston&mdash;who is here today and his lovely wife&mdash;Boston stood resolute&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. Boston stood resolute and unbowed and unbroken. <p>And as the smoke cleared, we gained inspiration from the injured who gamely tackled their recovery&mdash;those who are running and walking again, including the young woman who has returned to professional dancing with a prosthetic leg. And we took heart from the first responders who put their lives at risk and bravely ran toward danger, people like Officer Richard Donahue of the MBTA Transit Police, who was shot and nearly killed that night. After months of rehab, Richard is walking again and keeping up with his 18-month-old son, and so we're proud to have Richard here today. Give him a big round of applause. <p>Today, our hearts are in Boston again. We've got the families of firefighters Michael Kennedy and Lieutenant Edward Walsh, who gave their lives protecting others from a massive blaze last week. And their sacrifice, like the sacrifice of those made last year, remind us of the selfless courage of everyday heroes who put their lives on the line to help others. The first responders, the brave citizens, the resolute victims of these tragedies&mdash;they're all \\"Boston Strong.\\" And ultimately, that's what this team played for last season, and every man behind me did his part to keep the team rolling. <p>There was Xander Boegarts, the upstart rookie who took over at third base and didn't let up. The tested veterans like my fellow Hawaiian Shane Victorino, and Mike Napoli, who came in during the offseason and shook off the rust and the injuries to secure win after win. Lackey and Lester, the heart of a rotation that upped their game and started begging their manager, John Farrell, to stay in for six and seven and eight innings. And of course, the legend, the only man to play for all three championship teams, the biggest bat in the dugout: Big Papi&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;Big Papi. That's what I'm talking about. Love this guy. Even a White Sox fan can appreciate these guys. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But for all the big names, this was never a single superstar's team. If you look at the numbers, no pitcher won more than 15 games, no batter hit more than 30 home runs. And yet they led the majors in runs scored, won the most games in the American League, had the second best ERA in their hard-hitting division. So this team never lost more than three games in a row all season, they just had a lot of heart. <p>And it was that consistency that brought the Red Sox into the postseason. But it was a drive to do more for the city that had their backs that took them on to win in the World Series. With the rallying symbol of \\"Boston Strong\\" mowed into the outfield and sewed into their uniforms, the Red Sox took the field against Tampa and Detroit with the full weight of their city behind them. When they found themselves in game four of the World Series, down two games to one against St. Louis, the faithful cheered as Jonny Gomes knocked in a three-run homer out of the park, breaking open a tie and giving Red Sox Nation the signal, they weren't done yet. <p>Big Papi let it rip, earned the World Series MVP. Koji Uehara, the third-choice closer who had been signed as an afterthought, capped one of the best postseasons in major league history with his signature splitter that sank straight into David Ross's mitt to win the World Series, four games to two. And then Koji just looked so happy after every game, didn't he? [<i>Laughter</i>] Jumping up on people. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So they all stormed the field, readied the duck boats. But this was more than just a trophy and parade. With every game they played, the Sons of Fenway never forgot what it meant to wear the Boston uniform. When they visited bombing victims in the hospital, when they played ball with kids getting cancer treatment, when they started a program to help wounded warriors get treatment at Mass General, these guys were saying we're all on the same team. And I think Big Papi put it better and more colorfully than any of us could. [<i>Laughter</i>] I won't repeat his quote. [<i>Laughter</i>] But the point is, Boston and the Red Sox were one this season. <p>And we knew last year, even as we mourned the loss&mdash;the lost and cared for the wounded and resolved to carry on, that the moment would come when the Sox would be champions again and the crowds would gather for a parade down Boylston once more. And that's exactly what happened. That's how this team helped Boston to heal. And true to that spirit, in just a few weeks, something else we resolved last year will come to pass: On the third Monday in April, the world will return to Boston and run harder than ever and cheer louder than ever for the 118th Boston Marathon. That will happen. Bottom line is, I'm proud of these guys. As a baseball fan, I appreciate their comeback season. But more importantly, as President, I'm grateful for their character and their embrace of the essential role they played in the spirit of that city. Sometimes, sports seems like it's trivial, it's just an entertainment. And then, every once in a while, you're reminded that sports represents something else and it has the power to bring people together like almost nothing can. And all of you should be very proud of what you accomplished. I know your fans are. And I'm grateful to you as well. <p>So congratulations to the Boston Red Sox and Red Sox Nation. Good luck this season. May the best Sox win. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>All right. Come on. You guys have something for me? All right, come on. Big Papi has something for me. <p><i>First baseman David A. \\"Big Papi\\" Ortiz.</i> Yes sir. <p>[<i>At this point, Mr. Ortiz presented the President with a Boston Red Sox jersey.</i>] <p><i>The President</i>. That looks pretty good. <p><i>Mr. Ortiz.</i> Forty-four President. <p><i>The President</i>. It looks like it may fit him better than me though. [<i>Laughter</i>] All right.

"66" "\"Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat. Thank you so much. Welcome to the White House. <p>Six months ago today, a big part of the Affordable Care Act kicked in as healthcare.gov and State insurance marketplaces went live. And millions of Americans finally had the same chance to buy quality, affordable health care&mdash;and the peace of mind that comes with it&mdash;as everybody else. <p>Last night, the first open enrollment period under this law came to an end. And despite several lost weeks out of the gate because of problems with the website, 7.1 million Americans have now signed up for private insurance plans through these marketplaces&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;7.1. <p>Yes. [<i>Applause</i>] The truth is, even more folks want to sign up&mdash;so anybody who was stuck in line because of the huge surge of demand over the past few days can still go back and finish your enrollment&mdash;7.1 million, that's on top of the more than 3 million young adults who have gained insurance under this law by staying on their family's plan. That's on top of the millions more who have gained access through Medicaid expansion and the Children's Health Insurance Program. Making affordable coverage available to all Americans, including those with preexisting conditions, is now an important goal of this law. <p>And in these first 6 months, we've taken a big step forward. And just as importantly, this law is bringing greatersecurity to Americans who already have coverage. Because of the Affordable Care Act, a hundred million Americans have gained free preventive care, like mammograms and contraceptive care, under their existing plans. Because of this law, nearly 8 million seniors have saved almost $10 billion on their medicine because we've closed a gaping hole in Medicare's prescription drug plan. We're closing the doughnut hole. And because of this law, a whole lot of families won't be driven into bankruptcy by a serious illness, because the Affordable Care Act prevents your insurer from placing dollar limits on the coverage they provide. <p>These are all benefits that have been taking place for a whole lot of families out there, many who don't realize that they've received these benefits. But the bottom line is this: Under this law, the share of Americans with insurance is up, and the growth of health care costs is down, and that's good for our middle class, and that's good for our fiscal future. <p>Now, that doesn't mean that all the problems in health care have been solved forever. Premiums are still rising for families who have insurance, whether you get it through your employer or you buy it on your own. That's been true every year for decades. But so far, those premiums have risen more slowly since the Affordable Care Act passed than at any time in the past 50 years. It's also true that, despite this law, millions of Americans remain uncovered, in part because Governors in some States, for political reasons, have deliberately refused to expand coverage under this law. But we're going to work on them. And we'll work to get more Americans covered with each passing year. <p>And while it remains true that you'll still have to change your coverage if you graduate from college or turn 26 years old or move or switch jobs or have a child&mdash;just like you did before the Affordable Care Act was passed&mdash;you can now go to healthcare.gov and use it year-round to enroll when circumstances in your life change. So no, the Affordable Care Act hasn't completely fixed our long-broken health care system, but this law has made our health care system a lot better. [<i>Applause</i>] A lot better. <p>All told, because of this law, millions of our fellow citizens know the economic security of health insurance who didn't just a few years ago, and that's something to be proud of. Regardless of your politics or your feelings about me or your feelings about this law, that's something that's good for our economy, and it's good for our country. And there's no good reason to go back. <p>Let me give you a sense of what this change has meant for millions of our fellow Americans. I'll just give you a few examples. Sean Casey, from Solana Beach, California, always made sure to cover his family on the private market. But preexisting medical conditions meant his annual tab was over $30,000. The Affordable Care Act changed that. See, if you have a preexisting condition, like being a cancer survivor, or if you suffer chronic pain from a tough job, or even if you've just been charged more for being a woman, you can no longer be charged more than anybody else. So this year, the Casey family's premiums will fall from over $30,000 to under $9,000. <p>And I know this because Sean took the time to write me a letter. \\"These savings,\\" he said, \\"will almost offset the cost of our daughter's first year in college. I'm a big believer in this legislation, and it has removed a lot of complexity and, frankly, fear from my life. Please keep fighting for the ACA.\\" That's what Sean had to say. <p>Jeanne Goe is a bartender from Enola, Pennsylvania. Now, I think most folks are aware, being a bartender, that's a job that usually doesn't offer health care. For years, Jeanne went uninsured or underinsured, often getting some health care through her local Planned Parenthood. In November, she bought a plan on the marketplace. In January, an illness sent her to the hospital. And because her new plan covered a CAT scan she wouldn't have otherwise been able to afford, her doctor discovered that she also had ovarian cancer and gave her a chance to beat it. So she wrote me a letter too. She said it's going to be \\"a long tough road to kill this cancer, but I can walk that road knowing insurance isn't an issue. I won't be refused care. I hope to send a follow-up letter in a few months saying I am free and clear of this disease, but until then, I know I will be fighting just as you have been fighting for my life as a working American citizen.\\" <p>And after her first wellness visit under her new insurance plan, Marla Morine, from Fort Collins, Colorado, shared with me what it meant to her: \\"After using my new insurance for the first time, you probably heard my sigh of relief from the White House.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"I felt like a human being again. I felt that I had value.\\" <p>That's what the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, is all about: making sure that all of us, and all our fellow citizens, can count on the security of health care when we get sick; that the work and dignity of every person is acknowledged and affirmed. The newly insured, like Marla, deserve that dignity. Working Americans, like Jeanne, deserve that economic security. Women, the sick, survivors&mdash;they deserve fair treatment in our health care system, all of which makes the constant politics around this law so troubling. <p>Like every major piece of legislation, from Social Security to Medicare, the law is not perfect. We've had to make adjustments along the way, and the implementation&mdash;especially with the website&mdash;has had its share of problems. We know something about that. And yes, at times this reform has been contentious and confusing, and obviously, it's had its share of critics. That's part of what change looks like in a democracy. Change is hard. Fixing what's broken is hard. Overcoming skepticism and fear of something new is hard. A lot of times folks would prefer the devil they know to the devil they don't. <p>But this law is doing what it's supposed to do. It's working. It's helping people from coast to coast, all of which makes the lengths to which critics have gone to scare people or undermine the law or try to repeal the law without offering any plausible alternative so hard to understand. I've got to admit, I don't get it. Why are folks working so hard for people not to have health insurance? Why are they so mad about the idea of folks having health insurance? Many of the tall tales that have been told about this law have been debunked. There are still no death panels. [<i>Laughter</i>] Armageddon has not arrived. Instead, this law is helping millions of Americans, and in the coming years, it will help millions more. <p>I've said before, I will always work with anyone who is willing to make this law work even better. But the debate over repealing this law is over. The Affordable Care Act is here to stay. <p>And those who have based their entire political agenda on repealing it have to explain to the country why Jeanne should go back to being uninsured. They should explain why Sean and his family should go back to paying thousands and thousands of dollars more. They've got to explain why Marla doesn't deserve to feel like she's got value. They have to explain why we should go back to the days when seniors paid more for their prescriptions or women had to pay more than men for coverage, back to the days when Americans with preexisting conditions were out of luck&mdash;they could routinely be denied the economic security of health insurance&mdash;because that's exactly what would happen if we repeal this law. Millions of people who now have health insurance would not have it. Seniors who have gotten discounts on their prescription drugs would have to pay more. Young people who were on their parent's plan would suddenly not have health insurance. <p>In the end, history is not kind to those who would deny Americans their basic economic security. Nobody remembers well those who stand in the way of America's progress or our people. And that's what the Affordable Care Act represents. As messy as it's been sometimes, as contentious as it's been sometimes, it is progress. It is making sure that we are not the only advanced country on Earth that doesn't make sure everybody has basic health care. And that's thanks in part to leaders like Nancy Pelosi and Dick Durbin and all the Members of Congress who are here today. We could not have done it without them, and they should be proud of what they've done. [<i>Applause</i>] They should be proud of what they've done. <p>And it's also thanks to the often unheralded work of countless Americans who fought tirelessly to pass this law and who organized like crazy these past few months to help their fellow citizens just get the information they needed to get covered. That's why we're here today. That's why 7.1 million folks have health insurance, because people got the word out. <p>And our&mdash;we didn't make a hard sell. We didn't have billions of dollars of commercials like some critics did. [<i>Laughter</i>] But what we said was, look for yourself, see if it's good for your family. And a whole lot of people decided it was. So I want to thank everybody who worked so hard to make sure that we arrived at this point today. <p>Now, I want to make sure everybody understands: In the months, years ahead, I guarantee you, there will be additional challenges to implementing this law. There will be days when the website stumbles, I guarantee it. So, press, just&mdash;I want you to anticipate&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;there will be some moment when the website is down, and I know it will be on all your front pages. It's going to happen. It won't be news. There will be parts of the law that will still need to be improved. And if we can stop refighting old political battles that keep us gridlocked, then we could actually make the law work even better for everybody. And we're excited about the prospect of doing that. We are game to do it. <p>But today should remind us that the goal we set for ourselves&mdash;that no American should go without the health care that they need; that no family should be bankrupt because somebody in that family gets sick, because no parent should have to be worried about whether they can afford treatment because they're worried that they don't want to have to burden their children; the idea that everybody in this country can get decent health care&mdash;that goal is achievable. <p>We are on our way. And if all of us have the courage and the wisdom to keep working not against one another, not to scare each other, but for one another, then we won't just make progress on health care. We'll make progress on all the other work that remains to create new opportunity for everybody who works for it and to make sure that this country that we love lives up to its highest ideals. That's what today is about. That's what all the days that come as long as I'm President are going to be about. That's what we're going to be working towards. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless America. Thank you.\" "
"67" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Michigan! Go Blue! Well, this is a good-looking crowd. Just happy to be out of class. I'm sure that's not true. I'm sure it's&mdash; these are all outstanding students. [<i>Applause</i>] Good to see you. <p>First of all, give Mira a big round of applause for the great introduction. I want to say thanks to your president, Mary Sue Coleman, for her years of outstanding leadership here at Michigan. We've got a few other Michigan leaders who are here today. We've got Congressman John Conyers. We've got Congressman Gary Peters. We've got your mayor, John Hieftje. Former Congressman Mark Schauer. Your Congressman, the legendary John Dingell, could not make it, but his wife Debbie is here. Give her a big round of applause. <p>Now, most importantly, I know to all of you, we've got some Wolverines in the house here. We've got Glenn Robinson III. We've got Jordan Morgan. We've got Big Ten Player of the Year Nik Stauskas. And we've got quarterback Devin Gardner. These guys were outstanding this year. Give them a bigger round of applause than that. They&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>You guys had a great run. That last game was as good of a game as we've seen the entire season. I know you wish that that it turned out a little bit later; if you'd had 5 more seconds, it would have been helpful. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I wanted to congratulate the coach, Coach Beilein, and the team for a great season. <p>And I understand that Jordan wanted me to talk about my bracket. [<i>Laughter</i>] My bracket's a mess. [<i>Laughter</i>] I've learned my lesson: I will not pick against the Wolverines. I've learned my lesson. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's not going to happen. This is the problem with doing these brackets: People just trash-talk you nonstop. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's terrible. <p>And I think it's worth mentioning, I want to congratulate Jordan for playing more games at Michigan than any other player in history, not only earning an undergraduate degree in engineering&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;pursuing a graduate degree in engineering as well. That's the kind of student athlete we're talking about, sir. Proud of him. [<i>Applause</i>] Proud of him. <p>Now, do some of you guys have chairs? Because if you've got chairs, feel free to sit down. But if you don't, don't sit down, because I don't want you getting hurt. <p>The&mdash;before I came here today, I stopped at Zingerman's, which is the right thing to do when you're in Ann Arbor. [<i>Laughter</i>] I stopped for two reasons. The first is, the reuben is killer. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I ordered, like, the small&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and it didn't look that small. So I gave half to Valerie Jarrett, who's traveling with us. And then, after I finished the half, I wanted the half back. [<i>Laughter</i>] But it was too late. All she had left was the pickle. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I took the pickle. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But&mdash;so one of the reasons I went was because the sandwiches are outstanding. The second reason, though, is, Zingerman's is a business that treats its workers well and rewards honest work with honest wages. And that's worth celebrating. And that's what I'm here to talk about today: How do we rebuild an economy that creates jobs and opportunities for every American? And I want to focus on something a lot of people in Michigan are working very hard to accomplish right now, and that is, raising the minimum wage to help more folks get ahead. Now, here's the context. Our economy is doing better. It's growing. Our businesses are creating jobs, 8.7 million new jobs over the past 4 years. Our manufacturing sector, which had been losing jobs throughout the nineties and throughout the&mdash;what do you call it&mdash;aughts? [<i>Laughter</i>] You know, the 2000 to 2010, whatever you call that. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But manufacturing had been losing jobs&mdash;about a third of manufacturing had lost&mdash;and obviously, that had hit Michigan really hard. But we're now seeing the manufacturing sector add jobs for the first time since the 1990s. So that is good news. Housing market is recovering. Obviously, the stock market has recovered, which means people's 401(k)s, if they have them, are doing a lot better. <p>Troops that were fighting two wars, they're coming home. We just went through the first month since 2003 where no U.S. soldier was killed in either Afghanistan or Iraq. <p>Today, you've got companies looking to invest in the U.S. instead of sending jobs overseas. They want to create more jobs and invest right here in the United States. We're more competitive. We're more productive. <p>Oh, and by the way, 7.1 million Americans have now signed up for coverage through the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare. That's a lot of people&mdash;7.1. That's enough to fill up the Big House 65 times. And by the way, that doesn't count the more than 3 million young people who have been able to stay on their parents' plans. So we have seniors here who graduate, and then it may take a couple months to find a job, or you're doing an internship or something that does not provide health care. You're going to be covered until you get that job that actually provides health insurance. So it provides you the kind of protection you need. <p>So that's the good news. We've fought back from the worst economic crisis in our lifetimes. We've laid the foundation for America's future growth. But here's the problem: There's been a long-term trend that has really been hitting middle class folks and folks trying to get into the middle class, and that's been going on since before most of you were born. The economy increasingly has folks at the top doing really well, but then middle class families, people who are struggling to get into the middle class, they're working harder, but their wages, their incomes aren't going up. <p>And we're a better country than that. In America, we do not believe in opportunity just for the few. We believe that everybody should have a chance at success. Everybody. And we believe our economy grows best not from the top down, but from the middle out and from the bottom up. And we want to make sure that no matter where you're born, what circumstances, how you started out, what you look like, what your last name is, who you love, it doesn't matter; you can succeed. That's what we believe. <p>We believe that what matters is the strength of our work ethic and the scope of our dreams and our willingness to take responsibility for ourselves, but also for others. That's what America is about. That's the promise that this country is built on. And for the sake of your generation, we got to make sure that that continues to be the case; that that's not just something we're nostalgic about; that that's something that we project out into the future. <p>So I had a State of the Union a while back, and I laid out a four-part opportunity agenda to make sure everybody has a shot. And that starts with something I know graduating seniors are thinking about: more good jobs paying good wages, jobs in high tech and manufacturing and energy and innovation. And there are things we can do to create jobs: rebuilding our infrastructure in this country, investing in R&D, closing wasteful loopholes that don't create jobs. So we're providing tax breaks to companies that are creating jobs right here in the United States. Those are things we can do right now. <p>Opportunity means training more Americans for the skills needed to fill those jobs. We got to make sure everybody is ready with the skills they need. Not everybody is going to be lucky enough to be a Wolverine and graduate from Michigan. But everybody can get a good, solid base so that they can have a job and a career. <p>Opportunity means guaranteeing every young people access to a world-class education, and that's got to start with pre-K, all the way through higher education. And it means making college more affordable. <p>Some of you may not know this, but before a lot of you even entered college, we took on the student loan system. It was giving billions of taxpayer dollars to big banks to serve as middlemen in the student loan process. We said, why do we need the banks? We cut them out. We used the savings that were generated, billions of dollars, to expand the grants that help millions of low-income students pay for college. And we're offering millions of students who are graduating the chance to cap monthly student loan payments at 10 percent of your income. <p>This is something you need to talk to your counselors about, especially if you're going into teaching or social work or other professions where it's a passion, but you're not going to be in an investment banker salary situation. So make sure you find out about this. You can cap&mdash;I mean, I know Stauskas has got the contract coming up, so he'll&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;he doesn't have to worry about these things. But I'm saying later; I'm not telling him to leave. [<i>Laughter</i>] I wasn't editorializing on that. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>My point is, we've got to make sure that everybody can afford to do things that may not pay huge sums of money, but are really valuable to society. <p>And the good news is more young people are earning college degrees than ever before. But we've still got to do more work to rein in tuition costs. I talked to your president about this. And we've got to help more students who are trapped by student loan debt, because this country cannot afford striving young people to be priced out of a higher education. Everybody has got to be able to afford it. <p>Now, finally, opportunity means rewarding the hard work of every American&mdash;not just some Americans, every American. That means making sure that folks are paid equal for doing equal work. We&mdash;I do not want my daughters paid less than somebody else's sons for doing the same job. <p>It means making sure that there are decent benefits and, at minimum, that every American has access to quality, affordable health insurance. It means paychecks and wages that allow you to support a family. <p>All of which brings me back to this issue of the minimum wage, giving America a raise. Now, raising the minimum wage is not going to solve all of our economic challenges. The majority of folks who are working get paid more than the minimum wage. As Americans, we understand that some people will earn more than others. But here's one thing we do believe: Nobody who works full time should be raising their family in poverty, right? If you're working, if you're responsible, you should be able to pay the rent, pay the bills. <p>But that's what's happening right now. All across the country, you can work full time on the minimum wage and still be in poverty. And that's why, in the year since I first asked Congress to raise the minimum wage, we've seen six States, on their own, pass laws to raise their minimum wage. Last week, Connecticut became the first State in the country to raise its minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. [<i>Applause</i>] Congratulations, Connecticut. <p>You've got more States and counties and cities that are working to raise their minimum wage as we speak. That includes your State legislators from Ann Arbor&mdash;Adam Zemke and Jeff Irwin&mdash;who are trying to raise it here in Michigan. We're proud of them. Stand up, guys. Come on. [<i>Applause</i>] There they are. See, I used to be in the State legislature, so I was kind of partial to&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>But raising wages is not just a job for organizers, it's not just a job for elected officials, it's also a job for business. It was here in Michigan a hundred years ago that Henry Ford announced he was doubling his workers' wages. And at the time, some of his fellow business leaders thought he had lost his mind. But Henry Ford understood it was going to be good for business. Not only did it boost productivity, not only did it reduce turnover, not only did it make employees more loyal to the company, but it meant that the workers could afford to buy the cars that they were building. So you were building&mdash;so by paying your workers more, you were building your own market for your products. <p>And hugely successful companies today, like Costco, they take the same approach. And it's not just big businesses, small businesses too. In my State of the Union Address, I called on more business leaders to boost their employees' wages, give them a fair wage. And since then, you've seen businesses across the country&mdash;small ones, like an ice cream parlor in Florida, to a marketing agency in Georgia, to a pizzeria in St. Louis&mdash;they've all said, you know what, this is the right thing to do. <p>Recently, the Gap decided to raise its base wages, and that benefited about 65,000 workers in the United States&mdash;and it led me to go shopping at Gap. [<i>Laughter</i>] Some of you may have seen the very attractive sweaters that I purchased for my daughters. [<i>Laughter</i>] They have not worn them yet, so if they're listening, make me feel good, just wear it one time. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, Zingerman's does not have as many workers as the Gap, obviously, but they try to do right by each and every one of them. You've got some big businesses who go to Washington to lobby for special treatment for themselves. So one of Zingerman's owners, Paul Saginaw, flew to DC to lobby for his workers, to lobby for better treatment for workers through a higher minimum wage. That's the kind of folks who are running Zingerman's. <p>Then afterwards, he held a sandwich summit here in Ann Arbor to help build support for Michigan's minimum wage going up. And Paul's point is simple: Fair wages and higher profits are not mutually exclusive, they can go hand in hand. That's what Henry Ford understood. And Paul opened Zingerman's doors 32 years ago last month, so he knows a little bit about business. But he and business owners like him believe higher wages are good for the bottom line. <p>I happen to believe the same thing. So I decided several months ago that the Federal Government should follow their lead. And so I issued anExecutive order that requires Federal contractors, folks who are doing business with the Government, to pay their employees on new contracts a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour. It's the right thing to do. <p>And I'm determined to do my part to lift wages, improve take-home pay any way I can. My attitude is, if you cook our troops' meals, you wash their dishes, your country should pay you a living wage. Now, here's the challenge. What Zingerman's can do on its own, what even I can do as the head of the executive branch of the Federal Government, that doesn't reach everybody. If we're going to do right by our fellow Americans, we need Congress to get on board. We've got to have Congress to get on board. We've got to have State legislators to get on board. Because even though we're bringing manufacturing jobs back to America, we're creating more good-paying jobs in education and health care and business services, there are always going to be folks who do critical work, who bust their tails every day&mdash;airport workers, restaurant workers, and hospital workers, and retail salespeople&mdash;who deserve an honest day's pay for an honest day's work. They're doing necessary jobs. They should be able to make a living. <p>So right now there is a bill before Congress that would boost America's minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. It's easy to remember: 10-10. Ten-ten. [<i>Laughter</i>] Passing this bill would not just raise wages for minimum wage workers; it would help lift wages for nearly 28 million Americans, including nearly a million people right here in Michigan. It would lift millions of people out of poverty right away. It would help millions more work their way out of poverty right away. <p>It wouldn't require any new taxes. It doesn't require new spending. It doesn't require new bureaucracy. But what it would do is help those families and give businesses more customers with more money to spend. And it would help grow the economy for everybody. <p>So you would think this would be a no-brainer. Politically, you'd think that folks would be rushing to do this. Nearly three in four Americans support raising the minimum wage&mdash;nearly three in four. Here's the problem. Republicans in Congress&mdash;not Republicans out in America, because some of them get paid the minimum wage, so they want to see it raised&mdash;Republicans in Congress don't want to vote to raise it at all. In fact, some want to just scrap the minimum wage. All right? One House Republican said, \\"It's outlived its usefulness.\\" <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> No, that's what he said. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> No, no, no. Don't boo, organize. [<i>Laughter</i>] So the&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. That's what you need to do, because they may not hear the boos, but they can read a petition, and they can see votes. <p>You've got some Republicans saying we shouldn't raise the minimum wage because&mdash;they've said this&mdash;because, well, it just helps young people. Now, first of all, I think it's pretty good to help young people. I don't know what's wrong with helping young people. I mean, folks who say that, next thing you know, they'll say, \\"Get off my lawn.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] I think it's okay to help young people. <p>But the fact is, most people who would benefit from a higher minimum wage are not teenagers taking on their first job. The average age of folks getting paid the minimum wage is 35. A majority of lower wage jobs are held by women. Many of them work full time, often to support a family. <p>And by the way, what's wrong with helping young people get ahead? [<i>Laughter</i>] Mira puts herself through college on a base wage of less than $3 an hour, because she's working in a restaurant. She works hard. [<i>Applause</i>] She does. So we should be making it easier for your generation to gain a foothold on the ladder of opportunity. We shouldn't be making it harder. Now, the truth is, the Republicans' refusal so far to raise the minimum wage is pretty consistent with their general worldview&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;no, which says&mdash;it says basically you're on your own, government doesn't have a role to play in making sure that the marketplace is working for everybody. <p>Just yesterday Republicans in Congress put forward a budget for the country that I believe would shrink opportunity for your generation. It starts by giving a massive tax cut to households making more than $1 million a year, the very folks who've benefited the most over the last 20 years from this economy that is benefiting people at the top. Then, so they don't blow a hole in the deficit, they'd have to raise taxes on middle class families with kids. Then, they'd force deep cuts to the investments that help our economy grow, like research and clean energy, and investments in middle class families, like education and job training. <p>Now, when they put these budgets together, usually they don't tell you exactly what they'd cut, because they know you wouldn't like it. So you have to kind of do the math. But compared to my budget, if they cut everything evenly in the amounts that they're talking about, within a few years about 170,000 kids would get cut from early childhood education. About 200,000 new moms and children would get cut off from the programs that help them to get healthy food. Funding for 21,000 special education teachers would be cut off. And if they wanted to make smaller cuts in any of these other&mdash;in any one of these areas, they'd have to make bigger cuts in others. It even cuts Pell grants, which makes it harder for students to pay for a college education. <p>And&mdash;now, to give them credit, they do have one original idea, which is to repeal Obamacare&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;because they haven't tried that 50 times. Fifty times they've tried to do that. [<i>Laughter</i>] So that means they would take away health coverage not only for more than 7 million Americans who've done the responsible thing, signed up, bought health care for themselves and their families, but for the 3 million young adults who've been able to stay on their parent's plan under this law. What I just told you about being able to stay on your parent's plan, the Republicans don't like that. <p>And their budget guts the rules we put in place to protect middle class families from another financial crisis like the one that we've endured. So if this all sounds familiar, it should be familiar because it was their economic plan in the 2012 campaign; it was their economic plan in 2010. It's like that movie \\"Groundhog Day\\"&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;except it's not funny. If they tried to sell this sandwich at Zingerman's, they'd have to call it the Stinkburger or the Meanwich. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>You know, look, here's the truth. They're not necessarily cold hearted, they just sincerely believe that if we give more tax breaks to a fortunate few and we invest less in the middle class and we reduce or eliminate the safety net for the poor and the sick and we cut food stamps and we cut Medicaid and we let banks and polluters and credit card companies and insurers do only what's best for their bottom line without the responsibility to the rest of us, then somehow, the economy will boom, and jobs and prosperity will trickle down to everybody. <p>And when I say it that way, I know it sounds like I'm exaggerating, except I'm not. This is their theory. They're pretty unabashed about it. And it's not a new theory. They've held it for decades, through good times and bad. They were making the same argument against FDR when he was setting up Social Security. <p>And look, it does create opportunity for a handful of people who are already doing really, really well. But we believe in opportunity for everybody, more good jobs for everybody, more workers to fill those jobs, a world-class education for everybody, hard work that pays off with wages you can live on and savings you can retire on and health care you can count on. That's what opportunity for all means. [<i>Applause</i>] That's what it means. <p>Now, next week, Members of Congress have a fresh chance to show which side they're on. They're going to get a yes-or-no vote on raising the minimum wage all across this country. And they've got to make a clear choice: Talk the talk about valuing hard-working families, or walk the walk and actually value hard-working families. You've got a choice: You can give America the shaft, or you can give it a raise. <p>Here in Michigan, your Senators, Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow, your Representatives, John Dingell and John Conyers and Gary Peters, they are already on board. But every American deserves to know where their elected representatives stand on this choice. So those of you&mdash;if you're going back home for spring break or something or&mdash;did that already happen, spring break? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes! <p><i>The President.</i> I'm sorry. [<i>Laughter</i>] Everybody is all, aw, yeah. [<i>Laughter</i>] Well, I hope you had a good time. [<i>Laughter</i>] But if you have the chance to talk to a Congressman who's not supporting it, you need to ask him, do you support raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour? And if they say yes, then you should say thank you because elected officials do not hear that very often. When they do the right thing, you should reward them. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Thank you, President Obama! <p><i>The President.</i> You're welcome. Thank you. [<i>Applause</i>] Thank you. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, if they say no, you shouldn't yell at them. Be polite. Ask them why not. Ask them to reconsider. Tell them to join the rest of the country. For once, instead of just saying no, say yes. It's time for $10.10. It's time to give America a raise. <p>As I'm looking out at all of you I'm reminded, 4 years ago I had the privilege of delivering the commencement address at the university, over in the big stadium. And I said our democracy, it's always been noisy, it's always been messy. We have big arguments. But in the end, we've always had the ability to look past our differences and our disagreements and forge a common future. And we've got common values: hard work, responsibility, pursuing your individual dreams. <p>What the argument is right now about is whether we also affirm the values that make sure we've giving everybody a chance; making sure our fellow citizens can also pursue their dreams; that we're not just looking out for ourselves all the time, but we're also looking out for the person next to you. That's also what America is about. That's what we have to do again. <p>We've got more jobs to create. We've got more kids to educate. We've got more clean energy to create. We've got more troops to bring home. We've got more veterans to care for. We've got an immigration system we got to fix. We've got to build a middle class. We've got to give opportunity for everybody who strives for it. We've got to make sure everybody&mdash;Black, White, Latino, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, with or without a disability, folks in the inner city, folks outside the borders of the city&mdash;everybody has got a chance. America is a place for everybody. That's what we're fighting for. That's what I need you to get out there and talk about. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"68" "\"Hello, everybody. I just got off the phone with Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Sandy Winnefeld to get the latest report on the situation in Fort Hood. Obviously, we're following it closely. The situation is fluid right now. But my national security team is in close contact with not just the Defense Department, but the FBI. They are working with folks on the ground to determine exactly what happened to make sure that everybody is secure. And I want to just assure all of us that we're going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened. <p>Any shooting is troubling. Obviously, this reopens the pain of what happened at Fort Hood 5 years ago. We know these families. We know their incredible service to our country and the sacrifices that they make. Obviously, our thoughts and prayers were&mdash;are with the entire community. And we are going to do everything we can to make sure that the community at Fort Hood has what it needs to deal with the current situation, but also any potential aftermath. <p>We're heartbroken that something like this might have happened again. And I don't want to comment on the facts until I know exactly what has happened, but for now, I would just hope that everybody across the country is keeping the families and the community of Fort Hood in our thoughts and in our prayers. The folks there have sacrificed so much on behalf of our freedom. Many of the people there have been on multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. They serve with valor, and they serve with distinction. And when they're at their home base, they need to feel safe. We don't yet know what happened tonight, but obviously, that sense of safety has been broken once again. And we're going to have to find out exactly what happened. <p>The Pentagon will undoubtedly have further briefings for you as we get more details about what happened. All right? <p>Thanks, everybody.\" "
"69" "\"<i>The First Lady.</i> Hey, everybody. [<i>Laughter</i>] Welcome to the White House! I know you guys have been standing for a while, but you're athletes, you can handle it. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We are so excited to have Team U.S.A. here with us today. But before we begin, I just want to take a moment to acknowledge the Fort Hood community that, as many of you know, has experienced yet another devastating tragedy. And we just want to make sure that folks there know that our thoughts and prayers are with all of those who lost loved ones and friends, as well as those that were injured. <p>Because I know that many of the athletes here today are veterans themselves, and when something like this happens, it touches all of us. I know that the President and I are just torn apart when things like this happen. So today, as we celebrate the Olympic spirit, we remember that the same spirit&mdash;the spirit of hard work and team work&mdash;is shared by our military men and women, and we stand with them today and every day. <p>So now let's get into the \\"you guys\\" thing. [<i>Laughter</i>] Today, after watching you guys all over TV all these couple of months, I have to say that I am truly amazed. I shared some of this with you guys in the receiving line. You all are so talented. You're dedicated, and honestly, sometimes, I don't know how you do it. I really don't. <p>I have watched you guys do some of the craziest stuff. That's the thing with the Winter Olympics. You guys do crazy things&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;careening down the face of mountains. Craziness! [<i>Laughter</i>] Throwing each other up in the air, it's like&mdash;the mixed-pair skaters, the women, they're teeny. The big guys take them and throw them, just throw them across the ice. I'm, like, are you kidding me? [<i>Laughter</i>] You threw her so hard, and she lands on one foot on a blade. And those of you jumping on those cookie sheet things and just sliding down a mountain&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;80 miles an hour. I mean, who thinks of that? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So I am really in awe of everything you do, as so many people here in America and across the globe are. Again and again, you all showed us that being an Olympian is about heart, it's about guts, and it's about giving it your all no matter what stands in your way. And that's a message that I try to convey to young people all the time: the idea that if you work hard and commit yourselves to a goal and then pick yourself up when you fall, that there is nothing that you can't achieve. <p>And as Olympic and Paralympic athletes, you also know that a big part of reaching your full potential is making sure that you're putting the right fuel in your body. You all know that better than anyone in this country: that what you eat absolutely makes a difference in how you perform. <p>And that's another message that I try to spread to our young people, the importance of eating healthy and staying active. So I want to thank all of you who taped a video for our \\"Let's Move!\\" campaign earlier today. Thank you so much for making that happen. And I want to give a special thank you to the USOC for their work to give over 2 million young people opportunities to get active in their communities. We are so grateful for that work, and we're grateful for the example you all set for our young people. In so many different ways, you all are inspiring folks across the country, not just every 4 years, but every single day. And nowhere have I seen that more clearly than in the story of someone that I met here at the White House 4 years ago under far different circumstances. <p>Lieutenant Commander Dan Cnossen was seated next to me at a dinner with leaders of our military. And I just got to see Dan, and we were remarking&mdash;because we were in the Dip Room, it was the same room we had dinner in together&mdash;but just a few months earlier, Dan had been in Afghanistan. He was leading a platoon of Navy SEALs when he stepped on an IED. Dan lost both of his legs in the explosion, but he never lost that fighting spirit. <p>I will always remember Dan, because just 4 months after that explosion, he finished a half marathon in a wheelchair&mdash;4 months after the explosion. On the 1-year anniversary of his injury, he ran a mile on his prosthetics. Over the next few years, Dan stayed on Active Duty while in the Navy, earning medals in swimming and running events at the Warrior Games and completing the New York City Marathon. <p>And today, 4&frac12; years after his injury, Dan is proud to wear another one of our Nation's uniforms, and that is of Team U.S.A. Yes. [<i>Applause</i>] There's Dan. <p><i>The President.</i> Dan is in the back there. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Dan is in the back. <p><i>The President.</i> Wave again, Dan. There's Dan. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> And I also got to meet Dan's sister, who stayed by his side every single minute of his recovery, and she was an important part of that recovery. And she's a terrific woman, a nurse herself. And I'm glad to hear she's doing well. <p>In Sochi, Dan inspired us all again by competing in the 15K biathlon and the 1-kilometer sitting cross-country sprint. So Dan has come a long way in the 4 years that we met, and I know that his story and the stories of all our Olympians and Paralympians are nowhere near finished. <p>So keep it up. This is only the beginning. Many of you were here 4 years ago, and you told us you'd be back. And you're back. So I know you're already getting ready for that next 4 years. But in the meantime, we look forward to all that you're going to do in this country and around the world to keep inspiring particularly young people to just live a little more like you all live and to show them that spirit of persistence. <p>So thank you all, again, for everything that you do. And I can't wait to hear about everything that you will do in the years to come. <p>And with that, I'm going to turn it over to this guy next to me&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;who happens to be my husband, but more importantly, is the President of the United States, Barack Obama. <p><i>The President.</i> Let's, first of all, be clear: It is more important that I'm Michelle's husband than that I'm President of the United States. [<i>Laughter</i>] I just want you to&mdash;I don't want anybody to be confused. Many of you young people out there aren't married yet, so I just want you to know&mdash;giving you some tips in terms of how to prioritize. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Obviously, as Michelle mentioned, our thoughts right now in many ways are with the families at Fort Hood. These are folks who make such extraordinary sacrifices for us each and every day for our freedom. During the course of a decade of war, many of them have been on multiple tours of duty. To see unspeakable, senseless violence happen in a place where they're <p>supposed to feel safe&mdash;home base&mdash;is tragic. And obviously, this is the second time that the Fort Hood community has been affected this way. <p>So we join that entire community in honoring those who lost their lives. Every single one of them was an American patriot. We stand with their families and their loved ones as they grieve. We are thinking about those who are wounded. We're there to support them. <p>And as we learn more about what happened and why, we're going to make sure that we're doing everything in our power to keep our troops safe and to keep our troops strong, and not just on the battlefield, but also when they come home. They've done their duty, and they're an inspiration. They've made us proud. They put on their uniform, and then they take care of us, and we've got to make sure that when they come home, we take care of them. <p>And that spirit of unity is what brings us here today, because we could not be prouder of Team U.S.A. [<i>Applause</i>] Team U.S.A. I hope all of you made yourself at home. We double-checked to make sure that all the bathroom locks were working in case Johnny Quinn&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;tried to bust down one of these antique doors. We didn't want that to happen. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to recognize the Members of Congress we have here with us, as well as Scott Blackmun and Larry Probst from the USOC, our fantastic delegations that represent the diversity and the values of our country so well. But most of all, we're here just to celebrate all of you, our Olympians and Paralympians who brought home a total of 46 medals for the red, white, and blue. <p>I understand that freestyle skier Gus Kenworthy also brought home a few stray dogs that he adopted. [<i>Laughter</i>] That doesn't count in the medal standings, but it tells you something about the freestyle skiers. <p>The&mdash;over the past couple of months, we saw some dominating performances by Team U.S.A. American women won more medals in the Olympics than women of any other nation. [<i>Applause</i>] Way to go, women! Good job. The men swept the podium in slopestyle skiing and Paralympic snowboarding. [<i>Applause</i>] There you go. Our women's hockey team brought home the silver. Our men's hockey team played a game for the ages with an epic shootout victory over the Russians. <p>I would personally like to thank all of our snowboarders and freestyle skiers for making newscasters across America say things like \\"air to fakie\\" and the \\"back-to-back double cork 1260.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] I don't know what that means, really, but I just wanted to say it. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm pretty sure I'm the first President to ever say that. [<i>Applause</i>] I'm pretty sure that's true. The back-to-back double cork 1260. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member.</i> It feels good. <p><i>The President.</i> Does it feel good? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>In Sochi, these athletes made plenty of history. You had 16-year-old Declan Farmer scoring three goals to help our sled hockey team become the first nation ever to win back-to-back gold medals. Hey! [<i>Applause</i>] There he is. There he is. Hey! <p>Our men's bobsled team became the first Americans in 62 years to medal in both the two-man and the four-man competition. Bobsledders&mdash;those are some tough guys, those bobsledders. Don't mess with them. [<i>Laughter</i>] And then, Mikaela Shiffrin became the youngest Olympian ever to win gold in the slalom, at just 18 years old. Where's Mikaela? She's back here somewhere. Wave a little bit. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> She's a little&mdash;she's down low. <p><i>The President.</i> She's down low. See, there she is. I knew she was here. I saw her. [<i>Laughter</i>] Afterwards, she said she wants to win five gold in 2018. I do have to say, though, Mikaela, as somebody who was once told that, \\"you're young, but you should set your sights high,\\" I just got three words of advice: Go for it. The&mdash;we are confident you are going to be bringing back some more gold. <p>Thanks to years of lobbying from Team U.S.A., women's ski jumping was added as an Olympic sport, and they did outstanding. So women can fly just like men. Jessica Jerome said: \\"We have arrived. We are good at what we do. And we are a lot prettier than the boy jumpers.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Which I can attest to; I've seen them. [<i>Laughter</i>] She wasn't lying. <p>So from our ski jumpers who fought for equality to the athletes and coaches who have served our country in uniform, like Dan, who we're so proud of, these athletes all send a message that resonates far beyond the Olympic Village. And that's always been the power of the Olympics: In going for the gold and pushing yourselves to be the best, you inspire the rest of us to try to, if not be the best, at least be a little better. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Get off the couch. <p><i>The President.</i> Just get off the couch. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's what Michelle said. <p>All of you remind us, just like the Olympic creed states: The most important thing in life is not the triumph, but the fight. And I want to take the example of somebody who couldn't be here today, but her story, I think, is typical of so many of yours. And this is Noelle Pikus-Pace. Noelle was hoping to be here, but she's been on the road a lot, wanted to get back to her husband and her kids, and they may be watching us now. <p>But almost a decade ago, Noelle was on top of the world after winning the women's skeleton World Cup. She was injured in a freak accident that cost her her chances in 2006. In 2010, she missed the podium by one-tenth of a second. And after all of those Olympics, she retired to spend more time with her family. But then 2 years ago, her husband convinced her to go back on that sled, because raising a family and racing down the track don't have to be mutually exclusive. <p>So since then, Noelle, her husband, her two young children traveled from competition to competition, living out of suitcases, seeing the world together. And in Sochi, it all paid off, and she took home the silver in the skeleton, jumping over the wall to celebrate with her family on the final run. And here's what said&mdash;what Noelle said afterwards: \\"Life is never going to go as planned. You have to decide, when you're bumped off course, if it's going to hold you back or move you forward.\\" <p>That's the spirit we celebrate today. That's something Dan understands. That's something that all of you at some stages in your life have understood or will understand. Things aren't always going to go perfect. And Michelle and I always remark, watching our Olympians, that you work hard for 4 years, and then just a little something can happen. And you're just that close, and the courage and the stick-to-it-ness and the confidence and the joy in competition that keeps you moving, that's going to help you throughout life. It helps our country. It's what America is all about. It's why we are so proud to have you all here today. And 4 years from now, I won't be here to greet you, but some President is going to. And then I suspect that a lot of you may come back even 4 years after that. You guys have done a great job, and what an extraordinary achievement it is for all of you to have represented the United States of America at our Olympic and Paralympic Games. <p>Congratulations. Good job. Hey! <p><i>2014 U.S. Paralympic alpine skier Jon Lujan</i>. Mr. President and Mrs. Obama, on behalf of the United States Olympic and Paralympic Teams, we want to present you with these flags that were signed by all the athletes. And just to say thank you from our coaches, staff, and all the USOC athletes that were competing. <p><i>The President</i>. Fantastic. <p>[<i>At this point, Mr. Lujan and 2014 U.S. women's hockey team forward Julie Chu presented the flags to the President and First Lady</i>.] <p><i>The President. </i>All right. Good job. Don't tear up the place! <p><i>Audience member</i>. We already did! <p><i>The President</i>. Did you? [<i>Laughter</i>]\" "
"70" "\"<i>The President.</i> Well, it is a great honor to be here to sign the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act. And I want to talk about Gabriella, the young girl that this bill is named after. <p>When Gabriella, a beautiful, fun-loving, smart young lady, was 9 years old, she was diagnosed with a brain tumor about the size of a walnut. And she was tough, and she knew that she had to fight it, and one of the ways that she did was to&mdash;it was about the size of a walnut, so she smashed walnuts. <p>[<i>At this point, the President addressed Gabriella's brother Jake Miller.</i>] <p>And sometimes, I'll bet you might have helped out. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And she fought the good fight. And Gabriella didn't make it, and she's in a better place, but her parents Mark and Ellyn, along with her little brother Jake, as well as a coalition of outstanding legislators&mdash;Republicans and Democrats, standing behind me&mdash;as well as advocates, decided that in her memory we needed to make sure that we get more money into research for the National Institute of Health so that we can know more about brain tumors, how they affect children relative to adults, what more we can do to make sure that the pain that the Miller family went through is not something that has to be repeated. <p>And so what this legislation is going to do is, it's going to put millions of additional dollars into that research. We're going to need some cooperation from Congress, continuing to work on a bipartisan basis, to actually allocate those dollars in an effective way. I know that NIH is very eager to work on these pediatric cancers, because obviously, nothing is more challenging for a family than to go through something like this, and there's more we can do to prevent it. <p>So I want to thank all the legislators who are standing behind me here today. I want to thank all the advocates who are here with us today. I especially want to thank the Miller family for being here, because it's a wonderful way to remember a wonderful girl. <p>Okay, so, Jake, do you think that I should I start signing? I should? <p><i>Ellyn Miller</i>. Yes, sir [<i>Laughter</i>]. <p><i>The President</i>. Okay. So what I have to do is, I have to use all of these pens, which means I can only use&mdash;for each pen, I can only make, like, half a letter. So it's going to take a little bit of time. Are you okay with that? All right. <p>[<i>The President signed the bill.</i>] <p>There you go. And there's my signature, and the bill is officially signed. But before we finish up, you get the first pen. <p>[<i>The President presented the pen to Jake Miller.</i>] <p><i>Ellyn Miller.</i> Say, \\"Thank you, sir.\\" <p><i>Jake Miller.</i> Thank you. <p><i>The President.</i> You're welcome. <p>All right. Thank you, everybody.\" "
"71" "\"Hi, everybody. Today, our economy is growing and our businesses are consistently generating new jobs. But decades-long trends still threaten the middle class. While those at the top are doing better than ever, too many Americans are working harder than ever, but feel like they can't get ahead. <p>That's why the budget I sent Congress earlier this year is built on the idea of opportunity for all. It will grow the middle class and shrink the deficits we've already cut in half since I took office. <p>It's an opportunity agenda with four goals. Number one is creating more good jobs that pay good wages. Number two is training more Americans with the skills to fill those jobs. Number three is guaranteeing every child access to a great education. And number four is making work pay, with wages you can live on, savings you can retire on, and health care that's there for you when you need it. <p>This week, the Republicans in Congress put forward a very different budget. And it does just the opposite: It shrinks opportunity and makes it harder for Americans who work hard to get ahead. The Republican budget begins by handing out massive tax cuts to households making more than $1 million a year. Then, to keep from blowing a hole in the deficit, they'd have to raise taxes on middle class families with kids. Next, their budget forces deep cuts to investments that help our economy create jobs, like education and scientific research. <p>Now, they won't tell you where these cuts will fall exactly. But compared to my budget, if they cut everything evenly, then within a few years, about 170,000 kids will be cut from early childhood education programs. About 200,000 new mothers and kids will be cut off from programs to help them get healthy food. Schools across the country will lose funding that supports 21,000 special education teachers. And if they want to make smaller cuts to one of these areas, that means larger cuts in others. <p>Not surprisingly, the Republican budget also tries to repeal the Affordable Care Act, even though that would take away health coverage from the more than 7 million Americans who have done the responsible thing and signed up to buy health insurance. And for good measure, the Republican budget guts the rules we put in place to protect the middle class from another financial crisis like the one we've had to fight so hard to recover from. <p>Policies that benefit a fortunate few while making it harder for working Americans to succeed, that's not what we need right now. Our economy doesn't grow best from the top down, it grows best from the middle out. That's what my opportunity agenda does, and that's what I'm going to keep on fighting for. Thanks. And have a great weekend.\" "
"72" "\"Hello, Mustangs! [<i>Applause</i>] Fantastic. Well, everybody have a seat. Have a seat. Thank you, Leah, for the great introduction. Give Leah a big round of applause. Yay! [<i>Applause</i>] Yes. Meeting young people like Leah just makes me inspired. It's a good way to start the week. And all of the students here who are discovering and exploring new ideas is one of the reasons I love visiting schools like Bladensburg High. And so I just want to congratulate all of you for the great work that you're doing. <p>I brought a couple of folks here who are helping to facilitate some of the programs here. My new Deputy Secretary of Labor, Chris Lu, is here. Give him a big round of applause. And some of the biggest champions for education in Prince George's County are here, including your Governor, Martin O'Malley; County Executive Rushern Baker; Mayor Walter James; Superintendent Kevin Maxwell. Your biggest fans in Congress, Donna Edwards and Steny Hoyer. Well, we are proud of all of them, and we're proud of you. <p>All of you remind me, all these young people here, that young people today are working on cooler stuff than they were when I was in high school. In classrooms all across the country, students just like the students here, they're working hard, they're setting their sights high. And we've got to do everything we can to make sure that all of you have a chance to succeed. And that's why your outstanding principal, Aisha Mahoney, is working so hard at this school. That's why Governor O'Malley has been working so hard to repair old schools and build new ones across the State of Maryland. And that's why I'm here today. Because last year, we launched a national competition to redesign America's high schools for the 21st century&mdash;the 21st-century economy. And I'm proud to say that your hard work here has paid off, because one of the winners is Prince George's County. [<i>Applause</i>] Good job. That's right, you guys have done great. <p>Now, let me tell you why this is so important. Many of the young people here, you've grown up in the midst of one of the worst economic crises of our lifetimes. And it's been hard, and it's been painful. There are a lot of families that lost their homes, lost jobs; a lot of families that are still hurting out there. But the work that we've done, the groundwork that we've laid, has created a situation where we're moving in the right direction. Our businesses have created almost 9 million new jobs over the last 4 years. Our high school graduation rate is the highest on record. Dropout rates are going down. Among Latinos, the dropout rate has been cut in half since 2000. More young people are earning college degrees than ever before. We've been bringing troops home from two wars. More than 7 million Americans have now signed up for health coverage through the Affordable Care Act. <p>So we've been making progress, but we've got more work to do to make sure that every one of these young people, that everybody who is willing to work hard, has the chance to get ahead. We've got to make sure that our economy works for everybody, not just a few. We've got to make sure opportunity exists for all people. No matter who you are, no matter where you started out, you've got to have confidence that if you work hard and take responsibility, you can make it. <p>And that's the chance that this country gave me. It's the chance that this country gave Michelle. And that's why we're working so hard for what we call an opportunity agenda, one that gives everybody a shot. And there are four simple goals: We want to create new jobs; we want to make sure that people have the skills to fill those jobs; we want to make sure every young person has a world-class education; and we want to make sure that we reward hard work with things like health care you can count on and wages you can live on. <p>And Maryland and Governor O'Malley have been working alongside us on these issues, and I want to give a special shout-out to the Maryland Legislature because, because of Governor O'Malley's leadership, you are helping to make sure that we are raising more people's wages with your push to raise your minimum wage right here in Maryland. And we're very proud to see that happen. And I hope Governor O'Malley is going to sign it into law soon. Give Maryland a raise. [<i>Applause</i>] That's good work. <p>But the main focus here is guaranteeing every young person has access to a world-class education&mdash;every single student. Now, that starts before high school. We've got to start at the youngest ages by making sure we've got high-quality preschool and other early learning programs for every young child in America. It makes a difference. <p>We've got to make sure that every student has access to the world's information and the world's best technology. And that's why we're moving forward with an initiative we call ConnectED, to finally connect 99 percent of America's students to high-speed Internet in the next few years. It means that we've got to rein in college costs, because I want to make sure that Leah, when she goes to school, she's not burdened with too much debt. And we've got to make it easier to repay student loans, because none of the young people here should be denied a higher education just because your family has trouble affording it. And a world-class education means preparing every young person with the skills they need for college, for a career, and for a lifetime of citizenship. <p>So what we did was, we launched a new competition, backed by America's Departments of Education and Labor, to start redesigning some of our high schools. We call it Youth CareerConnect. And we're offering a hundred million dollars in new grants to help schools and local partners develop and test new curricula and models for success. We want to invest in your future. <p>You guys are all coming up in an age where you're not going to be able to compete with people across town for good jobs, you're going to be competing with the rest of the world. Every&mdash;young people in India and China, they're all interested in trying to figure out how they get a foothold in this world economy. That's who you're competing against. Now, I'm confident you can match or exceed anything they do, but we don't do it by just resting on what we've done before. We've got to outwork and outinnovate and outhustle everybody else. We've got to think about new ways of doing things. <p>And part of our concern has been, our high schools, a lot of them were designed with curriculums based on the 1940s and fifties and sixties and haven't been updated. So the idea behind this competition is how do we start making high school, in particular, more interesting, more exciting, more relevant to young people. <p>Last year, for example, I visited a school called P-TECH&mdash;this is in Brooklyn&mdash;a high school that partnered with IBM and the City University of New York to offer its students not only a high school diploma, but also an associate's degree in computer systems or electromechanical engineering. IBM said that P-TECH graduates would be the first in line for jobs. Then I visited a high school in Nashville that offers academies where students focus on a specific subject area, but they're also getting hands-on experience running their own credit union, working in their own TV studios, learning 3-D printing, tinkering with their own airplane&mdash;which was pretty cool. [<i>Laughter</i>] I never got to do that. I did get my own airplane later in life. [<i>Laughter</i>] But&mdash;although I've got to give it back. [<i>Laughter</i>] I don't get to keep it. <p>But this is stuff I didn't get to do when I was in high school, and I wish I had. But it's stuff you have to know how to do today, in today's economy. Things are moving faster; they're more sophisticated. <p>So we challenged America's high schools to look at what's happening in a place like P-TECH, look at what's happening in cities like Nashville, and then say, what can you do to make sure your students learn the skills that businesses are looking for in high-demand fields? And we asked high schools to develop partnerships with colleges and employers and create classes that focus on real-life applications for the fields of the future, fields like science and technology and engineering and math. And part of the reason we have to do this now is because other countries, they've got a little bit of a lead on us on some of these areas. <p>A country like Germany right now focuses on graduating their high school students with a technical degree equivalent that gives them a head start. So we're asking schools to look into what places like Germany are doing. <p>Now, not every school that enters into this competition for the hundred million dollars is going to win, because we don't have enough money for everybody, and we want to force schools to think hard and redesign them, and we want to reward the schools that are being most innovative and are actually proving some of the concepts that they're trying out. But the great thing is that through this competition, schools across the country that entered have changed the way they prepare their students and have already made enormous improvements, even when&mdash;before they get the grant. And ultimately, we had to choose the top Youth CareerConnect initiatives. Today I'm proud to say that schools across America are putting up some pretty impressive proposals. <p>The winners across the board are doing the kinds of stuff that will allow other schools to start duplicating what they're doing. The winners in Indianapolis are expanding their career prep programs to encourage more young women and kids from diverse backgrounds to join our science and technology workforce. New York City likes that Brooklyn high school model, P-TECH, so much that they're using their grant to fund two more just like it so that students can gain two degrees at once and get the edge they need in today's high-tech, high-speed economy. And as I mentioned earlier, one of our 24 winners is a three-school team including your high school. Mustangs, you guys are part of the team that won! [<i>Applause</i>] That's good. <p>Now, in part, the reason you won is because you guys were ahead of the curve. You were already winning. For a couple years now, your career academies have been integrating classroom learning with ready-to-work skills, and you're preparing students to move directly into the in-demand jobs of the future: jobs in IT and biosciences and hospitality. And now you're stepping it up. You're taking it to another level. So in the classroom I just visited, you had 10th graders&mdash;although there was also a freshman&mdash;who are studying epidemiology, the study of disease patterns and outbreaks. And they're getting potentially college-level credit for it, which is good because there&mdash;they may be the young people who discover a cure for some disease down the line that we don't even know about yet. I know our brilliant scientists at the National Institute for Health and the Center for Disease Control, they'd be proud of you. They like looking at bacteria. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I got a little worried when I went into the classroom. Everybody was wearing goggles and vests, and I didn't have my goggles. So&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. But they assured me it was safe. But some of you Mustangs are pushing yourselves to get industry-recognized certifications in nursing, while other students on this winning team are studying cutting-edge technology and getting hands-on internship experience at local businesses. And we know these are skills that will be in demand. Companies will come looking to hire you because of the experiences you've gotten here. <p>If you're focused, if you're working hard, you now have a platform so that by the time you get out of high school you're already ahead of the game; you're already in a position where you've got some skills that make you employable. And then you can just take it further, whether it's a 2-year college or a 4-year college or graduate school. Or there are a couple of young ladies in there who said they want to be neurosurgeons and psychiatrists. So you can build on these careers, but the point is, you have a baseline where you know if you're focused here at this school, doing your work, you're going to be able to find a job. <p>And the grants that you've won in this Youth CareerConnect competition mean that the programs you've started are going to expand and you're going to get more college and career counseling to help get you a jump on your post-high school plans. So a little over 4 years from now, Bladensburg and your partner schools will graduate hundreds more students with the knowledge and skills that you'll need to succeed. <p>And that's what we want for all the young people here. We want an education that engages you; we want an education that equips you with the rigorous and relevant skills for college and for a career. <p>And I'm confident&mdash;meeting these young people, they were incredible. And a couple of them giggled a little bit when I walked in, but after they kind of settled down&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;they were&mdash;they knew their stuff, and they were enjoying it. And that's part of the message I've got for all the young people here today, is, your potential for success is so high as long as you stay focused. As long as you're clear about your goals, you're going to succeed. <p>And my message to the older people here like me is, we've got a collective responsibility to make sure that you're getting those opportunities. And there are resources out there that we've got to pull into the school setting. Businesses, foundations around the country, they want to fund more CareerConnect programs, because it's in their interest. They want good employees. They're looking for folks with skills. <p>When you can say, \\"Hey, the math that I'm doing here could change the way the business operates,\\" or, \\"I see how this biology experiment could help develop a drug that cures a disease,\\" that's a door opening in your imagination. It's also good for our economy. It's good for our businesses. That's a new career path you're thinking about that allows you to pursue higher education in that field or the very training you need to get a good job or create a new business that changes the world. That's good for our economy, it's good for business; it's good for you, it's good for America. <p>As a country, we've got to do everything we can to make sure that every single young person here can have that \\"aha\\" moment. That light bulb goes off, and suddenly, you're not just studying because your parents tell you to or your teacher tells you to, you're studying because you know you've got something to offer. And I want to make sure every student in America has a chance to get that moment, that realization that your education can not just unlock your future and take you places you never imagined, but you're also going to be leading this country. That's the chance that this country gave to me and Michelle. And that's the chance I want for every single one of you. From preschool for every 4-year-old in America to higher education for everybody who wants to go, every young person deserves a fair shot. And I'm going to keep on doing everything I can to make sure you get that shot and to keep America a place where you can make it if you try. <p>I'm proud of your principal. I'm proud of your superintendent. I'm proud of everybody who got involved in making sure that you guys were already doing the right thing before you won this new grant. And I know it's going to be well spent. Most of all, I'm proud of the students. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. Go, Mustangs! All right.\" "
"73" "\"All right, everybody, please have a seat. <p>I just wanted to stop by and congratulate Maria on officially being sworn in as the head of the SBA. <p>I want to thank the Members of Congress who are here today, as well as the terrific staff at the SBA for helping America's small businesses succeed, and who have been holding down the fort until we got this confirmation through. <p>I nominated Maria because she knows first hand the challenges that small businesses go through, and she has a proven track record of helping them succeed. She was California's secretary of business, transportation, and housing, and in that role she was the driving force behind major public investments in job-creating industries. As the founder of the ProAm&eacute;rica Bank, she supported Latino entrepreneurs throughout Los Angeles. <p>So Maria understands that small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy. They represent the promise that if you work hard in this country, you can succeed, and you can help your children do even better. <p>And that's why this administration has been so focused on helping small businesses succeed from day one. We cut taxes 18 times for small businesses in my first term. We've helped more than 200,000 small businesses get loans supported by the SBA. Today, our economy is growing and our businesses have created almost 9 million new jobs, and a lot of that has to do with the fact that there are small businesses out there who are making things happen every single day. <p>But we can always do more. And that's why having such a hard charger as Maria, who knows both the entrepreneurial side as well as public service, is so important. When I announced her nomination back in January, I was absolutely confident that she was going to do a terrific job. And I am no less confident today. <p>I understand, she already had meetings this morning. She didn't really wait for the ceremony&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;to start meeting with some of our veterans and women-owned businesses and Latino- and African American-owned businesses. And she's going to be out there, I know, listening to small businesses, working with our other agencies that are in charge of helping businesses grow. And I'm confident that by the end of her tenure she's really going to have made her mark and made a difference. And of course, she also has a really beautiful family, which is good too. <p>So with that, Biden is in charge of the next stage of this thing. [<i>Laughter</i>] And he always does a great job. And it's not that many lines&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;so hopefully, we'll get them right. We had a few problems my first time out, but second time went smoothly. So&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. And Joe has done this a lot. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So congratulations again, Maria. Thank you. [<i>At this point, the President left the stage. Vice President Joe Biden delivered brief remarks and then administered the oath of office. Administrator Contreras-Sweet then delivered brief remarks.</i>]\" "
"74" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you, everybody. All right. Well, thanks to my friend, Lilly Ledbetter, not only for that introduction, but for fighting for a simple principle: equal pay for equal work. It's not that complicated. And, Lilly, I assure you, you remain the face of fair pay. [<i>Laughter</i>] People don't want my mug on there. [<i>Laughter</i>] They want your face. <p>As Lilly mentioned, she did not set out to be a trailblazer. She was just somebody who was waking up every day, going to work, doing her job the best that she could. And then one day, she finds out, after years, that she earned less than her male colleagues for doing the same job. I want to make that point again. [<i>Laughter</i>] Doing the same job. This&mdash;sometimes, when you&mdash;when we discuss this issue of fair pay, equal pay for equal work, and the pay gap between men and women, you'll hear all sorts of excuses about: Now, well, they're childbearing, and they're choosing to do this, and they're this, and they're that and the other. She was doing the same job, probably doing it better. [<i>Laughter</i>] Same job. Working just as hard, probably putting in more hours. But she was getting systematically paid less. <p>And so she set out to make sure this country lived up to its founding, the idea that all of us are created equal. And when the courts didn't answer her call, Congress did. <p>The first time Lilly and I stood together in this room was my 10th day in office, and that's when we signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. First bill I signed into law. And some of the leaders who helped make that happen are here today, including Leader Pelosi and Senator Mikulski and Congresswoman DeLauro. I want to thank all the Members of Congress and all the State legislators who are here and all the advocates who are here, because you all contributed to that effort. And I want to give a special thanks to the members of the National Equity Pay&mdash;Equal Pay Task Force, who have done outstanding work to make workplaces across America more fair. <p>Now, we're here because today is Equal Pay Day. [<i>Applause</i>] Equal Pay Day. And it's nice to have a day, but it's even better to have equal pay. And our job is not finished yet. Equal Pay Day means that a woman has to work about this far into 2014 to earn what a man earned in 2013. Think about that. A woman has got to work about 3 more months in order to get what a man got, because she's paid less. That's not fair. That's like adding an extra 6 miles to a marathon. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's not right. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Ain't right. <p><i>The President.</i> Ain't right. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's not right, and it ain't right. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>America should be a level playing field, a fair race for everybody, a place where anybody who's willing to work hard has a chance to get ahead. And restoring that opportunity for every American&mdash;men and women&mdash;has to be a driving focus for our country. <p>Now, the good news is, today our economy is growing. Businesses have created almost 9 million new jobs over the past 4 years. More than 7 million Americans have signed up for health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act. [<i>Applause</i>] That's a good thing too. <p>And I know it's Equal Pay Day and not \\"Obamacare day\\"&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but I do want to point out that the Affordable Care Act guarantees free preventive care, like mammograms and contraceptive care, for tens of millions of women and ends the days when you could be charged more just for being a woman when it comes to your health insurance. And that's true for everybody. That's just one more place where things were not fair. <p>We'll talk about drycleaners next, right&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;because I know that&mdash;I don't know why it costs more for Michelle's blouse than my shirt. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But we've got to make sure that America works for everybody. Anybody who is willing to work hard, they should be able to get ahead. And we've got to build an economy that works for everybody, not just those at the top. Restoring opportunity for all has to be our priority. That's what America is about. It doesn't matter where you started off, what you look like; you work hard, you take responsibility, you make the effort, you should be able to get ahead. <p>And we've got to fight for an opportunity agenda, which means more good jobs that pay good wages and training Americans to make sure that they can fill those jobs and guaranteeing every child a world-class education and making sure the economy rewards hard work for every single American. <p>And part of that is fighting for fair pay for women, because when women succeed, America succeeds. When women succeed, America succeeds. [<i>Applause</i>] It's true. I believe that. It's true. It's true. [<i>Applause</i>] It's true. <p>Now, here's the challenge: Today, the average full-time working woman earns just 77 cents for every dollar a man earns; for African American women, Latinas, it's even less. And in 2014, that's an embarrassment. It is wrong. And this is not just an issue of fairness, it's also a family issue and an economic issue, because women make up about half of our workforce and they're increasingly the breadwinners for a whole lot of families out there. So when they make less money, it means less money for gas, less money for groceries, less money for child care, less money for college tuition, less money is going into retirement savings. <p>And it's all bad for business, because our economy depends on customers out there, and when customers have less money, when hard-working women don't have the resources, that's a problem. When businesses lose terrific women talent because they're fed up with unfair policies, that's bad for business. They lose out on the contributions that those women could be making. When any of our citizens can't fulfill their potential for reasons that have nothing to do with their talent or their character or their work ethic, we're not living up to our founding values. We don't have second-class citizens in this country and certainly not in the workplace. <p>So tomorrow the Senate has the chance to start making this right by passing a bill that Lilly already alluded to: the Paycheck Fairness Act. They've got a chance to do the right thing. And it would put sensible rules into place, like making sure employees who discuss their salaries don't face retaliation by their employers. <p>And it's&mdash;here's why this is important. There are women here today who worked in offices where it was against the rules for employees to discuss salaries with one another. And because of that, they didn't know they were being paid less than men&mdash;just like Lilly didn't know&mdash;for doing the exact same work. For some, it was years before they found out. And even then, it only happened because a manager accidentally let it slip or, as in Lilly's case, a sympathetic coworker quietly passed a note. She only found out she earned less than her male colleagues for doing the same work because somebody left an anonymous note. <p>We can't leave that to chance. And over the course of Lilly's career, she lost more than $200,000 in salary, even more in pension and Social Security benefits&mdash;both of which are pegged to salary&mdash;simply because she was a woman. <p>And Lilly and some of the other women here decided it was wrong, set out to fix it. They went to their bosses; they asked for a raise. That didn't work. They turned to the law; they filed suit. And for some, for years after waiting and persisting, they finally got some justice. <p>Well, tomorrow the Senate could pay tribute to their courage by voting yes for paycheck fairness. This should not be a hard proposition. This should not be that complicated. <p>And so far, Republicans in Congress have been gumming up the works. They've been blocking progress on this issue and, of course, other issues that would help with the economic recovery and help us grow faster. But we don't have to accept that. America, you don't have to sit still. You can make sure that you're putting some pressure on Members of Congress about this issue. And I don't care whether you're a Democrat or a Republican. If you're a voter&mdash;if you've got a daughter, you've got a sister, you've got a mom&mdash;I know you got a mom&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;this is something you should care about. <p>And I'm not going to stand still either. So in this year of action I've used my executive authority whenever I could to create opportunity for more Americans. And today I'm going to take action&mdash;executive action&mdash;to make it easier for working women to earn fair pay. So first, I'm going to sign an Executive order to create more pay transparency by prohibiting Federal contractors from retaliating against employees who discuss their pay with each other. <p><i>Audience member</i>. Excellent! <p><i>The President</i>. Right? Pay secrecy fosters discrimination, and we should not tolerate it, not in Federal contracting or anywhere else. <p>Second, I'm signing a Presidential memorandum directing the Department of Labor and our outstanding Secretary of Labor, Tom Perez, to require Federal contractors to provide data about their employee compensation so pay discrimination can be spotted more easily. <p>Now, I want to be clear: There are great employers out there who do the right thing. And there are plenty of employers out there who are absolutely certain that there's no pay discrimination happening in their offices. But then sometimes, when the data is laid out, it paints a different picture. Many times, they then do everything they can to fix the problem, and so we want to encourage them to fix these problems if they exist by making sure that the data is out there. <p>So everybody who cares about this should pay attention to how the Senate votes tomorrow on this payness&mdash;Paycheck Fairness Act, because the majority of Senators support this bill, but 2 years ago, a minority of Senate Republicans blocked it from getting a vote. Even worse, some commentators are out there saying that the pay gap doesn't even exist. They say it's a myth. But it's not a myth, it's math. [<i>Laughter</i>] You can look at the paychecks. You can look at the stubs. <p>I mean, Lilly Ledbetter didn't just make this up. [<i>Laughter</i>] The court, when it looked at the documents, said, yes, yes, you've been getting paid less for doing the same job. It's just the court then said, you know, it's been&mdash;as Lilly said&mdash;it's been happening so long, you can't do anything about it anymore, which made no sense, and that's why we had to sign another bill. It's basic math that adds up to real money. It makes a real difference for a lot of Americans who are working hard to support their families. <p>And of course, the fact that we've got some resistance from some folks on this issue up on Capitol Hill just fits with this larger problem, this vision that the congressional Republicans seem to be continually embracing, this notion that, you know what, you're just on your own, no matter how unfair things are. You see it in their budget. The budget the Republicans in Congress just put forward last week, it's like a bad rerun. It would give massive tax cuts to households making more than a million dollars a year, force deep cuts to things that actually help working families, like early education and college grants and job training. <p>And of course, it includes that novel idea of repealing the Affordable Care Act. [<i>Laughter</i>] Fiftieth time they've tried that, which would mean the more than 7 million Americans who've done the responsible thing and signed up to buy health insurance, they'd lose their health insurance, and the 3 million young adults who've stayed on their parent's plan, they'd no longer have that available; take us back to the days when insurers could charge women more just for being a woman. <p>On minimum wage, three out of four Americans support raising the minimum wage. Usually, when three out of four Americans support something, Members of Congress are right there. [<i>Laughter</i>] And yet here, Republicans in Congress are dead set against it, blocking a pay raise for tens of millions of Americans, a majority of them women. This isn't just about treating women fairly, this is about Republicans seemingly opposing any efforts to even the playing field for working families. <p>And I was up in Michigan last week, and I just asked, I don't understand the&mdash;fully the theory behind this. I don't know why you would resist the idea that women should be paid the same as men and then deny that that's not always happening out there. If Republicans in Congress want to prove me wrong, if they want to show that they, in fact, do care about women being paid the same as men, then show me. They can start tomorrow. They can join us in this, the 21st century, and vote yes on the Paycheck Fairness Act. [<i>Applause</i>] Vote yes. <p>And if anybody is watching or listening, if you care about this issue, then let your Senators know where you stand, because America deserves equal pay for equal work. <p>This is not something we're going to achieve in a day. There's going to be a lot of stuff that we've got to do to close the pay gap. We got to make it possible for more women to enter high-paying fields that up until now have been dominated by men, like engineering and computer science. Women hold less than 6 percent of our country's commercial patents. That's not good enough. We need more parents and high school teachers and college professors encouraging girls and women to study math and science. We need more businesses to make gender diversity a priority when they hire and when they promote. Fewer than 5 percent of Fortune 500 companies have women at the helm. <p>I think we'd all agree that we need more women in Congress. [<i>Applause</i>] You know? Fewer than 20 percent of congressional seats are held by women. Clearly, Congress would get more done if the ratio was&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;evened out a little bit. So we've got to work on that. <p>And we've all got to do more to make our workplaces more welcoming to women. Because the numbers show that even when men and women are in the same profession and have the same education, there's still a wage gap, and it widens over time. So we're going to keep making the case for why these policies are the right ones for working families and businesses. And this is all going to lead up to this first-ever White House Summit on Working Families on June 23. <p>So ultimately, equal pay is not just an economic issue for millions of Americans and their families. It's also about whether we're willing to build an economy that works for everybody and whether we're going to do our part to make sure that our daughters have the same chances to pursue their dreams as our sons and whether or not we're willing to restore to the heart of this country that basic idea: You can make it, no matter who you are, if you try. <p>And that's personal for me. I've said this before: I've got two daughters, and I expect them to be treated just like anybody's sons. And I think about my single mom working hard, going to school, trying to raise two kids all at the same time. And I think about my grandmother trying to work her way up through her career and then hitting the glass ceiling. And I've seen how hard they've worked, and I've seen how they've sucked it up. And they put up with stuff, and they don't say anything, and they just take care of their family, and they take care of themselves, and they don't complain a lot. But at a certain point, we have the power to do something about it for the next generation. And this is a good place to start. <p>So for everybody out there who's listening, ask your Senator where you stand on paycheck fairness. If they tell you that there's not a pay gap out there, you tell them to look at the data, because there is. It's time to get this done. And I'm going to do my small part right now by signing these Executive orders and Presidential memoranda. <p>All right. Scoot on over here guys. Come on, let's scoot in here. Scoot in here. All right. <p>[<i>At this point, the President signed the Executive order.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> There you go. That's done right there. <p>All right, and then I got another one. This is for you, Tom. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>The President signed the memorandum.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> There you go.\" "

For Danny, said his fianc&eacute;e, being in the Army \\"was his life.\\" Carlos, said a friend, was \\"the epitome of what you would want a leader to be in the Army.\\" Timothy helped counsel his fellow soldiers. Said a friend, \\"He was always the person you could go to talk to.\\" <p>And it was love for their comrades, for all of you, that defined their last moments. As we've heard, when the gunman tried to push his way into that room, Danny held the door shut, saving the lives of others while sacrificing his own. And it's said that Timothy&mdash;the counselor, even then&mdash;gave his life walking toward the gunman, trying to calm him down. <p>For you, their families, no words are equal to your loss. We are here on behalf of the American people to honor your loved ones and to offer whatever comfort we can. But know this: We also draw strength from you. For even in your grief, even as your heart breaks, we see in you that eternal truth: \\"Love never ends.\\" <p>To the parents of these men: As a father, I cannot begin to fathom your anguish. But I know that you poured your love and your hopes into your sons. I know that the men and soldiers they became&mdash;their sense of service and their patriotism&mdash;so much of that came from you. You gave your sons to America, and just as you will honor them always, so too will the Nation that they served. <p>To the loves of their lives&mdash;Timothy's wife Billy and Danny's fianc&eacute;e Kristen&mdash;these soldiers cherished the Army, but their hearts belonged to you. And that's a bond that no earthly power can ever break. They have slipped from your embrace, but know that you will never be alone, because this Army and this Nation stands with you for all the days to come. <p>To their children: We live in a dangerous world, and your fathers served to keep you safe and us safe. They knew you have so much to give to our country, that you'd make them proud. Timothy's daughter Lori already has. Last Wednesday night, she posted this message online: \\"I just want everyone to think for a moment.\\" Love your family, she said, \\"because you never know when [they're] gonna be taken from you. I love you, daddy.\\" <p>And to the men and women of Fort Hood: As has already been mentioned, part of what makes this so painful is that we have been here before. This tragedy tears at wounds still raw from 5 years ago. Once more, soldiers who survived foreign war zones were struck down here at home, where they're supposed to be safe. We still do not yet know exactly why, but we do know this: We must honor their lives, not \\"in word or talk, but in deed and in truth.\\" <p>We must honor these men with a renewed commitment to keep our troops safe, not just in battle, but on the homefront as well. In our open society, and at vast bases like this, we can never eliminate every risk. But as a nation, we can do more to help counsel those with mental health issues, to keep firearms out of the hands of those who are having such deep difficulties. As a military, we must continue to do everything in our power to secure our facilities and spare others this pain. <p>We must honor these men by doing more to care for our fellow Americans living with mental illness, civilian and military. Today, four American soldiers are gone. Four Army families are devastated. As Commander in Chief, I'm determined that we will continue to step up our efforts to reach our troops and veterans who are hurting, to deliver to them the care that they need, and to make sure we never stigmatize those who have the courage to seek help. <p>And finally, we must honor these men by recognizing that they were members of a generation that has borne the burden of our security in more than a decade of war. Now our troops are coming home, and by the end of this year, our war in Afghanistan will finally be over. <p>In an era when fewer Americans know someone in uniform, every American must see these men and these women&mdash;our 9/11 generation&mdash;as the extraordinary citizens that they are. They love their families. They excel at their jobs. They serve their communities. They are leaders. And when we truly welcome our veterans home, when we show them that we need them&mdash;not just to fight in other countries, but to build up our own&mdash;then our schools and our businesses, our communities and our Nation, will be more successful, and America will be stronger and more united for decades to come. <p>Sergeant First Class Daniel Ferguson. Staff Sergeant Carlos Lazaney-Rodriguez. Sergeant Timothy Owens. Like the 576 Fort Hood soldiers who have given their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan, they were taken from us much too soon. Like the 13 Americans we lost 5 years ago, their passing shakes our soul. And in moments such as this, we summon once more what we've learned in these hard years of war. We reach within our wounded hearts. We lean on each other. We hold each other up. We carry on. And with God's amazing grace, we somehow bear what seems unbearable. <p>\\"Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends.\\" May God watch over these American soldiers, may He keep strong their families whose love endures, and may God continue to bless the United States of America with patriots such as these.\" "
"76" "\"Please, please, have a seat. Thank you. <p>What a singular honor it is for me to be here today. I want to thank, first and foremost, the Johnson family for giving us this opportunity and the graciousness with which Michelle and I have been received. <p>We came down a little bit late because we were upstairs looking at some of the exhibits and some of the private offices that were used by President Johnson and Mrs. Johnson. And Michelle was in particular interested to&mdash;of a recording in which Lady Bird is critiquing President Johnson's performance. [<i>Laughter</i>] And she said, \\"Come, come, you need to listen to this.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] And she pressed the button and nodded her head. Some things do not change&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;even 50 years later. <p>To all the Members of Congress, the warriors for justice, the elected officials and community leaders who are here today, I want to thank you. <p>Four days into his sudden Presidency&mdash;and the night before he would address a Joint Session of the Congress in which he once served&mdash;Lyndon Johnson sat around a table with his closest advisers, preparing his remarks to a shattered and grieving nation. <p>He wanted to call on Senators and Representatives to pass a civil rights bill, the most sweeping since Reconstruction. And most of his staff counseled him against it. They said it was hopeless; that it would anger powerful Southern Democrats and Committee Chairmen; that it risked derailing the rest of his domestic agenda. And one particularly bold aide said he did not believe a President should spend his time and power on lost causes, however worthy they might be. To which, it is said, President Johnson replied, \\"Well, what the hell's the Presidency for?\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] What the hell's the Presidency for if not to fight for causes you believe in? <p>Today, as we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, we honor the men and women who made it possible. Some of them are here today. We celebrate giants like John Lewis and Andrew Young and Julian Bond. We recall the countless unheralded Americans&mdash;Black and White, students and scholars, preachers and housekeepers&mdash;whose names are etched not on monuments, but in the hearts of their loved ones and in the fabric of the country that they helped to change. <p>But we also gather here, deep in the heart of the State that shaped him, to recall one giant man's remarkable efforts to make real the promise of our founding: \\"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\\" <p>Those of us who have had the singular privilege to hold the office of the Presidency know well that progress in this country can be hard and it can be slow, frustrating, and sometimes, you're stymied. The office humbles you. You're reminded daily that in this great democracy, you are but a relay swimmer in the currents of history, bound by decisions made by those who came before, reliant on the efforts of those who will follow to fully vindicate your vision. <p>But the Presidency also affords a unique opportunity to bend those currents: by shaping our laws and by shaping our debates; by working within the confines of the world as it is, but also by reimagining the world as it should be. This was President Johnson's genius. As a master of politics and the legislative process, he grasped like few others the power of government to bring about change. <p>LBJ was nothing if not a realist. He was well aware that the law alone isn't enough to change hearts and minds. A full century after Lincoln's time, he said, \\"Until justice is blind to color, until education is unaware of race, until opportunity is unconcerned with the color of men's skins, emancipation will be a proclamation, but not a fact.\\" <p>He understood laws couldn't accomplish everything. But he also knew that only the law could anchor change and set hearts and minds on a different course. And a lot of Americans needed the law's most basic protections at that time. As Dr. King said at the time, \\"It may be true that the law can't make a man love me, but it can keep him from lynching me, and I think that's pretty important.\\" <p>And passing laws was what LBJ knew how to do. No one knew politics and no one loved legislating more than President Johnson. He was charming when he needed to be, ruthless when required. [<i>Laughter</i>] He could wear you down with logic and argument. He could horse trade, and he could flatter. \\"You come with me on this bill,\\" he would reportedly tell a key Republican leader from my home State during the fight for the civil rights bill, \\"and 200 years from now, schoolchildren will know only two names: Abraham Lincoln and Everett Dirksen!\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] And he knew that Senators would believe things like that. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>President Johnson liked power. He liked the feel of it, the wielding of it. But that hunger was harnessed and redeemed by a deeper understanding of the human condition; by a sympathy for the underdog, for the downtrodden, for the outcast. And it was a sympathy rooted in his own experience. <p>As a young boy growing up in the Texas Hill Country, Johnson knew what being poor felt like. \\"Poverty was so common,\\" he would later say, \\"we didn't even know it had a name.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] The family home didn't have electricity or indoor plumbing. Everybody worked hard, including the children. President Johnson had known the metallic taste of hunger; the feel of a mother's calloused hands, rubbed raw from washing and cleaning and holding a household together. His cousin Ava remembered sweltering days spent on her hands and knees in the cotton fields, with Lyndon whispering beside her: \\"Boy, there's got to be a better way to make a living than this. There's got to be a better way.\\" <p>It wasn't until years later when he was teaching at a so-called Mexican school in a tiny town in Texas that he came to understand how much worse the persistent pain of poverty could be for other races in a Jim Crow South. Oftentimes, his students would show up to class hungry. And when he'd visit their homes, he'd meet fathers who were paid slave wages by the farmers they worked for. Those children were taught, he would later say, \\"that the end of life is in a beet row, a spinach field, or a cotton patch.\\" <p>Deprivation and discrimination: These were not abstractions to Lyndon Baines Johnson. He knew that poverty and injustice are as inseparable as opportunity and justice are joined. So that was in him from an early age. <p>Now, like any of us, he was not a perfect man. His experiences in rural Texas may have stretched his moral imagination, but he was ambitious, very ambitious, a young man in a hurry to plot his own escape from poverty and to chart his own political career. And in the Jim Crow South, that meant not challenging convention. During his first 20 years in Congress, he opposed every civil rights bill that came up for a vote, once calling the push for Federal legislation \\"a farce and a sham.\\" He was chosen as a Vice Presidential nominee in part because of his affinity with&mdash;and ability to deliver&mdash;that Southern White vote. And at the beginning of the Kennedy administration, he shared with President Kennedy a caution towards racial controversy. <p>But marchers kept marching. Four little girls were killed in a church. Bloody Sunday happened. The winds of change blew. And when the time came, when LBJ stood in the Oval Office&mdash;I picture him standing there, taking up the entire doorframe, looking out over the South Lawn in a quiet moment&mdash;and asked himself what the true purpose of his office was for, what was the endpoint of his ambitions, he would reach back in his own memory, and he'd remember his own experience with want. <p>And he knew that he had a unique capacity, as the most powerful White politician from the South, to not merely challenge the convention that had crushed the dreams of so many, but to ultimately dismantle for good the structures of legal segregation. He's the only guy who could do it. And he knew there would be a cost, famously saying the Democratic Party may \\"have lost the South for a generation.\\" <p>That's what his Presidency was for. That's where he meets his moment. And possessed with an iron will, possessed with those skills that he had honed so many years in Congress, pushed and supported by a movement of those willing to sacrifice everything for their own liberation, President Johnson fought for and argued and horse traded and bullied and persuaded until ultimately, he signed the Civil Rights Act into law. <p>And he didn't stop there, even though his advisers again told him to wait, again told him, let the dust settle, let the country absorb this momentous decision. He shook them off. \\"The meat in the coconut,\\" as President Johnson would put it, was the Voting Rights Act, so he fought for and passed that as well. Immigration reform came shortly after. And then, a Fair Housing Act. And then, a health care law that opponents described as \\"socialized medicine\\" that would curtail America's freedom, but ultimately freed millions of seniors from the fear that illness could rob them of dignity and security in their golden years, which we now know today as Medicare. <p>What President Johnson understood was that equality required more than the absence of oppression. It required the presence of economic opportunity. He wouldn't be as eloquent as Dr. King would be in describing that linkage, as Dr. King moved into mobilizing sanitation workers and a poor people's movement, but he understood that connection because he had lived it. A decent job, decent wages, health care&mdash;those too were civil rights worth fighting for. An economy where hard work is rewarded and success is shared, that was his goal. And he knew, as someone who had seen the New Deal transform the landscape of his Texas childhood, who had seen the difference electricity had made because of the Tennessee Valley Authority, the transformation concretely day in and day out in the life of his own family, he understood that Government had a role to play in broadening prosperity to all those who would strive for it. <p>\\"We want to open the gates to opportunity,\\" President Johnson said, \\"but we are also going to give all our people, Black and White, the help they need to walk through those gates.\\" <p>Now, if some of this sounds familiar, it's because today, we remain locked in this same great debate about equality and opportunity and the role of government in ensuring each. As was true 50 years ago, there are those who dismiss the Great Society as a failed experiment and an encroachment on liberty; who argue that government has become the true source of all that ails us and that poverty is due to the moral failings of those who suffer from it. There are also those who argue, John, that nothing has changed; that racism is so embedded in our DNA that there is no use trying politics. The game is rigged. <p>But such theories ignore history. Yes, it's true that despite laws like the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act and Medicare, our society is still racked with division and poverty. Yes, race still colors our political debates, and there have been government programs that have fallen short. In a time when cynicism is too often passed off as wisdom, it's perhaps easy to conclude that there are limits to change; that we are trapped by our own history; and politics is a fool's errand; and we'd be better off if we roll back big chunks of LBJ's legacy, or at least if we don't put too much of our hope, invest too much of our hope, in our government. <p>I reject such thinking. Not just because Medicare and Medicaid have lifted millions from suffering; not just because the poverty rate in this Nation would be far worse without food stamps and Head Start and all the Great Society programs that survive to this day. I reject such cynicism because I have lived out the promise of LBJ's efforts; because Michelle has lived out the legacy of those efforts; because my daughters have lived out the legacy of those efforts; because I and millions of my generation were in a position to take the baton that he handed to us. <p>Because of the civil rights movement, because of the laws President Johnson signed, new doors of opportunity and education swung open for everybody, not all at once, but they swung open. Not just Blacks and Whites, but also women and Latinos and Asians and Native Americans and gay Americans and Americans with a disability. They swung open for you, and they swung open for me. And that's why I'm standing here today, because of those efforts, because of that legacy. <p>And that means we've got a debt to pay. That means we can't afford to be cynical. Half a century later, the laws LBJ passed are now as fundamental to our conception of ourselves and our democracy as the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. They are foundational, an essential piece of the American character. <p>But we are here today because we know we cannot be complacent. For history travels not only forwards, history can travel backwards; history can travel sideways. And securing the gains this country has made requires the vigilance of its citizens. Our rights, our freedoms, they are not given. They must be won. They must be nurtured through struggle and discipline and persistence and faith. <p>And one concern I have sometimes during these moments&mdash;the celebration of the signing of the Civil Rights Act, the March on Washington&mdash;from a distance, sometimes, these commemorations seem inevitable, they seem easy. All the pain and difficulty and struggle and doubt, all that's rubbed away. And we look at ourselves, and we say, oh, things are just too different now; we couldn't possibly do what was done then&mdash;these giants, what they accomplished. And yet they were men and women too. It wasn't easy then. It wasn't certain then. <p>Still, the story of America is a story of progress. However slow, however incomplete, however harshly challenged at each point on our journey, however flawed our leaders, however many times we have to take a quarter of a loaf or half a loaf, the story of America is a story of progress. And that's true because of men like President Lyndon Baines Johnson. <p>In so many ways, he embodied America, with all our gifts and all our flaws, in all our restlessness and all our big dreams. This man&mdash;born into poverty, weaned in a world full of racial hatred&mdash;somehow found within himself the ability to connect his experience with the Brown child in a small Texas town; the White child in Appalachia; the Black child in Watts. As powerful as he became in that Oval Office, he understood them. He understood what it meant to be on the outside. And he believed that their plight was his plight too, that his freedom ultimately was wrapped up in theirs, and that making their lives better was what the hell the Presidency was for. <p>And those children were on his mind when he strode to the podium that night in the House Chamber, when he called for the vote on the civil rights law. \\"It never occurred to me,\\" he said, \\"in my fondest dreams that I might have the chance to help the sons and daughters of those students\\" that he had taught so many years ago, \\"and to help people like them all over this country. But now I do have that chance&mdash;and I'll let you in on a secret&mdash;I mean to use it. And I hope that you will use it with me.\\" <p>That was LBJ's greatness. That's why we remember him. And if there is one thing that he and this year's anniversary should teach us, if there's one lesson I hope that Malia and Sasha and young people everywhere learn from this day, it's that with enough effort and enough empathy and enough perseverance and enough courage, people who love their country can change it. <p>In his final year, President Johnson stood on this stage, racked with pain, battered by the controversies of Vietnam, looking far older than his 64 years, and he delivered what would be his final public speech. \\"We have proved that great progress is possible,\\" he said. \\"We know how much still remains to be done. And if our efforts continue, and if our will is strong, and if our hearts are right, and if courage remains our constant companion, then, my fellow Americans, I am confident, we shall overcome.\\" <p>We shall overcome. We, the citizens of the United States. Like Dr. King, like Abraham Lincoln, like countless citizens who have driven this country inexorably forward, President Johnson knew that ours in the end is a story of optimism, a story of achievement and constant striving that is unique upon this Earth. He knew because he had lived that story. He believed that together we can build an America that is more fair, more equal, and more free than the one we inherited. He believed we make our own destiny. And in part because of him, we must believe it as well. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"77" "\"<i>The President. </i>Thank you so much. It is good to be at the National Action Network. It is good to be here with some good friends. <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. That's why I'm here. <p>It is wonderful to be with all of you. I want to say, first of all, thank you to your leader, Reverend Al Sharpton. Give him a big round of applause. And I appreciate the idea of being an \\"action\\" President, although I do also have style&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I just want to point that out. I know it's not about it, but I just&mdash;but I do have it. [<i>Laughter</i>] Al is not the only guy with style. <p>We've got Barbara Arnwine here today, and we want to thank her. Clayola Brown, thank you. Melanie Campbell, thank you. Marc Morial, thank you. We've got Members of Congress, State and local officials from New York. And of course, we've got all of you. So thanks to all of you for such a wonderful welcome. <p>Everybody, sit down. [<i>Laughter</i>] Sit down. Al doesn't know how to get back to his seat. [<i>Laughter</i>] Help&mdash;somebody help out the leader here. But don't make him jump over it. Okay, they're going to explain it. There we go. All right. You're going to be all right. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, the last time I was here was 3 years ago, and a few things have changed since then. I am here as a second-term President. I have more gray hair. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's all right. Let's see, what else? I've got twice as many dogs. I'm glad I won't have to serve a third term, because three dogs is too many. I can't keep on promising Malia and Sasha another dog. <p>Of course, one thing that has not changed is your commitment to the cause of civil rights for everybody and opportunity for all people. And that's been something that's been on my mind this week. Some of you may know that yesterday I was down in Austin, Texas, at the LBJ Library to speak on the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act and the man who signed it into law. And standing there, I thought of all the Americans, known and unknown, who made it possible for me to stand in that spot, who marched and organized and sat in and stood up for jobs and for justice. And I thought of all who achieved that great victory and others, not just with respect to the Civil Rights Act, but the Voting Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act and immigration reform and Medicare and Medicaid and the first battles of a long War on Poverty. <p>And over the past 5 years, in the wake of the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes, we've won some victories too. Nearly 9 million new jobs at America's businesses over the past 4 years. Seven and a half million Americans signing up to buy health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act. And millions more who have gained coverage through Medicaid and CHIP and young people being able to stay on their parents' plans. The rate of uninsured Americans is down. High school dropout rates are down. Our high school graduation rate is the highest on record. More young people are earning college degrees than ever before. We've made progress, and we've taken action. <p>But we also know our work is unfinished. Too many Americans working harder than ever just to get by. Too many Americans who aren't working at all. So we we're getting&mdash;we know we have to do more to restore America's promise of opportunity for all people, particularly for communities hardest hit by the recession, particularly for those who struggled since long before the recession, not only African Americans and Latinos, but Americans trapped across the country in pockets of poverty: inner city, suburban, rural. <p>And we know what opportunity means. Opportunity means more good jobs that pay good wages. Opportunity means training folks for those jobs. Opportunity means changing the odds for all of our children through pre-K, something Mayor de Blasio is fighting for here in New York City. And it&mdash;opportunity means affordable higher education for all who are willing to work for it. Opportunity means answering the call to be my brother's keeper and helping more boys and young men of color stay on track and reach their full potential. <p>Before I came out, I was in a photo line, saw my good friend Freddie Haynes, a great pastor from the great State of Texas. And he told me this summer they're going to hire 100 young men, pay them $10.10 an hour&mdash;maybe $10.50&mdash;as a consequence of this call. And the point is, is that My Brother's Keeper, that's not just something I do, that's not just something the Government does. That's something everybody can participate in, because we know these young men need support. <p>Opportunity means making the minimum wage a wage you can live on. It means equal pay for equal work. It means overtime pay for workers who've earned it. It means continuing to extend the right of quality, affordable health care for every American in every State, because we've got some States that aren't doing the right thing. We have States who just out of political spite are leaving millions of people uninsured that could be getting health insurance right now. No good reason for it. If you ask them what's the explanation, they can't really tell you. <p>And by the way, making sure our citizens have the opportunity to lead healthy lives also means dealing with things like the dangerous carbon pollution that's disproportionately affecting low-income communities. It means making sure that our young people are eating right, so listen to Michelle. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm just saying. <p>So we know we've got more work to do to bridge the gap between our founding ideals and the realities of our time. And the question then becomes, well, how do we actually make these changes? How does it happen? How do we get a minimum wage bill passed? How do we make sure that those States that aren't yet implementing Affordable Care Act actually are doing right by their citizens? It means being vigilant. We've got to be vigilant to secure the gains we've made, but also to make more gains in the future. <p>And that's the meaning of these last 50 years since the Civil Rights Act was passed. Because across the country, right now there are well-organized and well-funded efforts to undo these gains. And one of those gains is under particular assault right now, and that's what I want to spend the rest of my time here talking about. <p>Just as inequality feeds on injustice, opportunity requires justice. And justice requires the right to vote. Johnson&mdash;President Johnson, right after he signed the Civil Rights Act into law, told his advisers&mdash;some of whom were telling him, well, all right, just wait; you've done a big thing now; let's let the dust settle, don't stir folks up. He said, no, no, I can't wait. We've got to press forward and pass the Voting Rights Act. Johnson said: \\"About this there can and should be no argument. Every American citizen must have an equal right to vote.\\" <p>Voting is a time when we all have an equal say: Black or White, rich or poor, man or woman. Doesn't matter. In the eyes of the law and in the eyes of our democracy, we're all supposed to have that equal right to cast our ballot to help determine the direction of our society. <p>The principle of one person, one vote is the single greatest tool we have to redress an unjust status quo. You would think there would not be an argument about this anymore. But the stark, simple truth is this: The right to vote is threatened today in a way that it has not been since the Voting Rights Act became law nearly five decades ago. <p>Across the country, Republicans have led efforts to pass laws making it harder, not easier, for people to vote. In some places, women could be turned away from polls just because they're registered under their maiden name, but their driver's license has their married name. Senior citizens who have been voting for decades may suddenly be told they can no longer vote until they can come up with the right ID. <p>In other places, folks may learn that without a document like a passport or a birth certificate, they can't register. About 60 percent of Americans don't have a passport. Just because you don't have the money to travel abroad doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to vote here at home. And just to be clear, I know where my birth certificate is, but a lot of people don't. [<i>Laughter</i>] A lot of people don't. I think it's still up on a website somewhere. [<i>Laughter</i>] You remember that? That was crazy. That was some crazy stuff. [<i>Laughter</i>] I hadn't thought about that in a while. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, I want to be clear: I am not against reasonable attempts to secure the ballot. We understand that there has to be rules in place. But I am against requiring an ID that millions of Americans don't have. That shouldn't suddenly prevent you from exercising your right to vote. <p>The first words put to paper in our American story tell us that all of us are created equal. And we understand that it took a long time to make sure that those words meant something. But 50 years ago, we put laws in place, because of enormous struggles, to vindicate that idea, to make our democracy truly mean something. And that makes it wrong to pass laws that make it harder for any eligible citizen to vote, especially because every citizen doesn't just have the right to vote, they have a responsibility to vote. <p>So yes, we're right to be on guard against voter fraud. Voter fraud would impinge on our democracy as well. We don't want folks voting that shouldn't be voting. We all agree on that. Let's stipulate to that, as the lawyers say. <p>But there's a reason why those who argue that harsh restrictions on voting are somehow necessary to fight voter fraud are having such a hard time proving any real, widespread voter fraud. So I just want to give you some statistics. One recent study found only 10 cases of alleged in-person voter impersonation in 12 years&mdash;10 cases. Another analysis found that out of 197 million votes cast for Federal elections between 2002 and 2005, only 40 voters&mdash;out of 197 million&mdash;were indicted for fraud. Now, for those of you who are math majors, as a percentage, that is 0.00002 percent. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's not a lot. So let's be clear: The real voter fraud is people who try to deny our rights by making bogus arguments about voter fraud. <p>And I have to say, there have been some&mdash;some of these officials who have been passing these laws have been more blunt. They said, this is going to be good for the Republican Party. Some of them have not been shy about saying that they're doing this for partisan reasons. <p>\\"It is wrong,\\" President Johnson said, \\"deadly wrong, to deny any of your fellow Americans the right to vote in this country.\\" It is wrong to change our election rules just because of politics. It is wrong to make citizens wait for 5, 6, 7 hours just to vote. It is wrong to make a senior citizen who no longer has a driver's license jump through hoops and have to pay money just to exercise the rights she has cherished for a lifetime. America did not stand up and did not march and did not sacrifice to gain the right to vote for themselves and for others only to see it denied to their kids and their grandchildren. We've got to pay attention to this. <p>Some of the folks from Chicago know&mdash;Crider knows&mdash;one of the first jobs I had out of law school was to lead a voter registration drive in my home State of Illinois. We registered more than 150,000 new voters. And as an organizer, I got to help other citizens exercise their most cherished and fundamental rights. That mattered to me. <p>And as President, I'm not going to let attacks on these rights go unchallenged. We're not going to let voter suppression go unchallenged. So earlier this week, you heard from the Attorney General, and there's a reason the agency he runs is called the Department of Justice. They've taken on more than a hundred voting rights cases since 2009. They've defended the rights of everybody from African Americans to Spanish speakers, to soldiers serving overseas. <p>Earlier this year, a bipartisan commission I appointed chaired by my election lawyer and Mitt Romney's election lawyer came up with a series of modern&mdash;or commonsense reforms to modernize voter registration and to curb the potential for fraud in smart way and ensure that no one has to wait for more than half an hour to cast a ballot. States and local election boards should take up those recommendations. And with the 50th anniversary of Freedom Summer almost upon us, I urge Members of Congress to honor those who gave their lives so that others could exercise their rights and update the Voting Rights Act. Go ahead and get that done. <p>Do it because the right to vote is something cherished by every American. We should not be having an argument about this. There are a lot of things we can argue about, but the right to vote? I mean, what kind of political platform is that? [<i>Laughter</i>] Why would you make that a part of your agenda, preventing people from voting? How can you defend that? There are a whole bunch of folks out there who don't vote for me, didn't vote for me, don't like what I do. The idea that I would prevent them from voting and exercising their franchise makes no sense. <p>Black or White, man or woman, urban, rural, rich, poor, Native American, disabled, gay, straight, Republican or Democrat&mdash;voters who want to vote should be able to vote. Period. Full stop. Voting is not a Democratic issue, it's not a Republican issue. It's an issue of citizenship. It's what makes our democracy strong. <p>But it's a fact: This recent effort to restrict the vote has not been led by both parties, it's been led by the Republican Party. And in fairness, it's not just Democrats who are concerned. You had one Republican State legislator point out&mdash;and I'm quoting here&mdash;\\"Making it more difficult for people to vote is not a good sign for a party that wants to attract more people.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] That was a pretty&mdash;that's a good insight. [<i>Laughter</i>] Right? I want a competitive Republican Party, just like a competitive Democratic Party. That's how our democracy is supposed to work: the competition of ideas. But I don't want folks changing the rules to try to restrict people's access to the ballot. <p>And I think responsible people, regardless of your party affiliation, should agree with that. If your strategy depends on having fewer people show up to vote, that's not a sign of strength, that's a sign of weakness. <p>And not only is it ultimately bad politics. I believe ultimately it harms the entire country. If voting is denied to the many, we risk ending up stuck year after year with special interest policies that benefit a fortunate few. And injustice perpetuates inequality. But remember, just as injustice perpetuates inequality, justice opens up opportunity. And as infuriating as efforts to roll back hard-earned rights can be, the trajectory of our history has to give us hope. The story of America is a story of progress. No matter how often or how intensely that progress has been challenged, ultimately, this Nation has moved forward. As Dr. King said, \\"The arc of the moral universe is long, [but; White House correction.] it bends towards justice.\\" We move forward on civil rights and we move forward on workers' rights, and we move forward on women's rights and disability rights and gay rights. We show that when ordinary citizens come together to participate in this democracy we love, justice will not be denied. So the single most important thing we can do to protect our right to vote is to vote.<p>So I'm going to make one last point here. We're going to have an Attorney General that looks at all the laws that are being passed. We're going to have civic organizations that are making sure that State laws and local laws are doing what they're supposed to do. We will fight back whenever we see unfairly the franchise being challenged. But the truth is that, for all these laws that are being put in place, the biggest problem we have is people giving up their own power, voluntarily not participating. <p>The number of people who voluntarily don't vote, who are eligible to vote, dwarfs whatever these laws are put in place might do in terms of diminishing the voting rolls. <p>So we can't treat these new barriers as an excuse not to participate. We can't use cynicism as an excuse not to participate. Sometimes, I hear people saying, well, we haven't gotten everything we needed. You know? We still have poverty. We still have problems. Of course. These things didn't happen overnight. <p>When I was down in Texas, everybody was celebrating the day that the civil rights law was finally passed. Remember, there were decades in which people sacrificed and worked hard. Change doesn't happen overnight, but it happens as long as we don't purposely give our power away. Every obstacle put in our path should remind us of the power we hold in our hands each time we pull that lever or fill in that oval or touch that screen. We just have to harness that power. We've got to create a national network committed to taking action. We can call it the National Action Network. <p>So I want you to go out there and redouble your efforts. Register more voters. Help more folks to get their rights. Get those souls to the polls. If they don't let you do it on Sunday, then do it on Tuesday instead. I know it's better going to the polls on Sunday because you go to church, you're getting a little meal. [<i>Laughter</i>] You got the bus waiting for you. I understand. But you can do it without that if you&mdash;if we have to. <p>We're at a time when we're marking many anniversaries. And it's interesting for me&mdash;I've been on this Earth 52 years, and so to see the progress we've made is to see my own life and the progression that's happened. You think about <i>Brown </i>v.<i> Board of Education</i> and the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act and Freedom Summer. And with those anniversaries, we have new reason to remember those who made it possible for us to be here. Like the three civil rights workers in Mississippi&mdash;two White, one Black&mdash;who were murdered 50 years ago as they tried to help their fellow citizens register to vote. James Chaney and Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner believed so strongly that change was possible, they were willing to lay down their lives for it. The least you can do is take them up on the gift that they have given you. Go out there and vote. You can make a change. You do have the power. I've run my last election, but I need you to make sure that the changes that we started continue for decades to come. <p>Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.\" "
"78" "\"Hi, everybody. Earlier this week was Equal Pay Day. It marks the extra time the average woman has to work into a new year to earn what a man earned the year before. You see, the average woman who works full time in America earns less than a man, even when she's in the same profession and has the same education. <p>That's wrong. In 2014, it's an embarrassment. Women deserve equal pay for equal work. <p>This is an economic issue that affects all of us. Women make up about half our workforce. And more and more, they're our families' main breadwinners. So it's good for everyone when women are paid fairly. That's why this week I took action to prohibit more businesses from punishing workers who discuss their salaries. Because more pay transparency makes it easier to spot pay discrimination. And I hope more business leaders will take up this cause. <p>But equal pay is just one part of an economic agenda for women. Most lower wage workers in America are women. So I've taken executive action to require Federal contractors to pay their federally funded employees at least $10.10 an hour. I ordered a review of our Nation's overtime rules, to give more workers the chance to earn the overtime pay that they deserve. <p>And thanks to the Affordable Care Act, tens of millions of women are now guaranteed free preventive care like mammograms and contraceptive care, and the days when you could be charged more just for being a woman are over for good. Across the country, we're bringing Americans together to help us make sure that a woman can have a baby without sacrificing her job, or take a day off to care for a sick child or parent without hitting hardship. It's time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a \\"Mad Men\\" episode and give every woman the opportunity she deserves. <p>Here's the problem though. On issues that would benefit millions of women, Republicans in Congress have blocked progress at every turn. Just this week, Senate Republicans blocked the Paycheck Fairness Act, commonsense legislation that would help more women win equal pay for equal work. House Republicans won't vote to raise the minimum wage or extend unemployment insurance for women out of work through no fault of their own. The budget they passed this week would force deep cuts to investments that overwhelmingly benefit women and children, like Medicaid, food stamps, and college grants. And of course, they're trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act for the 50th or so time, which would take away vital benefits and protections from millions of women. <p>I'm going to keep fighting to make sure that doesn't happen, because we do better when our economy grows for everybody, not just a few. And when women succeed, America succeeds. Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"79" "\"Please, please have a seat. Thank you so much. Well, good morning, everybody. <p>Welcome to the White House, and welcome to our annual Easter prayer breakfast. As always, we are blessed to be joined by so many good friends from around the country. We've got distinguished guests. We've got faith leaders, members of my administration who are here. And I will once again resist the temptation to preach to preachers. [<i>Laughter</i>] It never works out well. I am reminded of the admonition from the Book of Romans: \\"Do not claim to be wiser than you are.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] So this morning I want to offer some very brief reflections as we start this Easter season. <p>But as I was preparing my remarks, something intervened yesterday. And so I want to just devote a few words about yesterday's tragedy in Kansas. This morning our prayers are with the people of Overland Park. And we're still learning the details, but this much we know. A gunman opened fire at two Jewish facilities: a community center and a retirement home. Innocent people were killed. Their families were devastated. And this violence has struck at the heart of the Jewish community in Kansas City. <p>Two of the victims, a grandfather and his teenage son [grandson; White House correction.], attended the United Methodist Church of the Resurrection, which is led by our friend Reverend Adam Hamilton. Some of you may know that during my Inauguration, Reverend Hamilton delivered the sermon at the prayer service at the National Cathedral. And I was grateful for his presence and his words. He joined us at our breakfast last year. And at the Easter service for Palm Sunday last night, he had to break this terrible news to his congregation. <p>That this occurred now&mdash;as Jews were preparing to celebrate Passover, as Christians were observing Palm Sunday&mdash;makes this tragedy all the more painful. And today, as Passover begins, we're seeing a number of synagogues and Jewish community centers take added security precautions. Nobody should have to worry about their security when gathering with their fellow believers. No one should ever have to fear for their safety when they go to pray. <p>And as a government, we're going to provide whatever assistance is needed to support the investigation. As Americans, we not only need to open our hearts to the families of the victims, we've got to stand united against this kind of terrible violence, which has no place in our society. And we have to keep coming together across faiths to combat the ignorance and intolerance, including anti-Semitism, that can lead to hatred and to violence, because we're all children of God. We're all made in His image, all worthy of his love and dignity. And we see what happens around the world when this kind of religious-based or -tinged violence can rear its ugly head. It's got no place in our society. <p>So this Easter week, of course, we recognize that there's a lot of pain and a lot of sin and a lot of tragedy in this world, but we're also overwhelmed by the grace of an awesome God. We're reminded how He loves us, so deeply that He gave his only begotten Son so that we might live through Him. And in these Holy Days, we recall all that Jesus endured for us: the scorn of the crowds and the pain of the crucifixion. In our Christian religious tradition, we celebrate the glory of the Resurrection, all so that we might be forgiven of our sins and granted everlasting life. <p>And more than 2,000 years later, it inspires us still. We are drawn to His timeless teachings, challenged to be worthy of His sacrifice, to emulate as best we can His eternal example to love one another just as He loves us. And of course, we're always reminded each and every day that we fall short of that example. And none of us are free from sin, but we can look to His life and strive, knowing that \\"if we love one another, God lives in us, and His love is perfected in us.\\" <p>I'll tell you, I felt this spirit when I had the great honor of meeting His Holiness Pope Francis recently. I think it's fair to say that his&mdash;those of us of the Christian faith, regardless of our denomination, have been touched and moved by Pope Francis. Now, some of it is his words: his message of justice and inclusion, especially for the poor and the outcast. He implores us to see the inherent dignity in each human being. But it's also his deeds, simple yet profound: hugging the homeless man or washing the feet of somebody who, normally, ordinary folks would just pass by on the street. He reminds us that all of us, no matter what our station, have an obligation to live righteously, and that we all have an obligation to live humbly. Because that's, in fact, the example that we profess to follow. <p>So I had a wonderful conversations with Pope Francis, mainly about the imperatives of addressing poverty and inequality. And I invited him to come to the United States, and I sincerely hope he will. When we exchanged gifts, he gave me a copy of his inspired writings, \\"The Joy of the Gospel.\\" And there is a passage that speaks to us today: \\"Christ's resurrection,\\" he writes, \\"is not an event of the past; it contains a vital power which has permeated this world.\\" And he adds: \\"Jesus did not rise in vain. May we never remain on the sidelines of this march of living hope!\\" <p>So this morning my main message is just to say thank you to all of you, because you don't remain on the sidelines. I want to thank you for your ministries, for your good works, for the marching you do for justice and dignity and inclusion, for the ministries that all of you attend to and have helped organize throughout your communities each and every day to feed the hungry and house the homeless and educate children who so desperately need an education. You have made a difference in so many different ways, not only here in the United States, but overseas as well. And that includes a cause close to my heart, My Brother's Keeper, an initiative that we recently launched to make sure that more boys and young men of color can overcome the odds and achieve their dreams. <p>And we're joined by several faith leaders who are doing outstanding work in this area, mentoring and helping young men in tough neighborhoods. We're also joined by some of these young men who are working hard and trying to be good students and good sons and good citizens. And I want to say to each of those young men here, we're proud of you, and we expect a lot of you. And we're going to make sure that we're there for you so that you then in turn will be there for the next generation of young men. <p>And I mention all this because of all of our many partners for My Brother's Keeper, it's clergy like you and your congregations that can play a special role to be that spiritual and ethical foundation, that rock, that so many young men need in their lives. <p>So I want to thank all of you who are already involved. I invite those who are not to get more information, see if you can join in this effort as brothers and sisters in Christ who \\"never tire of doing good.\\" And in closing, I'll just recall that old prayer that I think more than one preacher has invoked at the pulpit: \\"Lord, fill my mouth with worthwhile stuff, and nudge me when I've said enough.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] The Almighty is nudging me. I thank you for joining us this morning of prayer. I wish you all a blessed Holy Week and Easter, and I'd like to invite my friend Joel Hunter to deliver the opening prayer. Come on up, Joel.\" "
"80" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! <p><i>Audience members</i>. Hello! <p><i>The President.</i> Hello, Allegheny County! Joe and I decided it was time for a guys' trip. [<i>Laughter</i>] Actually, Michelle and Jill wanted us out the house. [<i>Laughter</i>] They said&mdash;so we decided to take a little road trip. And we are thrilled to be back here with a lot of good friends and folks who are doing terrific work every single day. <p>We brought with us some people who are doing some important work, trying to make sure that we're building on the kind of success that we're seeing here. First of all, Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker is here. Give Penny a big round of applause. We've got a great friend and an outstanding Senator, Bob Casey, in the house. Congressman Mike Doyle is here. One of the biggest Steelers fans we've got. [<i>Laughter</i>] We've got County Executive Rich Fitzgerald here in the house. Outstanding mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto is here. And your college president, Quintin Bullock, is here. [<i>Applause</i>] Hey! <p>And of course, all of you are here. [<i>Applause</i>] Yeah! Yeah! [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, we're here because CCAC is an outstanding model of the kind of job-driven training we're trying to encourage all across the country. And Joe and I just spent some time checking out the machines and motors that are being used here to train folks in mechatronics. Now, I have to say that before I came here, I didn't know there was such a thing as mechatronics. [<i>Laughter</i>] Sounds like something that Godzilla would be fighting. [<i>Laughter</i>] It turns out, it has to do with engineering, how stuff works. And we saw firsthand everything that you are doing to train more workers for new jobs and better jobs, jobs companies need to keep growing. <p>And what we want to do is, we want to replicate your model across the country. You're doing something right that is making a difference in people's lives, and we want to spread the word. So that's why we're here today in Allegheny County, because I'm taking some new action to expand this kind of job-driven training to all 50 States. <p>And Joe talked a little bit about why we have to do this, because in today's economy, it's never been more important to make sure that our folks are trained for the jobs that are there and for the jobs of the future. <p>Now, we've spent the past 5&frac12; years fighting back from the worst economic crisis in our lifetimes. The good news is, our economy is growing again, our businesses are creating jobs. We've created nearly 9 million jobs over the past 4 years. We've cut our deficits by more than half. Our manufacturing sector that used to be losing jobs, just hemorrhaging jobs, is now adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s. [<i>Applause</i>] First time since the 1990s. High school dropout rates are going down. College attendance rates and graduation rates are going up. Our troops are coming home. We're seeing an energy boom all across the country. And more than 7&frac12; million people have been able to sign up for health care, many for the very first time, through the Affordable Care Act. And 7&frac12; million people, by the way, is about the number that it would take to fill up Heinz Field 115 times. So there are a lot of good trends that are taking place. And a lot of that has to do with the great work that our outstanding Vice President is doing. It has to do with the great work that folks like Mike and Bob and Rich are doing, and your outstanding mayor that's&mdash;in Pittsburgh and all he's doing to help transform the economy there. <p>But here's the challenge, and a lot of folks here know it: A lot of people don't feel that progress in their own lives yet. So the stock market is doing great. Corporate profits are soaring. Folks at the very, very top are doing better than ever. But too many Americans, if they're lucky enough to have a job, are working harder and harder just to get by, much alone&mdash;much less to get ahead. For too many middle class Americans, it feels as if the same trends that have been going on for decades are continuing. Right? You're working hard, but wages flatline, incomes flatline, cost of everything else going up. <p>So we've got to reverse those trends. We've got to make sure that we have an economy that's not just growing from the top down, because it doesn't really grow when it's just from the top down. We've got to have an economy where it grows from the middle class out and from the bottom up and everybody has a chance. <p>That's the idea of America: If you work hard, you can get ahead. That's the promise at the heart of this country. If you're responsible, you're willing to put in some sweat, you can get ahead. You may not be fabulously wealthy, but you can support a family, you can buy a home, make sure your kids are doing good and they can go to college, have something left over for retirement, have health care you can count on, maybe take a vacation once in a while&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;right? Just the basics and knowing that you're part of a community that is growing for everybody, not just some. <p>Restoring that idea is the defining issue of our time. And so the truth is&mdash;Joe and I, we were talking about this the other day. We sometimes sound like a broken record because we've been talking about this for 6, 7, 8 years, ever since we've been in public office. But it's more urgent than ever now that we move forward. And we know what to do. <p>We're pushing a four-part opportunity agenda. And the first part is more good jobs paying good wages: manufacturing jobs, construction jobs, jobs in energy, jobs in innovation, jobs in infrastructure, rebuilding our roads and our bridges, putting people back to work. There's a lot more we could be doing. <p>Number two, we've got to train more Americans with the skills to fill the jobs that are there, just like you do here at CCAC. Number three, we've got to guarantee every young American a world-class education. And number four, when people do have a job, we've got to make sure that job pays a decent wage and that you have savings you can retire on and health care you can count on. <p>Now, these are the things we've got to be doing. You know it, I know it. That's what would put our unemployment rate down faster. It would pull our wages up faster. It's what we could do to create more jobs and economic security for a lot of families that have been reaching for it for years. And every single person you send to Washington should be focused on that issue. That's what America needs right now. <p>Now, today the reason we came here is to focus on that second part of that agenda: training Americans with the skills that they need for the good jobs that are going to be here today and tomorrow. Around here, you know better than most how in recent decades, the economy hasn't always worked for middle class families. You saw outsourcing. You&mdash;there was a time when finding a good job in manufacturing wasn't all that hard. If you were willing to work, you could go to the local factory&mdash;maybe the factory your dad was working in&mdash;and say, I'm ready to go, and they'd sign you up. <p>And over time, the economy changed, part of it because of globalization, some of it because of new technologies. And you've seen, sometimes painfully, where technology shutters factories and ships jobs overseas and even makes some jobs obsolete. <p>But you know what? We're not going to reverse all those trends. We can't stop technology. And you've got a global economy now where we've got to compete. We live in a 21st-century global economy. Jobs know no borders, and companies are able to seek out the best educated, most highly skilled workers wherever they live. And that's where the good jobs and the good pay and the good benefits is going to be. <p>Other countries know this. Countries like Germany, China, they are&mdash;India, they're working every day to outeducate our kids so they can outcompete our businesses. And each year, frankly, it shows that they're making more progress than we are. We're still ahead, we've still got the best cards, but they're making some good decisions. We've got to make those same decisions. <p>And when it comes to training our workers, not all of today's good jobs require a 4-year college degree, but I promise you, there's not a job out there that's going to pay a lot if you don't have some sort of specialized training. So our best bet is keeping ahead in the skills race. <p>And you see what happens when we put effort into making sure workers have new skills, the education that's required for this 21st-century economy. At a time when traditional manufacturing is back on the rise, Pittsburgh is seeing new factories manufacturing new technologies across the board. And I know you're county executive and your mayor and our steel workers, everybody is&mdash;we're focused on bringing jobs back. And the good news is they're coming back. The problem is we're having trouble filling some of those jobs. <p>I mean, there's been great progress in this area. You've earned a great nickname&mdash;Roboburgh&mdash;because you've got high-tech plants and workplaces that are adding jobs faster than workers can fill them. That's a good problem to have. But we've got a lot of Americans who are still looking for work or underemployed and not getting paid enough. That's where what you do here is making a difference. <p>America has got a choice to make. We can do nothing, which is the strategy that some folks in Washington seem to have, or we can do what we've always done best: We pull together, we fight back, and we win. That's what we do best. <p>So earlier this year, I asked Joe to work with Penny Pritzker and Tom Perez, our Labor Secretary, to lead an across-the-board reform of all of our Federal training programs to make sure they've got one clear mission: Train Americans with the skills employers need. Not something that looks good on paper, but doesn't give you a job. Find out what are the jobs that need to be filled, and make sure folks are being trained and matched to those good jobs. <p>We've got to move away from what our Labor Secretary, Tom Perez, calls a \\"train and pray\\" approach. We train them and we pray that they can get a job. [<i>Laughter</i>] Because the problem there is students, when they go to a community college, they go to a 4-year university, they're taking out debt. They're straining their budgets. We got to make sure that it pays off for them. So we need to take a job-driven approach. And that's what you've done here in Allegheny County. That's what you're doing here. So we're rewarding high schools that redesign their curriculums to help students gain ready-to-work skills even earlier because there's no reason why you got to wait for college. Our high schools could be providing more relevant education and making kids more job ready. <p>We are supporting partnerships between employers and local governments and nonprofits to help unemployed workers who have been sidelined for too long, help them get the skills that they need, help to connect them to the jobs that require those skills. We're working with a bipartisan coalition of Governors and mayors across the country to make job training partnerships a reality for more Americans. <p>But we could be doing a lot more. And I've asked Congress to invest in serious programs that connect ready-to-work Americans with ready-to-be-filled jobs. That's&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. And in fairness, Mike Doyle, he's supportive of that and Bob Casey is supportive of it. But unfortunately, there are some other folks in Washington that haven't acted yet. They haven't been getting the job done so far. And Americans can't afford to wait. <p>So today I'm taking two significant actions that don't require Congress&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;that don't require Congress. First, we've asked more community colleges to do what you've done here at Allegheny, and that is to figure out what skills local employers are looking for, and then partner with them to help design the curriculums and to prepare the students for those jobs. We want a seamless progression from community college programs to industry-recognized credentials and credit towards a college degree. <p>And today I'm announcing that we're going to award nearly $500 million to those institutions who are doing it best in all 50 States, using existing money to create opportunity for hard-working folks like you. [<i>Applause</i>] That's good. <p>Second&mdash;and this is related&mdash;we're launching a $100 million competition for what we're calling American Apprenticeship Grants. Now, these are awards that are going to expand the kinds of apprenticeships that help young people and experienced workers get on a path for&mdash;towards advancement, towards better jobs, better pay, a trajectory upwards in their careers. <p>And apprenticeships are a way to link more Americans to jobs in some of our in-demand fields, like IT and health care. They let you earn while you learn. And sometimes, it makes&mdash;it's possible for them to also create college credits on the job, even as you're pursuing a degree or a better job. <p>Right now nearly 9 out of 10 apprenticeships&mdash;folks who are in apprenticeships, they get hired when they're finished, which makes sense, right? You get an apprenticeship; you're there, you're learning on the job. People see that you're serious about working. So 9 out of 10 folks, once they get an apprenticeship, they get hired. And by the way, they make an average of $50,000. <p>So we're streamlining efforts by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Labor to help veterans access their GI bill benefits for apprenticeships. Businesses, unions, community colleges, nonprofits&mdash;we're getting them to work with us as well. The UAW is joining with the Big Three and John Deere and others to add nearly 2,000 apprentices. Some of the biggest manufacturers are partnering with community colleges in North Carolina and Texas and California on high-skill training programs. <p>And now we want to work with national industry associations to help partnerships like these take root all across the country so that anybody, in any city, any State, can earn the training they need to get the good jobs of tomorrow. So the bottom line is, if you're willing to put in the work to get a job or earn a promotion in today's economy, America's job-training system should give you every possible chance. <p>And you're doing it here. When we took that tour, we saw young people and some not-so-young people&mdash;I won't say who. I don't want to offend&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but these are folks who, many of them were in a job right now, but they saw that it was a dead end, and they wanted to make sure that they could get a better job. Some of them were just getting started. But either way, their investment and their effort was being rewarded. <p>One person we met is a gentleman named Tim Wright. He was showing us some of the computer systems that folks are working on. Now, Tim worked as a shift laborer for 13 years, loading rail cars, moving equipment, working nights, working weekends. And he always had his eye on moving into industrial maintenance so he could repair and oversee the factory's equipment, but he couldn't pass the skills test. But he&mdash;I love this about Tim. He did not give up. He didn't say, well, I guess I can't get to my dream. Instead, he started on this mechatronics training at CCAC. <p>So he'd squeeze in classes whenever he could, while he was still working his shifts. And after 6 months of hard work, he graduated as an industry-certified mechatronics technician. He retook the test. He passed the test. Today, Tim is doing what he set out to do. So today, he's working on a factory floor, making sure the machines do what they're supposed to do. He earns more money; he works better hours. He has more time to spend with his family. <p>And I want to read what Tim said here about this. He said: \\"That extra training made all the difference in the world. Those were the skills I needed to get to the next level.\\" <p>So I couldn't be prouder of Tim. Those are the victories. They don't get a lot of publicity. Tim's name won't be in the papers&mdash;although, now it may be because I just talked about him. [<i>Laughter</i>] But that's what America is all about, each of us working to try to move forward. And by each of us moving forward, we all move forward. And then we reach back, and we help other folks. <p>Companies that are represented here today, like Alle-Kiski and Schroeder and Aerotech, they're helping. They want to help even more of their workers to take their skills to the next level, whether it's through a community college partnership like Tim's or working with organizations like New Century Careers here in southwestern Pennsylvania. [<i>Applause</i>] Yeah! More workers getting apprenticeships. We know it works. And if it worked for folks like Tim and some of the men and women who are standing behind me here today, who took the initiative to upgrade their skills and stay ahead of the jobs curve and prepare themselves for a new job or a better job, then it can work all the way&mdash;all across the country. <p>We want that for every American. Everybody who works hard and takes responsibility deserves a chance to get ahead. That is what this country is built on. That's what the moment requires. That's what Congress should be working on. That's what Joe is working on. That's what I'm working on. That's what you're working on. And if we keep on working, we're going to move forward. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"81" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! Welcome to the White House. Thank you to Ric for not just a nice introduction, but more importantly, for your outstanding service to our country and for your service to our veterans and fellow wounded warriors. <p>Now, I also want to mention that our Vice President here has been relentless in his support, along with our spouses, Michelle and Jill Biden, for military families. And we're very proud of everything that Joe has done. <p>This is now the fifth time that I've had the honor of welcoming the Soldier Ride to the White House. And I have to tell you, this is one of my favorite events of the year. First of all, you know it's spring when&mdash;or at least it's supposed to be spring&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;when the Soldier Ride comes around. But mainly, it's because those who participate are such an incredible inspiration to me and to our country. <p>To all the riders, you look outstanding, especially after biking 17 miles yesterday. You're doing another 17 miles tomorrow, another 17 miles after that&mdash;all told, nearly 60 miles. Today we wanted to come cheer you on. And I think we've got some folks from the Army here, is that right? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> And the Navy. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> Air Force. <p><i>Audience members</i>. Hooah! <p><i>The President</i>. Marines. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> Oh, that was good. [<i>Laughter</i>] Coast Guard. <p><i>Audience members</i>. [<i>Applause</i>]. <p><i>The President</i>. And we've got some extraordinary families here today. Yay, families. <p>By now, everybody knows the story about how this got started. You had a bartender on Long Island, Chris Carney, who came up with the idea of riding his bike across America to support wounded warriors. Chris couldn't be here today. He owns a gym now. I think you all inspired him to trade the bar in for some barbells. But today there are Soldier Rides all across the country, and we want to thank everybody at the Wounded Warriors Project for their incredible support. <p>I know some of you are doing this for the very first time; some of you have ridden three or four times. Some of you are riding in tandem with your parents. Biking nearly 60 miles in 3 days would be a challenge for anybody, but for all of you, this is a lot more than a bike ride, this is a mark of how far you've come. Many of you are recovering from devastating injuries. Some of you have had to learn the basics all over again: how to stand again, how to walk again, how to run again. And now you're here today because that's what Soldier's Ride is all about: seeing each other through the finish line. <p>Lieutenant Commander John Jae Terry is here. Three years ago, he was on foot patrol in Afghanistan when he was hit by an IED, ended up losing his leg. But reflecting on his service, he said he would do it all again. Now he's got a new goal: get in the best shape possible so he can play with his three kids. And so today he's here on his first Soldier Ride. <p>You've got Master Sergeant Louis Alfonso Ramirez. Serving in Afghanistan, he lost good friends in a terrible ambush. He even assisted at the airport as they began their dignified transfer home. Later diagnosed with posttraumatic stress, credits the Wounded Warriors Project with helping him heal. He says, \\"You know that they got you.\\" This is now his fourth ride. <p>Sergeant Major Sedrick Banks is here. An explosion in Iraq left him with injuries to his neck and his back and traumatic brain injury. But after years of rehab, Sedrick is focused on the future. He volunteers here in Washington, helps mentor young men with the life skills they need to succeed. He calls himself now a \\"warrior for society.\\" This is his first Soldier Ride. <p>Major Jeanette Nieves-Ayala is here. And I first met Jeanette a few years ago at Walter Reed, where she was recovering from an injury received in Iraq. As some of you know, when I visit with our troops, I often hand out coins marked with the Seal of the President. Jeanette shook my hand, and she said: \\"Mr. President, all these men think your coin is the best; I don't. I made a bet with them that there was a coin that could trump yours.\\" I said, \\"What are you talking about?\\" She said, \\"I want the First Lady's coin.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"The First Lady's coin would beat yours.\\" <p>Now, it is true that the First Lady trumps me. But Jeanette says her proudest accomplishment is being a peer mentor to other wounded warriors. She says that during her recovery: \\"I was definitely being carried. Now I feel like I am helping to carry others.\\" So I want to thank you, Jeanette. <p>This ride is first and foremost for these incredible riders. But it's men and women like John and Louis and Sedrick and Jeanette and all of you who make the ride so special for all of us, because you inspire us. You inspire the country, some of whom will be out cheering along your ride. You inspire me with your courage, your resolve, your resilience, your tenacity, your optimism. It makes me proud to be your Commander in Chief. And Michelle and I treasure every moment that we get to spend with you and your families. <p>Every day I have the honor of serving as this country's Commander in Chief. And as long as I have that honor, I will keep fighting to make sure you and your families get the care and treatment and benefits that you have earned and deserve. When people ask of you to serve your country, to give your all, to make your sacrifices, you've raised your hands. You've stepped up. You held up your end of the bargain. And it's especially now, as we're winding down the war in Afghanistan, after having ended over a decade of war, that we are standing up for you. Our obligations to our veterans endure for your entire lives. That's our mission. That's why we're here, not just during this ride, but all year long. <p>So with that, the sun is out. It's a spectacular day. The racers look like they're ready. I think it's time for us to get this party started. God bless you. God bless America. Let's get this going.\" "
"82" "\"<i>The President.</i> All right. Everybody, please have a seat, have a seat. Welcome to the White House. Congratulations to the Navy Midshipmen. Does this get old? <p><i>Audience member.</i> Never. <p><i>The President.</i> No? Okay. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's good to see Coach Ken again. And I want to recognize Vice Admiral Mike Miller for his service to the Academy and to our country. <p>This is the second time these seniors have come here to claim the Commander in Chief's Trophy. If you guys have your punchcards with you, the next one is free. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm pretty sure Coach Ken would agree that this was one of the best teams yet. <p>First of all, you had incredible talent. Senior captain Cody Peterson and D.J. Sargenti led the defense. I hear that they're known in the locker room as the Meatheads. [<i>Laughter</i>] On a football team, though, that's high praise. <p>This year, quarterback Keenan Reynolds had one of the best seasons in school history. His 31 rushing touchdowns weren't just an Academy record, they were a Division I record for a quarterback. He is one of only a handful of players in Division I history to rush for 30 or more touchdowns in a single season. I think it's fair to say that if you're on a list with Barry Sanders you're doing pretty good. <p>So this team had the leadership, it had the tools. But this is a team that also had a knack for getting the job done under some pretty tough circumstances. When the Government was forced to shut down, you didn't even know if the game against Air Force was going to happen. Luckily, the Secretary of Defense stepped in, gave the green light, which tells you how important it was, because Secretary Hagel has a few things on his plate, but he personally intervened on this one. <p>A few weeks later, you beat San Jose State in triple overtime, with Keenan scoring seven rushing touchdowns, the most ever by a Division I quarterback in a single game. And you kept on rolling through the games that really mattered. In the snow, you beat Army for the 12th time in a row&mdash;they're starting to feel bad about this&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;locking up the Commander in Chief's Trophy for the ninth time in 11 years. You went on to beat Middle Tennessee State to win your first bowl game since 2009. <p>So, overall, this was a pretty good year on the gridiron. What's more impressive is the fact that for these outstanding young men, football isn't even the main thing. When these guys sign up&mdash;when you sign up to play at Annapolis&mdash;you know you're in for a different experience. A typical day starts at 6 a.m. in the training room. Breakfast is at 7. After that, it's class, lunch, and football meetings. Then more class, football practice, dinner. Free time starts at 8, which most players use to study until midnight. And when students at other colleges are enjoying summer vacation, these guys are busy with military training and summer school and offseason workouts. <p>So yes, it's about learning to be a good football player, but more importantly, it's about learning how to be a good leader and to be a good man. And that's what these outstanding Americans are and will continue to be. Next month, 14 of these guys are going to be commissioned as ensigns in the Navy. Another eight will become 2d lieutenants in the Marine Corps. Senior captain Matt Aiken will serve on a ship down in Norfolk. And Wave Ryder&mdash;by the way, if your name is Wave Ryder, then you've got to be in the Navy&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;will suit up as a naval aviator. <p>That's their commitment to service. That's a commitment to country and to each other that sets this team apart. <p>And today, that commitment is as strong as ever. Last month, I know that all of us were mourning the loss of Will McKamey. Two busloads of classmates and teammates made the 8-hour trip to Knoxville to attend his funeral, as did Coach Ken. I understand your motto for this season is \\"I Will\\" in memory of him. And that's what camaraderie is all about: Honor. Courage. Commitment. That's what makes the Midshipmen so strong. And that's why I'm so proud to serve as your Commander in Chief, not only&mdash;in fact, not primarily&mdash;because of what you've done on the football field, but because of your dedication to each other and your service to America. <p>So today it is my privilege to present you with a trophy that weighs about as much as I do. [<i>Laughter</i>] Congratulations, guys, once again. <p>[<i>At this point, Head Coach Ken Niumatalolo gave brief remarks, after which the President was presented with a team jersey and commemorative ring.</i>]\" "
"83" "\"Hi, everybody. For millions of Americans, this time of year holds great meaning. <p>Earlier this week, we hosted a Passover Seder at the White House and joined Jewish families around the world in their retellings of the story of the Exodus and the victory of faith over oppression. <p>And this Sunday, Michelle, Malia, Sasha, and I will join our fellow Christians around the world in celebrating the Resurrection of Christ, the salvation he offered the world, and the hope that comes with the Easter season. <p>These holy days have their roots in miracles that took place long ago. And yet they still inspire us, guide us, and strengthen us today. They remind us of our responsibilities to God and, as God's children, our responsibilities to one another. <p>For me and for countless other Christians, Holy Week and Easter are times for reflection and renewal. We remember the grace of an awesome God, who loves us so deeply that He gave us his only Son so that we might live through Him. We recall all that Jesus endured for us&mdash;the scorn of the crowds, the agony of the cross&mdash;all so that we might be forgiven our sins and granted everlasting life. And we recommit ourselves to following His example, to love and serve one another, particularly \\"the least of these\\" among us, just as He loves every one of us. <p>The common thread of humanity that connects us all&mdash;not just Christians and Jews, but Muslims and Hindus and Sikhs&mdash;is our shared commitment to love our neighbors as we love ourselves. To remember, I am my brother's keeper, and I am my sister's keeper. Whatever your faith, believer or nonbeliever, there's no better time to rededicate ourselves to that universal mission. <p>For me, Easter is a story of hope, a belief in a better day to come, just around the bend. So to all Christians who are celebrating, from my family to yours, happy Easter. And to every American, have a joyful weekend. <p>Thanks, God bless you, and may God bless this country we love.\" "
"84" "\"<i>The President.</i> Well, hello everybody. Is everybody having fun? Happy Easter. This is the biggest event that we have at the White House all year long, and it is our most fun event, because we have a chance to see families from all across the country coming through here. My main and only job, other than officiating over the roll at some point, is to introduce, alongside the Easter Bunny, the person who makes this all possible&mdash;we love her dearly&mdash;my wife, the First Lady, Michelle Obama. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Thank you, honey. Hey, everybody. Happy Easter Egg Roll Day. Isn't this exciting? It is so wonderful to have so many of you here today. We are celebrating the 136th Easter egg roll. The theme of this year's roll is \\"Hop Into Health [Healthy; White House correction.], Swing Into Shape.\\" Yes, I love it. <p>And it's going to be a great day. We have beautiful weather because the Easter egg roll is blessed. And we're going to have fun stuff going on. We've got the egg roll. We've got some storytelling. We've got entertainment. We've got wonderful athletes and performers like Cam and so many others. We've got obstacle courses and yoga and face painting and egg hunts. It's just going to be terrific. As Barack said, we love this event. This is the largest event that we do here on the South Lawn. We're going to have more than 30,000 people on the lawn today. <p>And we're just thrilled that this theme is focusing on one issue that is near and dear to my heart, and it's making sure that our young people are active and healthy. So while you're here, parents, look around. You're going to learn how to make healthy snacks that the kids will actually eat. I'm going to be over there on the chef's stage doing some demonstrations. <p>And I want to make sure that kids know that healthy eating and being active can be fun, because what today is about is having a whole lot of fun. And I hope you all do that, because we want our kids to be the healthiest and the strongest they can be so they can do well in school and live up to all of their God-given potential. Isn't that right, parents? <p><i>The President</i>. Right. Hey! <p><i>The First Lady</i>. That's what we want for you all. <p>And we want to thank the Easter Bunny, as always, for being here. And I would be remiss if I didn't thank the hundreds of volunteers who make today possible. Thank you to our volunteers&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The President.</i> Yay, volunteers! <p><i>The First Lady.</i> &mdash;&mdash;who have been out here setting up the South Lawn, who are going to make sure you guys get through these activities and have a great time. <p>So you all just enjoy. That's all you have to do from this point on, is have fun. And we'll be down there to participate in the egg roll. The President is going to read. I'm going to read a little bit. So we'll meet you down on the South Lawn, okay? <p><i>The President</i>. All right. <i>The First Lady</i>. All right. Have a great time. Bye-bye.\" "
"85" "\"Well, good afternoon, everybody. I just had a chance to tour some of the damage from last month's mudslide and, most importantly, had a chance to spend some time with the families whose loved ones have been lost. I also had a chance to thank some of the amazing first responders, the firefighters, police officers, search-and-rescue crews, and members of the Washington National Guard who have been working around the clock to help this community recover from this devastating incident. <p>Governor Inslee, Senator Murray, Senator Cantwell, Congresswoman DelBene, Congressman Larsen, and the rest of the elected officials who are here, they've been relentless in making sure that Oso had the resources that it needs. And from the day of the tragedy, I've instructed my team to make sure that they get what they need to make sure that the search-and-rescue mission is going forward the way it should. <p>A FEMA Incident Management Assistance Team was on the ground immediately after the mudslide, and a search-and-rescue team was deployed to help locate and recover victims. We immediately approved an emergency declaration to provide additional resources to State and local responders. And I followed that by approving a major disaster declaration to help residents and business owners rebuild and to help State and local and tribal governments with emergency work. <p>Today, that work continues. There are still families who are searching for loved ones. There are families who have lost everything, and it's going to be a difficult road ahead for them. And that's why I wanted to come here, just to let you know that the country is thinking about all of you and have been throughout this tragedy. <p>We're not going anywhere. We'll be here as long as it takes. Because, while very few Americans have ever heard of Oso before the disaster struck, we've all been inspired by the incredible way that the community has come together and shown the love and support that they have for each other in ways large and small. <p>Over the past month, we've seen neighbors and complete strangers donate everything from chainsaws to rain jackets to help with the recovery effort. We've seen families cook meals for rescue workers. We've seen volunteers pull 15-hour days, searching through mud up to 70 feet deep. One resident said: \\"We're Oso. And we just do it.\\" That's what this community is all about. And I think the outstanding work of Sheriff Willy Harper here helping to coordinate all of this&mdash;I was saying, he's a pretty young sheriff, but he has shouldered this burden in an incredible way. And we're very, very proud of him, as we are of all the local responders. <p>This is family. And these are folks who love this land, and it's easy to see why, because it's gorgeous. And there's a way of life here that's represented. And to see the strength in adversity of this community, I think, should inspire all of us, because this is also what America is all about. <p>When times get tough, we look out for each other. We get each other's backs. And we recover, and we build, and we come back stronger. And we're always reminded that we're greater together. That's how we'll support each other every step of the way. I have to say that the families that I met with showed incredible strength and grace through unimaginable pain and difficulty. Uniformly, though, they all wanted to say thank you to the first responders. They were deeply appreciative of the efforts that everybody has made. And I know that many of the first responders have heard that directly, but it doesn't hurt to repeat that we're very appreciative of what you've done. <p>And I also want to say that some terrific lessons were learned in the midst of very hard times during this process, because almost uniquely, we had not just coordination between State, local, and Federal officials, but also coordination between volunteers and those officials. And I know that it required some improvisation and some kinks getting worked out, but it was important for the family members themselves and the community themselves to be hands on and participate in this process, particularly a community like this one, where folks are hearty and know how to do things and take great pride in being self-reliant. It was important that they weren't just bystanders in this process, they were involved every step of the way. <p>One last point I'll make: I've received a number of letters from residents&mdash;either Darrington or Arlington or Oso itself&mdash;over the last several weeks, and one in particular struck me. It was from a firefighter who I may have met today; he didn't identify himself. But he pointed out how those who were operating the heavy machinery during this whole process did so with an incredible care and delicacy because they understood that this wasn't an ordinary job, this wasn't just a matter of moving earth; that this was a matter of making sure that we were honoring and respecting the lives that had been impacted. <p>And two things were of note in that letter: number one, that this firefighter pointed out properly the incredible work that's been done under very tough circumstances; number two, he was pointing out what others were doing, not what he was doing. And to see a community come together like this and not be interested in who's getting credit, but just making sure that the job gets done, that says a lot about the character of this place. <p>And so we're very, very proud of all of you. Michelle and I grieve with you. The whole country is thinking about you. And we're going to make sure that we're there every step of the way as we go through the grieving, the mourning, the recovery. We're going to be strong right alongside you. All right? <p>Thank you very much. God bless you. God bless America. Thank you.\" "
"86" "\"<i>Konnichiwa.</i> Please sit down. Thank you so much. Well, I want to thank Dr. Mohri and everyone at the Miraikan for welcoming me here today. And it is wonderful to see all of these outstanding students. Dr. Mohri is a veteran of two space shuttle missions, embodies the spirit that brings us here together: the incredible cooperation in science and technology between Japan and the United States. <p>I want to thank all the students that I had a chance to meet with as we went around the various exhibits. We heard a message from the International Space Station. We saw some truly amazing robots, although I have to say, the robots were a little scary. They were too lifelike. They were amazing. And these students showed me some of their experiments, including some soccer-playing robots that we just saw. And all of the exhibits, I think, showed the incredible breakthroughs in technology and science that are happening every single day. <p>And historically, Japan and the United States have been at the cutting edge of innovation. From some of the first modern calculators decades ago to the devices that we hold in our hands today&mdash;the smartphones that I'm sure every young person here uses&mdash;Japan and the United States have often led the way in the innovations that change our lives and improve our lives. <p>And that's why I'm so pleased that the United States and Japan are renewing the 10-year agreement that makes so much of our science and technology cooperation possible. Both of our societies celebrate innovation, celebrate science, celebrate technology. We're close partners in the industries of tomorrow. And it reminds us why it's so important for us to continue to invest in science, technology, math, engineering. These are the schools&mdash;these are the skills that students like all of you are going to need for the global economy, and that includes our talented young women. <p>Historically, sometimes, young women have been less represented in the sciences, and one of the things that I've really been pushing for is to make sure that young women, just like young men, are getting trained in these fields, because we need all the talent and brainpower to solve some of the challenges that we're going to face in the future. <p>Earlier today Prime Minister Abe and I announced a new initiative to increase student exchanges, including bringing more Japanese students to the United States. So I hope you'll come. Welcome. And it's part of our effort to double students' exchanges in the coming years. As we saw today, young people like you have at your fingertips more technology and more power than even the greatest innovators in previous generations. So there's no limit to what you can achieve, and the United States of America wants to be your partner. <p>So I'm very proud to have been here today. I was so excited by what I saw. The young people here were incredibly impressive. And as one of our outstanding astronauts described, as we just are a few days after Earth Day, it's important when we look at this globe and we think about how technology has allowed us to understand the planet that we share and to understand not only the great possibilities, but also the challenges and dangers from things like climate change, that your generation is going to help us to find answers to some of the questions that we have to answer, whether it's, how do we feed more people in an environment in which it's getting warmer? How do we make sure that we're coming up with new energy sources that are less polluting and can save our environment? How do we find new medicines that can cure diseases that take so many lives around the globe? To the robots that we saw that can save people's lives after a disaster because they can go into places like Fukushima that it may be very dangerous for live human beings to enter into. These are all applications, but it starts with the imaginations and the vision of young people like you. <p>So I'm very proud of all of you and glad to see that you're doing such great work. You have counterparts in the United States who share your excitement about technology and science. I hope you get a chance to meet them. I hope you get a chance to visit the United States. As far as I know, we don't have one of those cool globes, but we have some other pretty neat things in the United States as well. And I hope we can share those with you if and when you come. <p>Thank you very much. And I just want you to know in closing that I really believe that each of you can make a difference. <i>Gambatte kudasai.</i> You can do this thing if you apply yourselves. So thank you.\" "
"87" "\"Good evening. <i>Konbanwa.</i> Your Majesties, I thank you for the extraordinary welcome that you have given to me and my delegation today, and I thank you for your gracious hospitality tonight. <p>Prime Minister Abe and Mrs. Abe, distinguished guests and friends, It has been nearly 50 years since my mother first brought me to Japan, but I have never forgotten the kindness that the Japanese people showed me as a 6-year-old boy far away from home. I remain grateful for the welcome that Your Majesties gave me when I returned here as President, on the 20th anniversary of your ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne. <p>And I am deeply honored to be with you as a guest of state tonight, which is a reflection of the great friendship between our two peoples. <p>It's also very humbling. I stand here as the 44th President of the United States. Your Majesty is the 125th Emperor of Japan. [<i>Laughter</i>]And your family has embodied the spirit of the Japanese people across more than two millennia. And we feel that spirit here tonight in His Majesty's commitment to achieving peace and the resilience of the Japanese people who, despite difficult decades, despite the tragedies of 3 years ago, continue to inspire the world with your strength and discipline and dignity&mdash;your <i>hinkaku.</i> <p>And I saw that spirit today. In the glory of the Meiji Shrine, I experienced the beauty of a religious ceremony rooted in Japan's ancient past. In my work with Prime Minister Abe, we have strengthened our alliance for today, an alliance that will never be broken. And in the eager students that I met and the remarkable technologies that I saw, I glimpsed the future our nations can forge together. <p>Through all of this, although we are separated by vast oceans, our peoples come together every day in every realm. We create and build together, sparking new innovations for a changing world. We study and research together, unlocking new discoveries to cure disease and save lives. We go to the far corners of the Earth together, to keep the peace and feed the hungry. And we go to space together to understand the mysteries of the universe. We stand together in moments of joy, as when Japanese baseball players help propel America's teams to victory. And we stand together in moments of difficulty and pain, as we did 3 years ago. <p>Your Majesty, we will never forget how, in those trying days, you spoke from this palace directly to the people of this nation. And I would like to conclude by recalling the spirit of your message then, because it also remains our wish tonight, for the friendship and alliance between our two peoples. <p>May we never give up hope, may we always take care of each other, and may we continue to live strong for tomorrow.\" "
"88" "\"Well, good afternoon. <i>Annyeonghaseyo</i>. It is an honor to be here at the War Memorial of Korea. In a few moments, I'll lay a wreath to pay tribute to our servicemembers who've given their lives in defense of our freedom. And tomorrow I'll address our troops and civilians at Yongsan Garrison. <p>I have said before, I have no higher honor than serving as your Commander in Chief. And today I can think of no higher privilege than being here with all of you and your families for this special moment: becoming the newest citizens of the world's oldest constitutional democracy. <p>I know that each of you have traveled your own path to this moment. You come from 14 different countries. Some of you have called Seoul home. But a day came when each one of you did something extraordinary: Thirteen of you made the profound decision to put on the uniform of a country that was not yet fully your own. Seven of you married an American soldier, and as a military spouse, that means you've been serving our country too. <p>If there's anything that this should teach us, it's that Americans is strengthened by our immigrants. I had the chance to talk to our Ambassador and our commander here, and I said to them that there's no greater strength, no greater essence of America, than the fact that we attract people from all around the world who want to be part of our democracy. We are a nation of immigrants, people from every corner, every walk of life, who picked up tools to help build our country, who started up businesses to advance our country, who took up arms to defend our country. <p>What makes us Americans is something more than just the circumstances of birth, what we look like, what God we worship; rather, it is a joyful spirit of citizenship. And citizenship demands participation and responsibility and service to our country and to one another. And few embody that more than our men and women in uniform. <p>If we want to keep attracting the best and the brightest, the smartest and most selfless the world has to offer, then we have to keep this in mind: the value of our immigrants to our way of life. It is central to who we are; it's in our DNA. It's part of our creed. And that means moving forward we've got to fix our broken immigration system and pass commonsense immigration reform. <p>This is a huge advantage to us, the talent that we attract. We don't want to make it harder, we want to make it more sensible, more efficient. That's why I'm going to keep on pushing to get this done this year so that others like the young men and women here have the opportunity to join our American family and serve our great Nation. <p>Today I'm thrilled that, in a few moments, I'll get to call each of you my fellow Americans. I am so proud to be sharing this stage with you today. Congratulations. But I don't want to talk too long, because I'm not the main event. Thank you very much for your service.\" "
"89" "\"Hi, everybody. In my State of the Union Address, I talked about pizza. [<i>Laughter</i>] More specifically, I talked about a pizza chain in Minneapolis, Punch Pizza, whose owner, John Soranno, made the business decision to give his employees a raise to 10 bucks an hour. <p>A couple of weeks ago, I got a letter from a small-business owner who watched that night. Yasmin Ibrahim is an immigrant who owns her own restaurant, Desi Shack, and plans to open another this summer. <p>Here's what she wrote: \\"I was moved by John Soranno's story. It got me thinking about my . . . full-time employees and their ability to survive on $8 an hour in New York City.\\" So a few weeks ago, Yasmin put in place a plan to lift wages for her employees at both her restaurants to at least $10 an hour by the end of this year. <p>But here's the thing. Yasmin isn't just raising her employees' wages because it's the right thing to do. She's doing it for the same reason John Soranno did: It makes good business sense. <p>Yasmin wrote: \\"It will allow us to attract and retain better talent&mdash;improving customer experience, reducing employee churn and training costs. We believe doing so makes good business sense while at the same time having a positive impact on the community.\\" Yasmin's right. That's why, 2 months ago, I issued an Executive order requiring workers on new Federal contracts to be paid a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour. <p>But in order to make a difference for every American, Congress needs to do something, and America knows it. Right now there's a bill that would boost America's minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. That would lift wages for nearly 28 million Americans across the country&mdash;28 million. And we're not just talking about young people on their first job. The average minimum wage worker is 35 years old. They work hard, often in physically demanding jobs. <p>And while not all of us always see eye to eye politically, one thing we overwhelmingly agree on is that nobody who works full time should ever have to live in poverty. That's why nearly three in four Americans support raising the minimum wage. The problem is, Republicans in Congress don't support raising the minimum wage. Some even want to get rid of it entirely. In Oklahoma, for example, the Republican Governor just signed a law prohibiting cities from establishing their own minimum wage. <p>That's why this fight is so important. That's why people like John and Yasmin are giving their workers a raise. That's why several States, counties, and cities are going around Congress to raise their workers' wages. That's why I'll keep up this fight. Because we know that our economy as a whole works best when it works for all of us, not just a fortunate few. We believe we do better when everyone who works hard has a chance to get ahead. That's what opportunity is all about. <p>And if you agree with us, we could use your help. Republicans have voted more than 50 times to undermine or repeal health care for millions of Americans. They should vote at least once to raise the minimum wage for millions of working families. If a Republican in Congress represents you, tell him or her it's time to give the politics a rest for a while and do something to help working Americans. It's time for \\"10-10.\\" It's time to give America a raise. Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"90" "\"All right. Well, I want to thank Jim Kim and the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea for hosting us. And I'm very pleased to be meeting with these business leaders, both Korean and American, who have been in discussions with Michael Froman, our Ambassador for trade, as well as Caroline Atkinson, who is one of my senior advisers on international economics, because what we want to do is to underscore the fact that, as important as the security relationship and the alliance is between the Republic of Korea and the United States, what is also important is the incredible and growing economic ties that are creating jobs and opportunity in both countries. <p>I said yesterday with President Park that under the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, our trade has increased. These business leaders know concretely what this means. American companies are exporting more to Korea; Korean companies are exporting more to the United States. So it's a win-win for both countries. <p>We also know that we still have some more work to do to fully implement the trade agreement and make sure that we're maximizing its benefits, that our companies can compete fairly in areas like autos and IT and organic foods. And I discussed this with President Park last night. We both agreed that these are issues we can work through together. And given South Korea's interest in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, fully implementing KORUS also is the single most important step that South Korea can take now to show that it's prepared to eventually meet the high standards of TPP. <p>And finally, we are joined by some outstanding Korean companies that are already invested in the United States, and we want to thank them for their investments and the jobs that they're creating back home. <p>I just want to remind companies around the world that if you are looking for a great place to set up shop, come to the United States. We've got outstanding workers, great universities, incredible productivity, great energy sources, and a pretty big consumer market, last I checked. And you're also going to have a White House and Federal Government that&mdash;working with State and local governments, who are absolutely committed to making it easier for companies to invest in the United States. And whether it's high skills that you're looking for or productivity, our open economy, research and development, innovation, I think more and more companies realize it makes sense to locate in the U.S. And with our SelectUSA initiative, we're making it easier to invest. <p>So I just wanted to thank these leaders. With that, I'm going to actually spend most of my time listening, but I look forward to all the suggestions or recommendations that are being provided by both the Korean and the U.S. business leaders, because I'm confident that this is going to be one of the key economic relationships of the 21st century. <p>All right. Thank you so much, everybody.\" "
"91" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hey! Thank you. Well, hello, Yongsan! It is&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience</i> <i>member</i>. [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President</i>. Hey, who&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. It is good to be back at the Yongsan Garrison. I want to thank one of our military's most tested, trusted leaders for that outstanding introduction&mdash;General Mike Scaparrotti. Now, I've been told&mdash;I don't know if you've heard this story&mdash;that, years ago, Scap was actually an extra in a movie about the Battle of Inchon, the turning point of the Korean war. So it's only fitting that after a career of proud service that's taken him from West Point to Iraq, to Afghanistan, he is now commander of U.S. Forces Korea. And we could not be prouder of his effort. <p>He's got a great partner in our other representative, Ambassador Kim, a proud Korean American, for strengthening the rock-solid alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea. Give Ambassador Kim a big round of applause. <p>All of you have helped keep this alliance the linchpin of security and stability in the Asia-Pacific. The Eighth Army is in the house. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> The Seventh Air Force is in the house. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> U.S. Naval Forces Korea. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> U.S. Marine Forces Korea. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> Special Operations Command. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p>We've got our standing DOD civilians. And we have our wonderful U.S. Embassy staff are here as well. <p><i>Audience member.</i> And the VA! <p><i>The President.</i> Yes, good job, VA&mdash;in the house! [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And I know we've got some outstanding spouses and family members, kids in the house. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I want to thank you as well, because you bear the burdens of service as well, whether it's separation from a loved one or transitioning to a new country. And I just want you to know that America is grateful for your sacrifice and your service. <p>Now, President Park and I just attended a briefing led by General Scaparrotti with the Combined Forces Command. And then, I signed the guest book that sits on top of a table where the Korean war armistice was signed. And both of those moments drove home the truth that, after more than 60 years, our alliance is as strong as it has ever been and as effective as it has ever been. <p>And nowhere is that more evident than in the professionalism and the interoperability of our militaries. Even when Scap had to travel to Washington to testify before Congress last month, he was never more than a phone call or a teleconference away from Admiral Choi. And that's because our forces on duty here&mdash;American and Korean&mdash;are highly trained, closely coordinated, fit to fight tonight and every other night. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President</i>. But obviously, in addition to dealing with the threat from North Korea, this is also an alliance that represents the incredible bonds between peoples. So I know that you provided quick support in response to last week's terrible ferry tragedy, because we understood when our friends are in trouble, America helps. And our hearts are broken for our Korean friends, especially the loss of so many wonderful young people. But we're inspired by the tales of heroism and selflessness: the young woman who tried to make sure everyone else had a lifejacket, even if it meant her own death; the man whose last words were, \\"I'm on my way to save the kids.\\" <p>That's why America will continue to support every rescue and recovery effort. And it's that spirit that allows this alliance to endure: <i>Katchi kapshida&mdash;</i>we go together. That's what we're about. That's what we're about. That's been our common commitment for more than 60 years, in good times and in bad. <p>It was 1950, just 5 years after the end of World War II, when Communist armies first crossed the 38th parallel. And at the time, many Americans couldn't place Korea on a map. But we knew&mdash;as much as we had already given, as weary as we were of war&mdash;that we had a stake in what happened here in the Korean Peninsula, that we had to roll back the tide of communism, that as Americans, we had to stand with our South Korean friends. <p>And then, in September, the Americans arrived. The alliance we led with Korean troops landed in a surprise attack. And all told, nearly 1.8 million Americans would join the fight those next few years. The conditions were terribly difficult. The combat was brutal. The danger was close. By the end, nearly 37,000 Americans would give their last full measure of devotion on this faraway soil, but not without pushing the invading armies back across the line they had dared to cross. <p>If you want to know what that hard-earned, long-defended victory looks like, you look around this country, the Republic of Korea. This country has risen from occupation and ruin and become one of the most vibrant and open democracies in the world. Seoul, the city that has sprung up around this garrison, leads one of the most advanced and dynamic economies in the world. <p>When our veterans witness this nation's progress, when our veterans come here and see this great and modern country for themselves, they can say with pride, their efforts and their sacrifice was worth it. They see the real results of what they've done: a South Korea that is a world leader and a true partner in Asian security and stability. They see a country like ours, where children can not only have dreams, but those dreams are encouraged, and he or she can grow up to become Secretary General of the United Nations or President of the World Bank or even Ambassador from the U.S. to the country he was born in. None of this was an accident. Freedom is not an accident. Progress is not an accident. Democracy is not an accident. These are things that have to be fought for. And you're part of that legacy. They must be won. And they've got to be tended to constantly and defended without fail. And here, on freedom's frontier, they are, by every man and woman who has served and stood sentinel on this divided peninsula. <p>The 38th parallel now exists as much as a contrast between worlds as it does a border between nations; between a society that's open and one that is closed; between a democracy that is growing and a pariah state that would rather starve its people than feed their hopes and dreams. <p>That's not the results of a war, that's the result of the path that North Korea has taken, a path of confrontation and provocation and pursuing the world's most dangerous weapons. And I want to be clear: The commitment that the United States of America has made to the security of the Republic of Korea only grows stronger in the face of aggression. Our alliance does not waver with each bout of their attention-seeking, it just gains the support of the rest of the world. <p>North Korea's continued pursuit of nuclear weapons is a path that leads only to more isolation. It's not a sign of strength. Anybody can make threats. Anyone can move an army. Anyone can show off a missile. That doesn't make you strong. It does not lead to security or opportunity or respect. Those things don't come through force, they have to be earned. <p>And real strength is allowing an open and participatory democracy, where people can choose their own leaders and choose their own destiny. And real strength is allowing a vibrant society, where people can think and pray and speak their minds as they please, even if it's against their leaders. Especially if it's against their leaders. Real strength is allowing free and open markets that have built growing, thriving middle classes and lifted millions of people out of poverty. <p>We don't use our military might to impose these things on others, but we will not hesitate to use our military might to defend our allies and our way of life. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President</i>. So like all nations on Earth, North Korea and its people have a choice. They can choose to continue down a lonely road of isolation, or they can choose to join the rest of the world, seek a future of greater opportunity and greater security and greater respect, a future that already exists for the citizens on the southern end of the Korean Peninsula. <p>And if they choose this path, America and the Republic of Korea and the rest of the world will help them build that future. But if they do not, they should know that the commitment of the United States of America to the security and defense of the Republic of Korea has not wavered once in more than 60 years. It never has, and it never will. <p>This alliance is special, forged on the battlefield and has been fortified by the common values and mutual interest and mutual respect of our peoples. The United States and Korea are more than allies, we are friends. And this foundation of trust and security and stability that allows both our nations to thrive economically and socially is made possible by the service and sacrifice of every one of you, our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, diplomats. You are the tip of the spear on freedom's frontier. You carry high the legacy left by all those who fought and served here. And to the family members, both here in South Korea and awaiting your return back home, I thank you for your service as well. Because of that service and the service of generations of servicemembers and diplomats, our countries still stands, and our founding principles still shine, and nations around the world that once knew nothing but bitter tastes of fear, now know the blessings of freedom. That's because of you. I could not be prouder to be your Commander in Chief. <p>And now I'm going to come down and shake some hands and thank you in person. <p>God bless you, God bless the Republic of Korea, God bless the United States of America, and God bless our alliance. Thank you.\" "

We wish to express our utmost gratitude for the U.S. unwavering support and cooperation. Your involvement since the beginning of the search and rescue mission and the ongoing recovery operation indeed exemplifies the strong commitment established between our two countries. <p>We are pleased to see the ties between our two countries gaining so much traction. Over the years, the two countries' common interests and shared values have flourished. We are also delighted that both our countries will be discussing ways to strengthen cooperation in wide-ranging areas of economy, security and defense, education, energy, science and technology, and people-to-people relations. <p>The economic ties between our two countries have been very strong. Your continuous support to our country's economic growth would prepare Malaysia in its aspiration to reach the developed nation status. <p>We welcome the United States to continue working hand in hand with Malaysia to ensure the peace and stability of the region. This could be attained through the shared values and mutual respect, understanding, and moderation, coupled by the strong people-to-people relations, testifying both our countries' good will and mutual understanding. <p>Mr. President, you can be rest assured that Malaysia will continue our efforts to build a strong, nourished, and lasting relationship between the United States as a foundation for the stability and prosperity of our countries. <p>We hope that your visit to Malaysia is both meaningful and memorable. It is our hope that you will enjoy our hospitality and return to the United States with fond memories of Malaysia. We pray for your continued good health, as well as for that of your family and for the people of the United States. We pray also for peace, stability, and prosperity for both our countries in the years to come. <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we would like to invite all of you to join us in proposing a toast to the President and the people of the United States. <p>Thank you. <p>[<i>At this point, a toast was offered.</i>] <i>President Obama.</i> Good evening. <i>Selamat petang. </i>Your Majesty, thank you so much for those warm words. To you; Her Majesty; Madam Rosmah; Prime Minister; distinguished guests and friends: Thank you for the extraordinary hospitality that you've shown me and my delegation. And on behalf of my country, I want to thank the Malaysian people for the wonderful welcome that you extended to us today. <p>I'm delighted to make this historic visit. As some of you may know, it has been nearly 50 years since an American President visited Malaysia. In his memoirs, Lyndon Johnson wrote of how impressed he was by the \\"extraordinary vitality and eagerness\\" he saw in the faces of people here and throughout Southeast Asia. And I'm eager to see that same <i>boleh</i> spirit tomorrow when I have the opportunity to speak with young people from across Southeast Asia at the University of Malaya. <p>Mr. Prime Minister, I look forward to our work together, and I pledge to infuse our efforts with that same spirit. Tonight I simply want to express my gratitude for the generosity that you've shown us today, a generosity the people of Malaysia have extended to my family since I was elected. <p>As some of you may know, 2 years ago, the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia hosted an exhibit that showcased some of my mother's batik collection. Now, my mother loved batik.I remember when I was a boy growing up in Jakarta, she'd come home from village markets with her arms full of batik, and she'd lay them around the house and look at them and make dresses out of them. And I was a young boy, so I wasn't as excited as she was. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And they weren't particularly fancy or expensive&mdash;although, later in life, she would get some antiques that were extraordinary&mdash;but for my mother, batik wasn't about fashion. It was representative of the work and the livelihood of mothers and young women who had painstakingly crafted them. It was a window into the lives of others, their cultures and their traditions and their hopes. And it meant so much to her, and it was part of her spirit, and so I'm deeply grateful to the people of Malaysia for celebrating that part of my mother's life. It was very kind of you. <p>And I tell this story because my mother believed, and I believe, that whether we come from a remote village or a big city, whether we live in the United States or in Malaysia, that we all share basic human aspirations: to live in dignity and peace, to shape our own destiny, to be able to make a living and to work hard and support a family and, most of all, to leave the next generation something better than was left to us. <p>These are the aspirations that I believe illuminate a new era of partnership&mdash;of <i>berkerjasama&mdash;</i>between the United States and Malaysia. For while we may be different as nations, our people have similar hopes and similar aspirations. And we can draw strength in both our nations from our ethnic and religious diversity. We can draw hope from our history. And we dream of a brighter future for all of our children. <p>So I would like to propose a toast: To the strength of our relationship, the power of our friendship, the peace and prosperity of our peoples, and the good health of Their Majesties the King and Queen. <p>[<i>A toast was offered.</i>] <p><i>President Obama.</i> <i>Terima kasih banyak.</i> Thank you very much.\" "
"93" "\"<i>President Obama.</i> Well, hello, everybody. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hello! <p><i>President Obama.</i> <i>Selamat petang.</i> [<i>Laughter</i>] I want to thank Prime Minister Najib for bringing me here today, as well as Cheryl Yeoh. Where's Cheryl? She was here just a second ago. <p><i>Prime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia</i>. Cheryl. There's Cheryl. <p><i>President Obama</i>. There she is over there&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;who's going to be directing the Malaysia Global Innovation and Creativity Center, or MaGIC, and Startup Malaysia. <p>As Prime Minister Najib indicated, we are here because we have a shared commitment to fostering the spirit of entrepreneurship, especially among our young people. We want you to be able to create things and start your own companies and your own businesses and come up with your own products and services, because that's how our societies grow. And the dreams and talents of these young people help to fuel our economies and create jobs, and they also bring our countries closer together. <p>So, 5 years ago, when I was in Cairo, I called for a new partnership between the United States and Muslim communities around the world, partnerships where we could focus on the things that matter most in people's daily lives, including jobs and providing for our families. So often, the conversation between the United States and Muslim communities was around security issues, but the truth is, day to day, what people are concerned about is jobs and businesses and improving quality of life for themselves and their families. And that was not enough of a conversation that was taking place. <p>So I was proud to host the first Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Washington. Prime Minister Najib, who has been working to empower entrepreneurs here in Malaysia, hosted last year's summit in Kuala Lumpur. And the impact has been phenomenal. <p>Around the world, we are helping young entrepreneurs connect and collaborate and start their own businesses, serve their communities, tackle global challenges like expanding education and combating climate change, and create this center to turn their ideas into reality. And this center is a direct result of the entrepreneurship summit that the Prime Minister hosted. It's a one-stop shop so young entrepreneurs, they can come here, they can get help with their&mdash;to file a patent for their ideas, they can access loans and venture capital, they can get technical training and assistance, and they can get their businesses up and running. <p>And we just had a chance to see some innovations of some young entrepreneurs that have already been started: an online tool that helps student learn with digital presentations; a very impressive electric gocart; a device that helps diabetics monitor cold sweats so that if they are in need of medical assistance, somebody will be alerted right away. And so this is the kind of entrepreneurship that Prime Minister Najib and I want to encourage. And it's innovation like these that's going to make our lives better and safer and healthier. These young people here, they're going to be creating all kinds of amazing things when they get older. And the fact that this center is giving them the opportunity to learn computer coding early on, understanding that computer sciences and IT are going to be one of the keys to future growth, I think, is a testament to some outstanding investments by the people of Malaysia and the next generation. <p>So I want to thank Prime Minister Najib for all his efforts to support young entrepreneurs and would-be entrepreneurs. I want to thank all of you for your determination and your imagination. I'm very excited to see what's going to happen not only with the entrepreneurs here in the future, but these young people and the remarkable things they'll do to help Malaysia grow, help the region grow, and help the world grow. <p>So <i>terima kasih banyak</i> for the good work that you're doing. [<i>Laughter</i>] Yes.\" "
"94" "\"<i>Selamat pagi.</i> Please, everybody have a seat. Well, it's a great pleasure to be here with Prime Minister Najib. Before I leave to my next stop on this tour, I thought it was entirely appropriate for us to end my wonderful visit here in Malaysia with an event that directly relates to jobs, business, the well-being of our people. <p>Yesterday we agreed to forge a new comprehensive partnership between Malaysia and the United States, and that includes working to expand our economic ties. In the United States, our Government goes to bat every day for American companies that are trying to export or do business abroad. We advocate for them. We help facilitate deals like this. And today, we're selling more American exports around the world than ever before. <p>I want to congratulate these American companies for completing these important commercial deals. Together, these three deals&mdash;in aviation, biotech, and insurance&mdash;are worth nearly $2 billion. It means these companies will be doing more business in Malaysia and selling more exports marked \\"Made in America.\\" These deals support American jobs in places like Ohio and North Carolina. And companies that export often pay better wages, so it's a good day for American workers as well. <p>The United States is already the largest foreign investor in Malaysia, and Malaysia is one of the fastest growing investors in the United States. And I want to do even more business together. And I know the Prime Minister agrees. So these deals reflect our commitment to stepping up our game&mdash;competing harder, investing more&mdash;not only in each other's countries, but across the region. <p>And finally, today reminds us that we need to do everything we can to promote more trade and ties like this. And that includes reducing some of the existing barriers to trade and investment and completing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is going to open up more markets to our exports and support good jobs. <p>So I want to thank Prime Minister Najib for being here and for his commitment to expanding the economic ties between our countries. I want to thank these outstanding business leaders behind us for the great work that they do and the jobs they support back home in the United States. Here in Asia and around the world, I'm going to keep advocating on behalf of American companies and American workers so that we continue to see more growth and prosperity not only in our own country, but around the world. <p>And with that, we're going to let them sign the agreements.

Though your stay here in our country may be short, I hope that it will allow you to see and experience for yourself how, indeed, it is more fun in the Philippines and that, undoubtedly, the Philippines works. <p>Mr. President, the historic friendship between our peoples has been punctuated by visits from your predecessors. Your visit, the eighth by a U.S. President, has been a long time coming, and it marks yet another important chapter in our relations. Your presence here today reaffirms the strong bond between our nations. As a friend and partner of the Filipino people, Mr. President, you have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the growth and development of our nation. <p>It is only fitting, therefore, that your efforts be recognized with the conferment of the Order of Sikatuna. Since 1953, the highest recognition of diplomatic merit of the Republic of the Philippines has been the Order of Sikatuna. It is conferred on those who have fostered and elevated the bilateral partnership of our country with other nations. <p>Tonight I have the distinct pleasure to confer the highest rank, that of Raja, or Grand Collar, on you, Mr. President, for your leadership and policies that assisted the Philippines in times of natural disaster, for helping uphold stability and peace by means of the rule of law in Southeast Asia, and for working with us to fundamentally raise the defense capacity of our country. <p>[<i>At this point, President Aquino's aides displayed the medal for President Obama</i>.] <p><i>President Obama</i>. Thank you. <p><i>President Aquino</i>. Congratulations! <p>The first of your predecessors to receive this distinction was Venerable Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1960. Then as now, may this conferment symbolize our nation's esteem for the American people and may serve as a reminder of the mutual desire to always be partners based on the highest principles of liberty, democracy and progress. <p>Mr. President, our discussions today highlighted the ongoing dialogue and cooperation between our two countries as we adapt and respond to the changing circumstances and the paramount challenges of the 21st century. The world has come to realize that stability is a necessary foundation of progress and prosperity for all our peoples. Alliances are deepened not only through our shared history, but also through mutual confidence and respect, which is constantly refreshed to give new relevance and purpose to our positive, longstanding relations. <p>We are bound by the quest to turn our shared principles of democracy, human rights, and freedom into an inclusive reality not just for our respective peoples, but for all nations. <p>Mr. President, I've always taken to heart that in an increasingly complex world, it is incumbent upon all of us to be part of the solution and not of the problem. From the very first meeting we had in New York in 2010 to this night, you and I&mdash;and the members of our respective administrations&mdash;have worked together as partners and friends, finding ways to promote common understanding and to develop meaningful solutions to a great number of our era's dilemmas. <p>Whether in strengthening our trade relations, security alliances, and people-to-people engagements or encouraging more nations to commit to the Open Government Partnership, an area where the Philippines continues to innovate, we continue to challenge ourselves to answer the pressing questions of these times: By what means can be&mdash;can peace be sustained? Through what instruments can poverty and the effects of climate change and calamity be addressed? And to whose benefit will our mutual and collective undertakings redound? <p>The answer, of course, lies in the maintenance and deepening of the alliance we share, whether in building a Southeast Asia that champions the rule of law or in advancing the belief that the most certain way to prosperity is to actively seek a harmonious relationship with all nations. <p>Mr. President, through this brief visit of yours, I am confident that you have witnessed firsthand how such values, our shared beliefs and principles, can transform a society as it has ours. <p>On this note, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, please rise as I propose a toast. To the good health, happiness, and success of our dear friend President Obama and his family, to the continuing closeness and affection between Filipinos and Americans, and to the realization of our common vision of a more stable, more prosperous, and more inclusive international community. <p>[<i>A toast was offered.</i>] <p><i>President</i>.

Cheers. <p>Well, thank you so much. <i>Magandang gabi.</i> [<i>Laughter</i>] President Aquino, distinguished guests, on behalf of my delegation and myself, I want to thank you for the magnificent welcome today and thank you for your gracious hospitality this evening. <p>Mr. President, I am deeply honored to receive the Order of the Sikatuna. I accept it in the spirit in which it has been bestowed, with a commitment to continuing to deepen the bonds between our two great nations. <p>To all the gentlemen here this evening, you look very good, but I think you'll agree that the women outshine you in the vibrant colors of the Philippines. [<i>Laughter</i>] I have only been here 1 day, but the kindness that you've shown me and the extraordinary hospitality that's been extended to us leaves us with very warm feelings and reflects, I think, the legendary spirit of the Filipino people. I'm told that you have a word to describe this, the inner feeling, that core of a person's being: <i>kalooban.</i> [<i>Laughter</i>] We see this spirit in a family that's given itself to this country. There is no greater nobility than offering one's life to the nation and, Mr. President, your father offered his life so that this nation might be free. Your mother and the citizens of this great nation who took to the streets showed the world that true power lies with people. And with the canonization of Pope John Paul II, we also honor the role that the Catholic Church played in supporting the Filipino people and their desire for freedom. <p>Noynoy, you bear the scars of those who would have taken this nation backwards. And you carry on your family's noble tradition of service, in your commitment to the dignity and prosperity of the Filipino people. <p>We also see the spirit of this nation in all that you have overcome: colonialism and occupation, invasion and the dictatorship. Yours is a fierce independence, won through sacrifice and renewed with each generation. And we saw that again this year. After Yolanda, America grieved with you and stood with you. But we were also inspired by your resilience and your determination to care for those who had been affected. <p>Tonight our hearts actually grieve for some of our fellow Americans back home who have been devastated by very terrible storms and tornadoes, but we draw strength from your example. For even as we grieve, we know that we will recover and we will rebuild in these communities that have been affected because people will care after each other. <p>You bring that same strength and solidarity to our alliance. So let me say tonight on behalf of the American people: We are honored and proud to call you an ally and a friend. Through our treaty alliance, the United States has an ironclad commitment to defend you, your security, and your independence. <p>And finally, we feel our spirit&mdash;our <i>kalooban</i>&mdash;in the friendship between our peoples that expresses itself in so many ways. There's our mutual obsession with basketball. [<i>Laughter</i>] There's our mutual admiration for Manny Pacquiao&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;even if sometimes, he's fighting against Americans, and it doesn't turn out the way we'd like. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>There's our shared pride in the millions of Filipino Americans who contribute to our Nation every single day. There's one in particular I'm grateful for: Cris Comerford, our Executive Chef at the White House. Cris was born in Manila. She still has family here. Thanks to her, we in the White House enjoy the occasional lumpia and adobo. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So I want to propose a toast: To our gracious host, President Aquino; to the alliance that keeps us strong and free; and to the friendship between our peoples, may it always endure, across the ocean and in our hearts. <p><i>Mabuhay.</i> <p>[<i>A toast was offered.</i>] <p><i>President Obama.</i> Cheers.\" "
"96" "\"<i>The President</i>. Hello, everybody! Please, have a seat. <i>Kumusta kayo. </i><p><i>Audience members</i>. <i>Kumusta kayo.</i> <p><i>The President</i>. It is great to be here at Fort Bonifacio. Vice President Binay, distinguished guests: It's an honor to be here with our outstanding allies, the leaders and members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. And we're joined by men and women who stand tall and proud to wear the uniform of the United States of America. And let me also welcome all our Filipino friends. <p>Now, I'm not going to give a long speech, because it's hot and people are in uniform. I hope you don't mind me not wearing my jacket. And I also want to make sure that I have some time to shake some hands. <p>But I'm here in the Philippines to reaffirm the enduring alliance between our two countries. I thank President Aquino for his partnership and the deeper ties that we forged yesterday. I'm especially proud to be here as we remember one of the defining moments of our shared history, the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Leyte during World War II and the beginning of the liberation of the Philippines. <p>Right after this, I'll pay my respects at the American cemetery here in Manila, the final resting place of so many Americans and Filipinos who made the ultimate sacrifice for the freedom of this country in that war. These Americans and Filipinos rest in peace&mdash;they rest in peace as they stood in war: side by side, shoulder to shoulder&mdash;<i>balikatan.</i> <p>Together, Filipinos and Americans put up a heroic defense, at Bataan and Corregidor. Together, they endured the agony of death marches and the horror of the prisoner-of-war camps. Many never made it out. In those years of occupation, Filipino resistance fighters kept up the struggle. And hundreds of thousands of Filipinos fought under the American flag. <p>And sadly, the proud service of many of these Filipino veterans was never fully recognized by the United States. Many were denied the compensation they had been promised. It was an injustice. So in recent years, my administration, working with Congress and others, have worked to right this wrong. We passed a law, reviewed the records, processed claims, and nearly 20,000 Filipino veterans from World War II and their families finally received the compensation they had earned. And it was the right thing to do. <p>What's been written about Bataan could be said of their entire generation: \\"The loss of life was grievous, and hardly a Filipino family was untouched by the tragedy. But the heroic struggle brought out the best in the Filipino character in the face of adversity and served as a beacon to freedom loving peoples everywhere.\\" <p>We are truly honored to have some of these extraordinary veterans here with us today. Among them are men who fought at Bataan and Corregidor and a survivor of those hellish prisoner-of-war camps. Some fought in the resistance, including nurse Carolina Garcia Delfin. These veterans are now in their nineties. They are an inspiration to us all, and I'd ask those who can stand to stand or give a wave so that we can all salute their service. The spirit of these veterans&mdash;their strength, their solidarity&mdash;I see it in you as well: when you train and exercise together to stay ready for the future; when our Special Forces&mdash;some of you here today&mdash;advise and assist our Filipino partners in their fight against terrorism; and when you respond to crises together, as you did after Yolanda. Along with your civilian partners, you rushed into the disaster zone, pulled people from the rubble, delivered food and medicine. You showed what friends can do when we take care of each other. <p>These are the kinds of missions we face today. Yesterday President Aquino and I agreed to begin a new chapter in our alliance. And under our new agreement, American forces can begin rotating through Filipino airfields and ports. We'll train and exercise together more to bring our militaries even closer and to support your efforts to strengthen your armed forces. We'll improve our ability to respond even faster to disasters like Yolanda. And today I thank the people of the Philippines for welcoming our servicemembers as your friends and partners. <p>Deepening our alliance is part of our broader vision for the Asia-Pacific. We believe that nations and peoples have the right to live in security and peace and to have their sovereignty and territorial integrity respected. We believe that international law must be upheld, that freedom of navigation must be preserved, and commerce must not be impeded. We believe that disputes must be resolved peacefully and not by intimidation or force. That's what our nations stand for. That's the future we're working for. And that's why your service is so important. <p>Let me be absolutely clear: For more than 60 years, the United States and the Philippines have been bound by a mutual defense treaty. And this treaty means our two nations pledge&mdash;and I'm quoting&mdash;our \\"common determination to defend themselves against external armed attacks so that no potential aggressor could be under the illusion that either of them stands alone.\\" In other words, our commitment to defend the Philippines is ironclad, and the United States will keep that commitment, because allies never stand alone. <p>In closing, I want to leave you with an incredible story that captures the strength of our alliance. We all know about the massive international response after Yolanda. What few people realize is that it started all with a single aircraft carrying a handful of Filipino and American troops and civilians. The storm hit land that Friday. The very next morning, the first aircraft took off, a Philippine C-130 carrying Captain Roy Trinidad, a Philippine Navy SEAL, Colonel Mike Wylie, United States Marines, and Major George Apalisok, U.S. Air Force. <p>Just hours after the storm passed, with Tacloban devastated, they landed at the airport. And the next day, they were joined by others, including Army Major Leo Liebreich. In the days that followed, they worked together&mdash;Filipinos and Americans&mdash;setting up a medical station, clearing debris from the runway, reopening that airport. Filipino soldiers unloading aid from American cargo aircraft; American troops loading supplies onto Filipino helicopters. And when all the cargo was off those aircraft, our troops worked together to help local residents aboard so that they could be evacuated to safety. And over and over, those grateful Filipinos responded with a simple word: <i>salamat.</i> <p>There, in the ruin, men like these worked around the clock, day after day. And at night they'd sleep on boards for cots, in a damaged building with only half a roof. \\"It rained on some nights, and we got a little wet,\\" said George, \\"but nobody complained.\\" \\"We've been training together for many years,\\" he said. \\"We worked as a team.\\" And because of individuals like these, thousands were evacuated to safety, and what started with a few men on that first day became a global relief effort that saved countless lives. Roy, the Philippine Navy SEAL, George, Mike, Leo&mdash;they are here today. George also happens to be a proud Filipino American. I want them to stand again and accept our thanks. We are proud of their outstanding service. Thank you. <p>There's a connection between our proud veterans from World War II, our men and women serving today, bound across the generations by the spirit of our alliance, Filipinos and Americans standing together, shoulder to shoulder, <i>balikatan.</i> On behalf of the American people, thank you all for your service. Thank you for making us so proud. To the Americans here, I am never prouder than being able to stand before you as your Commander in Chief. To our Filipino Armed Forces, thank you for being such an outstanding ally. Together, you are helping to secure the prosperity and peace of both our nations. <p>God bless you. God bless the Republic of the Philippines. God bless the United States of America. God bless the alliance between our great nations. Thank you.\" "
"97" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you, everybody. Please have a seat. Good afternoon. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Aloha! <p><i>The President.</i> Aloha. [<i>Laughter</i>] Got a Hawaiian guy here. <p>After 14 months since I've called on Congress to reward the hard work of millions of Americans like the ones who we have here today to raise the Federal minimum wage, we saw this morning a majority of Senators saying yes, but almost every Republican saying no to giving America a raise. <p>They blocked a bill sponsored by Tom Harkin and Congressman George Miller, who is right here in front, a bill that would have gradually raised the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10 an hour. By preventing even a vote on this bill, they prevented a raise for 28 million hard-working Americans. They said no to helping millions work their way out of poverty. And keep in mind, this bill would have done so without any new taxes or spending or bureaucracy. They told Americans like the ones who are here today that you're on your own, without even looking them in the eye. <p>Now, we know these Americans. We depend on them. The workers who'd benefit from a minimum wage increase often work full time, often in physically demanding jobs. They average 35 years of age. Most low-paying jobs are held by women. But because Republicans in Congress said no to even allowing a vote on the floor of the Senate, these folks are going to have to wait for the raise they deserve. <p>Now, the good news is, outside of Washington, folks aren't waiting. While Republicans have been deciding whether to even allow a minimum wage bill to come up for a vote, you've seen 10 States and the District of Columbia go ahead and raise theirs. Yesterday the Hawaii Legislature voted to raise their minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. Maryland did the same thing earlier this month, and I know we've got some Maryland State legislators here today. Thanks for the good work. <p>So the actions that have been taken in just four States&mdash;Maryland, Connecticut, Minnesota, and Hawaii&mdash;means that over a million workers will see a raise. What's more, we've seen big companies like the Gap and small businesses&mdash;from a pizza joint in St. Louis to an ice cream parlor in Florida&mdash;increasingly choosing to raise wages for their employees because they know it's good business. They know that it means employees are more likely to stay on the job, less turnover. It means that they're going to be more productive and customers see the difference. That's one of the reasons I issued an Executive order requiring employees on new Federal contracts to be paid a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour. <p>So Americans have been way out in front of Congress on this issue. In fact, about three in four Americans support raising the minimum wage. And that's because we believe that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, nobody who works full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty. That's a basic principle. And at a time when those at the top are doing better than ever, while millions of Americans are working harder and harder just to get by, that three out of four Americans understands that America deserves a raise. A few months ago, I got a letter from a woman named Sheila Artis. And Sheila lives in Lilburn, Georgia, and at the time she was working two jobs, making $8 an hour at each job. As Sheila wrote, \\"I do not have days off, I have hours off.\\" But she kept going to work every day because she wanted to be able to afford college tuition for her daughter. And so she wrote to me and said: \\"I do not want a pot of gold. All I want is to pay for college and pay my bills in full every month.\\" That's all she's looking for. Doesn't expect to get wealthy, just wants to be able to pay the bills at the end of every month, be able to act responsibly, meet her responsibilities based on her own hard work. <p>People like Sheila deserve a fair shot. So far Republicans in Congress disagree. In fact, some of them want to scrap the minimum wage entirely. One House Republican said: \\"It's outlived its usefulness. I'd vote to repeal the minimum wage.\\" A Senate Republican said he doesn't think the minimum wage helps the middle class. <p>This is a very simple issue. Either you're in favor of raising wages for hard-working Americans or you're not. Either you want to grow the economy from the middle out and the bottom up so that prosperity is broad based, or you think that top-down economics is the way to go. <p>Republicans in Congress have found the time to vote more than 50 times to undermine or repeal the health care bill for millions of working families. Earlier this month, they voted for a budget that would give the wealthiest Americans a massive tax cut while forcing deep cuts to investments that help middle class families. But they won't raise wages for millions of working families when three-quarters of Americans support it? That makes no sense. And on top of that, they've blocked our efforts to make sure women receive equal pay for equal work. They've stood in the way as we've fought to extend unemployment insurance for parents who need a little help supporting their families while they're out looking for work. Republicans have failed to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, and they've increasingly failed to do anything when it comes to helping people who work hard to get ahead. <p>If there's any good news here, it's that Republicans in Congress don't get the last word on this or any issue; you do, the American people, the voters. Change is happening, whether Republicans in Congress like it or not. And so my message to the American people is this: Do not get discouraged by a vote like the one we saw this morning. Get fired up. Get organized. Make your voices heard. And rest assured, I'm going to keep working with you and Leader Nancy Pelosi and other Members of Congress who are here today to raise wages for hard-working Americans. It's the right thing to do. <p>If your Member of Congress doesn't support raising the minimum wage, you've got to let them know they're out of step and that if they keep putting politics ahead of working Americans, you'll put them out of office. Tell them to reconsider. Tell them it's time for $10.10. You can tweet at them: Use hashtag  1010Means. Let them know how raising the minimum wage would help you or your family or somebody that you know. And while you're at it, tell them to restore unemployment insurance for Americans who are trying to support their families right now while they look for work. Extending this lifeline of unemployment insurance would actually strengthen the economy and create jobs and give millions of Americans across the country a sense of hope. <p>In the meantime, I'm going to keep offering my support to every business owner and mayor and Governor and county official and legislator and organization that's working to give America a raise. Because change does not come from Washington, it comes to Washington from all the folks out there who were working hard. Americans want the people they send here to set aside the old political arguments and move this country forward. With enough determination and enough persistence, the American people will ultimately win out. <p>So thank you, God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\""
"98" "\"Well, welcome to the White House. Let me start off by saying thank you to a leader of unbelievable passion and expertise and dedication, somebody who every single day wakes up and thinks about three things&mdash;either his family, basketball&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;or how to give child a world-class education&mdash;our Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan. [<i>Applause</i>] Hey! <p>I also want to thank our Members of Congress who are here today. I am thrilled to have them here and always encourage all Members of Congress to focus on education and teachers. And I am thrilled to be welcoming all our State and national teachers of the year. So give them a big round of applause. Good job. <p>This is a phenomenal group, in addition to being very good looking&mdash;[<i>Laughter</i>] the best of the best. And they'd be the first to say that they're only here because they're surrounded by outstanding teachers who give all to their students every single day. Today is a chance to thank not just the teachers on this stage, but teachers all across the country. We really can't say enough about how important their role is in making sure that America succeeds. So thank you for what you're giving our children and what you're giving our Nation. <p>Now, it's been a while since I was in school, but I still remember all the wonderful teachers who made me who I am, who opened the world up to me, who made me feel that maybe I had something to offer and maybe saw things in me before I saw them in myself. We all had teachers like that. Talk to anybody who's succeeded in business or written a play or invented an app or broken an athletic record, and they'll tell you about a teacher or a coach who inspired them and who challenged them and taught them values and encouraged them to be curious and ask questions and explore new realms and new ideas. Everybody has got somebody like that in their lives. <p>That's what great teachers do. They set us on a better path. And they do it even though we ask so much of them. Teachers don't get an off day, even when they're exhausted, even when you're up all night with your own kid, even if you've got bills or something personal on your mind. Once you're in front of that class, you've got eager minds depending on you. And what a lot of people may not realize is how emotionally taxing teaching can be, because great teachers really care about their students. <p>You carry their struggles with you well after the school day ends. You worry about them. You're often the ones they go to with their troubles and their fears. And sometimes, you can see that they've got something on their minds even if they don't talk to you about it. Sometimes, they even reach back after they've gone off to college and may need a little advice. <p>And it's that all-encompassing commitment, that love that you feel for your students, that makes so many teachers go the extra mile. It's why many of you dip into your own pockets to pay for classroom supplies. It's why you spend your nights and weekends thinking about new ways to make your lessons come alive and why you work hard to build relationships with your students' families, because you want to make sure they all have the support that they need outside of the classroom, as well as in it. <p>So being a teacher is a 24/7 job. And yet many say there's nothing in the world they'd rather do. And that's the kind of commitment that the guests we have up on this stage today exhibit every day. We've got teachers here from just a few miles away. We've also got teachers who came from the Mariana Islands. They teach everything from biology to music to special education. What connects them is how they challenge their kids to reach their full potential; the creativity and passion that they bring to their work, instead of just going through the motions or teaching to the test. What separates them is the lasting impact that they have on their students' lives. <p>And that is the story of today's primary honoree, our National Teacher of the Year for 2014, Mr. Sean McComb. Give Sean a big round of applause. Now, I wish I could say this is the biggest thing that happened to Sean this year, but that little bundle right there is Sean's. [<i>Laughter</i>] So we clearly are ranked second or third in terms of big stuff happening in Sean's life. <p>But when Sean was a high school student, he dealt with some pretty serious problems at home and spent his days feeling apathetic and disengaged. And then he entered Mr. Schurtz's English class. And Mr. Schurtz was one of those teachers who changes everything. He made Sean want to work hard. When Sean's mom passed away, Mr. Schurtz gave Sean the strength to deliver her eulogy. When Sean went to college, it was, as he put it, through the force of Mr. Schurtz's will. So Sean himself saw the impact that a teacher could have in a child's life. And it was Mr. Schurtz's example that led Sean to become an English teacher himself. <p>Today, at Patapsco High School and Center for the Arts in Baltimore, Sean works with kids in a college readiness program called Advancement Via Individual Determination, or AVID. And it's aimed at the kind of student Sean was in high school: students who have the ability to do the work, but need that extra push to reach their full potential. Among the last two graduating classes in the AVID program, 98 percent were admitted to a 4-year college. And they earned more merit scholarship money than the rest of the graduating class combined. <p>It's a tribute to Sean that one of his students asked him, \\"What do you think about me becoming a teacher?\\" Sean asked him what subject he'd want to teach, and his student said: \\"It doesn't matter. I just want to have as much fun as you do every day.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And Sean tries to instill in his students a sense of respect and obligation to each other. As one of his students said, \\"I feel like I'm not learning on my own here, I learn from everyone.\\" And I think it speaks volumes about the kind of example Sean sets for his students that, as part of his application for this award, the parents of one of his students wrote a letter on his behalf. And they wrote: \\"[Our daughter] had the typical teenage drama in school that at times really got her depressed about school and life in general. We reached out to Sean for help with getting her back on track. No matter his schedule load, if he knew one of his students was in need, whether [for] a shoulder to cry on or a calming word of encouragement, he'd be there to help.\\" <p>And there's an image from Sean's application essay that captures what he and all the teachers here are trying to accomplish. Every child has an invisible chalkboard attached to their hearts and minds that they carry with them through their lives. Some people they meet write messages of love and support. Some leave messages of negativity and doubt. It's a teacher's job to erase the negative messages and fill those boards with caring words and inspire confidence and strengthen values. Now, some of today's students might not even know what a chalkboard is anymore&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but they do know that what a teacher gives them stays with them for a lifetime, because teachers matter. When Michelle and I talk to students, we often tell them education is a two-way street. It's our job to provide students with great schools and great teachers, and it's their job to do their homework and work hard and do their best. The people you elect have to make sure that teachers and school districts have the resources they need to do their jobs well. And investing in education has been a top priority of mine since the day I took office. And it falls on all of us to make sure that we're encouraging our kids and reading to them and teaching them healthy, successful habits that set them on a path to college and a career and a lifetime of citizenship. <p>Teachers who work hard to inspire their kids every day, they too deserve our support, because these are our kids that we're grooming for all the challenges that they're going to face throughout the next generation. <p>So I could not be prouder of Sean and all the teachers who are here today. Sean, I'm pretty sure Mr. Schurtz would be proud of you too. And to all the teachers who are out there, and the millions who are working hard in classrooms all across our Nation, we want to thank you as well. You're doing the Lord's work. And with that, I'm going to present Sean with his apple. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Thank you, and God bless you. God bless America. That's a good-looking apple.\" "
"99" "\"Hi, everybody. My number-one priority as President is doing whatever I can to create more jobs and opportunity for hard-working families. And yesterday we learned that businesses added 273,000 jobs last month. All told, our businesses have now created 9.2 million new jobs over 50 consecutive months of job growth. <p>But we need to keep going, to create more good jobs and give middle class families a sense of security. And I want to work with Congress to do it. <p>But so far this year, Republicans in Congress have blocked or voted down every serious idea to create jobs and strengthen the middle class. They've said no to raising the minimum wage, no to equal pay for equal work, and no to restoring the unemployment insurance they let expire for more than 2 million Americans looking for a new job. <p>That's not what we need right now. Not when there are still too many folks out of work and too many families working harder than ever just to get by. <p>That's why, in my State of the Union Address, I said that in this year of action, whenever I can act on my own to create jobs and expand opportunity for more Americans, I will. And since January, I've taken more than 20 executive actions to do just that. <p>I acted to raise more workers' wages by requiring that workers on new Federal contracts earn a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour, and as long as Republicans in Congress refuse to act, I'll keep working with cities, States, and businesses to give more Americans a raise. I acted to encourage more pay transparency and strengthen enforcement of equal pay laws so that more women have the tools they need to earn fair pay. And I'm modernizing regulations to make sure that more Americans who work overtime get the pay that they've earned. I've launched new hubs to help attract more high-tech manufacturing jobs to America and ordered a reform of job training programs to make sure more Americans can earn the skills that employers need right now. I've brought together business leaders to help us connect more classrooms to high-speed Internet and give more of the long-term unemployed a better shot at finding a job. <p>Each of these steps will make a difference. You can check out the full list at whitehouse.gov. But we could do a lot more if Republicans in Congress were less interested in stacking the deck in favor of those at the top and more interested in growing the economy for everybody. They've now voted more than 50 times to take apart the Affordable Care Act. Imagine if they voted 50 times on serious jobs bills. <p>That's why I'm going to take action on my own wherever I can: to grow our economy from the middle out, not the top down; to give every American who works hard a chance to get ahead. That's what this year of action is all about, and that's what I'm going to keep fighting for. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "

[<i>Laughter</i>] That's more like it. <p>It is great to be back. What a year, huh? I usually start these dinners with a few self-deprecating jokes. After my stellar 2013, what could I possibly talk about? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I admit it, last year was rough. Sheesh. [<i>Laughter</i>] At one point, things got so bad, the 47 percent called Mitt Romney to apologize. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Of course, we rolled out healthcare.gov. That could have gone better. [<i>Laughter</i>] In 2008, my slogan was, \\"Yes, we can.\\" In 2013, my slogan was, \\"Control-Alt-Delete.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] On the plus side, they did turn the launch of healthcare.gov into one of the year's biggest movies. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>An image of the title of the Walt Disney Co. film \\"Frozen\\" was shown.</i>] <p>But rather than dwell on the past, I would like to pivot to this dinner.

[<i>Laughter</i>] They've never seen an audience this big before. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But look, everybody is trying to keep up with this incredibly fast-changing media landscape. For example, I got a lot of grief on cable news for promoting Obamacare to young people on \\"Between Two Ferns.\\" But that's what young people like to watch. And to be fair, I am not the first person on television between two potted plants. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>An image of Elizabeth Hasselbeck, cohost of the FOX News program \\"FOX & Friends,\\" seated between cohosts Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade was shown.</i>] <p>Sometimes, I do feel disrespected by you reporters.

[<i>Laughter</i>] I'm the best President in the game! [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>What do you think, Richard? Was that good? A little more feeling next time? While we're talking sports, just last month, a wonderful story, an American won the Boston Marathon for first time in 30 years. Which was inspiring and only fair, since a Kenyan has been President for the last 6. [<i>Laughter</i>] We had to even things out. [<i>Laughter</i>] We have some other athletes here tonight, including Olympic snowboarding gold medalist Jamie Anderson is here. We're proud of her. Incredibly talented young lady. Michelle and I watched the Olympics. We cannot believe what these folks do, death-defying feats. Haven't seen somebody pull a 180 that fast since Rand Paul disinvited that Nevada rancher from this dinner. [<i>Laughter</i>] As a general rule, things don't end well if the sentence starts, \\"Let me tell you something I know about the Negro.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] You don't really need to hear the rest of it. [<i>Laughter</i>] Just a tip for you: Don't start your sentence that way. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Speaking of Rand Paul&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;Colorado legalized marijuana this year, an interesting social experiment. I do hope it doesn't lead to a whole lot of paranoid people who think that the Federal Government is out to get them and listening to their phone calls. [<i>Laughter</i>] That would be a problem. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And speaking of conservative heroes, the Koch brothers bought a table here tonight. But as usual, they used a shadowy right-wing organization as a front. Hello, FOX News. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm just kidding. Let's face it, FOX, you'll miss me when I'm gone. [<i>Laughter</i>] It will be harder to convince the American people that Hillary was born in Kenya. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>A lot of us really are concerned about the way big money is influencing our politics. I remember when a Super PAC was just me buying Marlboro 100s instead of regulars. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Of course, now that it's 2014, Washington is obsessed on the midterms. Folks are saying that with my sagging poll numbers, my fellow Democrats don't really want me campaigning with them. And I don't think that's true, although I did notice the other day that Sasha needed a speaker at career day, and she invited Bill Clinton. [<i>Laughter</i>] I was a little hurt by that. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Both sides are doing whatever it takes to win the ruthless game. Republicans&mdash;this is a true story&mdash;Republicans actually brought in a group of consultants to teach their candidates how to speak to women. This is true. And I don't know if it will work with women, but I understand that America's teenage boys are signing up to run for the Senate in droves. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Anyway, while you guys focus on the horserace, I'm going to do what I do: I'm going to be focused on everyday Americans. Just yesterday I read a heartbreaking letter&mdash;you know I get letters from folks from around the country; every day, I get 10 that I read&mdash;this one got to me: a Virginia man who's been stuck in the same part-time job for years, no respect from his boss, no chance to get ahead. I really wish Eric Cantor would stop writing me. [<i>Laughter</i>] You can just pick up the phone, Eric. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And I'm feeling sorry, believe it or not, for the Speaker of the House as well. These days, the House Republicans actually give John Boehner a harder time than they give me, which means orange really is the new black. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But I have not given up the idea of working with Congress. In fact, 2 weeks ago, Senator Ted Cruz and I, we got a bill done together. And I have to say, the signing ceremony was something special. We've got a picture of it, I think. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>An image of the President signing a bill, with Sen. R. Edward Cruz and Satan standing behind him and an icy landscape labeled \\"Hell\\" in the background, was shown.</i>] Look, I know, Washington seems more dysfunctional than ever. Gridlock has gotten so bad in this town you have to wonder: What did we do to piss off Chris Christie so bad? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>One issue, for example, we haven't been able to agree on is unemployment insurance. Republicans continue to refuse to extend it. You know what? I am beginning to think they've got a point. If you want to get paid while not working, you should have to run for Congress just like everybody else. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Of course, there is one thing that keeps Republicans busy. They have tried more than 50 times to repeal Obamacare. Despite that, 8 million people signed up for health care in the first open enrollment. Which does lead one to ask, how well does Obamacare have to work before you don't want to repeal it? What if everybody's cholesterol drops to 120? [<i>Laughter</i>] What if your yearly checkup came with tickets to a Clippers game? [<i>Laughter</i>] Not the old, Don Sterling Clippers, the new, Oprah Clippers. Would that be good enough? [<i>Laughter</i>] What if it gave Mitch McConnell a pulse? [<i>Laughter</i>] What is it going to take? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Anyway, this year, I've promised to use more executive actions to get things done without Congress. My critics call this the imperial Presidency. The truth is, I just show up every day in my office and do my job. I've got a picture of this, I think. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>An image of the President sitting in the Oval Office on a throne from the HBO program \\"Game of Thrones,\\" with a crossbow on the coffee table in the foreground, was shown</i>.] <p>You would think they'd appreciate a more assertive approach, considering that the new conservative darling is none other than Vladimir Putin. [<i>Laughter</i>] Last year, Pat Buchanan said Putin is \\"headed straight for the Nobel Peace Prize.\\" He said this. Now, I know it sounds crazy, but to be fair, they give those to just about anybody these days. [<i>Laughter</i>] So it could happen. <p>But it's not just Pat. Rudy Giuliani said Putin is \\"what you call a leader.\\" Mike Huckabee and Sean Hannity keep talking about his bare chest, which is kind of weird. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>An image depicting FOX News commentator Sean Hannity, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York City, and former Gov. Michael D. Huckabee of Arkansas as teenage fans, with a poster of a shirtless President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia on the wall behind them, was shown.</i>] <p>Look it up. They talk about it a lot. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>It is strange to think that I have just 2&frac12; years left in this office. Everywhere I look, there are reminders that I only hold this job temporarily. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>An image of moving boxes labeled \\"Hillary&mdash;Oval\\" and \\"Hold for Hillary\\" stacked on top of the President's desk in the Oval Office was shown.</i>] <p>But it's a long time between now and 2016, and anything can happen. You may have heard the other day, Hillary had to dodge a flying shoe at a press conference. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>An image of Vice President Joe Biden holding a shoe was shown.</i>] <p>I love that picture. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Regardless of what happens, I've run my last campaign, and I'm beginning to think about my legacy. Some of you know Mayor Rahm Emanuel recently announced he is naming a high school in Chicago after me, which is extremely humbling. I was even more flattered to hear Rick Perry, who is here tonight, is doing the same thing in Texas. Take a look. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>An image of a high school was shown. A sign in the foreground reads: \\"Raging Socialist Preparatory School. Home of the 'Fighting Chomskys.' Bake Sale Tuesday. All Proceeds Will Be Divided Equally.\\"</i>] <p>Thank you, Rick. It means a lot to me. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And I intend to enjoy all the free time that I will have. George W. Bush took up painting after he left office, which inspired me to take up my own artistic side. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm sure we've got a shot of this. [<i>Laughter</i>] Maybe not. The joke doesn't work without the slide. [<i>Laughter</i>] Oh well. Assume that it was funny. [<i>Laughter</i>] Does this happen to you, Joel? It does, okay. <p>On a more serious note, tonight reminds us that we really are lucky to live in a country where reporters get to give a head of state a hard time on a daily basis, and then, once a year, give him or her the chance, at least, to try to return the favor. <p>But we also know that not every journalist or photographer or crewmember is so fortunate, because even as we celebrate the free press tonight, our thoughts are with those in places around the globe, like Ukraine and Afghanistan and Syria and Egypt, who risk everything&mdash;in some cases, even give their lives&mdash;to report the news. <p>And what tonight also reminds us is that the fight for full and fair access goes beyond the chance to ask a question. As Steve mentioned, decades ago, an African American who wanted to cover his or her President might be barred from journalism school, burdened by Jim Crow, and, once in Washington, banned from press conferences. But after years of effort, Black editors and publishers began meeting with FDR's Press Secretary, Steve Early. And then they met with the President himself, who declared that a Black reporter would get a credential. And even when Harry McAlpin made history as the first African American to attend a Presidential news conference, he wasn't always welcomed by the other reporters. But he was welcomed by the President, who told him, \\"I'm glad to see you, McAlpin, and I'm very happy to have you here.\\" <p>Now, that sentiment might have worn off once Harry asked him a question or two&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and Harry's battles continued. But he made history. And we're so proud of Sherman and his family for being here tonight and the White House Correspondents' Association for creating a scholarship in Harry's name. <p>For over 100 years, even as the White House Correspondents' Association has told the story of America's progress, you've lived it too, gradually allowing equal access to women and minorities and gays and Americans with disabilities and, yes, radio and television and Internet reporters as well. And through it all, you've helped make sure that even as societies change, our fundamental commitment to the interaction between those who govern and those who ask questions doesn't change. And as Jay will attest, it's a legacy you carry on enthusiastically every single day. <p>And because this is the 100th anniversary of the Correspondents' Association, I actually recorded an additional brief video thanking all of you for your hard work. Can we run the video? <p>[<i>A video of the President speaking began, but then malfunctioned.</i>] <i>The President.</i> What's going on? [<i>Laughter</i>] I was told this would work. Does anybody know how to fix this? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius entered the stage.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Oh, thank you. [<i>Laughter</i>] You got it? <p><i>Secretary Sebelius.</i> I got this. I see it all the time. There, that should work. <p>[<i>The video played. In it, the President made brief remarks as follows.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Congratulations to the White House Correspondents' Association. Here's to a hundred more terrific years. <p>[<i>The President resumed his live remarks as follows.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. And God bless America, and thank you, Kathleen Sebelius.\" "
"101" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! <i>Bienvenidos a la Casa Blanca!</i> [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member</i>. Hey! <p><i>The President</i>. Hey! This is a rowdy crowd, I can tell. [<i>Laughter</i>] They're ready to party. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Love the margaritas. <p><i>The President.</i> The margaritas, I hear, are quite good. Be careful, though, they'll sneak up on you. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Well, thank you for joining our Cinco de Mayo celebration. It is wonderful to have so many Latinos and Latinas&mdash;and people who wish they were Latino or Latina. [<i>Laughter</i>] A lot of honorary Latinos and Latinas: On Cinco de Mayo, <i>todos somos Latinos!</i> [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I'm just going to say a few words, and then we get back to the fiesta. No Cinco de Mayo would be complete without great food and great music. So I want to thank our guest chefs: my good friend Jos&eacute; Andr&eacute;s; Pati Jinich is here as well. Our musicians: members of the Georgetown University Orchestra and our mariachis, Los Gallos Negros. <p>I'm honored to welcome our friends from other parts of the Americas. We've got Mexico's Undersecretary of North America, Sergio Alcocer, is here. The Ambassador to the United States, Eduardo Medina Mora, is here as well. Give them a big round of applause. Peru's Ambassador to the U.S. Harold Forsyth is here. I also want to welcome all the Members of Congress who are here today, including members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. And its outstanding Chairman, Rub&eacute;n Hinojosa, is here. And as always, it's great to see Hispanic Americans from across my administration, whose contributions every single day make me proud. <p>Cinco de Mayo marks a great moment in Mexican history, one that ended up shaping the United States as well. One hundred and fifty-two years ago, a band of Mexican patriots in the town of Puebla faced an invasion by Napoleon III's troops. The French side was bigger, it was better trained and better armed. But the Mexicans grabbed whatever weapons they could and fought with all their might, and they won the battle. A few years later, thanks to the bravery and tenacity of the Mexican people, with support of the United States, the occupation came to an end. <p>And had the opposite happened, our nations would look very different today. Our friendship with Mexico has had an enormous influence on our history and our culture and our economy. Today, our governments work together on everything from stopping crime to promoting trade to protecting our environment. And millions of Americans are connected to Mexico through ties of friendship and language and family, and they make vital contributions to our Nation every single day. So today we remember with gratitude those brave fighters who triumphed in Puebla all those years ago and the generations of Mexicans and Americans who've sustained and strengthened us ever since. <p>Of course, we can honor our past by building an even brighter future together. And that means restoring our Nation's promise of opportunity for all so that everybody has a fair shot at the American Dream, which is why I fought so hard for the Affordable Care Act, because every American deserves quality, affordable health care. Thanks to the ACA, millions of Latinos now have access to expanded preventive care, and hundreds of thousands of Latinos have recently enrolled in health care plans; hundreds of thousands of young Latinos are able to stay on their parents' plans until they're 26. <p>It's the same reason I'm fighting to make sure every child has access to a world-class education, from pre-K through college. And thanks in part to our investments, our high school graduation rate is the highest on record, and the Latino dropout rate has been cut in half since 2000. That's worth applauding. <p>Education helps us find new frontiers for collaboration between the United States and Mexico and throughout the hemisphere. Now, that's why I launched the 100,000 Strong in the Americas initiative to significantly increase educational exchanges among our countries. And I just came from a discussion with leaders in business and education who see these exchanges as key to maintaining our competitive advantage. They understand that if we're serious about building a 21st-century workforce, then we're going to have to build knowledge and relationships that reach across borders. And that's how we're going to create new jobs and develop new markets, explore new ideas and unleash the hemisphere's extraordinary opportunity. <p>And opportunity for all is why I'm fighting so hard to fix a broken immigration system. [<i>Applause</i>] All right? I am convinced that America's prosperity and security depend on comprehensive, commonsense immigration reform. Last year, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate came together to pass a commonsense bill that would grow our economy and shrink our deficit, reward businesses and workers that played by the rules, all while upholding our most cherished values as a nation of immigrants. <p>So far, the Republicans in the House have refused to allow meaningful immigration reform to move forward at all. We know there are Republicans in the House who want to do the right thing. I'm going to work with everybody who's serious about strengthening our borders, modernizing our legal immigration system, keeping more families together, and getting this done. And it's the right thing to do for our economy, for our security, and our future. <p>The majority of Americans agree with me on this. It's time for Members of Congress and Republicans in the House to catch up with the rest of the country. So I need all of you to go out there and mobilize, particularly over the next 2 months. Tell them to get on board. Get on board with business leaders and faith leaders, law enforcement, Republicans and Democrats across the country. Say yes to fixing our broken immigration system. Let's get it done right now once and for all. <p>So today, on Cinco de Mayo, we celebrate our shared heritage, our shared history, our shared future. And that's not something to be afraid of, that's something that we need to embrace. That's what I'm going to be doing, not just today, but every day, to keep fighting for opportunity for all people and greater understanding between all nations. And I know that's what you're fighting for as well. <p>So <i>gracias</i>. <i>Que Dios los bendiga, y feliz Cinco de Mayo.</i> Thank you, everybody.\" "
"102" "\"Well, good afternoon, everybody. Obviously, we just had a chance to tour some of the areas that were devastated by last week's tornadoes and had a chance to meet with some of the families who lost loved ones. I also had a chance to thank some of the first responders and the recovery workers and members of the National Guard who have been working nonstop to help families and businesses pick up the pieces after this devastating tornado. <p>I want to express my deep appreciation for Governor Beebe and his outstanding leadership; Senator Pryor, Congressman Griffin, Mayor Firestone. They all showed great leadership and were here, hands-on, on the ground throughout these difficult days. And I'm here to make sure that they know and that everybody who's been affected knows that the Federal Government is going to be right here until we get these communities rebuilt. Because when something like this happens to a wonderful community like this one, it happens to all of us, and we've got to be there for them. <p>After the tornadoes touched down, I immediately approved a major disaster declaration to make sure every Federal resource was available to help folks in Faulkner County and other areas affected by the tornadoes. At my direction, FEMA deployed Incident Management Assistance Teams to support local recovery efforts. Craig Fugate was down here the day after the storm, and a team of the Army Corps of Engineers has been helping search through the debris. <p>Here in Vilonia, the recovery process is just beginning. It's especially difficult because this town has seen more than its fair share of tragedy. Almost exactly 3 years ago, another tornado leveled parts of Vilonia, and some families and businesses had just finished rebuilding when they were forced to start all over. But folks here are tough. They look out for one another, and that's been especially clear over the past week. <p>Immediately after the tornado hit, about 200 people, including fire crews from other counties, were ready to go house to house searching for injured neighbors. Some survivors were driven to the hospital by complete strangers, and in the days that followed, thousands of volunteers showed up to help remove debris and hunt for belongings, pick up trash, and deliver supplies and water. And one volunteer, 16-year-old Casey Williams, did such a good job coordinating relief efforts that Arkansas State troopers started taking orders from her. I had a chance to meet her, and she is extraordinarily impressive. So I don't know what she's going to be doing in the future, but I know it's going to be something great. <p>More than any disaster, it is that dedication and that commitment to each other that truly defines this town. As one resident said, \\"We just say a prayer and then get to work.\\" So the people of Vilonia and all the other towns devastated by the storm understand there's a lot of work that remains to be done. But I'm here to remind them that they're not doing this work alone. Your country is going to be here for you. We're going to support you every step of the way. You are in our thoughts and prayers, Mr. Mayor. Thank you for the great leadership that you've shown. I know that you can count on your Governor and your Senator and your Congressman here to make sure that every resource that we have available to you is going to be there. And one of the things that the mayor expressed to me that we've got some concerns about is when this happens in a town like this, it's not just the infrastructure and the buildings that are torn down. You also lose part of your sales tax base. And so we're going to have to figure out how they can make sure that they get back on their feet. And I'll be sure to work with Congressman Griffin, Senator Pryor, and Governor Beebe to see if we can do something on that front as well. But I could not be more impressed by the spirit of community that's here. <p>We've got this gentleman right here I just had a chance to meet, who was in one of these homes where he lives just when the storm hit. Thankfully, he and his 16-year-old son and wife are okay. It's a reminder, obviously, that as important as possessions are, nothing is more important than family. Those families that I had a chance to met&mdash;meet with, they're still mourning those they lost. But they couldn't be more grateful and thankful for the way the community has responded. So this is a testament to the strength of this community, the strength of Arkansas, and the strength of America. And I could not be more proud of everybody who has participated in the recovery process. All right? <p>Thank you very much.\" "
"103" "\"Thank you so much. Please, please, everybody have a seat. <p>Well, thank you, Steven, for your incredibly generous words, for this great honor, for your friendship, and most importantly, for the extraordinary work which brings us here all tonight. To Robert Katz and all the members of the board and staff of the Shoah Foundation; to President Max Nikias and everybody at USC; to all the distinguished guests; and to all the friends that I see in this audience: It is an incredible honor to be with you as we pay tribute to a remarkable institution and one that makes claim on our moral imagination. <p>Being here with you tonight, I'm taken back to the visit to Buchenwald that I took in the very first months of my Presidency. And I was there with my dear friend Elie Wiesel. As most of you know, he had endured that camp as a teenager. And we walked among the guard towers and the barbed wire. We saw the ovens and the crematorium. We saw the memorial to the prisoners, a steel plate heated to the temperature of the human body, as a reminder of our common humanity. And at the end of our visit, as we stood outside the place where his father and so many other souls had perished, Elie spoke these words. He said: \\"Memory has become a sacred duty of all people of good will.\\" Memory has become a sacred duty of all people of good will. <p>And that's what brings us here tonight. That's the duty that Steven and all of you embrace: the \\"sacred duty\\" of memory. <p>Now, just a few decades ago, many survivors of the Shoah were reluctant to share their stories. But one survivor living here in Los Angeles, a leather goods merchant named Poldek Pfefferberg, insisted on telling anybody who would listen about the man who had saved his life, a man named Oskar Schindler. And thanks to Poldek's persistence, Schindler's story was published as a novel, and the world eventually came to see and understand the Holocaust like never before in Steven's remarkable film, \\"Schindler's List,\\" brought to life in a masterful way by Liam Neeson. And we were reminded that the Holocaust was not a matter of distant history or abstract horror. The voices&mdash;the memories&mdash;of survivors became immediate and intimate&mdash;became a part of all of us. <p>I loved what the teacher said in the video about how it entered into our DNA. That's what stories do. We're storytelling animals. That's what Steven does. That's what Bruce does&mdash;tells a story that stitches up our fates with the fates of others. And that film gave us each a stake in that terrible history and a stake in ensuring such atrocities never happen again. <p>Now, if the story had ended there, it would have been enough&mdash;<i>dayenu.</i> But Steven didn't stop with \\"Schindler's List,\\" because there were too many other stories to tell. So he created this foundation to undertake what he called \\"a rescue mission,\\" preserving the memories that would otherwise be lost to time. <p>Over the past two decades, you've recorded tens of thousands of interviews in dozens of countries and languages, documented the experience not only of the Holocaust, but of atrocities before and since. As you heard tonight with Celina's incredible eloquence, you freed voices that could tell their own story in their own way. And as Michelle Clark described so powerfully this evening, you've turned that testimony into tools that can be used by scholars and students all around the world. <p>Now, Steven, I know that for you, like so many here, this is deeply personal. You lost distant relatives in the Holocaust and heard your mother pass on stories told by survivors. And as you said just a few days ago, the story of the Shoah is the story that you were put on this Earth to tell. So to you and everybody at the Shoah Foundation and for all that you've done, for setting alight an eternal flame of testimony that can't be extinguished and cannot be denied, we express our deepest gratitude. <p>Of course, none of these stories could be preserved without the men and women with the courage to tell them. And I think sometimes how hard it must be to return to those moments, to remember those darkest of days, to recount how loved ones&mdash;husbands, wives, sons, daughters&mdash;were taken away. And as Steven mentioned, my great-uncle was a soldier in the 89th Infantry Division, helping to liberate Ohrdruf, a part of Buchenwald. And what he saw during the war left him so shaken that, upon his return to the States, he could not speak of his memories for years to come. We didn't have a word for it back then, but he returned and closed himself off for months, so shaken was he just to witness what had happened, much less experience it. <p>So I want to say a special word to the survivors who are with us this evening, not just of the Holocaust, but as Steven noted, survivors of other unimaginable crimes. Every day that you have lived, every child and grandchild that your families have brought into this world has served as the ultimate rebuke to evil and the ultimate expression of love and hope. And you are an inspiration to every single one of us. And on behalf of all of us, thank you for the example of your lives and sharing your stories with us and the world. Thank you. We are grateful to you. <p>Now, let me add that, as Americans, we're proud to be a country that welcomed so many Holocaust survivors in the wake of World War II. As President, I'm proud that we're doing more, as Steven noted, to stand with Holocaust survivors in America. We announced Aviva Sufian as our first-ever Special Envoy to help support Holocaust survivors living in the United States. I'm pleased that Aviva is here tonight. We've proposed a new Survivor Assistance Fund to help Holocaust survivors in our country live in dignity and free from poverty. We're already working with Members of Congress and many of your organizations on this project, and tonight I'd invite more of you to join us. We need to keep faith with these survivors who already have given so much. <p>The work of this foundation, the testimonies of survivors like those with us tonight, also remind us that the purpose of memory is not simply to preserve the past, it is to protect the future. We tell stories, we're compelled to tell stories, but there are stories that bring out the best in us, and there are stories that bring out the worst. The voices of those recorded and unrecorded, those who survived and those who perished, call upon us&mdash;implore us and challenge us&mdash;to turn \\"never forget\\" into \\"never again.\\" <p>And we only need to look at today's headlines&mdash;the devastation of Syria, the murders and kidnappings in Nigeria, sectarian conflict, the tribal conflicts&mdash;to see that we have not yet extinguished man's darkest impulses. There are some bad stories out there that are being told to children, and they're learning to hate early. They're learning to fear those who are not like them early. <p>And none of the tragedies that we see today may rise to the full horror of the Holocaust. The individuals who are the victims of such unspeakable cruelty, they make a claim on our conscience. They demand our attention, that we not turn away, that we choose empathy over indifference, and that our empathy leads to action. And that's not always easy. One of the powerful things about Schindler's story was recognizing that we have to act even where there is sometimes ambiguity; even when the path is not always clearly lit, we have to try. <p>And that includes confronting a rising tide of anti-Semitism around the world. We've seen attacks on Jews in the streets of major Western cities, public places marred by swastikas. From some foreign governments we hear the worst kinds of anti-Semitic scapegoating. In Ukraine, as Steven mentioned, we saw those disgusting pamphlets from masked men calling on Jews to register. And tragically, we saw a shooting here at home, in Overland Park in Kansas. <p>And it would be tempting to dismiss these as isolated incidents, but if the memories of the Shoah survivors teach us anything, it is that silence is evil's greatest coconspirator. And it's up to us&mdash;each of us, every one of us&mdash;to forcefully condemn any denial of the Holocaust. It's up to us to combat not only anti-Semitism, but racism and bigotry and intolerance in all their forms, here and around the world. It's up to us to speak out against rhetoric that threatens the existence of a Jewish homeland and to sustain America's unshakeable commitment to Israel's security. And it is up to us to search our own hearts&mdash;to search ourselves&mdash;for those stories that have no place in this world. Because it's easy sometimes to project out and worry about others and their hatreds and their bigotries and their blind spots. It's not always as easy for us to examine ourselves. <p>Standing up to anti-Semitism is not simply about protecting one community or one religious group. There is no such thing as \\"targeted\\" hatred. In Overland Park, a man went to a Jewish community center and a nursing home named Village Shalom and started shooting, and none of the people he murdered were Jewish. Two were Methodist. One was Catholic. All were innocent. <p>We cannot eliminate evil from every heart or hatred from every mind. But what we can do, and what we must do, is make sure our children and their children learn their history so that they might not repeat it. We can teach our children the hazards of tribalism. We can teach our children to speak out against the casual slur. We can teach them there is no \\"them,\\" there's only \\"us.\\" And here in America, we can celebrate a nation in which Christians and Muslims go to Jewish community centers and where Jews go to Church vigils; a nation where, through fits and starts, through sacrifice and individual courage, we have struggled to hear the truth and live out the truth that Dr. King described: that \\"injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere, that we are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.\\" <p>By keeping the memories alive, by telling stories, by hearing those stories, we can do our part to fulfill the mitzvah, the commandment of saving a life. I think of Pinchas Gutter, a man who lived through the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and survived the Majdanek death camp. Today he serves as a volunteer educator at the Shoah Foundation. \\"I tell my story,\\" he says, \\"for the purpose of improving humanity, drop by drop by drop. Like a drop of water falls on a stone and erodes it, so, hopefully, by telling my story over and over again, I will achieve the purpose of making the world a better place to live in.\\" <p>Those are the words of one survivor&mdash;performing that \\"sacred duty\\" of memory&mdash;that will echo throughout eternity. Those are good words for all of us to live by. <p>I have this remarkable title right now&mdash;President of the United States&mdash;and yet every day when I wake up and I think about young girls in Nigeria or children caught up in the conflict in Syria, when there are times in which I want to reach out and save those kids, and having to think through what levers, what power do we have at any given moment, I think, \\"drop by drop by drop,\\" that we can erode and wear down these forces that are so destructive, that we can tell a different story. <p>And because of your work&mdash;because of your work, Steven, and the work of all who supported you&mdash;our children and their children and their children's children will hear from the survivors, but they'll also hear from the liberators, the Righteous Among the Nations. And because of your work, their stories, years and decades from now, will still be wearing down bigotry and eroding apathy and opening hearts, \\"drop by drop by drop.\\" <p>And as those hearts open, that empowers those of us in positions of power. Because even the President can't do these things alone. Drop by drop by drop. That's the power of stories. And as a consequence, the world will be a better place, and the souls will be bound up in the bonds of eternal life. Their memories will be a blessing and they will help us make real our solemn vow: \\"never forget\\" and \\"never again.\\" <p>So thank you, Steven, for your incredible work. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you.\" "
"104" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Mountain View! Well, it's good to be in California. Everybody, have a seat, have a seat. This is actually my third day on the West Coast. On Wednesday, we went to L.A., then we went to San Diego, we're here in the Bay Area. But I have to get back because Sunday is what? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Mother's Day! <p><i>The President.</i> It is Mother's Day. That is a public service announcement. Do not forget. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's Mother's Day. <p>I told Michelle one time, I said, how come people put so much emphasis on Mother's Day, and Father's day not so much? [<i>Laughter</i>] She said every day other than Mother's Day is Father's Day&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;which I thought kind of quieted me down. <p>I want to thank your mayor, Chris Clark, for hosting us. I want to thank the folks at Walmart. And I know this looks like a typical Walmart, but it is different, and that's why I'm here. A few years ago, you decided to put solar panels on the roof of the store. You replaced some traditional light bulbs with LEDs. You made refrigerator cases more efficient. And you even put in a charging station for electric vehicles. And all told, those upgrades created dozens of construction jobs and helped this store save money on its energy bills. And that's why I'm here today, because more and more companies like Walmart are realizing that wasting less energy isn't just good for the planet, it's good for business. It's good for the bottom line. <p>[<i>At this point, a baby cried out</i>.] <p><i>The President.</i> Yes, see, he agrees. [<i>Applause</i>] And it means jobs. <p>Changing the way we use energy is just one of the ways Americans have been working so hard to move this country forward. In the wake of the worst financial crisis and then economic crisis in generations, our businesses now have created over 9.2 million new jobs. Housing market that was reeling is rebounding. Our auto industry that was flatlining is now booming. You've got a manufacturing sector that had lost a third of its jobs during the nineties and now is adding jobs for the first time. More than 8 million Americans have now signed up for health care coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Troops that were fighting two wars are coming home. And rather than create jobs in other countries, more companies are actually choosing to create jobs and invest right here in the United States of America. <p>But we've got a long way to go before we get to where we need to be, which is an economy where everybody who works hard, everybody who takes responsibility, has a chance to get ahead; and that we have a chance to build an economy that works not just for a few at the top, but for everybody. That's our goal: the idea that no matter who you are, no matter what you look like, no matter where you come from, what your last name is, if you work hard, if you take responsibility, you can make it here in America. <p>And that starts with helping businesses create more good jobs. One of the biggest factors in bringing jobs back to America has been our commitment to American energy over the last 5 years. When I took office, we set out to break our dependence on foreign oil. Today, America is closer to energy independence than we have been in decades. We generate more renewable energy than ever, with tens of thousands of good American jobs to show for it. We produce more natural gas than anyone, and nearly everybody's energy bill is lower because of it. So are our carbon emissions that cause climate change. <p>We set new fuel standards for our cars and trucks so that they'll go twice as far on a gallon of gas by the middle of the next decade. That saves the typical family about $8,000 at the pump. And for the first time in nearly 20 years, America produces more oil here at home than we buy from other countries. <p>So we're producing more traditional energy, but we're also becoming a leader in the energy sources of the future. We're becoming a global leader in solar, thanks in part to the investments we've made in the Recovery Act. Over the past few years, the cost of solar panels have fallen by 60 percent; solar installations have increased by 500 percent. Every 4 minutes, another American home or business goes solar, and every panel is pounded into place by a worker whose job cannot be shipped overseas. <p>So today, no matter where you live or where you do business, solar is getting cheaper and is getting easier to use than before. And with more businesses and rural cooperatives and homes choosing solar, prices keep coming down, manufacturers keep getting more innovative, and more jobs are created. So last year, jobs in the solar industry increased by 20 percent. <p>But we've got more work to do. And I want to work with Congress to do it. Unfortunately, Congress has not always been as visionary on these issues as we would like. It can be a little frustrating. But in this year of action, wherever I can go ahead and create my own opportunities for new jobs, I'm going to take it. <p>And so far, I've taken more than 20 executive actions, from launching new hubs to attracting more high-tech manufacturing jobs to America, to reforming our job training programs to make sure more Americans are getting the skills they need to get the jobs that exist right now. <p>And so today, here at Walmart, I want to announce a few more steps that we're taking that are going to be good for job growth and good for our economy and that we don't have to wait for Congress to do. They are going to be steps that generate more clean energy, waste less energy overall, and leave our kids and our grandkids with a cleaner, safer planet in the process. <p>So let me list these out. Number one, we know that making buildings more energy efficient is one of the easiest, cheapest ways to create jobs, save money, and cut down on harmful pollution that causes climate change. It could save our businesses tens of billions of dollars a year on their energy bills, and they can then use that money to grow and hire more folks. It would put construction workers back to work installing new systems and technologies. So this is what you call a win-win-win. <p>So that's why, 3 years ago, I announced what we called the Better Buildings Initiative. It's an ambitious plan to improve the energy efficiency of America's commercial buildings by 20 percent by the year 2020. And already we've got 190 businesses and organizations that have signed on. On average, they're on track to meet their goal: cutting energy use by 2&frac12; percent every single year. Together, they've already saved $300 million in energy costs. So we know it works. <p>And that's why, over the past few months, I've been picking up the phone and reaching out to more leaders to get them on board. And today, they're stepping up. From cities, school districts, businesses, and universities, you're seeing folks move on energy efficiency. GM is pledging to improve energy efficiency in 31 plants. University of Virginia is doing the same thing in its buildings. Cities like Little Rock, Kansas City, and Detroit are replacing regular street lights with more efficient LEDs. <p>And at Walmart, you've committed to reducing energy consumption across 850 million square feet of space. That's a lot. That's enough to cover more than half of the city of San Francisco. Taken together, this is going to make a difference, and it's the right thing to do for the planet, but it's also the right thing to do for the bottom line. Because when you save that money, you can pass that money back to consumers in the form of lower prices, or you can use it to create more jobs. <p>So folks in the private sector are doing their part to create jobs and reduce pollution and cut waste. I'm making sure the Federal Government does its part. Two years ago, I ordered $2 billion in energy upgrades to Federal buildings. Today I'm ordering an additional $2 billion in upgrades over the next 3 years. And these upgrades will create tens of thousands of construction jobs and save taxpayers billions of dollars. <p>The Department of Energy is putting a new efficiency standard&mdash;set of efficiency standards in place that could save businesses billions of dollars in energy costs and cut carbon pollution, and it's the equivalent of taking about 80 million cars off the road. And I want to thank Ernie Moniz, Secretary of Energy, and Secretary Donovan&mdash;Shaun Donovan of HUD&mdash;who are here today because they've shown extraordinary leadership on these issues. [<i>Applause</i>] That's worth applauding. <p>So that's the first announcement. Cities, schools, businesses, Federal Government&mdash;we're all going to pledge to waste less energy, and we've got concrete strategies that we know work. <p>The second announcement is about more Americans coming together to use more clean energy. Last month, I called up leaders from a whole range of industries and made the economic case for why solar is a good idea. And they listened. And today, more than 300 organizations&mdash;from homebuilders to affordable housing owners to companies like Home Depot and Apple&mdash;announced that they are going to expand the use of solar energy, thereby creating more jobs and cutting carbon pollution. <p>We've got public banks like Connecticut's Green Bank and private banks like Goldman Sachs ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy. The Treasury Department and IRS are making it easier for renewable energy companies to operate and attract investment. And we're going to support training programs at community colleges across the country that will help 50,000 workers earn the skills that solar companies are looking for right now. <p>Walmart has already got the most installed onsite solar capacity of any company in America. And now you've announced plans to double that capacity. And it's all part of your goal to buy or produce 7 billion kilowatt hours of renewable energy by 2020, something that could save Walmart $1 billion a year in energy costs. <p>So we know that generating more clean energy, using less dirty energy, wasting less energy overall can be good for business and consumers. And it's also good for the world that we leave for our children. <p>So together, the commitments we're announcing today prove that there are cost-effective ways to tackle climate change and create jobs at the same time. So often, when we hear about how we're going to deal with this really serious issue, people say we can't afford to do it; won't be good for the economy. It will be good for the economy long term, and if we don't, that will be bad for the economy. Rising sea levels, drought, more wildfires, more severe storms&mdash;those are bad for the economy. So we can't afford to wait. And there's no reason why we can't even go further than we are so far by working with States and utilities and other organizations to change the way we power our economy. Climate change is real, and we have to act now. <p>Earlier this week, I issued&mdash;or we issued a report that was years in the making called the National Climate Assessment. Hundreds of scientists, experts, and businesses, non-for-profits, local communities all contributed over the course of 4 years. What they found was, unequivocally, that climate change is not some far-off problem in the future. It's happening now. It's causing hardship now. It's affecting every sector of our economy and our society&mdash;more severe floods, more violent wildfires. It's already costing cities and States and families and businesses money. <p>Here in California, you've seen these effects firsthand. You know what's happening. And increasingly, more and more Americans do, including, by the way, many Republicans outside of Washington. <p>So, unfortunately, inside of Washington we've still got some climate deniers who shout loud, but they're wasting everybody's time on a settled debate. Climate change is a fact. <p>And while we know the shift to clean energy won't happen overnight, we've got to make some tough choices along the way. And we know that if we do, it's going to save us ultimately money and create jobs over the long term. That's what Walmart understands, and Walmart is pretty good at counting its pennies. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So that's why this fight is so important. That's why the sooner we work together to adapt the economy to our&mdash;to this reality of climate change, the more likely it is that we do right by our kids and leave a more stable world. And ultimately, that's what motivates a whole lot of us. <p>As Americans, we don't look backwards, we look forward. We don't fear the future, we seize it. We shape it. And when it comes to energy, we have a chance to shape that sector that is probably going to have more to do with how well our economy succeeds than just about any other. We are blessed when it comes to energy, but we're much more blessed when it comes to the innovation and the dynamism and the creativity of our economy. <p>If we do our part right now to rebuild an economy and transition to a clean energy future, we will create new jobs, we will reduce our dependence on foreign oil, we will leave our children with a better America and a better future. <p>So thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. Thanks to all the companies who are doing the great work and the non-for-profits. We appreciate your leadership. <p>Thank you, guys. Happy Mother's Day, moms!\" "
"105" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you, everybody. It is a great honor to be here, one of my favorite events that we do every single year. And let me start by thanking Joe Biden not only for being a great Vice President&mdash;which he is&mdash;but also being a lifelong friend of law enforcement. Now, he and I have a special reason for loving law enforcement, because we have the unusual privilege of being surrounded by law enforcement every minute of every day. [<i>Laughter</i>] And they also protect the people we love most in the world, our families. So we're incredibly grateful to them and to all the law enforcement officers who serve and protect families and communities across the Nation every single day. <p>Some of the public servants who make sure America's police officers have what they need to do their jobs are also here today, and I just want to recognize them briefly. First of all, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson is here. Attorney General Eric Holder is here as well. Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton is here. And I want to thank everybody from the National Association of Police Organizations, including your outstanding president, Tom Nee. <p>But most of all, we're here to welcome and congratulate our guests of honors, America's TOP COPS of 2014, and to thank their families&mdash;their spouses, moms, dads, sons, daughters&mdash;who love and support these heroes every single step of the way. So give them a big round of applause. [<i>Applause</i>] Good job. We know it takes a lot of courage to be a cop, but it also takes a lot of courage to love a cop&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and to send them off to work every single day with a hug and a prayer for their safety. So all of you are heroes in my book as well. <p>The 53 officers, detectives, patrolmen, special agents, and troopers that we celebrate today are America's finest, the best of the best. They hail from different parts of the country, and different events brought them here today. But they share one important thing in common. When the moment came&mdash;when the shooting started or a bomb went off or a hostage was taken or a child screamed for help&mdash;they did not hesitate. They went into action. They ran toward the danger, not away from it. And they risked their lives to save the lives of others. <p>Now, I got a chance to spend a little time with these guys before they came out here. When you talk to them&mdash;and this has been true every time we've done this, every single year&mdash;they'll always say, \\"I was just doing my job,\\" insisting that they didn't do anything extraordinary. And they're right about one thing: There are heroes in every force, in every city, in every town across the Nation. And everyone standing up here owes something to police officers who aren't here, somebody who pushed them to do their best and had their backs when they needed it. So this is also a celebration for all law enforcement who are doing their jobs out there bravely and diligently, and we want to thank them for keeping us safe. <p>Having said that, even if these guys won't admit it, there is something special about these guys. This is the sixth year that I've welcomed TOP COPS to the White House, and every year, their stories are incredible. There are no exceptions. <p>[<i>At this point, there was a disruption in the audience.</i>] There's somebody on the loose here! [<i>Laughter</i>] Oh no! She was making a break for it. [<i>Laughter</i>] That was great. Did you see her? <p><i>Vice President Joe Biden.</i> Yes, I saw her. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> She was moving. <p><i>Vice President Biden.</i> She could move quickly. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Yes, yes. The&mdash;here are some of the reasons these officers are here today: surviving a violent ambush in the pitch-black woods while confronting an escaped felon convicted of sexual assault; engaging in hand-to-hand combat to take down someone seen trying to blow up a gas station near a major international airport; storming an underground bunker to rescue a kidnapped 5-year-old boy; braving a hail of gunfire to protect victims of domestic violence. <p>One of these officers, in protecting the public, took out a suspected cop-killing bank robber with what was described as a one-in-a-million shot. Another stopped a shooter by returning fire through the windshield of his patrol car, while making sure to wear his seat belt. [<i>Laughter</i>] One jumped a fence during his own Father's Day celebration when a boy screamed that someone was trying to kill his mom. He saved both the mother and her son, and now that little boy says he's thinking about becoming a cop as well. <p>And there are officers here who were in the thick of two attacks last year: the shooting at the Washington Naval Yard and the bombing at the Boston Marathon. On those awful days&mdash;and we all remember them&mdash;amid the smoke and the chaos, the courage of these officers shone through. And their quick thinking and levelheadedness undoubtedly saved lives. Their willingness to put themselves in danger to protect others answered the prayer of Americans watching all across the country. <p>So heroism like this can come with great sacrifice. Some of the officers here today sustained serious injuries in the line of duty. They were shot or stabbed. Some lost friends, even a partner. Some are still recovering. <p>There's one person who should be here today, but isn't: Officer Dennis Simmonds of the Boston P.D. Last year, Officer Simmonds was injured in an explosion during that gun battle after the Boston Marathon bombing. And just a few weeks ago, he died while on active duty. Dennis's partner, Officer Jean Gerard JeanLouis, is here. So are members of his family, including his parents Dennis and Roxanne. And our sorrow at your loss is matched only by our gratitude for your son's service and sacrifice. I told the family before I came out here, he will not be forgotten. <p>So what these officers do is dangerous. They do it because it's important. Maintaining the public safety is the foundation of everything that is good that happens every single day in America. It's why parents can send their kids to school and adults can head off to work and community centers and houses of worship can open their doors to one and all and businesses can start and thrive. And that's why people can cast their votes and express their views without fear. It's one of the reasons people travel and do business in these United States. <p>And that's why Americans everywhere owe a debt to our Nation's law enforcement. And we have to do our part by making sure all of you have the resources and protections and support that you need to do your job well. That's our end of the bargain. That's what I'm going to keep on fighting for every day that I have the honor of serving as your President. And that's what Joe Biden is going to work every day as long as he has the honor of serving as your Vice President. <p>So on behalf of all the American people, thank you. There are people alive today because of you. You may not even know their names, but we do, and we're proud of you. <p>God bless you. God bless your families, and God bless the United States of America. Please give them a big, big round of applause. Congratulations!\" "
"106" "\"Thank you, everybody. Have a seat, have a seat. Well, it's wonderful to see all of you. Some of you I've had the chance to get to know working on law enforcement issues and criminal justice issues. But I cannot thank you enough for participating today on an issue that I think is important to our economic future, to our cultural future, to our standing in the world, and to our safety and security, and that's the issue of immigration. <p>I'm here with some of the leaders of America's law enforcement agencies who recognize that fixing a broken immigration system isn't just the right thing to do, it's also the right thing to do for safety and security in communities all across America. <p>The immigration system that we have right now makes it harder, not easier, for law enforcement agencies to do their jobs. It makes it harder for law enforcement to know when dangerous people cross our borders. It makes it harder for business owners who play by the rules to compete when they're undercut by those who would exploit workers in a shadow economy. And it makes it harder for law enforcement to do their jobs when large segments of the community are afraid to report crimes or serve as witnesses because they fear the consequences for themselves or their families. <p>This system is not fair. It's not fair to workers; it's not fair to businesses who are trying to do the right thing; it's not fair to law enforcement agencies that are already stretched thin. <p>Now, the good news is, the Senate has already passed a bill with a wide, bipartisan majority that would go a long way towards fixing a broken system. It would strengthen our borders even further. And I'm sure Jeh has talked to you about the work that's been done over the last 5 five years. We have put unprecedented resources at the borders, and you've seen the results. We have fewer folks coming in than ever before. And the personnel that is arrayed along our borders is well beyond anything that we saw 5 years ago, 10 years ago, 20 years ago. So we take border enforcement seriously. <p>But what this reform package would also do is create a firm, but fair pathway to earned citizenship for those who live in the shadows, and as a consequence, would give law enforcement a better idea of who's in the country. It would also help build trust between local communities and law enforcement and immigrant communities. It would undermine criminal enterprises that prey on undocumented immigrants. And it would allow law enforcement to focus on its primary mission, which is keeping our communities safe. <p>And these are some of the reasons why a broad, bipartisan coalition&mdash;including law enforcement agencies like the ones who are represented today&mdash;is pushing Congress to go ahead and get the job done and get us over the finish line and do it this year. <p>I hope all of you keep it up because it's making a difference. A number of Republicans are realizing that blocking immigration reform is not an option, and that's the good news. And most Americans&mdash;the majority of Americans&mdash;know this is the right thing to do. Public opinion is on our side on this. Unfortunately, we've got a handful of House Republicans right now who are blocking going ahead and letting legislation get to the floor. To their credit, I think Speaker Boehner and some of the other leaders there do believe that immigration reform is the right thing, but they've got to have a political space that allows them to go ahead and get it through their caucus and get it done. I've said to them, if they've got a&mdash;ideas, I'm happy to talk to them. We're not hell bent on making sure that every letter of what's in the Senate bill is exactly what ultimately lands on my desk for signature, but there are some core principles that we've got to get done. We've got to have stronger border security. We've got to make sure that we are dealing with companies that are not doing the right thing by workers. We've got to make sure that we've got an improved legal immigration system, because a lot of folks are getting pushed into the illegal system because the waits are so long through the legal process. And we've got to make sure that there's a way for people to earn some pathway to citizenship. <p>And keep in mind&mdash;some of these statistics you may have already heard&mdash;it's estimated that over 80 percent of the folks who are here on an undocumented basis have been here 10 years or longer. These are folks who are woven into the fabrics of our communities. Their kids are going to school with our kids. Most of them are not making trouble; most of them are not causing crimes. And yet we put them in this untenuous position, and it creates a situation in which your personnel, who have got to go after gangbangers and need to be going after violent criminals and deal with the whole range of challenges and who have to cooperate with DHS around our counterterrorism activities, you've got to spend time dealing with somebody who is not causing any other trouble other than the fact that they were trying to make a living for their families. That's just not a good use of our resources. It's not smart. It doesn't make sense. <p>So I know I'm preaching to the choir here. You wouldn't be here if you didn't agree with us that this is time for us to go ahead and get moving. But I just want all of you to know, your voices, particularly over the next couple of months, are going to be critical. I think people have come to expect that I'm in favor of comprehensive immigration reform. I think that people anticipate that the Congressional Hispanic Caucus is going to be in favor of comprehensive immigration reform. I think people understand that there are a lot of agricultural enterprises that know how important their immigrant workers are to them. But it's more important in some ways to get over the hump when they hear from unexpected voices. <p>I think the evangelical Christian community has shown itself to be foursquare behind immigration reform, and that's a powerful voice. I think portions of the business community that people may not anticipate know that this is the key to our economic future. It would lower our deficits; it would grow our economy; it would bring in some of the most skilled people around the world. We want them to continue to come here. That's part of our competitive advantage relative to the rest of the world. Our population is not aging the way some other populations are because it's constantly replenished with folks who are go-getters. And hearing from law enforcement is important, and I think it lends this overall effort great credibility. <p>So I just want to say thank you to all of you. But we've got this narrow window. The closer we get to the midterm elections, the harder it is to get things done around here. Now, I know it's hard to believe that things could get harder to&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that this place could get a little more dysfunctional. But it's just very hard right before an election. So we've got maybe a window of 2, 3 months to get the ball rolling in the House of Representatives. And your voices are going to be absolutely critical to that effort. <p>So I just want to say thank you to all of you. And while I'm here, I want to thank you for the wide range of issues that we've had a chance to cooperate with you on. Whether it's dealing with counterterrorism issues and the preparations that ensure that if and when an event happens, that we're prepared and, more importantly, that we're able to prevent such activities from taking place in the first place, or dealing with natural disasters where our first responders are always right there on the scene, day in and day out your teams, your personnel are doing heroic work on behalf of America. And we're very, very grateful for that. <p>So thank you, everybody. Let's make this happen. All right?\" "
"107" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. Please, be seated. Welcome to the White House. It has been said that true courage is \\"a perfect sensibility of the measure of danger and a mental willingness to incur it.\\" For more than 12 years, with our Nation at war, the men and women of our Armed Forces have known the measure of danger that comes with military service. But year after year, tour after tour, they have displayed a selfless willingness to incur it: by stepping forward, by volunteering, by serving and sacrificing greatly to keep us all safe. <p>Today, our troops are coming home. By the end of this year, our war in Afghanistan will be over, and we'll welcome home this generation&mdash;the 9/11 generation&mdash;that has proven itself to be one of America's greatest. <p>And today we pay tribute to a soldier who embodies the courage of his generation: a young man who was a freshman in high school when the Twin Towers fell and who just 5 years later became an elite paratrooper with the legendary 173d Airborne, the Sky Soldiers. Today we present our Nation's highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor, to Sergeant Kyle J. White. <p>Now, Kyle is the second Sky Soldier to be recognized with the Medal of Honor for service above and beyond the call of duty in Afghanistan. Today he joins Staff Sergeant Salvatore Giunta and a proud brotherhood of previous honorees, members of the Medal of Honor Society, some of whom are with us here today. <p>We have a lot of VIPs here, but I'd like to acknowledge the most important: Kyle's parents Cheryl and Curt and Kyle's girlfriend Helen. I am told that back home in Bonney Lake, Washington, when Kyle wanted to enlist, at first he had set his sights on the Marines. But his dad Curt is a veteran of the Army, Special Forces. So I'm told there was a difference of opinion&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and, I suspect, a good family discussion. As Commander in Chief, I cannot take sides in this debate. [<i>Laughter</i>] Bottom line is, Kyle joined the Army. And in doing so he carried on his family's proud tradition of service, which found its expression on a November day over 6 years ago. <p>Across Afghanistan, base commanders were glued to their radios, listening as American forces fought back an ambush in the rugged mountains. One battalion commander remembered that \\"all of Afghanistan\\" was listening as a soldier on the ground described what was happening. They knew him by his call sign: Charlie-One-Six-Romeo. We know it was Kyle, who at the time was just 20 years old and only 21 months into his military service. <p>Earlier that afternoon, Kyle and the 13 members of his team, along with a squad of Afghan soldiers, left an Afghan village after a meeting with elders. The Americans made their way back up a steep hill, single file, along a narrow path, a cliff rising to their right and a slope of rocky shale dropping on their left. They knew not to stop, that they had to keep moving. They were headed into an area known as ambush alley. <p>And that's when a single shot rang out, then another. And then, an entire canyon erupted, with bullets coming from what seemed like every direction. It was as if, Kyle said, the whole valley \\"lit up.\\" The platoon returned fire. Kyle quickly emptied a full magazine, but as he went to load a second, an enemy grenade exploded and knocked him unconscious. He came to with his face pressed against a rock. And as he moved to get up, enemy rounds hit a rock just inches from his head, sending shrapnel and rock shards across his face. <p>Most of the unit had been forced to slide down the cliff to the valley below. But Kyle saw a teammate, Specialist Kain Schilling, trying to treat his own shattered arm, using a tree as cover, what Kain later called \\"the smallest tree on Earth.\\" I'm sure that's how it felt. Kyle sprinted through enemy fire to Kain's side and began applying a tourniquet, shielding Kain with his own body as gunfire shredded that tree. <p>Then Kyle saw another man down, Marine Sergeant Phillip Bocks, in the open, 30 feet behind them, but too injured to reach cover. Kyle remembers thinking: \\"It's just a matter of time before I'm dead. If that's going to happen, I might as well help someone while I can.\\" <p>With bullets impacting all around him, Kyle ran to Bocks and began to pull the injured marine to cover. But worried that he'd expose Bocks to more gunfire, Kyle retreated. The enemy rounds followed him. He ran out again, pulling Bocks a little farther. And once more, he retreated to distract the enemy fire. Once more, he went out, over and over thinking to himself, \\"I'm not going to make it.\\" Kyle could feel the pressure of the rounds going by him. But somehow, miraculously, they never hit him, not once. One of his teammates said it was as if Kyle was moving \\"faster than a speeding bullet.\\" <p>And finally, Kyle succeeded in pulling his comrade to cover. Tragically, there on that cliff, Sergeant Bocks succumbed to his wounds. But in his final moments, this American marine surely found some solace in Kyle White, the American soldier who, until the very end, was there by his side. <p>Now, that other injured soldier, Kain Shilling, was still out there. And he had sustained another injury, this time to his knee. Kyle ran out once more to Kain's side. Kyle ripped off his own belt for a tourniquet and soon got his hands on a working radio. The voice of Charlie-One-Six-Romeo came into base. Crouching behind that lone tree, Kyle began calling in airstrikes to take out enemy positions. <p>Kyle stayed with Specialist Schilling as night fell. And Kain was too badly injured to move. Kyle was starting to feel the fog of his own concussions set in, but he knew that he was Kain's best chance to get out alive, so Kyle took charge and ordered the Afghan soldiers to form a security perimeter. He called in a medevac and made sure Kain and the other injured were safely on board. And only then did Kyle finally allow himself to be lifted out. <p>As the helicopter pulled away, Kyle looked out the window, watching the darkness as they pulled away from that single tree on the cliff. \\"When you're deployed,\\" he later said, \\"those people become your family. What you really care about is: I want to get this guy to the left and to the right home.\\" <p>This family was tested that day. Not a single one of them escaped without injury, and six brave Americans gave their lives, their last full measure of devotion. And we remember them today: Sergeant Phillip A. Bocks, Captain Matthew C. Ferrara, Specialist Joseph M. Lancour, Sergeant Jeffery S. Mersman, Corporal Lester G. Roque, and Kyle's best friend, Corporal Sean K. A. Langevin. Some of their families are here today. I'd ask them to please stand so we can recognize their extraordinary sacrifice. <p>The legacy of these fallen heroes endures in the courage and strength of their unit: 14 men, forever brothers-in-arms. We're proud to welcome those who fought so valiantly that day: Specialist Kain Schilling, the soldier that Kyle saved, and members of the 2d Battalion, Chosen Company of the 173d Airborne Brigade. Would you please stand? <p>We honor Kyle White for his extraordinary actions on that November day. But his journey from that day to this speaks to the story of his generation. Kyle completed the rest of a 15-month deployment in Afghanistan. He came back home and trained other young paratroopers as they prepared to deploy. When he completed his service, Kyle decided to pursue a different dream, and with the help of the post-9/11 GI bill, he went to college, he graduated and today works for a bank in Charlotte, North Carolina. <p>When Kyle walks into the office every day, people see a man in a suit headed to work. And that's how it should be: a proud veteran welcomed into his community, contributing his talents and skills to the progress of our Nation. But Kyle will tell you that the transition to civilian life&mdash;and dealing with the posttraumatic stress&mdash;hasn't always been easy. More than 6 years later, he can still see the images and hear the sounds of that battle. Every day, he wakes up thinking about his battle buddies. <p>And if you look closely at that man in the suit on his way to work, you'll notice the piece of the war that he carries with him tucked under his shirt sleeve: a stainless steel bracelet around his wrist etched with the names of his six fallen comrades who will always be with him. \\"Their sacrifice motivates me,\\" he says, to \\"be the best [that; White House correction.] I can be. Everything I do in my life is done to make them proud.\\" <p>Kyle, members of Chosen Company, you did your duty, and now it's time for America to do ours: after more than a decade of war, to welcome you home with the support and the benefits and opportunities that you've earned. You make us proud, and you motivate all of us to be the best we can be as Americans, as a nation: to uphold our sacred obligations to your generation and all who have faced that \\"measure of danger\\" and \\"the willingness to incur it.\\" <p>May God bless you, and may your courage inspire and sustain us always. And may God continue to bless the United States of America. <p>With that, I'd like to have the citation read. <p>[<i>At this point, Maj. Matthew R. Newell, USAF, Air Force Aide to the President, read the citation. The President then presented the medal, assisted by Lt. Col. Michael P.

"108" "\"Hello, New York! It turned out to be a beautiful day. Well, it's wonderful to be here with all of you. Take a seat, take a seat. Relax. <p>First of all, I want to thank Governor Cuomo for that great introduction and the great job he's doing. I want to thank Mayor Fixell for having me in Tarrytown. Where's the Mayor? Where'd he go? There he is, right there. This is a gorgeous part of the world, and I am lucky to be here, and I'm going to be coming back soon; in 2 weeks, I've got the honor of delivering the commencement at West Point just a little bit further up. <p>But today I'm here, along with our Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx, to talk about one of the best ways to create new jobs and spur our economy, and that is to rebuild America's infrastructure. <p>It's been about 5&frac12; years since the financial crisis that rocked Wall Street and then ultimately spread to Main Street. Thanks to the grit, the determination of the American people, we've been steadily fighting our way back. In just 4 years, our businesses have now created 9.2 million new jobs. Auto industry that was flatlining is now booming. A manufacturing sector that had lost a third of its jobs back in the nineties is adding jobs for the first time. Troops that were fighting two wars, they're either home or coming home. Rather than creating jobs in other countries, more and more companies are recognizing, it makes good business sense to locate right here in the United States of America with outstanding American workers. <p>So we've made progress, but here's the thing: We could be doing a lot more. We could make the decision easier for businesses to locate here in the United States, here in New York State, if we do a better job rebuilding our roads, rebuilding our bridges, upgrading our ports, unclogging commute times. The alternative is to do nothing and watch businesses go to places that have outstanding infrastructure. <p>Now, behind me is the old Tappan Zee Bridge, the longest bridge in New York and one of the busiest bridges around. As any commuter will tell you, it is crowded. [<i>Laughter</i>] It carries a lot more traffic than when it was built back in 1955. At times, you can see the river through the cracks in the pavement. Now, I'm not an engineer, but I figure, that's not good. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But right now, thanks to the efforts of Governor Cuomo, thanks to your outstanding congressional delegation led by Nita Lowey and including Eliot Engel and Sean Patrick Maloney and Jerry Nadler, all of whom are here today&mdash;stand up, congressional delegation; we're proud of you&mdash;thanks to their outstanding efforts, workers are building a replacement, the first new bridge in New York in 50 years. It's called the New New York Bridge, which is fine as a name, but for your next bridge, you should come up with something a little more fresh. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, here's the thing&mdash;now, this never happens&mdash;you are building this bridge ahead of schedule. Three years ago, after Republicans in Congress refused to pass multiple bills that would have put construction workers back to work, I took action on my own to fast-track the permitting process for major projects like this one. Normally, it would have taken 3 to 5 years to permit this bridge; we did it in a year and a half&mdash;in a year and a half. That meant we were creating thousands of jobs faster while doing right by workers and tending to the environment. And the Vice President is in Cleveland today at another project that we fast-tracked: a rapid-transit station that will make life easier for a lot of residents there. <p>So today we're releasing a new plan to apply the same strategy to other major projects all across America. We're announcing 11 more projects to accelerate, to get moving faster, from Boston's South Station to Pensacola Bay Bridge to new light-rail projects north and south of Seattle. We're cutting bureaucratic redtape that stalls good projects from breaking ground. We're launching a new national permitting center to implement these reforms. We are aiming to put every major infrastructure project on a public dashboard so everybody can go online, track our progress, hold us accountable, make sure things are coming in on time, on budget; make sure your taxpayer money is being used well, but also make sure that we're putting folks back to work rebuilding America. That's our goal. <p>Now, all these steps we can do without Congress. And all these steps mean more good jobs, because nobody was hurt worse than construction workers by the financial crisis. The housing market plummeted, and a lot of guys in hard hats and a lot of gals in hard hats, suddenly, they were off the job. And that's why the Recovery Act back in 2009, 2010 included the most important public works jobs program since the New Deal, jump-starting more than 15,000 construction projects around the country. <p>Over the past 5 years, American workers have repaired or replaced more than 20,000 bridges, improved more than 350,000 miles of American roads. Four years ago, when we were just starting to clear away the damage from the financial crisis, the unemployment rate for construction workers stood at 20 percent&mdash;in fact, it was over 20 percent. Today, we've cut it by more than half. <p>But we can do better. We can build better, and we have to. We've got ports that aren't ready for the next generation of cargo ships. We've got more than a hundred thousand bridges that are old enough to qualify for Medicare. [<i>Laughter</i>] We've got leaky pipes that lose billions of gallons of drinking water every single day, even as we've got a severe drought in much of the West. Nearly half our people don't have access to transit at all. And I don't have to tell you what some of our airports look like. <p>Building a world-class transportation system is one of the reasons America became an economic superpower in the first place. But over the past 50 years, as a share of our economy, our investment in transportation has shrunk by 50 percent. Think about that. Our investment in transportation has been cut by half. <p>You know what other countries are doing? European countries now invest twice as much as we do. China invests four times as much as we do in transportation. One study recently found that over time, we've fallen to 19th place when it comes to the quality of our infrastructure&mdash;19th place. I don't know about you, but I don't like America being 19th. I don't like America being second. I want us to be first when it comes to infrastructure around the world because businesses are going to come where there's good infrastructure to move businesses, move people, move services. <p>We shouldn't watch the top-rated airports and seaports or the fastest rail lines or fastest Internet networks get built somewhere else, they need to be built right here in New York, right here in the United States. First-class infrastructure attracts first-class jobs. Business owners don't want a crumbling road or a bridge because then they can't move out their stuff and their workers aren't as productive because it's harder for them to get to work. They want to set up shop where there's high-speed rail and high-speed broadband, high-tech schools, self-healing power grids, new ports, tunnels. That allows them, when they make goods here in America, to move those goods out and sell them all around the world. <p>Now, unfortunately, helping States and cities fund infrastructure is one of Congress's chief responsibilities. And you've got some outstanding Members here, but let me just talk a little bit about Congress right now. If they don't act by the end of the summer, Federal funding for transportation projects will run out&mdash;will run out. There will be no money. The cupboard will be bare. And all told, nearly 700,000 jobs would be at risk over the next year. That's like the population of Tampa and St. Louis combined. <p>Right now there are more than a hundred thousand active projects paving roads and rebuilding bridges, modernizing our transit systems. States might have to choose which ones to put the brake on. Some States are already starting to slow down work because they're worried Congress won't untangle the gridlock on time. And that's something you should remember every time you see a story about a construction project stopped or machines idled or workers laid off their jobs. <p>And that's why, earlier this year, in addition to fast-tracking projects, working with Secretary Foxx, I put forward a plan to rebuild our transportation infrastructure in a more responsible way. It would support millions of jobs across America. It would give cities and States and private investors the certainty they need to plan ahead and invest. And it wouldn't add to our deficits because we'd pay for it in part by closing wasteful tax loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas that are in the Tax Code right now and that we could clean out and help pay to put folks back to work rebuilding America. <p>Now, so far, at least, Republicans who run this Congress seem to have a different priority. Not only have they prevented so far efforts to make sure funding is still in place for what we've already got, but their proposal would actually cut job-creating grant programs that have funded high-priority transportation projects in all 50 States. They'd cut them by about 80 percent. And they can't say it's to save money, because at the very same time, they voted for trillions of dollars in new tax cuts, weighted towards folks at the very top. <p>So you think about that for a second. Instead of putting more workers back on the job, they'd put those workers' jobs at risk. Instead of breaking ground on new projects that would improve the quality of life for millions of people, they voted to give a massive tax cut to households making more than a million dollars a year. Instead of making investments that grow our economy by growing the middle class, they're still convinced that prosperity trickles down from the very top. <p>If you want to tell them what you think about that, don't worry, because usually they show up at ribbon cuttings&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;for projects that they refused to fund. <p>And here is the sad part: Rebuilding America, that shouldn't be a partisan issue. My favorite President happens to have been a Republican, a guy named Abraham Lincoln, in my home State of Illinois. And it was Lincoln who committed to a railroad connecting East to West, even while he was struggling mightily to hold together the North and South. It was a Republican, Dwight Eisenhower, who built the Interstate Highway System. It was Ronald Reagan who said that rebuilding our infrastructure is \\"an investment in tomorrow that we must make today.\\" Since when are the Republicans in Congress against Ronald Reagan? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But that's part of the problem. We've gotten so partisan, everything is becoming political. They're more interested in saying no because they're worried that maybe they'd have to be at a bill signing with me than they are at actually doing a job that they know would be good for America. It's time for folks to stop running around saying what's wrong with America; roll up your sleeves and let's get to work and help America rebuild. That's what we should be doing. <p>We don't need a can't-do spirit, we need a can-do spirit. That's what Governor Cuomo has, and it sounds like the State legislature was willing to work with him on this. Well, we need Congress to work with us on these issues. It doesn't mean they're going to agree with us on everything. I guarantee you, they will have more than enough to disagree with me about, but let's not fight on something we all know makes sense. After all, we're the people who, in the depths of the Depression, lifted a great bridge in California and laid a great dam down in the Southwest and lifted up rural America. We shrank a sprawling continent when we pounded in that final railroad spike, connected up this amazing country of ours, stretched a network of highways all across America from coast to coast. And then we connected the world with our imaginations and the Internet. <p>A great nation does these things. A great nation doesn't say, \\"No, we can't,\\" it says, \\"Yes, we can.\\" <p>So the bottom line, Tarrytown, is America doesn't stand still. There is work to be done. There are workers ready to do it, and some of them are here, and they're already on the job doing the work. And we're proud of them. There are people all across this country that are ready and eager to move this country forward. <p>So I'm going to keep on fighting alongside all of you to make sure that we're doing everything we can to rebuild America, not just rebuild one bridge, but I want us to rebuild every bridge. I don't want us to just rebuild one school, I want us to rebuild every school that needs help. I want us to, most of all, most importantly, rebuild an economy where hard work is valued and responsibility is respected and rewarded and where opportunity is available not just to some, but to every single hard-working American. And that's what I'm fighting for, and I know that's what you care about. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. Good job, workers. Look forward to seeing this bridge. Thank you very much. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"109" "\"Mayor Bloomberg, Governor Cuomo, honored guests, families of the fallen: In those awful moments after the South Tower was hit, some of the injured huddled in the wreckage of the 78th floor. The fires were spreading. The air was filled with smoke. It was dark, and they could barely see. It seemed as if there was no way out. <p>And then there came a voice: clear, calm, saying he had found the stairs. A young man in his twenties, strong, emerged from the smoke, and over his nose and his mouth, he wore a red handkerchief. <p>He called for fire extinguishers to fight back the flames. He tended to the wounded. He led those survivors down the stairs to safety and carried a woman on his shoulders down 17 flights. And then, he went back, back up all those flights, then back down again, bringing more wounded to safety. Until that moment when the tower fell. <p>They didn't know his name. They didn't know where he came from. But they knew their lives had been saved by the man in the red bandana. <p>Again, Mayor Bloomberg; distinguished guests; Mayor de Blasio; Governors Christie and Cuomo; and the families and survivors of that day; to all those who responded with such courage: On behalf of Michelle and myself and the American people, it is an honor for us to join in your memories. To recall and to reflect. But above all, to reaffirm the true spirit of 9/11&mdash;love, compassion, sacrifice&mdash;and to enshrine it forever in the heart of our Nation. <p>Michelle and I just had the opportunity to join with others on a visit with some of the survivors and families, men and women who inspire us all. And we had a chance to visit some of the exhibits. And I think all who come here will find it to be a profound and moving experience. <p>I want to express our deep gratitude to everybody who was involved in this great undertaking: for bringing us to this day, for giving us this sacred place of healing and of hope. <p>Here, at this memorial, this museum, we come together. We stand in the footprints of two mighty towers, graced by the rush of eternal waters. We look into the faces of nearly 3,000 innocent souls, men and women and children of every race, every creed, from every corner of the world. And we can touch their names and hear their voices and glimpse the small items that speak to the beauty of their lives: a wedding ring, a dusty helmet, a shining badge. <p>Here we tell their story so that generations yet unborn will never forget: of coworkers who led others to safety; passengers who stormed a cockpit; our men and women in uniform who rushed into an inferno; our first responders who charged up those stairs; a generation of servicemembers&mdash;our 9/11 generation&mdash;who have served with honor in more than a decade of war. A nation that stands tall and united and unafraid, because no act of terror can match the strength or the character of our country. Like the great wall and bedrock that embrace us today, nothing can ever break us; nothing can change who we are as Americans. <p>On that September morning, Alison Crowther lost her son Welles. Months later, she was reading the newspaper, an article about those final minutes in the towers. Survivors recounted how a young man wearing a red handkerchief had led them to safety. And in that moment, Alison knew. Ever since he was a boy, her son had always carried a red handkerchief. Her son Welles was the man in the red bandana. <p>Welles was just 24 years old, with a broad smile and a bright future. He worked in the South Tower on the 104th floor. He had a big laugh, a joy of life, and dreams of seeing the world. He worked in finance, but he had also been a volunteer firefighter. And after the planes hit, he put on that bandana and spent his final moments saving others. <p>Three years ago this month, after our SEALs made sure that justice was done, I came to Ground Zero. And among the families here that day was Alison Crowther. And she told me about Welles and his fearless spirit, and she showed me a handkerchief like the one he wore that morning. <p>And today, as we saw on our tour, one of his red handkerchiefs is on display in this museum. And from this day forward, all those who come here will have a chance to know the sacrifice of a young man who, like so many, gave his life so others might live. <p>Those we lost live on in us: in the families who love them still, in the friends who remember them always, and in a nation that will honor them, now and forever. <p>And today it is my honor to introduce two women forever bound by that day, united in their determination to keep alive the true spirit of 9/11: Welles Crowther's mother Alison and one of those he saved, Ling Young.\" "
"110" "\"<i>The President.</i> Let me say something to these folks real quick so we can eat our burgers in peace. And excuse me, my voice is a little hoarse. I had a cold at the beginning of the week. In addition to coming to Shake Shack&mdash;which has great burgers and pays its employees over 10 bucks an hour, so we're very proud of them and the great work that they're doing&mdash;we've been talking a lot all across the country about the importance of raising the minimum wage. These four individuals just completed a project here in DC, an infrastructure project that put a lot of folks to work, is going to make the economy move better, traffic move better. And as you know, earlier this week, both Joe and I highlighted the fact that we're fast-tracking projects all across the country. <p>One of the things that we could do right now to put more Americans back to work is to fund our transportation more effectively and more consistently. And if Congress does not act, then by the end of this summer, we could have hundreds of thousands of projects like this all across the country stop, and people whose livelihoods depend on those projects sent home, and businesses that need improved infrastructure suffering under downgraded infrastructure. <p>So it is a no-brainer for Congress to do what it's supposed to do: Pass transportation funding. We can do it without adding to the deficit simply by getting rid of some corporate tax loopholes that aren't creating jobs and are basically giveaways to folks who don't need them. And when people who&mdash;when you ask Americans from all walks of life all across the country what's their number-one priority, it's improving the economy and putting people back to work. And one of the best ways we can do it is to do something about the roads, the bridges, the ports, the airports, the sewer lines all across the country that need repair. <p>We know we're going to have to do it. This is like deferred maintenance on your house. If you've got to do some tuck-pointing, to fix the roof, or fix the boiler, there's no point in putting it off. Now is the time to do it, and we've got outstanding contractors and workers ready to work. So I hope Congress gets working, and I'm prepared to work with anybody on a bipartisan basis to get it done. <p><i>Vice President Joe Biden.</i> Mr. President, for 40 years, it's been a bipartisan notion. <p><i>The President.</i> Right. <p><i>Vice President Biden. </i>For 40 years. This is the first time&mdash;I've been hanging around and it's like, oh, infrastructure. <p><i>The President.</i> This shouldn't be Democrat or Republican, this is American. We've got to rebuild America. And these are folks who are doing it. <p>So thank you very much, everybody. Enjoy your burgers if you guys are buying them.\" "
"111" "\"Hi, everybody. At a time when our businesses have created 9.2 million new jobs in just over 4 years and more companies are considering bringing jobs back from to foreign countries overseas, we have a choice to make: We can make it easier for businesses to invest in America, or we can make it harder. <p>I want to work with Congress to create jobs and opportunity for more Americans. But where Congress won't act, I will. And I want to talk about three things we're doing right now. <p>First, we're helping more businesses bring jobs to America from overseas. Three years ago, my administration created SelectUSA, a team of people in Embassies abroad and agencies here at home focused on insourcing instead of outsourcing. Today, they're helping a Belgian company create jobs in Oklahoma. They're helping a Canadian company create jobs in Kansas. In my State of the Union Address, I asked more businesses to do their part. And this week, business leaders from across the country are coming here to the White House to discuss new investments that will create even more jobs. <p>Second, on Thursday, I'll be heading to Cooperstown, New York, home of the Baseball Hall of Fame, to talk about tourism. Because believe it or not, tourism is an export. And if we make it easier for more foreign visitors to visit and spend money at America's attractions and unparalleled national parks, that helps local businesses and grows the economy for everyone. <p>Finally, we know that investing in first-class infrastructure attracts first-class jobs. And I want to spend a minute on this, because it's very important this year. <p>We know business owners don't seek out crumbling roads and bridges and backed-up supply chains. They set up shop where the newest, fastest, most convenient transportation and communications networks let them invent and sell goods made in America to the rest of the world as fast as possible. <p>Here's the problem: If Congress doesn't act by the end of this summer, Federal funding for transportation projects will run out. States might have to put some of their projects on hold. In fact, some already are, because they're worried Congress won't clear up its own gridlock. And if Congress fails to act, nearly 700,000 jobs would be at risk over the next year. <p>That's why I put forward a plan to rebuild our transportation infrastructure in a more responsible way. It would support millions of jobs across the country. And we'd pay for it without adding to the deficit by closing wasteful tax loopholes for companies that ship jobs overseas. <p>Now, the Republicans in Congress seem to have very different priorities. Not only have they neglected to prevent this funding from running out, their proposal would actually cut by 80 percent a job-creating grant program that has funded high-priority transportation projects in all 50 States. And they can't say it's to save money, because at the very same time, they voted for trillions of dollars in new tax cuts, weighted towards those at the very top. <p>Think about that. Instead of putting people to work on projects that would grow the economy for everyone, they voted to give a huge tax cut to households making more than a million dollars a year. So while Congress decides what it's going to do, I'll keep doing what I can on my own. On Wednesday, I was in New York where workers are building the area's first large, new bridge in 50 years. And they're doing it ahead of schedule. Three years ago, I took action without Congress to fast-track the permitting process for major projects. Normally, it would have taken 3 to 5 years to permit that bridge in New York. We did it in a year and a half. And I announced a new plan to cut redtape and speed up the process for even more projects across the country. <p>All these steps will make it easier for businesses to invest in America and create more good jobs. All of them can be done without Congress. But we could do a lot more if Congress was willing to help. In the meantime, I'll do whatever I can, not just to make America a better place to do business, but to make sure hard work pays off and opportunity is open to all. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"112" "\"<i>The President.</i> For the press, I just want to point out these are some outstanding companies, all of whom are investing in the United States, are representing major companies that see the U.S. as a great place to do business. We have made enormous strides over the last several years not just recovering from a great recession, but taking advantage of and now marketing the advantages of doing business in the United States, whether it's low energy costs, an incredibly productive workforce. <p>Obviously, we have the most dynamic and creative and innovative economy in the world, but we don't always do what it takes to go after business around the world and make sure that they know the benefits of investing in the largest market on Earth. And we want to be more systematic about it. We want to make sure that the Federal Government is working in sync with State and local governments when it comes to locating businesses here in the United States. <p>SelectUSA turned out to be an enormously successful process, where we're coordinating between agencies as well as other stakeholders.

It's a priority. <p>And you guys were all outstanding. So congratulations. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Thank you, honey. Thank you, honey. That's how&mdash;you guys, I want all the kids to know just how important you are that the President of the United States came by to tell you how proud he was. <p>I just want to thank everyone. To all our principals, to all our teachers, to our Turnaround Artists, to our funders: This wouldn't be possible without you. And remember what I said early on: Just think about the millions of kids who aren't being touched by the arts. Look at how much we're missing. We can't afford to miss out on any kid's talent, reaching their&mdash;I have seen these kids from little to&mdash;this little one has grown up so much. And I am so proud of them. But we have to make this a reality for every child in this country. We just have to. <p>You all, thank you so much. Kids, great job. Well done. You all take care. Have a great afternoon. Keep working hard.\" "
"114" "\"<i>The President</i>. All right, everybody have a seat. Welcome to the White House. Let's give it up for this quiet, reserved bunch called the Seattle Seahawks. World champions. Best football team in America. I considered letting Sherman up here to the podium today&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;giving him the mike, but we've got to go in a little bit so&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>Obviously, we've got some big Seahawks fans here today. That includes&mdash;I know there are some Members of Congress here who are huge Seahawks fans. We've also got the Secretary of Interior, Sally Jewell, who is a big Seahawks fan. We've got Seattle Mayor Ed Murray in the house, a big Seahawks fan. I want to congratulate Coach Pete Carroll for his outstanding leadership. I think those of us who are in leadership positions across disciplines, we're always looking at folks who do things the right way. I think it's pretty clear that Coach Carroll does things the right way, and we're very proud of him. Seahawks owner Paul Allen, who has done a great job, congratulations to him. We've got General Manager John Schneider, who put together this outstanding organization, but I'm curious where the championship belt is today, John. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We are here to celebrate the first Super Bowl victory for the city of Seattle. During the regular season, the Seahawks tied for the best record. Suffocating defense led to&mdash;led the league in points allowed, yards allowed, interceptions, takeaways, turnover margin. They beat the rival 49ers&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;I knew you guys would clap on that one&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;in the NFC Championship game and then dominated one of the best offenses in the NFL, beating the Broncos by 35 points. <p>Of course, I don't need to tell you how outstanding the Seahawks are because they did a pretty good job of describing themselves as outstanding during the year. You may have heard about the Legion of Boom&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;Richard Sherman and Earl Thomas and Kam Chancellor and Byron Maxwell, who combined to form the best secondary in football. You had a dominating defensive line with guys like Michael Bennett and Red Bryant, Brandon Mebane&mdash;and Brandon Mebane's belly roll dance&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;all combining to&mdash;we can't do that here in the White House. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>There's Super Bowl MVP Malcom Smith. You've got breakout star Percy Harvin. He's not here today, but we've got to give props to \\"Beast Mode\\" Marshawn Lynch. I am sorry that Marshawn is not here, because I just wanted to say how much I admire his approach to the press. [<i>Laughter</i>] I wanted to get some tips from him. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member. </i>It's about the action. <p><i>The President</i>. It's about the action. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And then there's Russell Wilson, who you may not recognize because his locks are shorn&mdash;he has cut his hair. [<i>Laughter</i>] Where is Russell? <p><i>Quarterback Russell C. Wilson</i>. Right here. <p><i>The President</i>. There he is. I was telling him he looks okay this way too. He doesn't have a peanut head or anything, but&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. So Russell has won more games through his first two seasons than any quarterback in history&mdash;in history. He also became only the second African American quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl. And the best part about it is, nobody commented on it, which tells you the progress that we've made, although we've got more progress to make. <p>And part of the reason that I think Russell inspired a lot of folks is, he's been proving the doubters wrong for a very long time. For years, folks said he'd be too short to succeed as a quarterback in the NFL. Five quarterbacks were drafted ahead of him, which is a familiar story for a lot of these Seahawks. You got three starters in the secondary who were taken fifth round or lower. Nineteen players on the roster weren't drafted at all. Last year, a pundit had the gall to call the receiving corps \\"pedestrian,\\" which I heard made \\"Angry\\" Doug Baldwin even angrier. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So let me just say as a guy who was elected President named Barack Obama, I root for the underdogs. And so seeing folks overcome the odds excites me. But it also excites me when you see the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. And that's what team is all about. And this is a team. <p>And it's not just about football. These guys have been overcoming adversity off the field as well. They've got fullback Derrick Coleman, who has been legally deaf since he was 3 years old. I joke about Richard Sherman, but he grew up in Compton amid some wonderful people, but also gangs and drugs and guns. His dad had to wake up before 4 a.m. every day to drive a garbage truck. But because of his dad's hard work and his family and his mom and&mdash;Richard ended up earning a 4.2 GPA in high school, won a scholarship to Stanford. He showed kids from his neighborhood that they could make it. And if he seems a little brash, it's because you've got to have attitude sometimes if you are going to overcome some of this adversity. And the fact that he still goes back to inspire high schoolers for higher goals and making better choices, that's all-star behavior. <p>And he's not the only one giving back. Russell spends every Tuesday&mdash;even during the season&mdash;visiting sick kids at the Seattle Children's Hospital. Coach Carroll's A Better Seattle and A Better LA organization works to keep at-risk youth away from drugs and violence. Paul Allen's Family Foundation has given millions of dollars for medical research into traumatic brain injuries, which obviously is a concern in the NFL, but also is a concern to our troops and people all across the country. As a team, the Seahawks raised more than $700,000 this year for causes like supporting our troops and strengthening our schools. <p>And that spirit of working hard and giving back has endeared this team to its fans in a way that most cities can't replicate. Now, part of it is you all have that stadium that is kind of cheating, because it's so loud. [<i>Laughter</i>] You hired some physicist to make it so. [<i>Laughter</i>] You know, it was&mdash;there are a lot of really smart people at Microsoft and up in those places that can design these things. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So we can't talk about the Seahawks without talking about the 12th Man. And&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. Last season, \\"the 12s\\" set a record not once, but twice, for the loudest crowd noise in history. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, history is a long time, so that's really loud. [<i>Laughter</i>] So loud on multiple occasion, they've actually created minor earthquakes, which is disturbing. And you should think about that. [<i>Laughter</i>] After the Super Bowl, when they had the chance to celebrate, they let loose in true Seattle style. And while some got a little carried away, there's actually video of a huge group of Seahawks fans interrupting their celebration to wait for the walk sign before crossing an intersection. [<i>Laughter</i>] So that's Seattle for you. [<i>Laughter</i>] So congratulations to the 12s, congratulations to the players, the coaches, the staff, the owners. Congratulations to the Seattle Seahawks and the whole city for an outstanding season. All right.\" "
"115" "\"Thank you. Well, good afternoon, everybody. As somebody who lives in the neighborhood, I thought I might just drop by and see what all the fuss is about. [<i>Laughter</i>] I want to thank Sally for hosting me here today. <p>And I am thrilled to be with all of you because of your work, not to mention some of the art on the walls reminds me that one of the great blessings of being an American is that we are blessed with some of the most beautiful landscapes and real estate on Earth. I think about the awe that I felt as a little boy the first time I saw the Grand Canyon. I think about the pride that I felt when I took my daughters to see Yellowstone. I think about the memories of what it's like to go on a hike without a security detail behind me. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's a wistful feeling. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But most of all, I think about our obligations to be good stewards to the next generation, to make sure that our children's children get the same chance to experience all of these natural wonders. So today I'm here to announce that I am using my executive authority to protect more of our pristine landscapes by designating the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks region a national monument. [<i>Applause</i>] Good news. Now, I am grateful for the incredible partnership of so many residents of this region, including ranchers and tribal leaders and hunters and many of you here today, especially Senators Martin Heinrich and Tom Udall and former Senator Jeff Bingaman, who were instrumental in helping preserve this treasured landscape. So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>Now, anyone who's ever seen the Organ Mountains that overlook Las Cruces, New Mexico, will tell you that they are a spectacular sight. Secretary Jewell told me as much after her visit there. You got massive rocks that jut up 9,000 feet in the air and stretch for 20 miles, like the organ pipes of a giant. And they're home to many of God's smaller creatures as well: deer and antelope roam; falcons, mountain lions. There are even plant species that don't grow anywhere else in the world. <p>But it's not just the natural beauty of this region that makes it invaluable to future generations. Its caves and peaks and cliffs bear the marks of millennia of history. From the rock art of some of the first native peoples living on the land to the trail traveled by some of the first overland mail carriers. Some of the most notorious adventures of the Wild West were written in the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks region. <p>More than 130 years ago, Billy the Kid took cover in the Robledo Mountains and literally left his mark, inscribing his name into what we now know as Outlaw Rock. You can see it today, and I want to make sure that future generations can see it as well. Legend has it that Apache Chief Geronimo hid in these same mountains and staged a miraculous escape from what is now called Geronimo's Cave. <p>Every year, tens of thousands of Americans visit the region to discover what still remains of these landmarks and to explore what lies along its beautiful trails. Families go on vacation. Tribes return to uphold rich traditions. Archeologists dig for ancient artifacts. Scientists study a thriving environment. And all of it supports the local economy and jobs in the region. So we're not just preserving history. Outdoor recreation at parks and forests and other public lands brings in tourism dollars, attracting new businesses and encouraging spending at lodgings and food establishments and, of course, park souvenirs. One recent study says that the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks designation alone could double the number of visitors to the area and help grow the local economy by more than 70 percent. <p>It's impossible to put a price on towering peaks and pristine forests and America's cultural history, but we know that our national parks have an economic impact that extends beyond their boundaries. In 2012, hundreds of millions of recreational visits to public lands and waters generated over $50 billion for local communities and supported nearly 900,000 jobs. So whether they're hiking or camping or fishing, visitors to our parks and public lands are not only enjoying the bounty of our natural resources, but also they're promoting jobs, and they're promoting growth. And continuing to set aside Federal land for outdoor recreation will drive critical revenue for those local communities and preserve our pristine lands for generations to come. <p>The Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument is the second national monument I've designated this year, the 11th overall. I've preserved more than 3 million acres of public lands for future generations. And I am not finished. So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>As I said in my State of the Union Address, I'm searching for more opportunities to preserve Federal lands where communities are speaking up. Because wherever I see an opening to get things done for the American people, I'm going to take it. I've said before: I want to work with anyone in Congress who is ready to get to work and shares those goals. But recently, they haven't gotten the job done. <p>Congress is sitting on dozens of bills that would help protect our precious land and wildlife. And by one count, there's a set of 10 land conservation bills that have been introduced a combined 52 times over the past 30 years, and they are still stuck. So I'm here to pick up a little bit of the slack. [<i>Laughter</i>] Because there is no time to waste to preserve our precious resources and give a shot in the arm to local economies like Las Cruces. <p>So I want to thank everybody again, not just here on stage, but all of those at the Department of the Interior who worked so hard on this project. And I want to thank all the public servants around the country for everything that you do to guide Americans through God-given wonders and keep our national landscapes pristine, not just today, for&mdash;but for many years to come. <p>Thanks, everybody. And now I'm going to sign this proclamation. All right? Good. <p>Gather up, everybody. [<i>Laughter</i>]. Got to get all the pens in. <p>[<i>At this point, the President signed the proclamation.</i>] <p>There we go. Done.\" "
"116" "\"<i>The President</i>. Thank you. There must be some White Sox fans here somewhere. [<i>Laughter</i>] It is great to be here in Cooperstown. And I have to say that in addition to just wonderful people, those of you all across America and around the world who have not been here, this is a gorgeous place. We came in by helicopter and had a chance to see the landscape, and it looks like a spectacular place to spend a few days, a week, however long you want to stay. I'll bet people will be happy to have you. <p>And I'm&mdash;although he is not here yet, I want to acknowledge the Governor of New York. He had a conflict, and he's on his way up. But he is really focused on jobs in Upstate New York: your Governor, Andrew Cuomo. I want to thank your mayor, Jeff Katz, for having me, and his great hospitality, and everybody who was involved in arranging the visit. We've also got, by the way, our Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, Ali Mayorkas, who is here. And he's important because he's helping bring travelers to America. <p>Now, it is a great honor to be the first sitting President ever to visit the Baseball Hall of Fame. The timing could not be better. First off, summer marks the 70th&mdash;75th anniversary of the Hall of Fame. I also promised Frank Thomas I'd check the place out before he's inducted in July. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And I'm so glad I did. Obviously, I didn't have a chance to roam around as long as I wanted, but thanks to the wonderful hospitality here, I saw the ball that William Howard Taft threw in the first-ever Presidential opening day pitch. I saw the White House&mdash;\\"White Sox locker\\" of memorabilia and got to bask in the glory of the 2005 World Series win. <p><i>Audience member</i>. Woo! <p><i>The President</i>. Yes! <p>At the Hall's request, I contributed something of my own, which was the jacket I wore when I threw out the first pitch at the 2009 All-Star Game. I hear that with all the media attention about it, there was also some interest in the jeans I wore that night. [<i>Laughter</i>] But Michelle retired those jeans quite a while back. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So I love baseball; America loves baseball. It continues to be our national pastime. And for any baseball fan out there, you've got to make a trip here. But as much as I'd love to talk baseball all day&mdash;and with a Chicago legend, Andre Dawson, the \\"Hawk,\\" here today, it's hard not to want to talk baseball all day long&mdash;I'm actually here to talk about jobs: good, middle class jobs. And believe it or not, places like this institution, the Hall of Fame, have something to do with jobs and economic growth. <p>It's been about 5&frac12; years since the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes hit. And thanks to the grit and determination of the American people, we've been steadily fighting our way back. Over the last 4 years, our businesses have created 9.2 million new jobs. We had an auto industry that was flatlining; it's come roaring back. A manufacturing sector that had lost about one-third of its jobs in the last decade is now adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s. And rather than create jobs in other countries, more and more companies are recognizing that it makes sense to invest right here in America. We've got great workers. We've got the largest market in the world. We've got a whole bunch of stuff going for us, and we're starting to see insourcing rather than outsourcing of jobs. <p>So we've made progress, but here's the thing: Too many Americans out there are still working harder than ever and can't seem to get ahead. And so we have to do more to spur growth and economic development and create more jobs that pay a good wage. <p>We should be making it easier, not harder, for businesses to invest and create jobs here in the United States. We should be making sure that people are rewarded for hard work and responsibility, rather than see their wages and salaries stagnate. And we should be making it easier, not harder, for striving young students to afford the higher education that's going to be the key to a lot of 21st-century jobs and make sure that they can repay all that loan debt that too often they're taking on when they go to college. <p>There's a new bill, by the way, being introduced in Congress in the coming weeks that's going to really do more to make sure that college students are getting a fair shot. Of course, unfortunately, we've got a Congress that all too often spends a few days a week blocking initiatives to create jobs and raise wages and help young people go to college. They seem to be more interested in politics right now than performance. And that's a challenge. <p>I'll work with anybody who's focused on what we need to be focused on and what all the people who sent us to Washington are focused on, and that is: How do we improve the economy and create more jobs? But if Congress isn't going to act, then I'm going to do whatever and any steps I can take to create jobs and opportunity for more working families. <p>So far, we've seen, for example, the House Republicans blocked legislation that would raise America's minimum wage. So I've been working with States and cities and businesses to go ahead and raise their minimum wage anyway. And I issued an Executive order making sure that if you are contracting with the Federal Government, you've got to pay your workers a higher minimum wage&mdash;at least $10.10 an hour&mdash;because I believe that if you work full time, you shouldn't be in poverty. <p>We saw Senate Republicans block an up-or-down vote on ensuring equal pay for women. I went ahead and took action on my own to make it easier for women to find out whether they're being treated fairly on the workplace&mdash;at the workplace and to be able to take action. <p>And when it comes to creating jobs, last week I was down in Tarrytown, where workers were able to break ground on the replacement of the Tappan Zee Bridge ahead of schedule because my administration fast-tracked that project and a lot of major projects across the country. On Tuesday, I met with CEOs from around the world who are investing and hiring in America because we've made our country more competitive. <p>And today I'm here in Cooperstown to talk about some new steps that will lead to more tourism not just within America, but getting more folks to come and visit the treasures, the national treasures that we have all across this country, including the Baseball Hall of Fame right here in Cooperstown. Because tourism translates into jobs, and it translates into economic growth. When visitors come here, they don't just check out the Hall. They rent cars. They stay in hotels. They eat at restaurants. And that means, for Upstate New York, the Baseball Hall of Fame is a powerful economic engine. <p>Last year alone, travel and tourism were responsible for $1.5 trillion in economic activity across the country. Think about that: $1.5 trillion supporting nearly 8 million jobs in communities like this one. And when tourists come from other countries and spend money here, that's actually considered a type of export. We don't always think about it that way, but we should. Nothing says \\"Made in America\\" better than the Empire State Building or the Hoover Dam. Folks who work at restaurants and hotels that serve fans in Cooperstown have the kinds of jobs that can't be offshored. And obviously, it's tough to ship the Rocky Mountains or the Grand Canyon overseas. You can't do it. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>When it comes to tourism, the good news is, we've got a great product to sell. People want to come here. I was reminded of that yesterday. I took a walk from the White House to the Department of Interior building. Keep in mind, I don't get a chance to take walks very often. [<i>Laughter</i>] Secret Service gets a little stressed. But every once in a while, I'm able to sneak off. The&mdash;I'm sort of like the circus bear that kind of breaks the chain, and I start taking off, and everybody starts whispering, the bear is loose! [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So I got out, take a walk. It was a beautiful day. And even though I went for several blocks&mdash;it was probably about a 10-minute walk&mdash;in that little span of time, I met tourists from Germany and Israel and Brazil and China and Ukraine on the National Mall. The fact that people come from all over the world to see our parks, to see our monuments, is something we should take great pride in as Americans. And it's good for our economy. <p>So just like we're helping our businesses to sell more goods made in America in markets all across the world, we're spending a lot of time and focus trying to make it easier for folks from around the world to come see America and spend money here. Four years ago, I signed a law that set up a nonprofit organization with one mission, and that is to pitch America as a travel destination. And 2 years ago, I went down to Disney World to announce new action to make it simpler for travelers to visit America, without compromising security at our borders. <p>And those efforts are paying off. Since its low point after the recession, our travel and tourism industry has added nearly 580,000 new jobs. Last year, a record 70 million tourists visited America from other countries, more than the populations of Texas, Florida, and New York combined. And they spent their money here. No country on Earth earns more money from international tourism than we do. And the growth of international tourism created about 175,000 new jobs over the last 5 years and helped drive America's exports to an alltime high. <p>So we're making great strides in welcoming more visitors to America in places like Cooperstown, but we can do even better. I want to turn the 70 million tourists that came last year into a hundred million each year by the beginning of the next decade. And meeting that goal is going to help create jobs here in New York. <p>And that's why, earlier today, I took new actions to meet that goal. I met with several CEOs of travel and tourism companies, and building on the progress that we've made, I've directed my administration to work with airports, airlines, hotel groups, States, and cities to do more to improve the traveler experience, and reduce wait times for folks entering into the United States, all without compromising our security. <p>And we have some folks here today who are already showing us what's possible. Scott Donohue is the CEO of the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport. Where's Scott? There he is, right here. We've got, from my own hometown, Rosie Andolino, the Aviation Commissioner from Chicago. They're&mdash;Rosie is right there. The two of them are responsible for two of the busiest airports in America. But the average wait times through customs and passport control at DFW and O'Hare has fallen to just 15 minutes. You get off your plane, it takes you 15 minutes to get through if you're an international traveler. And that is a big deal. If folks spend less time at the airport, they're more likely to come back for a return trip. And when they go back home, they tell their friends, you know what, America was there to greet us. <p>And I've made clear that national security remains our top priority; that's not going to change. But there's no reason we can't replicate the success stories of places like Dallas and Chicago all around the country. We can automate passport controls. We can bring in top talent from the private sector to find best practices to help move lines faster. We can add new staff at customs. We want to bring in more visitors faster, more jobs faster. If they come into JFK faster, they come into La Guardia faster, then they can get to Cooperstown faster. And they can start seeing Joe DiMaggio's glove faster. And they can see Babe Ruth's bat faster. <p>So creating good jobs isn't always easy. But standing here and looking back on more than 150 years of our country's history&mdash;and baseball describes our history in so many ways&mdash;we're reminded of all the obstacles that we've overcome to get there. This Hall has memories of two world wars that we fought and won. It has memories of color barriers being broken: Jackie Robinson's uniform, the record of his first season as a Dodger. It shows us the history of communities that we built across a new continent and the ways that we connected with our country and our world and how women athletes started getting the recognition that they deserved. <p>So we've faced challenges before, but we don't respond with cynicism, and we can't respond with gridlock. Every generation faces tough times. But in the words of the great Yogi Berra, they're just \\"d&eacute;j&agrave; vu all over again.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We know we are up to these challenges. And just as our parents and our grandparents faced challenges a lot tougher than the ones we face, and just as they went ahead and built an economy where hard work was rewarded and responsibility was rewarded and opportunity was open to all people, we can do the same. They passed those values on down through the generations. They passed them down to us. And when you come to the Baseball Hall of Fame, part of what you're learning is that there is some eternal, timeless values of grit and determination and hard work and community and not giving up and working hard. Those are American values, just like baseball. <p>And there's no reason we can't do the same. That's what I'm going to be working on as long as I'm President of the United States. I'm going to be fighting to make sure that those values live out in better jobs, higher wages, stronger economy, stronger communities. And I hope you'll join me. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"117" "\"Hi, everybody. It's Memorial Day weekend, a chance for Americans to get together with family and friends, break out the grill, and kick off the unofficial start of summer. More importantly, it's a time to remember the heroes whose sacrifices made these moments possible: our men and women in uniform who gave their lives to keep our Nation safe and free. <p>From those shots fired at Lexington and Concord more than two centuries ago to our newest generation of veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, our history shines with patriots who answered the call to serve. They put their lives on the line to defend the country they love. And in the end, many gave that \\"last full measure of devotion\\" so that our Nation would endure. <p>Every single one of us owes our fallen heroes a profound debt of gratitude. Because every time we cast our votes or speak our minds without fear, it's because they fought for our right to do that. Every chance we get to make a better life for ourselves and our families is possible because generations of patriots fought to keep America a land of opportunity, where anyone&mdash;of any race, of any religion, from any background&mdash;can make it if they try. Our country was born out of a desire to be free, and every day since, it's been protected by our men and women in uniform, people who believed so deeply in America, they were willing to give their lives for it. <p>We owe them so much. So this Memorial Day, we'll gather together, as Americans, to honor the fallen, with both public ceremonies and private remembrances. And I hope all Americans will take a moment this weekend to think of those who have died in service to our Nation. Say a prayer in their memories and for their families. Lay a flower where they've come to rest. Reach out to servicemembers, military families or veterans in your community, or families who have lost a loved one, and let them know that their service and sacrifice will never be forgotten. <p>Most of all, let's keep working to make sure that our country upholds our sacred trust to all who have served. In recent weeks, we've seen again how much more our Nation has to do to make sure all our veterans get the care that they deserve. And as Commander in Chief, I believe that taking care of our veterans and their families is a sacred obligation. It's been one of the causes of my Presidency. And now that we've ended the war in Iraq, and as our war in Afghanistan ends as well, we have to work even harder as a nation to make sure all our veterans get the benefits and opportunities that they have earned. They've done their duty, and they ask nothing more than that this country does ours, now and for decades to come. <p>Happy Memorial Day, everybody. May God watch over our fallen heroes, and may He continue to bless the United States of America.\" "
"118" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Bagram! <p><i>Audiene members</i>. Hooah! <p><i>The President</i>. Hooah! Well, I know it's a little late, but I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd stop by. First of all, I want everybody to give a huge round of applause to your commander, General Joe Dunford. Please give him an outstanding, rousing acknowledgement. I am grateful to him for his leadership of our coalition here in Afghanistan and for his lifetime of distinguished service to the Marine Corps and to America. <p>And can everybody please give it up to Brad Paisley? Now, I want to say this about Brad. First of all, he's a great supporter of our troops, a great supporter of your families. Two years ago, we had him at the White House to perform for troops and military families during the Fourth of July celebration. Him coming here today was not easy. He had just started a tour, and he had to juggle a lot of stuff and had to try to figure out how to explain it to people without explaining it to people, and his wife and two young sons and promoters and agents&mdash;and without going into the details&mdash;this was a big sacrifice for him. And he did it because he cares so deeply about you. So I'm so grateful to him. <p>I want to make clear, though, I will not be singing so&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience members.</i> Aww. <p><i>The President.</i> Oh, you really want me to sing, huh? [<i>Applause</i>] No, no, no. But I do want to just say to Brad, thank you so much for doing this. <p>I want to acknowledge our outstanding Ambassador, Jim Cunningham, who's here with his lovely wife. And Jim leads an incredible team of civilians at our Embassy and across this country. They are also making sacrifices, also away from their families, oftentimes themselves at risk as they serve. I know those of you in uniform couldn't do your jobs without these Americans as your partners. So we salute the dedicated service of all the civilians who are here, led by Jim Cunningham. Give them a big round of applause. <p>Now, I guess I also should mention that we've got a few folks here as part of the 10th Mountain Division&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;\\"Climb to Glory.\\" We got the 455th Airwing in the house. [<i>Applause</i>] The Task Force Muleskinners. [<i>Applause</i>] Task Force Thunder. [<i>Applause</i>] Task Force Rugged. <p><i>Audience member</i>. Yeah! <p><i>The President. </i>[<i>Laughter</i>] To all of you: I'm here on a single mission, and that is to thank you for your extraordinary service. I thank you as our&mdash;as your Commander in Chief, because you inspire me. Your willingness to serve, to step forward at a time of war and say, \\"Send me,\\" is the reason the United States stays strong and free. Of all the honors that I have as serving as President, nothing matches serving as your Commander in Chief. <p>But I'm also here representing 300 million Americans who want to say thank you as well. I know sometimes, when you're over here, away from home, away from family, you may not truly absorb how much the folks back home are thinking about you. So I just want you to know when it comes to supporting you and your families, the American people stand united. We support you. We are proud of you. We stand in awe of your service. <p>And you can see it in American actions every single day. You see it in the kids across America who send you all those care packages and all those Girl Scout cookies. [<i>Applause</i>] Those are pretty popular, huh? You like those cookies, huh? All right. I'll bet you'll get some more now. <p>You see it in the neighbors and the coworkers who volunteer to help your moms and dads and wives and husbands and sons and daughters at school and on their sports teams. You see it at the airports when you return stateside, all the folks standing up, applauding, lining up to shake your hand and welcoming you home. <p>You see it when entire stadiums get to their feet to salute our troops and our veterans. Just the other day, I welcomed the Super Bowl Champion Seattle Seahawks, and&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience members. </i>Woo! <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> Listen, I'm a Bears fan, but I&mdash;but the one thing that I saw and I've seen in every sports team that comes to the White House is the work that they do, visiting Walter Reed, Bethesda, doing work with military families. In fact, to help announce their draft picks this month, the Seattle Seahawks selected Jeff Baker, who's a Seahawks fan, but also a veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan and a proud sergeant in the U.S. Army, to make that draft pick. Because they wanted to send a signal that we love our sports and we love our football&mdash;that's fun and games&mdash;but this is the competition that counts, and these are the real heroes. <p>You see America's gratitude every time I present a veteran of Afghanistan with our Nation's highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor. We bestow that medal on an individual. But every time&mdash;every time&mdash;that we bestow that medal, whoever is the recipient says he accepts it on behalf of the whole team and everybody who wears the uniform of the American Armed Forces. And when those citations are read, Americans all across the country stop, and they listen, and they're stirred by the sacrifices you render for each other and for all of us. <p>So I'm here to say thank you, and I'm here to say how proud I am of you. And I'm here to say how proud I am of your families, because in some ways&mdash;in ways large and small&mdash;they're sacrificing just like you are. <p>But I'm also here because after more than a decade of war, we're at a pivotal moment. Last year marked a major milestone: For the first time, Afghan forces took the lead to secure their own country. And today, you're in a support role, helping to train and assist Afghan forces. For many of you, this will be your last tour in Afghanistan. And by the end of this year, the transition will be complete, and Afghans will take full responsibility for their security, and our combat mission will be over. America's war in Afghanistan will come to a responsible end. <p>Now, that progress is because of you and the more than half a million Americans&mdash;military and civilian&mdash;who have served here in Afghanistan. And I don't want you to ever forget why you are here or how vital your mission is to our national security. <p>Some of you may know, recently, I was in New York City, and we were there to dedicate the new 9/11 Museum. I had time to spend with the survivors and with the families who lost loved ones and with the first responders who had rushed to the scene and had a chance to ponder the portraits and the biographies of the thousands who were killed that day and to think about those who were killed in Pennsylvania and at the Pentagon. And once again, we resolved to never forget what happened on that September day and to do everything in our power to prevent something like that from ever happening again. That's why you're here. That's why you're here. <p>And I notice&mdash;some of you don't remember&mdash;because as I was getting a briefing while Brad was singing, I saw a picture of the Twin Towers in the operation room nearby, so I know you don't forget. <p>And 4 years ago, on my first visit to Bagram as President, I laid out our mission. And General Dunford and Ambassador Cunningham just gave me a briefing on your progress. And today, every single one of you, everybody who has served here, and all the members of our coalition can be proud because you are completing our mission. You're completing the mission. <p>We said that we were going to deny Al Qaida safe haven. And since then, we have decimated the Al Qaida's leadership in the tribal regions, and our troops here at Bagram have played a central role in supporting our counterterrorism operations, including the one that delivered justice to Usama bin Laden. So, along with our intelligence personnel, you've helped prevent attacks and save American lives back home. Al Qaida is on its heels in this part of the world, and that's because of you. <p>We said that we were going to reverse the Taliban's momentum. And so you went on the offensive, driving the Taliban out of its strongholds. Look, everybody knows Afghanistan still is a very dangerous place. Insurgents still launch cowardly attacks against innocent civilians. But just look at the progress that you've made possible: Afghans reclaiming their communities, and more girls returning to school, dramatic improvements in public health and life expectancy and literacy. That's your legacy. That's what you did. Even with all the challenges, more Afghans have hope for their future. And so much of that is because of you. <p>We said that we were going to strengthen the capacity of Afghan forces so they could take more responsibility for their own security. So you've been training Afghan forces and building Afghan forces up. And we know they've still got a long way to go. But for nearly a year, Afghans have been in the lead, and they're making enormous sacrifices. You look at the casualties they're taking on. They are willing to fight. Afghan forces are growing stronger. Afghans are proud to be defending their own country, and that again, so much of that is because of you. <p>Think about last month's election. Despite all the threats from the Taliban, the Afghan people refused to be terrorized. They registered to vote. Afghan security forces secured thousands of polling places. Then millions of Afghans lined up to cast their ballot. And next month's runoff will be another step toward the first democratic transfer of power in the history of this nation. That's a tribute to the courage and determination of the people of Afghanistan. But it is also a tribute to you and the sacrifices of so many Americans and our coalition partners, everything that you've done over the years. <p>Now we know that this progress has come at a heavy price. Tomorrow is Memorial Day. And at bases here in Afghanistan and the towns across America, we will pause and we'll pay tribute to all those who've laid down their lives for our freedom. And that includes nearly 2,200 American patriots who made the ultimate sacrifice, that \\"last full measure of devotion,\\" right here in Afghanistan. I know you've stood in front of those battle crosses. I know many of you carry the memories of your fallen comrades in your heart today. We will honor every single one of them, not just tomorrow, but forever. And I want you to know, our gratitude is shared by the Afghan people. One of them&mdash;one of Afghanistan's leading women, a Member of Parliament&mdash;recently wrote an open letter. I don't know if many of you had a chance to see it. She described all the changes that have taken place here, including the millions of girls going to school and pursuing their dreams. And she wrote this&mdash;I want you to listen to this&mdash;she wrote: \\"It's been a difficult journey, marked by blood and violence, but we have made significant gains and achievements, which would not have been possible without the generous support of the international community, especially the American people.\\" Especially the American people. She's talking about all of you. She's talking about your families. She's talking about those who we've lost. That's the difference&mdash;and the legacy&mdash;that you can be proud of. <p>Now, even as our combat mission ends later this year, I want everybody to know, in this country and across the region, America's commitment to the people of Afghanistan will endure. With our strategic partnership, we'll continue to stand with Afghans as they strengthen their institutions, as they build their economy, as they improve their lives: men and women and boys and girls. <p>And I've made it clear that we're prepared to continue cooperating with our Afghan partners on two security missions: training and equipping Afghan forces and targeting&mdash;counterterrorism targets against Al Qaida. And once Afghanistan has sworn in its new President, I'm hopeful we'll sign a bilateral security agreement that lets us move forward. And with that bilateral security agreement, assuming it is signed, we can plan for a limited military presence in Afghanistan beyond 2014. Because after all the sacrifices we've made, we want to preserve the gains that you have helped to win. And we're going to make sure that Afghanistan can never again&mdash;ever&mdash;be used again to launch an attack against our country. <p>So our combat mission here will come to an end. But our obligations to you and your families have only just begun. The Al Qaida leadership may be on the ropes, but in other parts of the world, Al Qaida affiliates are evolving and pose a serious threat. We're going to have to stay strong, and we're going to have to stay vigilant. And fortunately, we've got the best led, best trained, best equipped military in human history. And as Commander in Chief, I'm going to keep it that way. <p>We're going to stay strong by taking care of your families back home. The First Lady, Michelle, and Vice President Joe Biden's wife Jill have made this their mission, because your families serve too. They're heroes on the home front. And so we're going to keep Joining Forces to make sure more Americans are stepping up to support and honor those extraordinary families. <p>We're going to stay strong by taking care of our wounded warriors and our veterans. Because helping our wounded warriors and veterans heal isn't just a promise, it's a sacred obligation. And as you come home, some of you will return to civilian life, and we want to make sure you can enjoy the American Dream that you helped to defend. So with the transition assistance to help you begin the next chapter of your life, that's going to keep America strong. The credentials and licenses to help you find a job worthy of your incredible skills, that will keep America strong. Making sure the post-9/11 GI bill is in place and delivering for you the kind of education that you have earned, that will keep America strong. <p>And I keep on saying to every company back home, \\"If you want somebody who knows how to get the job done, hire a vet.\\" <p><i>Audience members. </i>Hooah! <i>The President. </i>Hire a vet. [<i>Applause</i>] Hire a vet. Because like generations before you, we need you to help us write the next great chapter in the American story, and I know you'll do that because I've seen the character of your service, and I know the strength of our country. <p>Going back to New York and thinking about that tragedy 12 years ago, in those awful moments after the Twin Towers fell, as the wreckage was still burning, those at the scene were desperately looking for survivors, one of those searching was a detective at the NYPD. And as he climbed through the debris, he spotted something in the rubble. It was a flag. It was torn up. Parts of it were burned, but it was still intact. <p>And today, that flag is at the 9/11 Museum. It's dusty and it's torn and you can see the burn marks from the fires. That flag has been through a lot. But the thing you notice is, its broad stripes and bright stars still shine. Its red, white, and blue still inspire. After all it's been through, after all America has been through, our flag is still there. <p>And our flag is still there because when our Nation was attacked, a generation&mdash;this generation, the 9/11 generation&mdash;stepped up and said, \\"Send me.\\" Our flag is still there because you've served with honor in dusty villages and city streets and in rugged bases and remote outposts, in Helmand and Kandahar and Khost and Kunar and Paktika and Nuristan. Our flag is still there because through this long war, you never wavered in your belief that people deserve to live free from fear, over here and back home. Our flag will always be there, because the freedom and liberty it represents to the world will always be defended by patriots like you. <p>So I'm here to say thank you. I'm here to say I'm proud of you. The American people are proud of you. God bless you. God bless the United States Armed Forces. And God Bless our United States of America. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"119" "\"Thank you so much. Please be seated. Thank you, Secretary Hagel, for your introduction and for your lifetime of service, from a young Army sergeant in Vietnam to our Nation's 24th Secretary of Defense. <p>Vice President Biden, Jill, Chairman Dempsey, Major General Buchanan, Patrick Hallinan, Chaplain Brainerd; to our men and women in uniform here and around the world; to our outstanding veterans; and most of all, to the Gold Star families here to remember the loved ones you've lost: Michelle and I are humbled and honored to commemorate this Memorial Day with you. <p>Every year, this ceremony marks another page in the life of our Nation, this year in particular, as we recognize the 150th anniversary of this holy space, Arlington National Cemetery. One hundred and fifty years ago, war raged on hillsides and farmlands not far from where we gather today. A nation ill-prepared for war found itself overwhelmed with the task of burying so many of its sons. So we declared upon this hill a final resting place for those willing to lay down their lives for the country that we love. And on a spring day in 1864, Private William Christman of Pennsylvania was the first American to find eternal rest on these grounds. <p>Over that century and a half, in times of war, in times of peace, Americans have come here, to pay tribute not only to the loved ones who meant the world to them, but to all our heroes, known and unknown. Here, in perfect military order, lie the patriots who won our freedom and saved the Union. Here, side by side, lie the privates and the generals who defeated fascism and laid the foundation for an American century. Here lie the Americans who fought through Vietnam and those who won a long twilight struggle against communism. And here, in Section 60, lie men and women who gave their lives to keep our homeland safe over more than a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. <p>Early this morning I returned from Afghanistan, and yesterday I visited with some of our men and women serving there, 7,000 miles from home. For more than 12 years, men and women like those I met with have borne the burden of our Nation's security. Now, because of their profound sacrifice, because of the progress they have made, we're at a pivotal moment. Our troops are coming home. By the end of this year, our war in Afghanistan will finally come to an end. And yesterday at Bagram, and here today at Arlington, we pay tribute to the nearly 2,200 American patriots who've made the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan. We will honor them always. <p>Today, in small towns across America, in cemeteries throughout our country and around the world, and here on these solemn hillsides, the families of our fallen share stories of the lives they led. Our hearts ache in their absence. But our hearts are also full, full in knowing that their legacy shines bright in the people that they loved the most. Through almost unimaginable loss, these families of the fallen have tapped a courage and resolve that many of us will never know. And we draw comfort and strength from their example. We draw strength from the promise of their children. Today Michelle and Jill are with 200 brave boys and girls whose parents gave everything they had in service to their country. <p>They were mothers and fathers like Staff Sergeant Michael Cardenaz, who gave his life in Afghanistan 4 years ago. The years since have been hard for Michael's family. And yet, with the love of their mother, Macarena, his three youngest daughters have displayed a strength beyond their years. <p>Mariella, the oldest of the three, has become a mentor to other children who've lost their parents. Mariliz, the middle girl, was used to her dad carrying her everywhere when she was little; now 7, she shepherds her little sister, Marianna. And Marianna, who was just a baby when her dad was deployed, is starting to understand what it means that her daddy served his country. Mariella, Mariliz, and Marianna are here today. And we say to you and to all these courageous children: Your parents' bravery lives on in you. You will never walk alone. Your country will be there to help you grow up into the young men and women your parents always knew you would be. And that's our pledge to you. <p>We draw strength as well from the love of the spouses of the fallen. Sergeant First Class Joseph Gantt was a young man, but already a veteran of World War II, when he met Clara Edwards on a train headed to California. He spent 2 years courting Clara before she finally agreed to marry him. Then, when Joseph deployed to Korea, he told his young wife to remarry if he didn't come back. She told him no. He had a hard enough time getting her to say yes in the first place, she said. [<i>Laughter</i>] He had waited 2 years for her; she'd wait as long as it took for him to come home. <p>When Joseph went missing in action, Clara waited. She waited 63 years. Meanwhile, our country continued to work to bring home the missing from all our wars. And then, last December&mdash;last December&mdash;his remains finally identified, Joseph returned home to be laid to rest. Clara never remarried during those 63 years. And now 96 years old, she was there to welcome him home. And we are honored to have Clara Gantt here with us today. Clara. [<i>Applause</i>] <p>We also draw strength from the parents who have given their sons and daughters to America. <p>Earlier this year, in my State of the Union Address, I spoke of the remarkable story and grueling recovery of Sergeant First Class Cory Remsburg, who was severely injured by a massive roadside bomb in Afghanistan. And when he stood, there in the balcony, it reminded our entire Nation that we are blessed to be protected by patriots like him. But that was only part of the story. Today I want to close with the story of Cory's brother-in-arms, Sergeant Roberto Sanchez, who was killed by that same explosion. <p>Rob wasn't a big guy, but his mother Wendy remembers that he was \\"larger than life,\\" always surrounded by friends and melting hearts with a devastating smile. Rob admired the Army from a young age, dressed up as a soldier the first time he went out for Halloween and for many Halloweens after that. He meticulously arranged and rearranged G.I. Joes on his bedroom floor. And when he watched the Twin Towers fall that awful September day, Rob found his calling to serve his country. A proud Army Ranger who took care of his fellow soldiers just as he did his own family, he'd tell Wendy, \\"Mom . . . I'm your Superman.\\" <p>In October 2009, Rob was on his fifth deployment, and Rob and Cory were finishing a mission with their fellow Rangers in Kandahar. And that's when the bomb went off. And that's when this American family made a sacrifice the depths of which few of us will ever truly comprehend. <p>And in the years since, Wendy has dug deep to find the strength to live without Rob. She keeps in touch with Cory, who she finally had a chance to meet and spend some time with this past week, sharing their memories of Rob. She runs half-marathons. She and her husband pour their hearts into raising their youngest son Logan, who she says wants to be just like Rob, which she knows means she'll probably send another son into military service. <p>Today Wendy is watching this ceremony from home near Indianapolis, on a Memorial Day in America that has been made safe by her son's sacrifice. And every day, when she looks at the old photo of her and Rob that sits on her dresser, she's reminded that although he is gone, he will always inspire her and will always be her Superman. <p>For the parents who have lost a child, for the husbands and wives who have lost a partner, for the children who have lost a parent, this day and this place are solemn reminders of the extraordinary sacrifice they have made in our name. But today reminds us as well that for these family and for their comrades-in-arms, their service to our Nation endures. There are few who truly understand what it means to send a child into war or to watch a battle buddy give his life to save others. On this Memorial Day, and every day, these are the families and veterans we're sworn to look after. <p>And so here, on these hallowed grounds, we rededicate ourselves to our sacred obligations to all who wear America's uniform and to the families who stand by them always: that our troops will have the resources they need to do their job; that our Nation will never stop searching for those who've gone missing, who are held as prisoners of war; that, as we've been reminded in recent days, we must do more to keep faith with our veterans and their families and ensure they get the care and benefits and opportunities that they've earned and that they deserve. These Americans have done their duty. They ask nothing more than that our country does ours, now and for decades to come. <p>The fallen patriots we memorialize today gave their last full measure of devotion. Not so we might mourn them, though we do. Not so that our Nation might honor their sacrifice, although it does. They gave their lives so that we might live ours: so that a daughter might grow up to pursue her dreams; so that a wife might be able to live a long life, free and secure; so that a mother might raise her family in a land of peace and freedom. Everything that we hold precious in this country was made possible by Americans who gave their all. And because of them, our Nation is stronger, safer, and will always remain a shining beacon of freedom for the rest of the world. <p>May God bless the fallen and all those who serve. May God watch over their families. And may God continue to bless the United States of America.\" "
"120" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. As you know, this weekend, I traveled to Afghanistan to thank our men and women in uniform and our deployed civilians, on behalf of a grateful nation, for the extraordinary sacrifices they make on behalf of our security. I was also able to meet with our commanding general and Ambassador to review the progress that we've made. And today I'd like to update the American people on the way forward in Afghanistan and how, this year, we will bring America's longest war to a responsible end. <p>The United States did not seek this fight. We went into Afghanistan out of necessity, after our Nation was attacked by Al Qaida on September 11, 2001. We went to war against Al Qaida and its extremist allies with the strong support of the American people and their representatives in Congress, with the international community and our NATO allies, and with the Afghan people, who welcomed the opportunity of a life free from the dark tyranny of extremism. <p>We have now been in Afghanistan longer than many Americans expected. But make no mistake: Thanks to the skill and sacrifice of our troops, diplomats, and intelligence professionals, we have struck significant blows against Al Qaida's leadership, we have eliminated Usama bin Laden, and we have prevented Afghanistan from being used to launch attacks against our homeland. We've also supported the Afghan people as they continue the hard work of building a democracy. We've extended more opportunities to their people, including women and girls. And we've helped train and equip their own security forces. <p>Now we're finishing the job we started. Over the last several years, we've worked to transition security responsibilities to the Afghans. One year ago, Afghan forces assumed the lead for combat operations. Since then, they've continued to grow in size and in strength, while making huge sacrifices for their country. This transition has allowed us to steadily draw down our own forces, from a peak of 100,000 U.S. troops to roughly 32,000 today. <p>Two thousand fourteen, therefore, is a pivotal year. Together with our allies and the Afghan Government, we have agreed that this is the year we will conclude our combat mission in Afghanistan. This is also a year of political transition in Afghanistan. Earlier this spring, Afghans turned out in the millions to vote in the first round of their Presidential election, defying threats in order to determine their own destiny. And in just over 2 weeks, they will vote for their next President, and Afghanistan will see its first democratic transfer of power in history. <p>In the context of this progress, having consulted with Congress and my national security team, I've determined the nature of the commitment that America is prepared to make beyond 2014. Our objectives are clear: disrupting threats posed by Al Qaida, supporting Afghan security forces, and giving the Afghan people the opportunity to succeed as they stand on their own. <p>Here's how we will pursue those objectives. First, America's combat mission will be over by the end of this year. Starting next year, Afghans will be fully responsible for securing their country. American personnel will be in an advisory role. We will no longer patrol Afghan cities or towns, mountains or valleys. That is a task for the Afghan people. Second, I've made it clear that we're open to cooperating with Afghans on two narrow missions after 2014: training Afghan forces and supporting counterterrorism operations against the remnants of Al Qaida. <p>Today I want to be clear about how the United States is prepared to advance those missions. At the beginning of 2015, we will have approximately 98,000 U.S.&mdash;let me start that over, just because I want to make sure we don't get this written wrong. At the beginning of 2015, we will have approximately 9,800&mdash;nine thousand eight hundred&mdash;U.S. servicemembers in different parts of the country, together with our NATO allies and other partners. By the end of 2015, we will have reduced that presence by roughly half and will have consolidated our troops in Kabul and on Bagram Airfield. One year later, by the end of 2016, our military will draw down to a normal Embassy presence in Kabul, with a security assistance component, just as we've done in Iraq. <p>Now, even as our troops come home, the international community will continue to support Afghans as they build their country for years to come. But our relationship will not be defined by war, it will be shaped by our financial and development assistance, as well as our diplomatic support. Our commitment to Afghanistan is rooted in the strategic partnership that we agreed to in 2012. And this plan remains consistent with discussions we've had with our NATO allies. Just as our allies have been with us every step of the way in Afghanistan, we expect that our allies will be with us going forward. <p>Third, we will only sustain this military presence after 2014 if the Afghan Government signs the bilateral security agreement that our two governments have already negotiated. This agreement is essential to give our troops the authorities they need to fulfill their mission, while respecting Afghan sovereignty. The two final Afghan candidates in the runoff election for President have each indicated that they would sign this agreement promptly after taking office. So I'm hopeful that we can get this done. <p>The bottom line is, it's time to turn the page on more than a decade in which so much of our foreign policy was focused on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. When I took office, we had nearly 180,000 troops in harm's way. By the end of this year, we will have less than 10,000. In addition to bringing our troops home, this new chapter in American foreign policy will allow us to redirect some of the resources saved by ending these wars to respond more nimbly to the changing threat of terrorism, while addressing a broader set of priorities around the globe. <p>I think Americans have learned that it's harder to end wars than it is to begin them. Yet this is how wars end in the 21st century: not through signing ceremonies, but through decisive blows against our adversaries, transitions to elected governments, security forces who are trained to take the lead and ultimately full responsibility. We remain committed to a sovereign, secure, stable, and unified Afghanistan. And toward that end, we will continue to support Afghan-led efforts to promote peace in their country through reconciliation. We have to recognize, Afghanistan will not be a perfect place, and it is not America's responsibility to make it one. The future of Afghanistan must be decided by Afghans. But what the United States can do&mdash;what we will do&mdash;is secure our interests and help give the Afghans a chance, an opportunity, to seek a long-overdue and hard-earned peace. <p>America will always keep our commitments to friends and partners who step up, and we will never waver in our determination to deny Al Qaida the safe haven that they had before 9/11. That commitment is embodied by the men and women, in and out of uniform, who serve in Afghanistan today and who have served in the past. In their eyes, I see the character that sustains American security and our leadership abroad. These are mostly young people who did not hesitate to volunteer in a time of war. And as many of them begin to transition to civilian life, we will keep the promise we make to them and to all veterans and make sure they get the care and benefits that they have earned and deserve. <p>This 9/11 generation is part of an unbroken line of heroes who give up the comfort of the familiar to serve a half a world away, to protect their families and communities back home, and to give people they never thought they'd meet the chance to live a better life. It is an extraordinary sacrifice for them and for their families. But we shouldn't be surprised that they're willing to make it. That's who we are as Americans. That's what we do. <p>Tomorrow I will travel to West Point and speak to America's newest class of military officers to discuss how Afghanistan fits into our broader strategy going forward. And I am confident that if we carry out this approach, we can not only responsibly end our war in Afghanistan and achieve the objectives that took us to war in the first place, we'll also be able to begin a new chapter in the story of American leadership around the world. <p>Thanks very much.\" "
"121" "\"<i>The President.</i> Welcome to the White House Science Fair! I love this event. [<i>Laughter</i>] This is one of my favorite things all year long. <p>Before I begin, I want to recognize some people who are here today who really worked hard not only to make our Science Fair happen, but are working hard to connect young people to science every single day. We've got our Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan is here. We have our head of NASA and former astronaut, Charlie Bolden is here. There he is. We have our Director of the National Institutes of Health, Francis Collins is here. My chief Science Adviser, John Holdren, is here. <p>We've got Bill Nye, the Science Guy. You can see his bow tie. He's right here. Love Bill Nye, the Science Guy. [<i>Applause</i>] You guys like him, huh? [<i>Laughter</i>] You see, you got a big \\"whoop.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] And we've got a woman who gets to build and blow stuff up for a living at MythBusters: Kari Byron is here. Where's Kari? There she is right there. <p>And we want to recognize the people whose love and support helped these amazing young people get here: the parents, mentors, tireless teachers. Let's give them all a big round of applause. [<i>Applause</i>] Yay! <p>Now, I have a confession to make. When I was growing up, my science fair projects were not as successful as the ones here. [<i>Laughter</i>] One year, I accidently killed some plants that were a part of my experiment. [<i>Laughter</i>] Another time, a bunch of mice escaped in my grandmother's apartment. [<i>Laughter</i>] These experiments did not take me straight to the White House. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And instead, I have a chance now to see what real young scientists can do. And they were just amazing. And by the way, there were no rodents loose in the White House. [<i>Laughter</i>] I couldn't even imagine doing some of the work that the young people I had a chance to meet were doing when I was their age, and your generation of young people is learning more than people in some ages ever did. And our job is to make sure that you've got everything you need to continue on this path of discovery and experimentation and innovation that has been the hallmark not only of human progress, but also the hallmark of American progress. And that's why we decided to organize these science fairs. <p>Last week, we had the Super Bowl Champion Seattle Seahawks here. They came by the White House. And that was cool. And there's a tradition that when the NBA champions or the NFL champions or college football champions, if they win a championship, they get a chance to come and get highlighted in the White House and take a picture with the President. <p>But I believe that what's being done by these amazing young people who I had a chance to meet is even more important. And I'm a big sports fan; everybody knows that. But what's happening here is more important. As a society, we have to celebrate outstanding work by young people in science at least as much as we do Super Bowl winners. <p>Because superstar biologists and engineers and rocket scientists and robot builders, they don't always get the attention that they deserve, but they're what's going to transform our society. They're the folks who are going to come up with cures for diseases and new sources of energy and help us build healthier, more successful societies. And I want to make sure that every young people across America knows what their peers are doing to inspire even more work in science. <p>That's what this White House Science Fair is all about. And this year, we're putting special emphasis and special focus on all the amazing girls and young women who are excelling at science and technology and engineering and math. And I met some amazing young ladies here today. <p>So a lot of the young people who I met, they started off trying to solve a problem that they saw in their neighborhoods or at their school. But the solutions they're coming up with have the potential to solve problems all around the world. <p>So we have the all-girls app team from Resaca Middle School in Los Fresnos, Texas. Where are they? I just saw them. There they are. [<i>Applause</i>] There they are. So one of their classmates&mdash;an outstanding young man, Andres Salas&mdash;is visually impaired. So they designed an app to help him navigate their school and other buildings. <p>The app tells Andres where he is, where he may need to go, can give him directions, which saves Andres a huge amount of time because, they were explaining&mdash;Andres was explaining how if he goes from middle school to high school, he's got to essentially memorize and track his surroundings, and this app is helping him do that. And so not only do these young ladies have big brains, but they've also got big hearts. <p>When Maria Hanes thought about entering the science fair her senior year in high school, she wanted to work on a project on something she loves. She loves football more than anything else. She's from Oklahoma, so as you might imagine, the Sooners are big in her mind. And she also recognized, though, that a lot of players are suffering from the concussions that come from collisions, so&mdash;and she also happened to manage her high school football team. <p>She dropped her cell phone one day&mdash;like most teenagers, she loves her cell phone more than anything&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;including probably her parents at this stage&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;although I know that she'll grow out of that. She noticed, her rubber case protected her phone. She wondered what kinds of stuff are covering football helmets. And that's how her \\"Concussion Cushion\\" was born. And that's the kind of idea that we're going to be talking about this Thursday, when we actually have parents, kids, and pro athletes come to the White House for a Healthy Kids and Safe Sports Concussion Summit. <p>Peyton Robertson is here. First of all, but where is&mdash;I want to make sure I acknowledge Maria. Where is Maria? There she is. Stand up, Maria, so everybody can see you. All right. <p>Now, we've got Peyton Robertson, who's here from Pine Crest School of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I would just advise people&mdash;I can't do this because I've got a conflict of interest&mdash;if you can buy stock in Peyton, you should do so now. [<i>Laughter</i>] He actually had two projects here, both patented or patents pending. <p>You say you're 12? <p><i>Science Fair participant Peyton Robertson</i>. I am. <p><i>The President.</i> \\"I am\\"&mdash;yes. [<i>Laughter</i>] So this guy is something. [<i>Laughter</i>] When Hurricane Wilma hit nearly 9 years ago, Peyton took cover in the closet and played Monopoly with his mom and later said, \\"It's a lot easier to win when your parents are distracted by a category 3 storm.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] That is a good point. You were just buying Boardwalk and&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;they didn't care, whatever. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>After the storm, Peyton started thinking about the ways people prepare for floods. And he noticed that sandbags are heavy and sometimes they leak. So Peyton designed new, reusable sandbags, using polymers, that, when wet, expand to prevent saltwater from seeping in, and when they dry out, they weigh just 4 pounds. Now, this is just one of his projects. He had another project about retractable training wheels so dad doesn't have to get out the screwdriver. [<i>Laughter</i>] But it just gives you a sense of the kind of inquisitiveness and ingenuity that a young man like Peyton has. So give Peyton a big round of applause. [<i>Applause</i>] Way to go, Peyton. <p>And then there is Olivia Van Amsterdam and Katelyn Sweeney, representing their team from Natick High School in Massachusetts. Where are they? Where did they go? There they are. Stand up. They learned that diving for a missing person can be dangerous and a time-consuming process, particularly up in Massachusetts where it gets cold and there's often ice over the water. So they worked to develop a robot that could help firefighters and ice rescue teams search for objects and bodies in perilous waters. <p>So they built the robot. But here's the other reason that I admire the two of them: When they're not busy building lifesaving robots, they are also establishing an all-girls robotics team. And one is about to graduate. The other is a junior. They're already helping other young women get involved in science and technology, engineering and math. And we are very, very proud of them. So give them a big round of applause. <p>Every one of the young people that I met here were amazing. And it reminds us that there's so much talent to be tapped if we're working together and lifting it up. Fewer than&mdash;right now fewer than one in five bachelor's degrees in engineering or computer science are earned by women. Fewer than 3 in 10 workers in science and engineering are women. That means we've got half the field&mdash;or half our team we're not even putting on the field. We've got to change those numbers. These are the fields of the future. This is where the good jobs are going to be. And I want America to be home for those jobs. <p>And that's why, 3 years ago, I called for a national effort to train a hundred thousand excellent STEM teachers over the next decade. We are now making progress on that front. Today I'm announcing a new $35 million competition to train some of our best math and science graduates to become teachers and fill more of our classrooms with the hands-on science that we see here today, even when their school districts can't afford a lot of fancy equipment. We're also going to expand STEM AmeriCorps to provide learning opportunities for 18,000 low-income students this summer. <p>And companies, nonprofits, cities&mdash;they're doing their part. Today, dozens of them are stepping up with new commitments to inspire and help more students learn. So seven cities are partnering with more than 200 businesses and nonprofits to connect girls and low-income students with mentors in science and technology. Esri is giving every school in America the chance to use its scientific software for free. And we're grateful for that. Khan Academy is partnering with NASA to make lessons about the math and science going on relative to the Mars Project open and accessible to millions of learners worldwide. And a lot of private sector leaders are involved in these efforts and have come here today, probably to recruit&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;folks like Peyton, giving him a card and saying, here, in 6 years, come call me. [<i>Laughter</i>] So we're blessed to live in a country filled with bright, eager young people who love science, love tinkering, love making things, who have the ability to see old problems and grand challenges with fresh eyes. And those of us who are grownups have an obligation to help them reach their full potential, just as others helped us. <p>It was Franklin Roosevelt who said, \\"We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future.\\" And as President, that's what inspires me. That's what gets me up every day. And that's why I'm going to keep on&mdash;for every day that I'm in this office, that I have the privilege of being President, I'm going to make sure that my focus is on how we're building up the youth of tomorrow so that they can succeed and, as a consequence, America can succeed. <p>To all the young people that I met&mdash;just&mdash;I mean, I'm just looking at them. I want to kind of actually talk about all of them. You've got the young lady here who was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 12 and figured out, with the help of the surgeon, a better understanding of how to isolate the genetic mutations that impact her cancer. She's going to be going to Harvard, as you might imagine. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>You got this guy right here who is designing a new computer system that might allow us to develop flu vaccines faster and more efficiently. He's going to Harvard. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>You got this guy who won, like, a coding competition for STEM education, and he just started high school. So I don't know, he'll go to MIT or someplace. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And then we've got the Girl Scout troop here from Oklahoma who&mdash;stand up, girls. [<i>Laughter</i>] These guys did their own coding to design a Lego system that shows how, if water is rising too fast on a bridge, potentially, the bridge would go up right away and save lives and save the bridge. And they're in second grade. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I was just learning how to put up a tent. [<i>Laughter</i>] They're designing bridge stuff to save people. So we're very proud of them. Give them a big round of applause. Yes! <p>Let's see. Now that I'm at it, I'm not going to leave anybody out. Who else did I miss? We've got this crew that had a simulated catapult that did outstanding work. These two folks in the blue shirts are designing a sensor system to save pedestrians, and they are actually doing it jointly with kids in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, because they want to spread their knowledge, not just restrict it to here in the United States. <p>We've got our team from Chicago doing some outstanding robotic work. We've got a young lady from&mdash;was it San Antonio?&mdash;San Antonio, Texas, who's doing the great work with electronic vehicles, and she actually sat in it. <p>And I think those are all the folks&mdash;did I miss anybody who I saw, who I had a chance to see? Because I know that we've got other contestants, including the folks back here. <p>Anyway, I wanted to let you know how proud and impressed I was with all of you. Not only are you great scientists and engineers and tinkerers, but you also gave outstanding presentations to the President of the United States. And so not only are your parents very proud of you, and your teachers and your mentors, I'm very proud of you as well. <p>Thank you, everybody. This was a great day. Good luck. Great event.\" "
"122" "\"Thank you. And thank you, General Caslen, for that introduction. To General Trainor, General Clarke, the faculty and staff at West Point: You have been outstanding stewards of this proud institution and outstanding mentors for the newest officers in the United States Army. I'd like to acknowledge the Army's leadership: General McHugh&mdash;Secretary McHugh, General Odierno, as well as Senator Jack Reed, who is here, and a proud graduate of West Point himself. <p>To the class of 2014, I congratulate you on taking your place on the Long Gray Line. Among you is the first all-female command team, Erin Mauldin and Austen Boroff. In Calla Glavin, you have a Rhodes Scholar. And Josh Herbeck proves that West Point accuracy extends beyond the three-point line. To the entire class, let me reassure you in these final hours at West Point: As Commander in Chief, I hereby absolve all cadets who are on restriction for minor conduct offenses. [<i>Laughter</i>] Let me just add that nobody ever did that for me when I was in school. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I know you join me in extending a word of thanks to your families. Joe DeMoss, whose son James is graduating, spoke for a whole lot of parents when he wrote me a letter about the sacrifices you've made. \\"Deep inside,\\" he wrote, \\"we want to explode with pride at what they are committing to do in the service of our country.\\" Like several graduates, James is a combat veteran. And I would ask all of us here today to stand and pay tribute, not only to the veterans among us, but to the more than 2.5 million Americans who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as their families. <p>This is a particularly useful time for America to reflect on those who have sacrificed so much for our freedom, a few days after Memorial Day. You are the first class to graduate since 9/11 who may not be sent into combat in Iraq or Afghanistan. [<i>Applause</i>] When I first spoke at West Point in 2009, we still had more than a hundred thousand troops in Iraq. We were preparing to surge in Afghanistan. Our counterterrorism efforts were focused on Al Qaida's core leadership, those who had carried out the 9/11 attacks. And our Nation was just beginning a long climb out of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. <p>Four and a half years later, as you graduate, the landscape has changed. We have removed our troops from Iraq. We are winding down our war in Afghanistan. Al Qaida's leadership on the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan has been decimated, and Usama bin Laden is no more. And through it all, we've refocused our investments in what has always been a key source of American strength: a growing economy that can provide opportunity for everybody who's willing to work hard and take responsibility here at home. <p>In fact, by most measures, America has rarely been stronger relative to the rest of the world. Those who argue otherwise, who suggest that America is in decline or has seen its global leadership slip away, are either misreading history or engaged in partisan politics. Think about it. Our military has no peer. The odds of a direct threat against us by any nation are low and do not come close to the dangers we faced during the cold war. Meanwhile, our economy remains the most dynamic on Earth, our businesses the most innovative. Each year, we grow more energy independent. From Europe to Asia, we are the hub of alliances unrivaled in the history of nations. America continues to attract striving immigrants. The values of our founding inspire leaders in parliaments and new movements in public squares around the globe. And when a typhoon hits the Philippines or schoolgirls are kidnapped in Nigeria or masked men occupy a building in Ukraine, it is America that the world looks to for help. So the United States is and remains the one indispensable nation. That has been true for the century passed, and it will be true for the century to come. <p>But the world is changing with accelerating speed. This presents opportunity, but also new dangers. We know all too well, after 9/11, just how technology and globalization has put power once reserved for states in the hands of individuals, raising the capacity of terrorists to do harm. Russia's aggression towards former Soviet states unnerves capitals in Europe, while China's economic rise and military reach worries its neighbors. From Brazil to India, rising middle classes compete with us, and governments seek a greater say in global forums. And even as developing nations embrace democracy and market economies, 24-hour news and social media makes it impossible to ignore the continuation of sectarian conflicts and failing states and popular uprisings that might have received only passing notice a generation ago. <p>It will be your generation's task to respond to this new world. The question we face, the question each of you will face, is not whether America will lead, but how we will lead, not just to secure our peace and prosperity, but also extend peace and prosperity around the globe. <p>Now, this question isn't new. At least since George Washington served as Commander in Chief, there have been those who warned against foreign entanglements that do not touch directly on our security or economic well-being. Today, according to self-described realists, conflicts in Syria or Ukraine or the Central African Republic are not ours to solve. And not surprisingly, after costly wars and continuing challenges here at home, that view is shared by many Americans. <p>A different view from interventionists from the left and the right says that we ignore these conflicts at our own peril; that America's willingness to apply force around the world is the ultimate safeguard against chaos and America's failure to act in the face of Syrian brutality or Russian provocations not only violates our conscience, but invites escalating aggression in the future. <p>And each side can point to history to support its claims. But I believe neither view fully speaks to the demands of this moment. It is absolutely true that in the 21st century American isolationism is not an option. We don't have a choice to ignore what happens beyond our borders. If nuclear materials are not secure, that poses a danger to American cities. As the Syrian civil war spills across borders, the capacity of battle-hardened extremist groups to come after us only increases. Regional aggression that goes unchecked, whether in southern Ukraine or the South China Sea or anywhere else in the world, will ultimately impact our allies and could draw in our military. We can't ignore what happens beyond our boundaries. <p>And beyond these narrow rationales, I believe we have a real stake, abiding self-interest, in making sure our children and our grandchildren grow up in a world where schoolgirls are not kidnapped and where individuals are not slaughtered because of tribe or faith or political belief. I believe that a world of greater freedom and tolerance is not only a moral imperative, it also helps to keep us safe. But to say that we have an interest in pursuing peace and freedom beyond our borders is not to say that every problem has a military solution. Since World War II, some of our most costly mistakes came not from our restraint, but from our willingness to rush into military adventures without thinking through the consequences, without building international support and legitimacy for our action, without leveling with the American people about the sacrifices required. Tough talk often draws headlines, but war rarely conforms to slogans. As General Eisenhower, someone with hard-earned knowledge on this subject, said at this ceremony in 1947, \\"War is mankind's most tragic and stupid folly; to seek or advise its deliberate provocation is a black crime against all men.\\" <p>Like Eisenhower, this generation of men and women in uniform know all too well the wages of war, and that includes those of you here at West Point. Four of the servicemembers who stood in the audience when I announced the surge of our forces in Afghanistan gave their lives in that effort. A lot more were wounded. I believe America's security demanded those deployments. But I am haunted by those deaths. I am haunted by those wounds. And I would betray my duty to you and to the country we love if I ever sent you into harm's way simply because I saw a problem somewhere in the world that needed to be fixed or because I was worried about critics who think military intervention is the only way for America to avoid looking weak. <p>Here's my bottom line: America must always lead on the world stage. If we don't, no one else will. The military that you have joined is and always will be the backbone of that leadership. But U.S. military action cannot be the only&mdash;or even primary&mdash;component of our leadership in every instance. Just because we have the best hammer does not mean that every problem is a nail. And because the costs associated with military action are so high, you should expect every civilian leader&mdash;and especially your Commander in Chief&mdash;to be clear about how that awesome power should be used. <p>So let me spend the rest of my time describing my vision for how the United States of America and our military should lead in the years to come, for you will be part of that leadership. <p>First, let me repeat a principle I put forward at the outset of my Presidency. The United States will use military force, unilaterally if necessary, when our core interests demand it: when our people are threatened, when our livelihoods are at stake, when the security of our allies is in danger. In these circumstances, we still need to ask tough questions about whether our actions are proportional and effective and just. International opinion matters, but America should never ask permission to protect our people, our homeland, or our way of life. <p>On the other hand, when issues of global concern do not pose a direct threat to the United States, when such issues are at stake&mdash;when crises arise that stir our conscience or push the world in a more dangerous direction, but do not directly threaten us&mdash;then the threshold for military action must be higher. In such circumstances, we should not go it alone. Instead, we must mobilize allies and partners to take collective action. We have to broaden our tools to include diplomacy and development; sanctions and isolation; appeals to international law; and if just, necessary, and effective, multilateral military action. In such circumstances, we have to work with others because collective action in these circumstances is more likely to succeed, more likely to be sustained, less likely to lead to costly mistakes. <p>And this leads to my second point: For the foreseeable future, the most direct threat to America at home and abroad remains terrorism. But a strategy that involves invading every country that harbors terrorist networks is na&iuml;ve and unsustainable. I believe we must shift our counterterrorism strategy&mdash;drawing on the successes and shortcomings of our experience in Iraq and Afghanistan&mdash;to more effectively partner with countries where terrorist networks seek a foothold. <p>And the need for a new strategy reflects the fact that today's principal threat no longer comes from a centralized Al Qaida leadership. Instead, it comes from decentralized Al Qaida affiliates and extremists, many with agendas focused in countries where they operate. And this lessens the possibility of large-scale 9/11-style attacks against the homeland, but it heightens the danger of U.S. personnel overseas being attacked, as we saw in Benghazi. It heightens the danger to less defensible targets, as we saw in a shopping mall in Nairobi. <p>So we have to develop a strategy that matches this diffuse threat, one that expands our reach without sending forces that stretch our military too thin or stir up local resentments. We need partners to fight terrorists alongside us. And empowering partners is a large part of what we have done and what we are currently doing in Afghanistan. <p>Together with our allies, America struck huge blows against Al Qaida core and pushed back against an insurgency that threatened to overrun the country. But sustaining this progress depends on the ability of Afghans to do the job. And that's why we trained hundreds of thousands of Afghan soldiers and police. Earlier this spring, those forces, those Afghan forces, secured an election in which Afghans voted for the first democratic transfer of power in their history. And at the end of this year, a new Afghan President will be in office and America's combat mission will be over. <p>Now, that was an enormous achievement made because of America's Armed Forces. But as we move to a train-and-advise mission in Afghanistan, our reduced presence there allows us to more effectively address emerging threats in the Middle East and North Africa. So earlier this year, I asked my national security team to develop a plan for a network of partnerships from South Asia to the Sahel. Today, as part of this effort, I am calling on Congress to support a new counterterrorism partnerships fund of up to $5 billion, which will allow us to train, build capacity, and facilitate partner countries on the front lines. And these resources will give us flexibility for fulfill different missions, including training security forces in Yemen who have gone on the offensive against Al Qaida, supporting a multinational force to keep the peace in Somalia, working with European allies to train a functioning security force and border patrol in Libya, and facilitating French operations in Mali. <p>A critical focus of this effort will be the ongoing crisis in Syria. As frustrating as it is, there are no easy answers there, no military solution that can eliminate the terrible suffering anytime soon. As President, I made a decision that we should not put American troops into the middle of this increasingly sectarian war, and I believe that is the right decision. But that does not mean we shouldn't help the Syrian people stand up against a dictator who bombs and starves his own people. And in helping those who fight for the right of all Syrians to choose their own future, we are also pushing back against the growing number of extremists who find safe haven in the chaos. <p>So with the additional resources I'm announcing today, we will step up our efforts to support Syria's neighbors&mdash;Jordan and Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq&mdash;as they contend with refugees and confront terrorists working across Syria's borders. I will work with Congress to ramp up support for those in the Syrian opposition who offer the best alternative to terrorists and brutal dictators. And we will continue to coordinate with our friends and allies in Europe and the Arab world to push for a political resolution of this crisis and to make sure that those countries and not just the United States are contributing their fair share to support the Syrian people. <p>Let me make one final point about our efforts against terrorism. The partnerships I've described do not eliminate the need to take direct action when necessary to protect ourselves. When we have actionable intelligence, that's what we do, through capture operations, like the one that brought a terrorist involved in the plot to bomb our Embassies in 1998 to face justice, or drone strikes, like those we've carried out in Yemen and Somalia. There are times when those actions are necessary, and we cannot hesitate to protect our people. <p>But as I said last year, in taking direct action, we must uphold standards that reflect our values. That means taking strikes only when we face a continuing, imminent threat, and only where there is no certainty&mdash;that there is near certainty of no civilian casualties. For our actions should meet a simple test: We must not create more enemies than we take off the battlefield. <p>I also believe we must be more transparent about both the basis of our counterterrorism actions and the manner in which they are carried out. We have to be able to explain them publicly, whether it is drone strikes or training partners. I will increasingly turn to our military to take the lead and provide information to the public about our efforts. Our intelligence community has done outstanding work, and we have to continue to protect sources and methods. But when we cannot explain our efforts clearly and publicly, we face terrorist propaganda and international suspicion, we erode legitimacy with our partners and our people, and we reduce accountability in our own Government. <p>And this issue of transparency is directly relevant to a third aspect of American leadership, and that is our effort to strengthen and enforce international order. After World War II, America had the wisdom to shape institutions to keep the peace and support human progress, from NATO and the United Nations to the World Bank and IMF. These institutions are not perfect, but they have been a force multiplier. They reduce the need for unilateral American action and increase restraint among other nations. <p>Now, just as the world has changed, this architecture must change as well. At the height of the cold war, President Kennedy spoke about the need for a peace based upon \\"a gradual evolution in human institutions.\\" And evolving these international institutions to meet the demands of today must be a critical part of American leadership. <p>Now, there are a lot of folks, a lot of skeptics, who often downplay the effectiveness of multilateral action. For them, working through international institutions like the U.N. or respecting international law is a sign of weakness. I think they're wrong. Let me offer just two examples why. <p>In Ukraine, Russia's recent actions recalled the days when Soviet tanks rolled into Eastern Europe. But this isn't the cold war. Our ability to shape world opinion helped isolate Russia right away. Because of American leadership, the world immediately condemned Russian actions, Europe and the G-7 joined us to impose sanctions, NATO reinforced our commitment to Eastern European allies, the IMF is helping to stabilize Ukraine's economy, OSCE monitors brought the eyes of the world to unstable parts of Ukraine. And this mobilization of world opinion and international institutions served as a counterweight to Russian propaganda and Russian troops on the border and armed militias in ski masks. <p>This weekend, Ukrainians voted by the millions. Yesterday I spoke to their next President. We don't know how the situation will play out, and there will remain grave challenges ahead, but standing with our allies on behalf of international order, working with international institutions, has given a chance for the Ukrainian people to choose their future without us firing a shot. <p>Similarly, despite frequent warnings from the United States and Israel and others, the Iranian nuclear program steadily advanced for years. But at the beginning of my Presidency, we built a coalition that imposed sanctions on the Iranian economy, while extending the hand of diplomacy to the Iranian Government. And now we have an opportunity to resolve our differences peacefully. <p>The odds of success are still long, and we reserve all options to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. But for the first time in a decade, we have a very real chance of achieving a breakthrough agreement, one that is more effective and durable than what we could have achieved through the use of force. And throughout these negotiations, it has been our willingness to work through multilateral channels that kept the world on our side. <p>The point is, this is American leadership. This is American strength. In each case, we built coalitions to respond to a specific challenge. And now we need to do more to strengthen the institutions that can anticipate and prevent problems from spreading. For example, NATO is the strongest alliance the world has ever known. But we're now working with NATO allies to meet new missions, both within Europe where our Eastern allies must be reassured, but also beyond Europe's borders, where our NATO allies must pull their weight to counterterrorism and respond to failed states and train a network of partners. <p>Likewise, the U.N. provides a platform to keep the peace in states torn apart by conflict. Now we need to make sure that those nations who provide peacekeepers have the training and equipment to actually keep the peace so that we can prevent the type of killing we've seen in Congo and Sudan. We are going to deepen our investment in countries that support these peacekeeping missions, because having other nations maintain order in their own neighborhoods lessens the need for us to put our own troops in harm's way. It's a smart investment. It's the right way to lead. <p>Keep in mind, not all international norms relate directly to armed conflict. We have a serious problem with cyber attacks, which is why we're working to shape and enforce rules of the road to secure our networks and our citizens. In the Asia-Pacific, we're supporting Southeast Asian nations as they negotiate a code of conduct with China on maritime disputes in the South China Sea. And we're working to resolve these disputes through international law. That spirit of cooperation needs to energize the global effort to combat climate change, a creeping national security crisis that will help shape your time in uniform, as we are called on to respond to refugee flows and natural disasters and conflicts over water and food, which is why next year, I intend to make sure America is out front in putting together a global framework to preserve our planet. <p>You see, American influence is always stronger when we lead by example. We can't exempt ourselves from the rules that apply to everybody else. We can't call on others to make commitments to combat climate change if a whole lot of our political leaders deny that it's taken place. We can't try to resolve problems in the South China Sea when we have refused to make sure that the Law of the Sea Convention is ratified by our United States Senate, despite the fact that our top military leaders say the treaty advances our national security. That's not leadership, that's retreat. That's not strength, that's weakness. It would be utterly foreign to leaders like Roosevelt and Truman, Eisenhower and Kennedy. I believe in American exceptionalism with every fiber of my being. But what makes us exceptional is not our ability to flout international norms and the rule of law, it is our willingness to affirm them through our actions. And that's why I will continue to push to close Gitmo, because American values and legal traditions do not permit the indefinite detention of people beyond our borders. That's why we're putting in place new restrictions on how America collects and uses intelligence, because we will have fewer partners and be less effective if a perception takes hold that we're conducting surveillance against ordinary citizens. America does not simply stand for stability or the absence of conflict, no matter what the cost. We stand for the more lasting peace that can only come through opportunity and freedom for people everywhere. <p>Which brings me to the fourth and final element of American leadership: our willingness to act on behalf of human dignity. America's support for democracy and human rights goes beyond idealism; it is a matter of national security. Democracies are our closest friends and are far less likely to go to war. Economies based on free and open markets perform better and become markets for our goods. Respect for human rights is an antidote to instability and the grievances that fuel violence and terror. <p>A new century has brought no end to tyranny. In capitals around the globe&mdash;including, unfortunately, some of America's partners&mdash;there has been a crackdown on civil society. The cancer of corruption has enriched too many governments and their cronies and enraged citizens from remote villages to iconic squares. And watching these trends or the violent upheavals in parts of the Arab world, it's easy to be cynical. <p>But remember that because of America's efforts, because of American diplomacy and foreign assistance as well as the sacrifices of our military, more people live under elected governments today than at any time in human history. Technology is empowering civil society in ways that no iron fist can control. New breakthroughs are lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. And even the upheaval of the Arab world reflects the rejection of an authoritarian order that was anything but stable and now offers the long-term prospect of more responsive and effective governance. <p>In countries like Egypt, we acknowledge that our relationship is anchored in security interests, from peace treaties to Israel to shared efforts against violent extremism. So we have not cut off cooperation with the new Government, but we can and will persistently press for reforms that the Egyptian people have demanded. <p>And meanwhile, look at a country like Burma, which only a few years ago was an intractable dictatorship and hostile to the United States: 40 million people. Thanks to the enormous courage of the people in that country, and because we took the diplomatic initiative, American leadership, we have seen political reforms opening a once-closed society, a movement by Burmese leadership away from partnership with North Korea in favor of engagement with America and our allies. We're now supporting reform and badly needed national reconciliation through assistance and investment, through coaxing and, at times, public criticism. And progress there could be reversed, but if Burma succeeds, we will have gained a new partner without having fired a shot. American leadership. <p>In each of these cases, we should not expect change to happen overnight. That's why we form alliances not just with governments, but also with ordinary people. For unlike other nations, America is not afraid of individual empowerment, we are strengthened by it. We're strengthened by civil society. We're strengthened by a free press. We're strengthened by striving entrepreneurs and small businesses. We're strengthened by educational exchange and opportunity for all people and women and girls. That's who we are. That's what we represent. <p>I saw that through a trip to Africa last year, where American assistance has made possible the prospect of an AIDS-free generation, while helping Africans care themselves for their sick. We're helping farmers get their products to market, to feed populations once endangered by famine. We aim to double access to electricity in sub-Saharan Africa so people are connected to the promise of the global economy. And all this creates new partners and shrinks the space for terrorism and conflict. <p>Now, tragically, no American security operation can eradicate the threat posed by an extremist group like Boko Haram, the group that kidnapped those girls. And that's why we have to focus not just on rescuing those girls right away, but also on supporting Nigerian efforts to educate its youth. This should be one of the hard-earned lessons of Iraq and Afghanistan, where our military became the strongest advocate for diplomacy and development. They understood that foreign assistance is not an afterthought, something nice to do apart from our national defense, apart from our national security. It is part of what makes us strong. <p>Ultimately, global leadership requires us to see the world as it is, with all its danger and uncertainty. We have to be prepared for the worst, prepared for every contingency. But American leadership also requires us to see the world as it should be: a place where the aspirations of individual human beings really matters, where hopes and not just fears govern, where the truths written into our founding documents can steer the currents of history in a direction of justice. And we cannot do that without you. <p>Class of 2014, you have taken this time to prepare on the quiet banks of the Hudson. You leave this place to carry forward a legacy that no other military in human history can claim. You do so as part of a team that extends beyond your units or even our Armed Forces, for in the course of your service, you will work as a team with diplomats and development experts. You'll get to know allies and train partners. And you will embody what it means for America to lead the world. <p>Next week, I will go to Normandy to honor the men who stormed the beaches there. And while it's hard for many Americans to comprehend the courage and sense of duty that guided those who boarded small ships, it's familiar to you. At West Point, you define what it means to be a patriot. <p>Three years ago, Gavin White graduated from this academy. He then served in Afghanistan. Like the soldiers who came before him, Gavin was in a foreign land, helping people he'd never met, putting himself in harm's way for the sake of his community and his family, of the folks back home. Gavin lost one of his legs in an attack. I met him last year at Walter Reed. He was wounded, but just as determined as the day that he arrived here at West Point, and he developed a simple goal. Today his sister Morgan will graduate. And true to his promise, Gavin will be there to stand and exchange salutes with her. <p>We have been through a long season of war. We have faced trials that were not foreseen, and we've seen divisions about how to move forward. But there is something in Gavin's character&mdash;there is something in the American character&mdash;that will always triumph. Leaving here, you carry with you the respect of your fellow citizens. You will represent a nation with history and hope on our side. Your charge now is not only to protect our country, but to do what is right and just. As your Commander in Chief, I know you will. May God bless you, may God bless our men and women in uniform, and may God bless the United States of America.\" "
"123" "\"The&mdash;when you&mdash;as a dad, when you&mdash;Tori's parents are here. And I have to imagine, they are awfully proud of this remarkable young lady, and we really appreciate you taking the time to introduce me. <p>I want to welcome everybody here to the White House. I want to thank Members of Congress who are here. We've got leaders from America's sports and medical communities, especially young people here like Tori, who did such a great job sharing her story today. <p>All across the country, there are millions of young athletes just like Tori who spend their weekends and summers on baseball diamonds and soccer pitches. And they put in extra practice so they can make the varsity or maybe even earn a college scholarship. Most of them are not as good as Tori was at her sport. I certainly wasn't, although I had the same enthusiasm. And for so many of our kids, sports aren't just something they do; they're part of their identity. They may be budding scientists or entrepreneurs or writers, but they're also strikers and linebackers and point guards. And that's a good thing. <p>First of all, the First Lady thinks everybody needs to move. [<i>Laughter</i>] And obviously, there's a huge public health interest in making sure that people are participating in sports. But sports is also just fundamental to who we are as Americans and our culture. We're competitive. We're driven. And sports teaches us about teamwork and hard work and what it takes to succeed not just on the field, but in life. <p>And I was a basketball player, as I said, not as good as Tori was at soccer. But I learned so many lessons playing sports that I carry on to this day, even to the Presidency. And still, when I need to relax and clear my head, I turn to sports, whether it's a pickup basketball game&mdash;and I'm much slower than I was just last week&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;or more sedate pastimes like golf or watching SportsCenter. <p>And more than that, as a parent, Michelle and I have always encouraged our girls to play sports. One of the greatest transformations, I think, in our society has been how young women have been finally given the opportunity because of title IX. And now you see just unbelievable women athletes who are getting the same exposure and experience and outlets for sports all across the country. And Malia and Sasha are part of that generation. They take for granted, of course, we're playing sports. And they played everything from soccer to basketball and tennis and track. So sports are important to our life as a family, just like they are for families all across the country. <p>The reason we're here today, though, is, all across the country, parents are also having a more troubling conversation, and that's about the risks of concussions. There's a lot of concern, but there's a lot of uncertainty. And as Tori's story suggests, concussions are not just a football issue. They don't just affect grown men who choose to accept some risk to play a game that they love and that they excel at. Every season, you've got boys and girls who are getting concussions in lacrosse and soccer and wrestling and ice hockey, as well as football. And in fact, the Center for Disease Control reports that in the most recent data that's available to us, young people made nearly 250,000 emergency room visits with brain injuries from sports and recreation&mdash;250,000. That number obviously doesn't include kids who see their family doctor or, as is typical, don't seek any medical help. <p>Before the awareness was out there, when I was young and played football briefly, there were a couple of times where I'm sure that that ringing sensation in my head and the need to sit down for a while might have been a mild concussion, and at the time, you didn't think anything of it. The awareness is improved today, but not by much. So the total number of young people who are impacted by this early on is probably bigger than we know. <p>Now, I say this not to scare people. We want our kids participating in sports. I'd be much more troubled if young people were shying away from sports. As parents, though, we want to keep them safe, and that means we have to have better information. We have to know what these issues are. And the fact is, we don't have solid numbers, and that tells me that at every level, we're all still trying to fully grasp what's going on with this issue. <p>Last fall, a comprehensive report found that there are too many gaps in the understanding of the effects and treatment for concussions. Researchers are still learning about the causes and consequences of these injuries. Communities are wondering how young it is to start tackle football, for example. Parents are wondering whether their kids are learning the right techniques or wearing the best safety equipment or whether they should sign up for&mdash;to have their kids participate in any full-contact sports at all. <p>We've got some outstanding scientists here today like Francis Collins, the head of NIH. There may be tests that at some point we can do to see if there is a particular susceptibility to concussions. Some people's brains may be more vulnerable to trauma than others are. We don't know that yet, but there may be some evidence that is worth exploring. <p>So with all of these questions swirling around, as a parent and as a fan, and in discussions with a lot of other parents and fans who happen to be in this White House, we decided, why not use our convening power to help find some more answers? And today we've brought together the president of the NCAA, the MLS commissioner, senior leadership from the NHL and U.S. Soccer and the NFL and the NFL Players Association. We've also got some of the Nation's foremost brain experts. We've got doctors who work with kids every day from all over the country. We've got leaders in Pop Warner and Little League and Under Armour and ESPN participating. And we've got Members of Congress like Joyce Beatty and Tim Bishop and Bill Pascrell, all who have taken a great interest in this. <p>And because we're all here and are looking for information, even if we may not agree on everything, the one thing we can agree on is, is that sports are vital to this country and it's a responsibility for us to make sure that young, talented kids like Tori are able to participate as safely as possible and that we are doing our job, both as parents and school administrators, coaches, to look after them the way they need to be looked after. That's job number one. <p>The good news is, across the country, people eagerly signed up to participate here. They've recognized this is an issue that is worth paying attention to. We've seen all 50 States pass laws requiring concussed athletes to get a medical clearance before they return to play. Folks from USA Hockey banned checking before 12 years old. In March, the NFL donated $45 million to USA Football for their Heads Up Football program, which emphasizes coach training and player safety. <p>On our part, this administration&mdash;the CDC&mdash;has spearheaded a public awareness campaign for parents and athletes and coaches and school staff called Heads Up. And you can check it out at CDC.gov/concussion. That's where we've compiled a lot of the best information available for parents. And while the number of concussions reported among young athletes has risen over the past decade, one reason is likely because players, coaches, and parents better understand symptoms of these injuries. <p>Still, there's more work to do. We've got to have better research, better data, better safety equipment, better protocols. We've got to have every parent and coach and teacher recognize the signs of concussions. And we need more athletes to understand how important it is to do what we can to prevent injuries and to admit them when they do happen. We have to change a culture that says you suck it up. Identifying a concussion and being able to self-diagnose that this is something that I need to take care of doesn't make you weak, it means you're strong. <p>At the same time, I want to point out that this is not just a matter for athletes. You'll notice this big guy here, Ray Odierno, who is not only the leader of our Army, but also is somebody who plays football, who&mdash;I don't know if he still plays, although he could. [<i>Laughter</i>] But as a leader of our Armed Forces, he sees the effects that injuries have had on brave men and women who serve in uniform and all of us who cares about them. That's why Ray is here today. <p>And I've seen in my visits to wounded warriors, traumatic brain injury is one of the signature issues of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The thing is, the vast majority of mild traumatic brain injury cases in the military occur outside deployment. So even though our wars are ending, addressing this issue will continue to be important to our Armed Forces. And as part of a new national action plan we announced last year, we're directing more than a hundred million dollars in new research to find more effective ways to help prevent, diagnose, and treat mental health conditions and traumatic brain injury, because the more we can learn about the effects of brain injuries, the more we can do to help our courageous troops and veterans recover. And that obviously gives us more information about our kids as well. <p>Today, by the way, I'm proud to announce a number of new commitments and partnerships from the folks in this room that are going to help us move the ball forward on this issue. The NCAA and the Department of Defense are teaming up to commit $30 million for concussion education and a study involving up to 37,000 college athletes, which will be the most comprehensive concussion study ever. And our service academies&mdash;Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard&mdash;are all signed up to support this study in any way that they can. <p>The NFL is committing $25 million of new funding over the next 3 years to test strategies like creating health and safety forums for parents, and they're building on the program piloted by my own Chicago Bears&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;to get more trainers at high school games. And the NIH is announcing the next step in this partnership with the NFL. They're dedicating $16 million of the NFL's previous donation toward studies and clinical trials to examine the chronic effects of repetitive concussions. <p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology will invest $5 million over the next 5 years to explore the development of lighter and smarter and more responsive materials for protective equipment. And I want to single out the New York Giants chairman, Steve Tisch, who is here and is donating $10 million of his own money to expand the BrainSPORT Program at UCLA to prevent, study, and treat concussions and traumatic brain injury in youth. So all these new commitments are terrific, and we want to thank everybody here for participating. <p>So just to wrap up so you can hear from people who actually know what they're talking about, these efforts are going to make a lot of difference for a lot of people, from soldiers on the battlefield to students out on the football field. Take the Levine family from Rockville, Maryland, who are here today. Where did they go? There they are right there. Cheryl and Jason Levine have three boys who, when you look at them, you know right away they're brothers: Isaac, Sidney, and Rueben. They have loved ice hockey since they were really young. <p>But when he was 7 years old, Sidney suffered a pair of moderate concussions on the ice. A few years later, when Isaac was an eighth grader, he suffered a more severe concussion in a game. After the injury, both boys had headaches. They started struggling in class. They started acting out. Isaac's concussion even kept him out of school for a while. And as you might imagine, Cheryl was horrified. As she put it, \\"You only have one brain.\\" That's a good point. And you want to make sure that you're treating it right. <p>Fortunately, with the help of their doctors, both boys' health and behavior improved. And Sidney was back on the ice 10 weeks after his concussion. He's hoping to play varsity next year as a freshman. And last winter, Isaac played forward as his high school team won the State championship. <p>Now, Cheryl and Jason could have pulled their boys out&mdash;it was such a scare&mdash;and had their doctors recommended it, that's what they would have done. But they knew that just like millions of kids across the country, kids love their sports. So Cheryl and Jason educated themselves on the issue, and with their doctor's blessing and the support of the coaches and teachers, they're encouraging their boys to lace up those skates and get out on the ice. And as Cheryl said, \\"My kids aren't going to go on and play in the NHL.\\" But&mdash;I hope they know that, by the way. [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"But what I'm worried about is getting through their teens while having fun and building confidence and doing the things they want to do, obviously within certain limits.\\" That's some good parenting by Cheryl. <p>And that's what today is about. It's to give parents the information they need to help their kids compete safely. Let's keep encouraging our kids to get out there and play sports that they love and doing it the right way. That's not a job just for parents, but it's a job for all of us. And that's why the public-private partnerships like these are important. In a few minutes, I know that many of you are going to take this discussion a step further with this panel of experts moderated by Pam Oliver, which we're very grateful for. <p>But I want to thank all of you for coming here today, for your contributions to our kids' future. And most of all, I want to thank the young people who are here, particularly Tori, for highlighting why this issue is so important. We're really excited. And by the way, Tori, although is not going to be playing soccer when she goes to college&mdash;she's graduating&mdash;she does intend to stay involved in the sport and, I understand, is going to be doing some coaching of some 4- and 5-year-olds this summer. And she is going to pass on some of the knowledge, hard-earned knowledge that she's learned. And that's why we know she's going to be a terrific success in whatever she chooses to do. <p>Thank you, everybody.\" "
"124" "\"Earlier this year, I launched something we're calling My Brother's Keeper, and I think that many of you recall me talking in very personal terms about someone who grew up without a father and made some mistakes when I was young, but benefited from the love and attention and opportunities that were given to me during the course of growing up, and the fact that we have too many young men of color&mdash;Black boys and young men, Latino boys and young men&mdash;who are adrift and don't have those same opportunities and don't have those same structures of support. <p>The idea behind My Brother's Keepers was that there are a lot of folks that want to do something, but we hadn't created a platform, a mechanism to gather all those resources together, concentrate them, focus on them, get good data, figure out what the best practices are, and then go out there and implement. <p>And so what I did was assign a process for us to inventory everything that's already being done to help young boys of color and men of color to succeed, to have every agency&mdash;from Justice Department to Education to HUD to USDA&mdash;look at how they could contribute to the process to make sure that we've got the best data possible and then to report back to me so that we can have a plan of attack. <p>Today, thanks to the good work of my Cabinet Secretary, who has been heading this up, as well as our Deputy Secretary of Education, Broderick Johnson and Jim Shelton&mdash;they've presented to me our report on what we need to be doing. And it is comprehensive, and it goes&mdash;everything from making sure that we've got better early childhood education to finding better ways to create apprenticeship programs and job training programs and mentorship programs; how do we modify policies in schools where young men of color are being disproportionally suspended, which we know results in higher dropout rates, which we know results potentially in them ending up in the prison system; all the way to how do we deal with young people who have gotten into trouble with the law, but are&mdash;can be redeemed if we have effective ways of reaching them. <p>With this Task Force report, we're now looking to implement. And we're partnering with philanthropies, we're partnering with businesses, we're partnering with community organizations and nongovernment organizations that are already doing great jobs on the ground, but feel isolated and disconnected from other efforts in other places. <p>And the goal then is going to be for us over the course of the next couple of years to really put in place not only a all-hands-on-deck effort on the Federal level, but a partnership with the private sector so that we can see some concrete outcomes. And we've already got enormous enthusiasm from mayors around the country, many of whom tell us that this is the single most important priority that they have in ensuring that their cities will thrive. We've got businesses who are saying, we know this is going to be the workforce of the future, and if we do not address this demographic, our companies aren't going to prosper, and the American economy as a whole is not going to grow as quickly as it could. We know that there is enormous enthusiasm from faith-based groups that feel as if they're laboring out there on their own and want to connect up with others. We know that our national service programs have real interest in figuring out how this works. <p>So you're going to see a rollout over the next several weeks of some very specific commitments that have already been made. We have benefited from input from a whole range of sources. There have been listening tours that Broderick and Jim have conducted in cities all across the country. <p>I want to thank the CEO of Deloitte, Joe Echevarria, as well as Magic Johnson, who are going to be leading an external push to get more folks on board. And I also want to thank Members of Congress who have given us some great input as well. <p>One of the big pushes we're going to make because of the timing is on summer jobs. And already we're seeing, I think, a much greater sense of urgency this summer about putting these young people in opportunities where they can learn the basic skills that they're going to need to get attached to the labor market. <p>So overall, I'm very happy with the report. We'll give the press the report and/or an executive summary to see the very specific steps, the things that we know are going to work. And we are going to be rolling out over the next several weeks more specifics about commitments that we've obtained, and you can expect over the course of the next year, you're going to be getting more news from us about the successes that we're achieving and the lessons that we've learned. <p>But the bottom line is this: As we approach Father's Day, I'm just reminded that I am only here because a bunch of folks invested in me. We've got a huge number of kids out there who have as much talent or more talent than I had, but nobody is investing in them. And I want to make sure that I use this platform&mdash;and every Cabinet member here wants to make sure that they use the tools that they've got&mdash;so that these young men and young boys know somebody cares about them, somebody is thinking about them, and that they can succeed and make America stronger as a consequence. All right? <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"125" "\"Well, we're here at FEMA'S National Response Coordination Center to get an update on this year's preparations for hurricane season, which begins on Sunday. I want to thank Secretary Jeh Johnson as well as FEMA coordinator&mdash;or FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate for leading this briefing. And I also want to thank all the hard-working employees in all the departments that are responsible for helping us prepare, respond to, and recover from emergencies. <p>States still have the primary role in preparing for and responding to disasters, and we'll continue to make sure that they get the full resources that they need and support they need to back them up. But it's also every citizen's responsibility to make sure that we are prepared for emergencies when they come, not just hurricanes, but every emergency. And that's why I want to thank the representatives that we have from not just the Department of Energy, but also the Commonwealth of Virginia as well as the folks from Orange County, Florida, who have developed mobile apps to give residents the ability to plan, prepare for, get faster notice of, and respond to emergencies. <p>Before a hurricane is even on the horizon, these apps can help families develop emergency plans, figure out evacuation routes, and receive emergency alerts. After a storm, one app provides information about power outages and where gas stations might be open. Others show residents where to find shelter and water. So I encourage every American to visit ready.gov. That's our national website where you can go and get every bit of information you need to figure out whether you're ready in the event, heaven forbid, something happens. You can get even more information about family emergency plans and supply kits and the plans that are taking place in your community. <p>And over the larger term, the changes we're seeing in our climate means that, unfortunately, storms like Sandy could end up being more common and more devastating. And that's why we're also going to be doing more to deal with the dangerous carbon pollution that helps to cause climate change and global warming. And that's why we're also, with the terrific help of these departments, thinking of how we can build more resilient infrastructure. <p>But obviously, most urgently, as hurricane season begins, we have to remember that responding to a hurricane is a team effort and everybody is going to have a role to play at the Federal, State, and local levels. So I encourage every family and business owner to check out ready.gov and see what you can do to be prepared. <p>And while I'm here, I also want to thank not only the staff and employees of&mdash;who each and every day, without a lot of attention, help communities deal with disasters, but I also want to thank all the first responders out there all across the country, because when they're called on, they're the ones who have to get there first and often put themselves at risk and do an amazing job. All right? <p>Thank you, everybody.\" "
"126" "\"Hi, everybody. I'm here at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, DC, visiting with some kids being treated here all the time for asthma and other breathing problems. Often, these illnesses are aggravated by air pollution, pollution from the same sources that release carbon and contribute to climate change. And for the sake of all our kids, we've got to do more to reduce it. <p>Earlier this month, hundreds of scientists declared that climate change is no longer a distant threat, it \\"has moved firmly into the present.\\" Its costs can be measured in lost lives and livelihoods, lost homes and businesses, and higher prices for food, insurance, and rebuilding. <p>That's why, last year, I put forward America's first climate action plan. This plan cuts carbon pollution by building a clean energy economy: using more clean energy, less dirty energy, and wasting less energy throughout our economy. <p>One of the best things we can do for our economy, our health, and our environment is to lead the world in producing cleaner, safer energy. And we're already generating more clean energy than ever before. Thanks in part to the investments we made in the Recovery Act, the electricity America generates from wind has tripled. And from the Sun, it's increased more than tenfold. In fact, every 4 minutes, another American home or business goes solar. And every panel is pounded into place by a worker whose job cannot be shipped overseas. <p>We're wasting less energy too. We doubled down how far our cars and trucks will go on a gallon of gas by the middle of the next decade, saving you money at the pump, and we're helping families and businesses save billions with more efficient homes, buildings, and appliances. <p>This strategy has created jobs, grown our economy, and helped make America more energy independent than we've been in decades, all while holding our carbon emissions to levels not seen in about 20 years. It's a good start. But for the sake of our children, we have to do more. <p>This week, we will. Today, about 40 percent of America's carbon pollution comes from power plants. But right now there are no national limits to the amount of carbon pollution that existing plants can pump into the air we breathe. None. We limit the amount of toxic chemicals like mercury, sulfur, and arsenic that power plants put in our air and water. But they can dump unlimited amounts of carbon pollution into the air. It's not smart, it's not safe, and it doesn't make sense. <p>That's why, a year ago, I directed the Environmental Protection Agency to build on the efforts of many States, cities, and companies and come up with commonsense guidelines for reducing dangerous carbon pollution from our power plants. This week, we're unveiling these proposed guidelines, which will cut down on the carbon pollution, smog, and soot that threaten the health of the most vulnerable Americans, including children and the elderly. In just the first year that these standards go into effect, up to 100,000 asthma attacks and 2,100 heart attacks will be avoided, and those numbers will go up from there. These standards were created in an open and transparent way, with input from the business community. States and local governments weighed in too. In fact, nearly a dozen States are already implementing their own market-based programs to reduce carbon pollution. And over a thousand mayors have signed agreements to cut their cities' carbon pollution. <p>So the idea of setting higher standards to cut pollution at our power plants is not new. It's just time for Washington to catch up with the rest of the country. Now, special interests and their allies in Congress will claim that these guidelines will kill jobs and crush the economy. Let's face it, that's what they always say. <p>But every time America has set clear rules and better standards for our air, our water, and our children's health, the warnings of the cynics and the naysayers have been wrong. They warned that doing something about the smog choking our cities and acid rain poisoning our lakes would kill business. It didn't. Our air got cleaner, acid rain was cut dramatically, and our economy kept growing. <p>These excuses for inaction somehow suggest a lack of faith in American businesses and American ingenuity. The truth is, when we ask our workers and businesses to innovate, they do. When we raise the bar, they meet it. When we restricted cancer-causing chemicals in plastics and leaded fuel in our cars, American chemists came up with better substitutes. When we phased out the gases that depleted the ozone layer, American workers built better refrigerators and air conditioners. The fuel standards we put in place a few years ago didn't cripple automakers; the American auto industry retooled, and today, they're selling the best cars in the world, with more hybrids, plug-in, and fuel-efficient models to choose from than ever before. <p>In America, we don't have to choose between the health of our economy and the health of our children. The old rules may say we can't protect our environment and promote economic growth at the same time, but in America, we've always used new technology to break the old rules. <p>As President and as a parent, I refuse to condemn our children to a planet that's beyond fixing. The shift to a cleaner energy economy won't happen overnight, and it will require tough choices along the way. But a low-carbon, clean energy economy can be an engine of growth for decades to come. America will build that engine. America will build the future: a future that's cleaner, more prosperous, and full of good jobs; a future where we can look our kids in the eye and tell them we did our part to leave them a safer, more stable world. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"127" "\"<i>The President.</i> Good afternoon, everybody. This morning I called Bob and Jani Bergdahl and told them that after nearly 5 years in captivity, their son Bowe is coming home. <p>Sergeant Bergdahl has missed birthdays and holidays and the simple moments with family and friends, which all of us take for granted. But while Bowe was gone, he was never forgotten. His parents thought about him and prayed for him every single day, as did his sister Sky, who prayed for his safe return. <p>He wasn't forgotten by his community in Idaho or the military, which rallied to support the Bergdahls through thick and thin. And he wasn't forgotten by his country, because the United States of America does not ever leave our men and women in uniform behind. <p>As Commander in Chief, I am proud of the servicemembers who recovered Sergeant Bergdahl and brought him safely out of harm's way. As usual, they performed with extraordinary courage and professionalism, and they have made their Nation proud. <p>Right now our top priority is making sure that Bowe gets the care and support that he needs and that he can be reunited with his family as soon as possible. <p>I'm also grateful for the tireless work of our diplomats and for the cooperation of the government of Qatar in helping to secure Bowe's release. We've worked for several years to achieve this goal, and earlier this week I was able to personally thank the Amir of Qatar for his leadership in helping us get it done. As part of this effort, the United States is transferring five detainees from the prison in Guantanamo Bay to Qatar. The Qatari Government has given us assurances that it will put in place measures to protect our national security. <p>I also want to express gratitude to the Afghan Government, which has always supported our efforts to secure Bowe's release. Going forward, the United States will continue to support an Afghan-led process of reconciliation, which could help secure a hard-earned peace within a sovereign and unified Afghanistan. <p>As I said earlier this week, we're committed to winding down the war in Afghanistan, and we are committed to closing Gitmo. But we also made an ironclad commitment to bring our prisoners of war home. That's who we are as Americans. It's a profound obligation within our military, and today, at least in this instance, it's a promise we've been able to keep. <p>I am mindful, though, that there are many troops who remained missing in the past. That's why we're never going to forget; we're never going to give up our search for servicemembers who remain unaccounted for. We also remain deeply committed to securing the release of American citizens who are unjustly detained abroad and deserve to be reunited with their families, just like the Bergdahls soon will be. <p>Bob and Jani, today families across America share in the joy that I know you feel. As a parent, I can't imagine the hardship that you guys have gone through. As President, I know that I speak for all Americans when I say we cannot wait for the moment when you are reunited and your son Bowe is back in your arms. So with that, I'd like Bob to have an opportunity to say something, and Jani, if she'd like, as well. Please. <p><i>Jani Bergdahl.</i> I just want to say thank you to everyone who has supported Bowe. He's had a wonderful team everywhere. We will continue to stay strong for Bowe while he recovers. Thank you. <p><i>Robert Bergdahl.</i> I'd like to say to Bowe right now, who is having trouble speaking English&mdash;&mdash; <p>[<i>At this point, Mr. Bergdahl spoke briefly in Pashto, and no translation was provided. He then continued in English as follows.</i>] <p><i>Mr. Bergdahl.</i> I'm your father, Bowe. <p>To the people of Afghanistan, the same. Khalifa Al Thani, the complicated nature of this recovery was&mdash;will never really be comprehended. To each and every single one who effected this, in this country, in the service branches, at the State Department, throughout the whole of American Government, and around the world&mdash;international governments around the world, thank you so much. We just can't communicate the words this morning when we heard from the President. <p>So we looked forward to continuing the recovery of our son, which is going to be a considerable task for our family. And we hope that the media will understand that that will keep us very preoccupied in the coming days and weeks as he gets back home to the United States. <p>Thank you all for being here very much.\" "
"128" "\"Thanks, Gina. And thanks to all the folks at EPA who worked so hard to put this plan forward. I want to thank everybody who is on the call. We're going to be talking about carbon pollution and the standards that we proposed this morning. <p>I think a lot of people are aware of the climate action plan that I put forward last year based on what we know, which is that climate change is real. It has impacts not just in a distant future. It has serious impacts, as we speak. And what the EPA and Gina has been able to put forward, based on conversations they've had with a wide range of stakeholders from businesses to workers to many of the health organizations that are on the phone today, what she's been able to do with her team is to craft a sensible, State-based plan that provides States a wide range of options in terms of achieving their goals, but makes sure that we are reducing the carbon pollution that hurts the health of our kids and the health of the planet, while also giving us enormous opportunities to grow and improve the economy in all sorts of ways. <p>Now, up until now, there have been no national limits on the amount of carbon pollution that existing power plants can pump into the air. In contrast, we limit the amount of toxic chemicals like mercury and sulfur and arsenic that power plants put into our air and water. And the essence of the plan that the EPA is presenting makes sure that we're finally doing the same with carbon. <p>Since carbon emissions are a major contributor to climate change and since power plants are responsible for about 40 percent of America's carbon pollution, these new standards are going to help us leave our children a safer and more stable world. <p>And since air pollution from power plants actually worsens asthma and other breathing problems, putting these guidelines in place will help protect the health of vulnerable Americans, including children and the elderly. <p>And I just want to give one example. I got a letter from Dian Coleman, who is a mother of four. Her three kids have asthma. Her daughter has a congenital health defect. She keeps her home free of dust that can trigger asthma attacks. Cigarettes aren't allowed across the threshold of her home. But despite all that, she can't control the pollution that contributes potentially to her kids' illnesses, as well as threatening the planet. We've got to make sure that we're doing something on behalf of Dian and doing it in a way that allows us also to grow the economy and get at the forefront of our clean energy future. <p>And the health issues that we're talking about hit some communities particularly hard. African American children are twice as likely to be hospitalized for asthma, four times as likely to die from asthma. Latinos are 30 percent more likely to be hospitalized for asthma. So these proposed standards will help us meet that challenge head on. It sets carbon targets, give States and regions the flexibility to meet them, using the mix of energy resources that work best for them, whether it's natural gas or cleaner coal or solar or wind or hydropower or geothermal or nuclear. And it provides a huge incentive for the States and consumers to become more energy efficient. As a result, your electricity bills will shrink as these standards spur investment in energy efficiency, cutting waste. And ultimately, we're going to be saving money for homes and for businesses. <p>Now, I promise you, you will hear from critics who say the same thing they always say: that these guidelines will kill jobs or crush the economy. What we've seen every time is that these claims are debunked when you actually give workers and businesses the tools and the incentive they need to innovate. When Americans are called on to innovate, that's what we do, whether it's making more fuel-efficient cars or more fuel-efficient appliances or making sure that we are putting in place the kinds of equipment that prevents harm to the ozone layer and eliminates acid rain. At every one of these steps, there have been folks who have said it can't be done. There have been naysayers who said this is going to destroy jobs and destroy industry. <p>And it doesn't happen because once we have a clear target to meet, we typically meet it. And we find the best ways to do it. <p>And by the way, the idea of setting higher standards to cut carbon is not new. A lot of companies are already moving to lower carbon energy sources. You've got more than a dozen States that are already implementing market-based programs to reduce carbon pollution. Over a thousand mayors have agreed to cut their cities' carbon emissions. <p>Today, carbon emissions are at the lowest they've been in about 20 years. And that's a good start. But it's just not good enough when you look at the projections of where we're going. And for the sake of our children, we're going to have to do more. In America, we do not have to choose between the health of our economy and the health of our kids. We can do both. <p>And you should expect that there's going to be a heated debate in Washington. There's going to be a lot of efforts to put out misinformation and to try to make sure that spin overwhelms substance and that PR overwhelms science. But I wanted to call you directly so you guys hear from me directly: This is something that is important for all of us, as parents, as grandparents, as citizens, as folks who care about the health of our families and also want to make sure that future generations are able to enjoy this beautiful blue ball in the middle of space that we're a part of. So I just want you to all join in and work hard to build momentum for these plans because this the right direction to go in and it's going to mean a better future for America. <p>And if we're working together, I guarantee you we can build that cleaner, healthier, and more prosperous future. So thanks very much, everybody. Bye-bye.\" "
"129" "\"Well, thank you very much. Good afternoon. And along with President Komorowski, I'm very pleased to welcome our outstanding allies from across Central and Eastern Europe. We have done this before in Prague and on my last visit to Warsaw. And I want to thank my fellow leaders for being here. <p>As the President indicated, this 25th anniversary of Polish freedom reminds us of the transformations that have taken place all across the region. The countries represented here have all undertaken hard reforms, have built democratic institutions, have delivered greater prosperity for their citizens, and underlying this progress is the security guarantee that comes from NATO membership. We're here today because as NATO allies, we have to stand absolutely united in our article 5 commitments to collective defense. We stand together always. <p>And as I've said throughout the day and previously back home, I continue to believe that NATO is the cornerstone, the foundation, of U.S. security, not just European security. Now, given Russia's actions in Ukraine, NATO has increased its presence across the region, from the Baltics to the Black Sea. I thank our allies for the contributions they're making, and I'll be discussing the initiative that I announced today to bolster the U.S. presence in Europe. <p>A number of countries represented here have already committed to increasing their investments in our collective defense, and today we'll be discussing additional steps that we can take both as individual nations and as an alliance to make sure we have the capabilities that we need. I expect that we'll also have an opportunity to discuss how Europe, especially Central and Eastern Europe, can continue to diversify its energy sources. The United States will be exporting more natural gas to the global market in the years to come. But more immediately, there are steps that we can take together to reduce energy risk, upgrade our energy infrastructure, and improve efficiency. <p>So again, I want to thank our fellow leaders for being here today. I think our presence sends a powerful message that as NATO allies, we stand as one. Citizens across Central and Eastern Europe need to know that what you've built over the last 25 years no other nation can take away. <p>So I again thank you, President Komorowski, for your hospitality. And I think once the press clears the room, we can get the meeting started.\" "
"130" "\"Hello, Warsaw! <i>Witaj, Polsko!</i> <p>Mr. President; Mr. Prime Minister; Madam Mayor; heads of state and government, past and present, including the man who jumped that shipyard wall to lead a strike that became a movement, the prisoner-turned-President who transformed this nation&mdash;thank you, Lech Walesa, for your outstanding leadership. <p>Distinguished guests, people of Poland, thank you for your extraordinary welcome and for the privilege of joining you here today. I bring with me the greetings and friendship of the American people and of my hometown of Chicago, home to so many proud Polish Americans. In Chicago, we think of ourselves as a little piece of Poland. In some neighborhoods, you only hear Polish. The faithful come together at churches like Saint Stanislaus Kostka. We have a parade for Polish Constitution Day. And every summer, we celebrate the Taste of Polonia, with our kielbasa and pierogies, and we're all a little bit Polish for that day. So being here with you, it feels like home. <p>Now, 25 years ago today, we witnessed a scene that had once seemed impossible: an election where, for the first time, the people of this nation had a choice. The Communist regime thought an election would validate their rule or weaken the opposition. Instead, Poles turned out in the millions. And when the votes were counted, it was a landslide victory for freedom. One woman who voted that day said: \\"There is a sense that something is beginning to happen in Poland. We feel the taste of Poland again.\\" And she was right. It was the beginning of the end of communism, not just in this country, but across Europe. <p>And the images of that year are seared in our collective memory: citizens filling the streets of Budapest and Bucharest, Hungarians and Austrians cutting the barbed wire border, protestors joining hands across the Baltics, Czechs and Slovaks in their Velvet Revolution; East Berliners climbing atop that wall. And we have seen the extraordinary progress since that time: a united Germany; nations in Central and Eastern Europe standing tall as proud democracies; a Europe that is more integrated, more prosperous, and more secure. We must never forget that the spark for so much of this revolutionary change, for this blossoming of hope was lit by you, the people of Poland. <p>History was made here. But the victory of 1989 was not inevitable. It was the culmination of centuries of Polish struggle, at times in this very square: the generations of Poles who rose up and finally won independence; the soldiers who resisted invasion, from the east and the west; the Righteous Among the Nations&mdash;among them Jan Karski&mdash;who risked all to save the innocent from the Holocaust; the heroes of the Warsaw Ghetto who refused to go without a fight; the Free Poles at Normandy; and the Poles of the Home Army, who, even as this city was reduced to rubble, waged a heroic uprising. <p>We remember how, when an Iron Curtain descended, you never accepted your fate. When the&mdash;when a son of Poland ascended to the Chair of Saint Peter, he returned home, and here, in Warsaw, he inspired a nation with his words: \\"There can be no just Europe without the independence of Poland.\\" And today we give thanks for the courage of the Catholic Church and the fearless spirit of Saint John Paul II. We also recall how you prevailed 25 years ago. In the face of beatings and bullets, you never wavered from the moral force of nonviolence. Through the darkness of martial law, Poles lit candles in their windows. When the regime finally agreed to talk, you embraced dialogue. When they held those elections&mdash;even though not fully free&mdash;you participated. As one Solidarity leader said at the time, \\"We decided to accept what was possible.\\" And so Poland reminds us that sometimes the smallest steps, however imperfect, can ultimately tear down walls, can ultimately transform the world. <p>And of course, your victory that June day was only the beginning. As your President just indicated, democracy is more than just elections. True democracy, real prosperity, lasting security&mdash;these are neither simply given, nor imposed from the outside. They must be earned and built from within. And in that age-old contest of ideas between freedom and authoritarianism, between liberty and oppression, between solidarity and intolerance, Poland's progress shows the enduring strength of the ideals that we cherish as a free people. <p>Here we see the strength of democracy: citizens raising their voices, free from fear. Here we see political parties competing in open and honest elections. Here we see independent judiciary working to uphold the rule of law. Here in Poland, we see a vibrant press and a growing civil society that holds leaders accountable, because governments exist to lift up their people, not to hold them down. <p>Here we see the strength of free markets and the results of hard reforms: gleaming skyscrapers soaring above this city and superhighways across this country, high-tech hubs, and living standards that previous generations of Poles could only imagine. This is the new Poland you have built, an economic \\"Miracle on the Vistula\\"&mdash;<i>Cud nad Wis</i><i>& 322;&"
"131" "\"President Hollande, the people of France, friends, family, our veterans: If prayer were made of sound, the skies over England that night would have deafened the world. <p>Captains paced their decks. Pilots tapped their gauges. Commanders pored over maps, fully aware that for all the months of meticulous planning, everything could go wrong: the winds, the tides, the element of surprise, and above all, the audacious bet that what waited on the other side of the Channel would compel men not to shrink away, but to charge ahead. <p>Fresh-faced GIs rubbed trinkets, kissed pictures of sweethearts, checked and rechecked their equipment. \\"God,\\" asked one, \\"give me guts.\\" And in the predawn hours, planes rumbled down runways, gliders and paratroopers slipped through the sky, giant screws began to turn on an armada that looked like more ships than sea. And more than 150,000 souls set off towards this tiny sliver of sand upon which hung more than the fate of a war, but rather the course of human history. <p>President Hollande, distinguished guests: I'm honored to return here today to pay tribute to the men and women of a generation who defied every danger, among them, our veterans of D-day. And, gentlemen, we are truly humbled by your presence here today. <p>Just last week, I received a letter from a French citizen. \\"Dear Mr. President and the American people,\\" he wrote, \\"[we are] honored to welcome you . . . to thank you again for all the pain and efforts of [the] American people and others in our common struggle for freedom.\\" <p>Today we say the same to the people of France. Thank you, especially for the generosity that you've shown the Americans who've come here over the generations&mdash;to these beaches and to this sacred place of rest for 9,387 Americans. At the end of the war, when our ships set off for America, filled with our fallen, tens of thousands of liberated Europeans turned out to say farewell, and they pledged to take care of the more than 60,000 Americans who would remain in cemeteries on this continent. In the words of one man, we will take care of the fallen \\"as if their tombs were our children's.\\" And, the people of France, you have kept your word like the true friends you are. We are forever grateful. <p>Here, we don't just commemorate victory, as proud of that victory as we are. We don't just honor sacrifice, as grateful as the world is. We come to remember why America and our allies gave so much for the survival of liberty at this moment of maximum peril. We come to tell the story of the men and women who did it so that it remains seared into the memory of a future world. <p>We tell this story for the old soldiers who pull themselves a little straighter today to salute brothers who never made it home. We tell the story for the daughter who clutches a faded photo of her father, forever young; for the child who runs his fingers over colorful ribbons he knows signify something of great consequence, even if he doesn't yet fully understand why. We tell this story to bear what witness we can to what happened when the boys from America reached Omaha Beach. By daybreak, blood soaked the water, bombs broke the sky. Thousands of paratroopers had dropped into the wrong landing sites; thousands of rounds bit into flesh and sand. Entire companies' worth of men fell in minutes. \\"Hell's Beach\\" had earned its name. <p>By 8:30 a.m., General Omar Bradley expected our troops to be a mile inland. \\"Six hours after the landings,\\" he wrote, \\"we held only ten yards of beach.\\" In this age of instant commentary, the invasion would have swiftly and roundly been declared, as it was by one officer, \\"a debacle.\\" <p>But such a race to judgment would not have taken into account the courage of free men. \\"Success may not come with rushing speed,\\" President Roosevelt would say that night, \\"but we shall return again and again.\\" And paratroopers fought through the countryside to find one another. Rangers pulled themselves over those cliffs to silence Nazi guns. To the west, Americans took Utah Beach with relative ease. To the east, the British tore through the coast, fueled by the fury of 5 years of bombs over London and a solemn vow to \\"fight them on the beaches.\\" The Canadians, whose shores had not been touched by war, drove far into France. And here at Omaha, troops who finally made it to the seawall used it as shelter, where a general barked, \\"If you're Rangers . . . lead the way!\\" <p>By the end of that longest day, this beach had been fought, lost, refought, and won, a piece of Europe once again liberated and free. Hitler's Wall was breached, letting loose Patton's Army to pour into France. Within a week, the world's bloodiest beach had become the world's busiest port. Within a month, 1 million Allied troops thundered through Normandy into Europe, and as our armies marched across the continent, one pilot said it looked \\"as if the very crust of the Earth had shaken loose.\\" The Arc de Triomphe lit up for the first time in years, and Paris was punctuated by shouts of \\"<i>Vive la France!</i>\\" and \\"<i>Vive les &Eacute;tats-Unis!</i>\\" <p>Of course, even as we gather here at Normandy, we remember that freedom's victory was also made possible by so many others who wore America's uniform. Two years before he commanded armies, Eisenhower's troops sliced through North Africa. Three times before D-day, our GIs stormed the beaches at Sicily, Salerno, Anzio. Divisions like the Fighting 36th brawled their way through Italy, fighting through the mud for months, marching through towns past waving children before opening the gates to Rome. As the \\"dogfaces\\" marched to victory in Europe, the Devil Dogs&mdash;the Marines&mdash;clawed their way from island to island in the Pacific, in some of the war's fiercest fighting. And back home, an army of women&mdash;including my grandmother&mdash;rolled up their sleeves to help build a mighty arsenal of democracy. <p>But it was here, on these shores, that the tide was turned in that common struggle for freedom. What more powerful manifestation of America's commitment to human freedom than the sight of wave after wave after wave of young men boarding those boats to liberate people they had never met? <p>We say it now as if it couldn't be any other way. But in the annals of history, the world had never seen anything like it. And when the war was won, we claimed no spoils of victory. We helped Europe rebuild. We claimed no land other than the earth where we buried those who gave their lives under our flag and where we station those who still serve under it. But America's claim&mdash;our commitment&mdash;to liberty, our claim to equality, our claim to freedom and to the inherent dignity of every human being, that claim is written in the blood on these beaches, and it will endure for eternity. <p>Omaha, Normandy, this was democracy's beachhead. And our victory in that war decided not just a century, but shaped the security and well-being of all posterity. We worked to turn old adversaries into new allies. We built new prosperity. We stood once more with the people of this continent through a long twilight struggle until finally, a wall tumbled down and an Iron Curtain too. And from Western Europe to East, from South America to Southeast Asia, 70 years of democratic movement spread. And nations that once knew only the blinders of fear began to taste the blessings of freedom. <p>None of that would have happened without the men who were willing to lay down their lives for people they'd never met and ideals they couldn't live without. None of it would have happened without the troops President Roosevelt called \\"the life-blood of America . . . the hope of the world.\\" <p>They left home barely more than boys and returned home heroes. But to their great credit, that is not how this generation carried itself. After the war, some put away their medals, were quiet about their service, moved on. Some, carrying shrapnel and scars, found that moving on was much harder. Many, like my grandfather, who served in Patton's army, lived a quiet life, trading one uniform and set of responsibilities for another, as a teacher or a salesman or a doctor or an engineer, a dad, a grandpa. <p>Our country made sure millions of them earned a college education, opening up opportunity on an unprecedented scale. And they married those sweethearts and bought new homes and raised families and built businesses, lifting up the greatest middle class the world has ever known. And through it all, they were inspired, I suspect, by memories of fallen brothers, memories that drove them to live their lives each day as best they possibly could. <p>Whenever the world makes you cynical, stop and think of these men. Whenever you lose hope, stop and think of these men. Think of Wilson Colwell, who was told he couldn't pilot a plane without a high school degree, so he decided to jump out of a plane instead. And he did, here on D-day, with the 101st Airborne, when he was just 16 years old. <p>Think of Harry Kulkowitz, the Jewish son of Russian immigrants, who fudged his age at enlistment so he could join his friends in the fight. And don't worry, Harry, the statute of limitations has expired. [<i>Laughter</i>] Harry came ashore at Utah Beach on D-day. And now that he's come back, we said he could have anything he wants for lunch today&mdash;he helped liberate this coast, after all. But he said a hamburger would do fine. [<i>Laughter</i>] What's more American than that? <p>Think of Rock Merritt, who saw a recruitment poster asking him if he was a man enough to be a paratrooper, so he signed up on the spot. And that decision landed him here on D-day with the 508th Regiment, a unit that would suffer heavy casualties. And 70 years later, it's said that all across Fort Bragg, they know Rock, not just for his exploits on D-day or his 35 years in the Army, but because 91-year-old Rock Merritt still spends his time speaking to the young men and women of today's Army and still bleeds \\"O.D. Green\\" for his 82nd Airborne. <p>Whenever the world makes you cynical, whenever you doubt that courage and goodness is possible, stop and think of these men. <p>Wilson and Harry and Rock, they are here today, and although I know we already gave them a rousing round of applause, along with all our veterans of D-day, if you can stand, please stand; if not, please raise your hand. Let us recognize your service once more. These men waged war so that we might know peace. They sacrificed so that we might be free. They fought in hopes of a day when we'd no longer need to fight. We are grateful to them. And, gentlemen, gentlemen, I want each of you to know that your legacy is in good hands. For in a time when it has never been more tempting to pursue narrow self-interest, to slough off common endeavor, this generation of Americans, a new generation&mdash;our men and women of war&mdash;have chosen to do their part as well. <p>Rock, I want you to know that Staff Sergeant Melvin Cedillo-Martin, who's here today, is following in your footsteps. He just had to become an American first, because Melvin was born in Honduras, moved to the United States, joined the Army. After tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, he was reassigned to the 82d Airborne. And Sunday, he'll parachute into Normandy. \\"I became part of a family of real American heroes,\\" he said. \\"The paratroopers of the 82d.\\" <p>Wilson, you should know that Specialist Jannise Rodriguez joined the Army not even 2 years ago, was assigned to the 101st Airborne, and just last month earned the title of the 101st Airborne Division Air Assault Soldier of the Year. And that's inspiring, but not surprising, when the women of today's military have taken on responsibilities, including combat, like never before. <p>I want each of you to know that their commitment to their fellow servicemembers and veterans endures. Sergeant First Class Brian Hawthorne's grandfather served under General Patton and General MacArthur. Brian himself served two tours in Iraq, earned the Bronze Star in Baghdad for saving the life of his best friend, and today, he and his wife use their experience to help other veterans and military families navigate theirs. And Brian is here in Normandy to participate in Sunday's jump, and here, just yesterday, he reenlisted in the Army Reserve. <p>And this generation&mdash;this 9/11 generation of servicemembers&mdash;they, too, felt something. They answered some call; they said \\"I will go.\\" They, too, chose to serve a cause that's greater than self, many even after they knew they'd be sent into harm's way. And for more than a decade, they have endured tour after tour. <p>Sergeant First Class Cory Remsburg has served ten. And I've told Cory's incredible story before, most recently when he sat with my wife Michelle at the State of the Union Address. It was here, at Omaha Beach, on the 65th anniversary of D-day, where I first met Cory and his fellow Army Rangers, right after they made their own jump into Normandy. The next time I saw him, he was in the hospital, unable to speak or walk after an IED nearly killed him in Afghanistan. But over the past 5 years, Cory has grown stronger, learning to speak again and stand again and walk again. And earlier this year, he jumped out of a plane again. And the first words Cory said to me after his accident echoed those words first shouted all those years ago on this beach: \\"Rangers, lead the way.\\" <p>So Cory has come back today, along with Melvin and Jannise and Brian and many of their fellow Active Duty servicemembers. We thank them for their service. They are a reminder that the tradition represented by these gentlemen continues. <p>We are on this Earth for only a moment in time. And fewer of us have parents and grandparents to tell us about what the veterans of D-day did here 70 years ago. As I was landing on Marine One, I told my staff, I don't think there's a time where I miss my grandfather more, where I'd be more happy to have him here, than this day. So we have to tell their stories for them. We have to do our best to uphold in our own lives the values that they were prepared to die for. We have to honor those who carry forward that legacy, recognizing that people cannot live in freedom unless free people are prepared to die for it. And as today's wars come to an end, this generation of service men and women will step out of uniform, and they, too, will build families and lives of their own. They, too, will become leaders in their communities&mdash;in commerce, in industry, and perhaps politics&mdash;the leaders we need for the beachheads of our time. And, God willing, they too, will grow old in the land they helped to keep free. And someday, future generations, whether 70 or 700 years hence, will gather at places like this to honor them and to say that these were generations of men and women who proved once again that the United States of America is and will remain the greatest force for freedom the world has ever known. <p>May God bless our veterans and all who served with them, including those who rest here in eternal peace. And may God bless all who serve today for the peace and security of the world. May God bless the people of France. And may God bless our United States of America.\" "
"132" "\"Hi, everybody. This is commencement season, a time for graduates and their families to celebrate one of the greatest achievements of a young person's life. But for many graduates, it also means feeling trapped by a whole lot of student loan debt. And we've got to do more to lift that burden. <p>See, in a 21st-century economy, the surest pathway into the middle class is some form of higher education. The unemployment rate for workers with a bachelor's degree is just 3.3 percent, about half what it is for high school graduates. A typical graduate of a 4-year college earns $15,000 more per year than someone with just a high school diploma. <p>But at a time when college has never been more important, it's also never been more expensive. That's why, since I took office, I've worked to make college more affordable. We reformed a student loan system that gave away billions of taxpayer dollars to big banks and invested that money where it makes a bigger bang: in helping more young people afford a higher education. <p>But over the past three decades, the average tuition at a public 4-year college has more than tripled. The average undergraduate student who borrows for college now graduates owing almost $30,000. And I've heard from too many young people who are frustrated that they've done everything they were supposed to do and now they're paying the price. <p>I've taken action on my own to offer millions of students the opportunity to cap their monthly student loan payments to 10 percent of their income. But Congress needs to do its part. The good news is that Senate Democrats are working on a bill that would help more young people save money. Just like you can refinance your mortgage at a lower interest rate, this bill would let you refinance your student loans. And we'd pay for it by closing loopholes that allow some millionaires to pay a lower tax rate than the middle class. <p>That's the choice that your representatives in Congress will make in the coming weeks: protect young people from crushing debt or protect tax breaks for millionaires. And while Congress decides what it's going to do, I will keep doing whatever I can without Congress to help responsible young people pay off their loans, including new action I will take this week. <p>This country has always made a commitment to put a good education within the reach of all who are willing to work for it. That's what made us an economic superpower. That's what makes us special. And as long as I hold this office, I'll keep fighting to give more young people the chance to earn their own piece of the American Dream. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"133" "\"Thank you. Everybody, have a seat. Welcome to the White House. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I want to thank Andy for the terrific introduction. And this is commencement season, and it's always a hopeful and exciting time, and I'll bet we might have some folks who just graduated here today. Raise your hands. Let's see&mdash;yes, we've got a couple of folks who are feeling pretty good. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Of course, once the glow wears off, this can be a stressful time for millions of students. And they're asking themselves, how on Earth am I going to pay off all these student loans? And that's what we're here to talk about. And Andy, I think, gave a vivid example of what's going through the minds of so many young people who have the drive and the energy and have succeeded in everything that they do, but because of family circumstances, have found themselves in a situation where they've got significant debt. <p>Now, we know&mdash;all of you know&mdash;that in a 21st-century economy, a higher education is the single best investment that you can make in yourselves and your future, and we've got to make sure that investment pays off. <p>And here's why. For 51 months in a row, our businesses have now created new jobs, 9.4 million new jobs in total. And over the last year, we've averaged around 200,000 new jobs every month. That's the good news. But while those at the top are doing better than ever, average wages have barely budged. And there are too many Americans out there that are working harder and harder just to get by. <p>Everything I do is aimed towards reversing those trends that put a greater burden on the middle class and are diminishing the number of ladders to get into the middle class, because the central tenet of my Presidency, partly because of the story of my life and Michelle's life, is, this is a country where opportunity should be available for anybody: the idea that no matter who you are, what you look like, where you come from, how you were raised, who you love, if you're willing to work hard, if you're willing to live up to your responsibilities, you can make it here in America. <p>And in America, higher education opens the doors of opportunity for all. And it doesn't have to be a 4-year college education. We've got community colleges, we've got technical schools, but we know that some higher education&mdash;some additional skills&mdash;is going to be your surest path to the middle class. The typical American with a bachelor's degree or higher earns over $28,000 more per year than somebody with just a high school education&mdash;28 grand a year. And right now the unemployment rate for workers with a bachelor degree is about half of what it is for folks with just a high school education. <p>So you know that this is a smart investment. Your parents know this is a smart investment. That's why so many of them made such big sacrifices to make sure that you could get into college and nagged&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;you throughout your high school years. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Here's the problem: At a time when higher education's never been more important, it's also never been more expensive. Over the last three decades, the average tuition at a public university has more than tripled at the same time that the typical family's income has gone up just 16 percent. <p>Michelle and I both went to college because of loans and grants and the work that we did. But I'll be honest with you&mdash;now, I'm old, I've got to admit&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but when I got out of school, it took me about a year to pay off my entire undergraduate education. That was it. And I went to a private school; I didn't even go to a public school. So as recently as the seventies, the eighties, when you made a commitment to college, you weren't anticipating that you'd have this massive debt on the back end. <p>Now, when I went to law school, it was a different story. But that made sense because the idea was, if you got a professional degree like a law degree, you would probably be able to pay it off. And so I didn't feel sorry for myself or any lawyers who took on law school debt. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But compare that experience just half a generation, a generation ago, to what kids are going through now. These rising costs have let the middle&mdash;have left middle class families feeling trapped. Let's be honest: Families at the top, they can easily save more than enough money to pay for school out of pocket. Families at the bottom face a lot of obstacles, but they can turn to Federal programs designed to help them handle costs. But you've got a lot of middle class families who can't build up enough savings, don't qualify for support, feel like nobody is looking out for them. And as Andy just described vividly, heaven forbid that the equity in their home gets used up for some other family emergency or, as we saw in 2008, suddenly, home values sink, and then people feel like they're left in the lurch. <p>So I'm only here because this country gave me a chance through education. We are here today because we believe that in America, no hard-working young person should be priced out of a higher education. <p>This country has always made a commitment to put a good education within the reach of young people willing to work for it. I mentioned my generation, but think about my grandfather's generation. I just came back from Normandy, where we celebrated D-day. When that generation of young people came back from World War II, at least the men, my grandfather was able to go to college on the GI bill. And that helped build the greatest middle class the world has ever known. <p>Grants helped my mother raise two kids by herself while she got through school. And she didn't have $75,000 worth of debt, and she was raising two kids at the same time. Neither Michelle or I came from a lot of money, but with hard work and help from scholarships and student loans, we got to go to great schools. We did not have this kind of burden that we're seeing, at least at the undergraduate stages. As I said, because of law school, we only finished paying off our own student loans just 10 years ago. So we know what many of you are going through or look forward to&mdash;or don't look forward to. [<i>Laughter</i>] We&mdash;and we were doing it at the same time we already had to start saving for Malia and Sasha's education. <p>But this is why I feel so strongly about this. This is why I'm passionate about it. That's why we took on a student loan system that basically gave away tens of billions of taxpayer dollars to big banks. We said, let's cut out the middle man. Banks should be making a profit on what they do, but not off the backs of students. We reformed it; more money went directly to students. We expanded grants for low-income students through the Pell grant program. We created a new tuition tax credit for middle class families. We offered millions of young people the chance to cap their student loan payments at 10 percent of their income; that's what Andy was referring to. Michelle right now is working with students to help them \\"Reach Higher\\" and overcome the obstacles that stand between them and graduation. This is something we are deeply invested in. <p>But as long as college costs keep soaring, we can't just keep throwing money at the problem. We're going to have to initiate reforms from the colleges themselves. States have to invest more in higher education. Historically, the reason we had such a great public education system&mdash;public higher education system&mdash;was, States understood we will benefit if we invest in higher education. And somewhere along the line, they started thinking, we've got to invest more in prisons than we do in higher education. And part of the reason that tuition has been jacked up year after year after year is State legislatures are not prioritizing this. They're passing the costs onto taxpayers. It's not sustainable. <p>So that's why I laid out a plan to shake up our higher education system and encourage colleges to finally bring down college costs. And I proposed new rules to make sure for-profit colleges keep their promises and train students with the skills for today's jobs without saddling them with debt. Too many of these for-profit colleges&mdash;some do a fine job, but many of them recruit kids in, the kids don't graduate, but they're left with the debt. And if they do graduate, too often, they don't have the marketable skills they need to get the job that allows them to service the debt. <p>None of these fights have been easy. All of them have been worth it. You've got some outstanding Members of Congress right here who have been fighting right alongside us to make sure that we are giving you a fair shake. And the good news is, more young people are earning college degrees than ever before. And that's something we should be proud of, and that's something we should celebrate. <p>But more of them are graduating with debt. Despite everything we're doing, we're still seeing too big a debt load on too many young people. A large majority of today's college seniors have taken out loans to pay for school. The average borrower at a 4-year college owes nearly $30,000 by graduation day. Americans now owe more on student loans than they do on credit cards. And the outrage here is that they're just doing what they've been told they're supposed to do. I can't tell you how many letters I get from people who say, I did everything I was supposed to, and now I'm finding myself in a situation where I've got debts I can't pay off, and I want to pay them off, and I'm working really hard, but I just can't make ends meet. <p>If somebody plays by the rules, they shouldn't be punished for it. A young woman named Ashley, in Santa Fe, wrote me a letter a few months ago. And Ashley wanted me to know that she's young, she's ambitious, she's proud of the degree she earned. And she said, \\"I am the future\\"&mdash;she put \\"am\\" in capital letters so that I'd know she means business. [<i>Laughter</i>] And she told me that because of her student loan debt, she's worried she'll never be able to buy a car or a house. She wrote, \\"I'm not even 30, and I've given up on my future because I can't afford to have one.\\" Now, I wrote her back and said it's a little early at&mdash;in your twenties to give up. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I'm sure Ashley was trying to make a point, but it's a point that all of us need to pay attention to. In America, no young person who works hard and plays by the rules should feel that way. <p>Now, I've made it clear that I want to work with Congress on this issue. Unfortunately, a generation of young people can't afford to wait for Congress to get going. The Members of Congress who are here are working very hard and putting forward legislation to try to make this stuff happen, but they have not gotten some of the support that they need. In this year of action, wherever I've seen ways I can act on my own to expand opportunity to more Americans, I have. And today I'm going to take three actions to help more young people pay off their student loan debt. <p>Number one, I'm directing our Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, to give more Americans who are already making their loan payments a chance to cap those payments at 10 percent of their income. We call it Pay As You Earn. We know it works, because we've already offered it to millions of young people. It's saving folks like Andy hundreds of dollars, potentially, every month. It's giving graduates the opportunity to pursue the dreams that inspired them to go to school in the first place, and that's good for everybody. And we want more young people to start their own businesses. We want more young people becoming teachers and nurses and social workers. We want young people to be in a position to pursue their dreams. And we want more young people who act responsibly to be able to manage their debt over time. So we're announcing steps that will open up Pay As You Earn to nearly 5 million more Americans. That's the first action we're taking today. <p>The second action is to renegotiate contracts with private companies like Sallie Mae that service our student loans. And we're going to make it clear that these companies are in the business of helping students, not just collecting payments, and they owe young people the customer service and support and financial flexibility that they deserve. That's number two. <p>Number three, we're doing more to help every borrower know all the options that are out there so that they can pick the one that's right for them. So we're going to work with the teachers' associations and the nurses' associations, with business groups, with the YMCA and nonprofits, and companies like TurboTax and H&R Block. And tomorrow I'm going to do a student loan Q&A with Tumblr to help spread the word. [<i>Laughter</i>] You're laughing because you think, what does he know about Tumblr? [<i>Laughter</i>] But you will recall that I have two teenage daughters, so that I am hip to all these things. [<i>Laughter</i>] Plus, I have all these 20-somethings who are working for me all the time. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But to give even more student borrowers the chance to save money requires action from Congress. I'm going to be signing this Executive order. It's going to make progress, but not enough. We need more. We've got to have Congress to make some progress. Now, the good news is, as I said, there are some folks in Congress who want to do it. There are folks here like Jim Clyburn, John Tierney, who are helping lead this fight in the House. We've got Elizabeth Warren, who's leading this fight in the Senate. Elizabeth has written a bill that would let students refinance their loans at today's lower interest rates, just like their parents can refinance a mortgage. It pays for itself by closing loopholes that allow some millionaires to pay a lower tax rate than middle class families. <p>I don't know, by the way, why folks aren't more outraged about this. I'm going to take a pause out of my prepared text. You would think that if somebody like me has done really well in part because the country has invested in them, that they wouldn't mind at least paying the same rate as a teacher or a nurse. There's not a good economic argument for it, that they should pay a lower rate. It's just clout, that's all. So it's bad enough that that's already happening. It would be scandalous if we allowed those kinds of tax loopholes for the very, very fortunate to survive while students are having trouble just getting started in their lives. <p>So you've got a pretty straightforward bill here. And this week, Congress will vote on that bill. And I want Americans to pay attention to see where their lawmakers' priorities lie here: lower tax bills for millionaires or lower student loan bills for the middle class. This should be a no-brainer. You've got a group of far-right Republicans in Congress who push this trickle-down economic plan, telling hard-working students and families, \\"You're on your own.\\" Two years ago, Republicans in Congress nearly let student loan interest rates double for 7 million young people. Last year, they tried to strip protections from lower income students. This year, House Republicans voted overwhelmingly to slash Pell grants and make it harder for thousands of families to afford college. If you're a big oil company, they'll go to bat for you. If you're a student, good luck. <p>Some of these Republicans in Congress seem to believe that it's just because&mdash;that just because some of the young people behind me need some help, that they're not trying hard enough. They don't get it. Maybe they need to talk to Andy. These students worked hard to get where they are today. <p>Shanelle Roberson&mdash;where is Shanelle? Shanelle is the first in her family to graduate from a 4-year college. Shanelle is not asking for a handout; none of these folks are. They're working hard. They're working while they're going to school. They're doing exactly what we told them they should do. But they want a chance. If they do exactly what they're told they should do, that they're not suddenly loaded up where they've got so much debt that they can't buy a house, they can't think about starting a family, they can't imagine starting a business on their own. <p>Now, I've been in politics long enough to hear plenty of people, from both parties, pay lip service to the next generation, and then they abandon them when it counts. And we, the voters, let it happen. This is something that should be really straightforward, just like the minimum wage should be straightforward, just like equal pay for equal work should be straightforward. And one of the things I want all the voters out there to consider, particularly parents who are struggling trying to figure out how am I going to pay my kid's college education, take a look and see, who is it that's fighting for you and your kids, and who is it that's not? Because if there are no consequences, then this kind of irresponsible behavior continues on the part of Members of Congress. <p>So I ran for this office to help more young people go to college, graduate, and pay off their debt. And we've made some really good progress despite the best efforts of some in Congress to block that progress. Think about how much more we could do if they were not standing in the way. <p>This week, they have a chance to help millions of young people. I hope they do. You should let them know you are watching and paying attention to what they do. If they do not look out for you and then throw up a whole bunch of arguments that are meant to obfuscate&mdash;meaning confuse, rather than to clarify and illuminate&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;then you should call them to account. And in the meantime, I'm going to take these actions today on behalf of all these young people here and every striving young American who shares my belief that this is a place where you can still make it if you try. <p>All right, thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America. <p>Why don't you guys come up. We'll sign&mdash;[<i>inaudible</i>]. <p>[<i>At this point, the President signed the memorandum.</i>] <p>All right. There you go. That was quick.\" "
"134" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you, everybody. Everybody, have a seat, have a seat. I've just got a few things to say here. Welcome to the White House, first of all. <p><i>Audience members. </i>Thank you. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> You're pleased to be here, aren't you? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience members. </i>Yes, we are. <p><i>The President.</i> I think we should give it up for the men's and women's national college basketball champions, the Connecticut Huskies! Now, I have to say that, as President, one of my goals has been to eliminate waste and cut out duplicative programs to make things a little more efficient, but this might be carrying things a little too far. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We have, as you might expect, some big Huskies fans here today, including some outstanding Members of Congress. I also want to recognize your university president, Susan Herbst; your athletic director, Warde Manuel; and Larry McHugh, the chairman of your board of trustees. Give them a big round of applause. And of course, you've got a couple of great coaches in what I called when we were meeting back there the grizzled veteran, Geno Auriemma&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and the new blood, Kevin Ollie, both in the house. I can make that joke now that I've got gray hair. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Only once before, in 2004, has one school won both the men's and women's Division I titles. And of course, that was who? <p><i>Audience members.</i> UConn. <p><i>The President.</i> It was UConn. [<i>Laughter</i>] This is the women's ninth national title, more than any other women's basketball team in history. For the men, it is their fourth title in the last 16 years, which is twice as many as anybody else during that same span of time. Which makes me think, what's up with you guys? Why aren't you sharing? [<i>Laughter</i>] It is just a remarkable thing what these two programs have accomplished. <p>Of course, this season the women went a perfect 40-0, won their games by an average of 34 points, so there was not a lot of suspense during their season. [<i>Laughter</i>] In a championship game billed as one of the biggest in women's basketball history, the Huskies routed the previously unbeaten Notre Dame&mdash;and gave me bragging rights. It gave me bragging rights to pick them in my bracket. This was not hard. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, me and 95 percent of the country. And this marked the fifth time that UConn has finished a season as an undefeated national champion. <p>Of course, a lot of this success belongs to Coach Geno, who has cemented his place as not only a legend in women's basketball, but one of the best coaches that we've ever seen at any level and any sport, period. So we are grateful to him. [<i>Applause</i>] Congratulations. <p>But I think Coach Auriemma would be the first to tell you that the credit goes to the players. And these were just some outstanding young ladies. You've got Breanna Stewart, named the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player 2 years in a row. You've got Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, who overcame injury and illness during the season and came up big&mdash;as she is prone to do&mdash;during the tournament. You've got Stefanie Dolson and Bria Hartley, who went on to become top-10 picks in the WNBA draft. <p>And, Stefanie, I did not forget that you challenged me to a dance-off last year. It is going to happen. It is going to happen. [<i>Laughter</i>] Don't think that I&mdash;don't think that you're going to beat me on that. [<i>Laughter</i>] I also told you the&mdash;I also appreciate that you told the world about it after the title game. I have daughters in junior high and high school, and for their sake, I will not be dancing too much while the cameras are around. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, I also have to confess, I did not pick the men to win in my bracket. [<i>Laughter</i>] Of course, neither did anybody else, unless you went to UConn. [<i>Laughter</i>] Look at these guys, they're all raising their hand&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;yes, I went. Come on now, tell the truth. We were not counting on Shabazz Napier leading the way as the tournament's Most Outstanding Player and hitting big shot after big shot and locking down the perimeter defensively. The Huskies also had huge contributions from guys like Ryan Boatright, DeAndre Daniels, and Niels Giffey, who's not here because he's playing overseas. <p>After the tournament wins over Villanova, Iowa State, Michigan State, Florida, Kentucky, UConn became the first seven-seed ever to win the title. And afterwards, Coach Ollie said: \\"Somebody told me we were Cinderellas, and I said, 'No, we're UConn. That's what we do, bred to cut down nets.'\\" And that's Coach Ollie. He's always confident and calm and collected. In fact, a sportswriter once referred to him as \\"our future President.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] I don't know with a name like Kevin whether that's possible. [<i>Laughter</i>] But who knows, anything could happen. <p>Now, Coach Ollie is doing one other important thing. He's making sure his team hits the books as hard as they hit the boards. And this season, both the men and the women ranked among the Nation's best academically, and that's worth applauding. <p>Both teams have also done tremendous work in the community. They've raised awareness for cancer and autism. They've volunteered at senior centers, spent time with underprivileged youth. Coach Ollie and Coach Auriemma spoke at the Pentagon last month as part of our Hoops for Troops program. And last year, after the tragedy in Newtown, the men put on a clinic for kids at a local rec center, and they asked the media to keep it under wraps so the kids could just have a good time. <p>Finally, I want to take a moment to single out the women here, because I could not be more proud of the example that they present for my daughters. They're showing that just like the boys, girls can be tough, athletic, beautiful, successful, competitive, and make fun of me, which is what my daughters do all the time. [<i>Laughter</i>] So thank you guys for the outstanding example. <p>Congratulations to your championship Huskies. And this really isn't goodbye probably, because I suspect I'll see some of these folks again before I leave office. So let's strike the podium. We'll take some good pictures. Come on. And I know we've got some jersey presentations here. Where's my jersey? [<i>Laughter</i>] Come on!\" "
"135" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you, everybody. Please, have a seat. Have a seat. Thank you. <p>Well, today I am proud to sign two bills into law. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yay! <p><i>The President</i>. Love signing bills. One will support jobs strengthening our national infrastructure; the other honors military heroes from our history. Though they accomplish two very different things, these bills do what we want all our laws to do, and that's serve the American people by honoring our past and building a stronger future. <p>Now, the first bill I'll sign today is the Water Resources Reform and Development Act, also known as WRRDA, which will put Americans to work modernizing our water infrastructure and restoring some of our most vital ecosystems. During my State of the Union Address, I asked Congress to pass this bill by the summer, and I congratulate this outstanding crew for getting it done. <p>Bipartisan negotiators&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. You had bipartisan negotiators&mdash;Senator Barbara Boxer, Senator Dave Vitter, Congressman Shuster, and Congressman Rahall&mdash;they set aside politics, they focused on what was important for the country and what was important for their communities, and as a consequence, we have a piece of legislation that's really going to make a good difference. <p>As more of the world's cargo is transported on these massive ships, we've got to make sure that we've got bridges high enough and ports that are big enough to hold them and accommodate them so that our businesses can keep selling goods made in America to the rest of the world. Meanwhile, many of America's businesses ship their goods across the country by river and by canal, so we've got to make sure that those waterways are in tiptop shape. <p>And this bill gives a green light to 34 water infrastructure projects across the country, including projects to deepen Boston Harbor and the Port of Savannah and to restore the Everglades. And with Congress's authorization, these projects can now move forward. So this bill will help towns and cities improve their commerce, but it's also going to help them prepare for the effects of climate change&mdash;storms, floods, droughts, rising sea levels&mdash;creating more adaptability, more resilience in these communities. <p>Traditionally, investments in our infrastructure have received strong bipartisan support. This hasn't always been true in the last few years. Right now we should be putting a lot more Americans back to work rebuilding our infrastructure. We've got two trillion dollars' worth of deferred maintenance that we could be getting done right now, especially because contractors are coming in under budget and on time. And there are a lot of guys with hard hats sitting at home. <p>So we could really be doing even more. The fact that this bill received some bipartisan support, I think, hopefully, sets a pattern for additional work that we can do on our transportation infrastructure. We need a transportation bill by the end of this summer in order to make sure that projects all across the country don't get shut down. So we're looking forward to seeing this same team work hard on that. <p>I just want to be clear: If Congress fails to act, then Federal funding for transportation projects runs out by the end of the summer. That means more than 100,000 active projects, nearly 700,000 jobs, would be at risk. Fortunately, we've got some leaders here who, I think, can work with us to make sure that doesn't happen. <p>And the good news&mdash;last point I want to make about infrastructure: World-class infrastructure is one of the reasons that America became a global superpower in the first place. And the good thing about infrastructure projects is, they can't be outsourced. American workers have to do the job right here in America. So&mdash;and American companies&mdash;it has huge ripple effects. You need steel, you need concrete, you need engineers, you need architects. You've got folks who have Ph.D.'s and you've got folks who've got high school diplomas who can all benefit from the kinds of infrastructure projects that we've put together. So this should be really a high priority. <p>Now, for the second bill. <p>Shortly after Puerto Rico became part of the United States in 1898, a regiment of Puerto Rican soldiers was formed, and they served our Nation bravely ever since. In World War I, they defended the homeland and patrolled the Panama Canal Zone. In World War II, they fought in Europe. In Korea, they fought in mud and snow. They are the 65th Infantry Regime, U.S. Army. They are also known as the Borinquen&mdash;I've got to get this right&mdash;Borinqueneers. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes! <p><i>The President.</i> See? I practiced before I came out. They are from the Taino name for Puerto Rico. And segregation that set them apart from their fellow soldiers, but their courage made them legendary. <p>They earned thousands of medals for their service in Korea. Today we are going to add to those accolades by awarding these soldiers one of the country's highest civilian honors: the Congressional Gold Medal. <p>One of them, I'm sure, would be very proud to see his son James end up in the White House someday. James Albino has been serving in my administration since 2009, both here in the White House and at the Department of Homeland Security. I know this is a proud day for his family. <p>I want to thank Puerto Rico's Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi, as well as Senator Richard Blumenthal, Senator Marco Rubio, Congressman Bill Posey. They led the efforts to pass this bill. And we are glad that we've got Puerto Rico's Governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, who is here with us today as well. <p>Only a handful of military units have ever received this award, and only one other Hispanic American has received this award, Roberto Clemente. That's pretty good company. So this is a proud day for the Borinqueneers and their families. It's a proud day for all of those whose lives they saved and whose freedom they defended. It's a proud day for all Americans, especially Hispanic Americans, who have made extraordinary contributions to our country, many through their military service. <p>So on behalf of the American people, we want to thank all the Borinqueneers and&mdash;for their extraordinary service. You've earned a hallowed place in our history. And to those members of the 65th Infantry Regiment who are here with us today, I'd ask you to please stand and raise your hand so we can recognize you for your service. <p>All right. Okay. So I'm going to sign these bills. We're going to do the WRRDA first, these are the water folks. [<i>Laughter</i>] Then we're going to&mdash;then we're going to get our infantry up here. All right? <p><i>Audience member.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> There you go.\" "
"136" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you! Please, everybody, be seated. Well, good afternoon. It is great to be back in Massachusetts, and it is great to be here at Worcester Tech! <p>I want to thank Reggie for that outstanding introduction. I want to thank Naomi for those inspiring words. I want to thank your outstanding, fabulous principal, Sheila Harrity, who has done so much to make this school a success. Let me just say, when you're the National High School Principal of the Year, you're doing something right. There are a lot of principals out there, and we could not be prouder of what she's doing. <p>I want to thank your mayor, Joseph Petty; your outstanding Governor and a great friend of mine, Deval Patrick; wonderful Congressman, Jim McGovern. And most of all, I want to thank the class of 2014. Thank you for allowing me to be part of your special day. And you all look great. And I want to thank all the parents and all the grandparents and the family and the friends. This is your day too. Part of the reason I'm here is because I've got to practice, because Malia is graduating in 2 years. So I'm trying to get used to not choking up and crying and embarrassing her. So this is sort of my trial runs here. <p>I have to say, I do not remember my high school graduation speaker. I have no idea who it was. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm sure I was thinking about the party after graduation. I don't remember the party either. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm just telling the truth here. You will remember the speaker at this graduation because there's a lot of Secret Service around, not because of anything that I say that's so inspiring. <p>But I know this day has been long time coming. Together, you made it through freshman initiation. You survived Mr. O'Connor's English class, which I understand is pretty tough. Everybody has got to have, like, a Mr. O'Connor in their life just to, kind of, straighten you out. And now it's the big day, although I notice that none of you are wearing your IDs. Rumor has it, some of you haven't been wearing them for years. [<i>Laughter</i>] Today I'm exercising my power as President and granting an official pardon for all of you who did not follow the rules there. I consider it my graduation gift to you. <p>I know a lot of folks watching at home today will see all of you in your caps and your gowns. And you'll think, well, maybe this is just another class of graduates at another American high school. But I'm here today because there is nothing ordinary about Worcester Tech or the class of 2014. You have set yourselves apart. This high school has set itself apart. <p>Over the past 4 years, some of you have learned how to take apart an engine and put it back together again. Some of you have learned how to run a restaurant or build a house or fix a computer. And all of you are graduating today not just with a great education, but with the skills that will let you start your careers and skills that will make America stronger. <p>Together, you're an example of what's possible when we stop just talking about giving young people opportunity, when we don't just give lip service to helping you compete in the global economy, we actually start doing it. That's what's happening right here in Worcester. And that's why I'm here today. I mean, I like all of you, and I'm glad to be with you, but the thing I really want to do is make sure that what we've learned here at this high school we can lift up for the entire Nation. I want the Nation to learn from Worcester Tech. <p>Of course, your journey is just beginning. Take a look around at all the smiles from the parents and the grandparents and all the family members. Everything your families have done has been so that you could pursue your dreams, so that you could fulfill your potential. Everybody here has a story of some sacrifice that's been made on your behalf. And whether you're heading to college or the military or starting your career, you're not going to be able to take them with you now. Some of your moms and dads probably wish they could hang onto you a little bit longer. [<i>Laughter</i>] Some of you, maybe they're ready to get rid of you. [<i>Laughter</i>] Regardless, though, you are now entering into a stage where it's up to you. And what you can do is remember some of the lessons that you've learned here and carry them with you, wherever you're going. <p>And I want to talk about three of those lessons, a couple of which have already been mentioned by the previous speakers. <p>First of all, I want you to remember that each of us is only here because somebody somewhere invested in our success. Somebody invested in us. I know that's true for me. I was raised by a single mom with the help of my grandparents. We didn't have a lot of money growing up. At times, we struggled. When my mom was going to school at the same time as she was raising my sister and me, we had to scrape to get by. <p>But we had a family who loved me and my sister. And I had teachers who cared about me. And ultimately, with the help of a community and a country that supported me, I was able to get a good education. And I was able to get grants and student loans, and opportunities opened up. And all of this happened because people saw something in me that I didn't always see in myself. And that's not just true for me, that's true for Michelle, who grew up the daughter of a blue-collar worker and a mom who stayed at home and then became a secretary, never went to college themselves. <p>That's true for Deval, who grew up initially on the South Side of Chicago and didn't have a lot, and somebody reached out and gave him a hand up. <p>It's true of this city. This is a town that's always been home to smart people with big ideas. The mayor mentioned Robert Goddard, the father of the modern rocket. He was born here, performed some of the earliest tests on rocketry. <p>But Worcester has also prepared its workers for the jobs that those big ideas would bring. And that's why they opened a technical school here more than a century ago, with a class of 29 ironworkers and 23 woodworkers. And that school became Worcester Tech. <p>Along the way, the economy changed. Innovation made it possible for businesses to do more with less. The Internet meant those companies could do it anywhere. Schools like this were finding it harder to prepare students with the skills that businesses were looking for. <p>And then a guy named Ted Coghlin came along. And Ted is known as the godfather of Worcester Tech, because about 10 years ago, he set out to make this school what he knew it could be: a place where businesses train new workers and young people get the keys to a brighter future. <p>And he put his heart and soul into it. And eventually, that's what happened. Ted helped raise money for a new building, and the State and Federal government chipped in as well. And businesses helped create everything from an auto service center to a bank right inside the school. And top-notch teachers got on board, led by Principal Harrity and the assistant principals here and an outstanding superintendent. And before long, Worcester Tech was on its way to becoming one of the best schools in this city. <p>And today, so many students want to come to Worcester Tech that there's a waiting list more than 400 names long. The number of students scoring \\"proficient\\" or \\"advanced\\" in math has gone up 100 percent; in English more than 200 percent. Ninety-five percent of students now graduate in 4 years. <p>And just as impressive, many of you are leaving here with more than a diploma. You're already certified as nursing assistants and EMTs and home health aides and preparing to become IT associates. And with the credits that you've earned, some of you are already on your way to a college diploma. And as Ted said, \\"Our students deserve the best so we can help them become the best, for their future and ours.\\" <p>The point is, a lot of people made an investment in you. I can't imagine a better investment. But as you experience your success and as you experience setbacks, you need to remember everything that's been put into making sure that you had opportunity. Which brings me to the second thing I hope you remember when you leave here: You're going to also have to give back. This community invested in you. You've got to make sure that you use those gifts. <p>When my Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, came to Worcester Tech earlier this year, he said he had never seen a school more open. If you live near the school, you can come in and get your car detailed for a fraction of what it would cost somebody someplace else. So I'm giving a little free advertising to the detailing operation here. [<i>Laughter</i>] You can eat a meal cooked by students in the culinary arts program. One teacher called the hair salon the \\"city's best kept secret.\\" Your veterinary clinic cares for about 250 pets a month, so I could have brought Bo and Sunny here. [<i>Laughter</i>] You guys would have taken care of them. <p>So Worcester Tech isn't separate from the broader community. You're a vital part of the community. So part of what you've learned here is that we are at our best, we are strongest when we are working together and when we're looking out for one another and we have responsibilities towards each other and all of us have contributions to make. You're giving back to folks who gave you so much. And whatever you do next, I hope you keep giving back. That may mean staying in Worcester and working for one of the companies that helped train you. If it means going to college or the military or using your skills to help more students get the same opportunities that you've had here, no matter what it is that you do, no matter what path you take, I want to make sure that you understand the incredible leadership that we now expect from you. <p>I understand that every year at exam time, you hear from a motivational speaker. And one of them this year was Colin Powell, because when you're getting ready to take a test, it never hurts to get a pep talk from a general. [<i>Laughter</i>] But the best part is that you decide to do the same thing for younger kids. So this class&mdash;those of you in the National Honor Society&mdash;rolled out the red carpet for students at nearby Chandler Elementary. And so those younger kids left here feeling fired up, inspired by your example, looking up to you, imagining that they could do what you did. And they're going to keep on looking up to you. <p>And there are going to be people across the country who are watching you. And when they see you succeed, when they see you working hard, when they see you overcoming setbacks, that's going to inspire them as well. And that brings me to my final point, which is, I hope you leave here today believing that if you can make it, then there shouldn't be any kid out here who can't make it. Every child in America, no matter what they look like or where they grow up, what their last name is, there's so much talent out there. And every single child&mdash;as Ted understood when he helped transform this school&mdash;every single child should have the opportunity like you have had to go as far as your talents and hard work will take you. I've seen you do it, so we know it's possible. <p>Now, it's a challenging time. I think sometimes, I worry that your generation has grown up in a cynical time: in the aftermath of a great recession, in the aftermath of two wars. We live in a culture that so often focuses on conflict and controversy and looks at the glass half empty instead of half full. And you're graduating at a time when you'll no longer be competing just with people across town for good jobs, you're going to be competing with the rest of the world. <p>But when I meet young people like you, I am absolutely certain, we are not just going to outcompete the rest of the world, we are going to win because of you. Because we are Americans, that's what we do. We don't settle. We outwork, we out innovate, we outhustle the competition. And when we do, nobody can beat us. <p>And that's what you've shown at this school, not just helping a few kids go as far as their hard work will take them. I want all of you to be part of the process of helping all our young people achieve their God-given potential. And as President, my job is to make sure every child in America gets that chance. And Deval Patrick's job is to make sure that everybody in the Commonwealth gets that chance. And the mayor, his focus is making sure everybody in this town gets that chance. Every community is different. But if Worcester can bring teachers and business and entire communities together for the sake of our young people, then other places can too. <p>And that's why I've challenged high schools all across the country to do what you're doing here: better prepare students for the demands of the global economy. We're getting started this year with a competition that pairs schools and employers and colleges to combine quality education with real-world skills. <p>As part of that initiative, I launched something called ConnectED, working with the private sector to connect America's students to high-speed broadband and advanced technology, just like you've got here at Worcester Tech. Already, companies have committed to donate $2 billion to this effort. And starting later this week, schools and teachers and students will be able to go to whitehouse.gov and access resources in time for the new school year, because I want to encourage more schools to do what you are doing. You've set a standard. You've set a bar. More schools can do it across the country. <p>If you're going to college, I also want to make sure that when you graduate you don't have a mountain of debt. So we're not only working to make college more affordable, we're working to help more students pay back their loans that they take out when they go to college. It is not fair to students who do everything right to get saddled with debt that they have to pay off not just for years, but in some cases, decades. We can do better than that. <p>And I&mdash;even though they had votes and they couldn't make it, I want to give a plug to a couple people: Senator Elizabeth Warren and Congressman John Tierney, both from Massachusetts, who introduced bills that would make it easier for students to repay their student loans. It's the same idea we used to make it easier for your parents to pay off their mortgages. Now today that idea was defeated by Republicans in Congress, which was frustrating, especially&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> Well, don't boo. Just remember to vote. [<i>Laughter</i>] But&mdash;so I know that it's frustrating for parents. It's frustrating for students who are working hard and doing everything right. There are too many politicians in Washington who don't have the right priorities. We need to straighten them out. And maybe they forgot where they came from and who invested in them along the way. And when a bill to help you pay off your college doesn't pass, it's a disservice not only to your generation, but to our history as a nation that strives to put quality education within the reach of every American. So we're going to have to keep on putting pressure on Congress. <p>But in the meantime, where Congress won't act, I'm going to do whatever I can on my own. So on Monday, I announced executive actions that are going to help students like you find the right options and give millions of Americans who are already making their loan payments a chance to cap those repayments at 10 percent of their income. Because a quality education shouldn't be something that other kids get, it should be something that every kid gets. And that has to be a priority for this country. <p>I tell you all this not just because you stand to benefit from changes in laws, but because you're going to have to be a part of helping to shape the law. You're going to have to shape public opinion. You're going to have to remember everybody who invested in you. You're going to have to remember the experience of being part of this incredible community. And then, when you go out into the world, whether you are a businessperson or you are in the military or you are an academic or a doctor or whatever it is that you're doing, you're also going to be a citizen. You're also going to be somebody who has a voice in how this country operates. And you've got to push so that others get the same chance you did. <p>And making sure that every young person has the same opportunities you've had, it won't be easy. Progress takes commitment. It takes hard work. We have to fight through the cynicism. It's going to take work from parents and from teachers and members of the community and from students. But I know we can do it, and I know it because of you. <p>If Melinda Blanchard can get so good at welding that a bunch of college kids ask her help building a solar-paneled house for a competition in China, I know that we can get more young people excited about learning. If Greg Carlson can help the robotics team at Worcester Tech win the world championship and still find time to mentor a robotics team at the middle school where he started out, then I know we can help guarantee every child in America a quality education. If Derek Murphy can start his own web development company and graduate with 18 college credits, I know we can help more students earn the skills that businesses are looking for. <p>You're already doing it. You're already blazing a trail. You're already leading. You're already giving back. You don't need to remember what I said today, because you're already doing it. <p>And if it can happen in Worcester, it can happen anyplace. And if it does&mdash;if more communities invest in young people like you, if you give back, if we all keep fighting to put opportunity within the reach of everybody who is willing to work for it&mdash;America will be stronger, your future will be brighter. There is no limit to what we can do together. So congratulations, Class of 2014. You're going to do big things. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"137" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody. Please, please, have a seat. Welcome to the White House. And give it up for our special guests, the 2013 WNBA Champions, \\"Los Lynx,\\" the Minnesota Lynx. [<i>Applause</i>] Hey! We happen also to have some fierce Lynx fans, including Congressman Tim Walz, who is here, and I understand that Mayor Chris Coleman just arrived. So give them both a big round of applause. Chris is around here somewhere. There he is back there. Stand up, Chris, so everybody can see you. Take credit. <p>Now, in 2012, when the Lynx came here after their first title, I said I had a feeling I might see them again before I left office. [<i>Laughter</i>] I just want to mention that I was right. [<i>Laughter</i>] And so you can fact-check that, PolitiFact. I got that one right. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>One of your assistant coaches, Shelley Patterson, put it pretty simply: \\"Winning is what we like to do.\\" And it shows. Over the last 3 years, Coach Cheryl Reeve has led the Lynx to the WNBA's best record, winning more than three-quarters of your games, making it three straight championship series. That's pretty good. Last year, Seimone Augustus issued one of the strangest apologies in sports. I've never heard this before. She said, \\"I'm sorry if we make it look too easy.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] That's a good problem to have. <p>But you began last season with something to prove. In 2012, a tough loss to the Indiana Fever in the finals kept you from a second straight championship. So in 2013, you set out for a little redemption, and to put it mildly, you succeeded. <p>You did not only go 26-8 in the regular season, but you also swept the playoffs, a perfect 7-0. You won it with all-star talent, from Seimone to Rebekkah Brunson, hometown hero Lindsay Whalen. You did it with fellow all-star and Finals MVP Maya Moore, who has now been here so many times, I've lost track. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, basically, there's like a Maya Moore wing in the White House. [<i>Laughter</i>] And when she comes, we kind of&mdash;we've got all her stuff here; she's got a toothbrush and&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>And you did it with all-star teamwork. On the road, in the clinching game of the finals, all five starters scored in double digits. Last season, Lindsay set a new franchise record for assists after just 88 games, a mark that took 205 games to set in the first place. Just gives you a sense of how good she is. Lindsay can play. <p>But bringing home titles isn't the only thing that's earned \\"Los Lynx\\" fans throughout Minnesota. These young women are outstanding members of the community. They make time to help local students with their reading. I hear they clean up pretty well for their annual \\"Catwalk for a Cure\\" fashion show&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that raises money for breast cancer research, so I'm going to have to look that up. <p>I also want to thank this team, as I always tell them, for being great examples for my daughters and for girls across the country. We know that when young women are involved in sports, they do better across the board. [<i>Applause</i>] They do better across the board. And when the WNBA first said \\"We got next,\\" some folks didn't think a professional basketball league could make it. That was 18 seasons ago. And so we're excited to see not only where the Lynx are going to go in the future, but every NBA&mdash;WNBA team for years to come. And one of the things I'd like to see is a Chicago Sky title. It's been a while. [<i>Laughter</i>] A really, really&mdash;a long while. But it's&mdash;it might happen in the future. <p>So today, of course, our job is to congratulate this outstanding team standing behind me, the 2013 Champions, Minnesota Lynx. Good luck with the rest of your season. And I understand&mdash;I don't know, Coach, if you want to say something. I know&mdash;I think Maya, who basically feels like she owns the place, wants to say a few words. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Head Coach Cheryl Reeve.</i> I'll defer to Maya. <p><i>The President.</i> All right, come on. <p><i>Forward Maya Moore.</i> Man, what a birthday treat. Thank you to my teammates. <p><i>The President.</i> Happy birthday. I didn't know that. <p><i>Ms. Moore.</i> Yes, yesterday. It's all week, don't worry. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Okay. [<i>Laughter</i>] Malia and Sasha do the same thing. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Ms. Moore.</i> It's reduced down from a month; now it's a week. <p>I just can't speak enough about this team behind me. It's really just been an awesome 3 years, going into my fourth year, and even before that, the foundation that was being built with Seimone, Coach Reeve, and all the other captains. But every year, it starts at Mr. Taylor's house, our awesome owner, who has provided&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;yes. <p>Like Mr. President said, if we don't have opportunities to compete in sports and to play in sports, you don't get to see us up here today. So to have somebody that believes in us, Mr. Taylor, Becky, we appreciate you. We have our annual dinner at their house where we all come together. And as the rookies got to see, we're really a family. And what you see behind me right now is very genuine, how we treat each other, the passion that we play with. Our leaders, with Coach Reeve, Jim, and Shelley, the tireless work that they put in, and they don't want any credit. They do their jobs to perfection. <p>And last year, we didn't start out with that hot streak that we did our first 2 years; we had a little trouble in the beginning. And then, we also hit a rough patch towards the end of the season, losing four out of five games. I know. Gasp. [<i>Laughter</i>] And it was a struggle. We were in Chicago&mdash;this will make you feel good&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;playing against an awesome rookie in Elena Delle Donne, and she ended up hitting a game-winning three. A heartbreaking loss for us on the road. And our captain&mdash;one of our captains, Lindsay Whalen, you wouldn't have known this, but she took that loss on herself. She cares so much about this team and really just took it personal and hard. And that's really the heart of our team and the heart of this club. We care. And it shows when we're on the court, when we're together, when we're in the community. And I think that's what our Nation is about. We care, we're leaders in that. And that's why this team is so special not just talent-wise, but just the people that I've been blessed to play with. <p>So, hopefully, we can continue to make this an annual trip, and I want to see that room you're talking about. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. <p><i>Ms. Moore.</i> You're welcome. Thank you. <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. <i>Ms. Moore. </i>We have something for you. <p><i>The President.</i> What do you got? <p><i>Ms. Moore.</i> We have a little treat for you for 2013. <p>[<i>At this point, the President was presented with a team jersey.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> All right. Very nice. Very nice. It's got the number. <p>So let's strike the podium so we can get a good picture here. Come on. I'm going to slide right in here.\" "
"138" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Dakota Nation! Hello, Lakota Nation! Chairman Archambault; tribal leaders; people of Standing Rock; people of Indian Country; Michelle and I are so honored to be in this sacred and beautiful place. It's easy to see why it's called God's country. And because I'm among friends, I'm going to try something in Lakota. But I can't guarantee it's going to come out perfect. <i>H&aacute;u, mit&aacute;kuyepi!</i> I'm going to practice. I'm going to be even better next time. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience Member.</i> We love you, Obama! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back! <p><i>Audience Member</i>. You're my hero! <p><i>The President.</i> [<i>Laughter</i>] I want to thank Governor Jack Dalrymple and the Members of Congress who are here today: Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Senator John Hoeven, Congressman Kevin Cramer. We're so grateful that you took the time to be here. <p>And I know that your annual Flag Day powwow officially begins this evening. So we're a little early. But thank you for giving us a sneak peek of the celebration. And we are grateful for the chance to pay tribute to all the veterans of America's Armed Forces who have joined us here today, as well as those who have walked on, and whose flags are proudly displayed here today. Thank you and to your families for your extraordinary service. We are very, very grateful. I also want to acknowledge our outstanding Secretary of the Interior, Sally Jewel, who is here. <p>This visit holds special meaning for me. <p><i>Audience Member. </i>We love Michelle too! <p><i>The President.</i> Of course you love Michelle. Who doesn't love Michelle? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>When I was first running for President, I had the honor of visiting the Crow Nation in Montana. And today I'm proud to be making my first trip to Indian Country as President of the United States. <p>I know that throughout history, the United States often didn't give the nation-to-nation relationship the respect that it deserved. So I promised when I ran to be a President who'd change that: a President who honors our sacred trust, and who respects your sovereignty and upholds treaty obligations, and who works with you in a spirit of true partnership and mutual respect to give our children the future that they deserve. <p>And today I'm proud that the government-to-government relationship between Washington and tribal nations is stronger than ever. Sally Jewell has been doing great work&mdash;her predecessor, Ken Salazar, did great work&mdash;to make sure that we were listening to you. And as head of our new Council on Native American Affairs, she makes sure that the Federal Government and tribal governments are coordinating with each other at all times. And Kevin Washburn, my Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs and a member of the Chickasaw Nation, is here as well. You see, my administration is determined to partner with tribes, and it's not something that just happens once in a while. It takes place every day, on just about every issue that touches your lives. And that's what real nation-to-nation partnerships look like. <p>We've responded and resolved longstanding disputes. George Keepseagle is here today. A few years ago, my administration reached a historic settlement with George and other American Indian farmers and ranchers. And I signed into law the historic <i>Cobell </i>settlement, leading to the Land Buy-Back Program, a 9&mdash;or a $1.9 billion fund to consolidate individual Indian lands and restore them to tribal trust lands. <p>We've made major investments to help grow tribal economies: investments in job training and tribal colleges; roads and high-speed Internet; energy, including renewable energy. And thanks to the Affordable Care Act, Native Americans, like all Americans, finally have access to quality, affordable health care. <p>But I realize that a powwow isn't just about celebrating the past. It's also about looking to the future. It's about keeping sacred traditions alive for the next generation, for these beautiful children. So here today, I want to focus on the work that lies ahead. And I think we can follow the lead of Standing Rock's most famous resident, Chief Sitting Bull. He said, \\"Let's put our minds together to see what we can build for our children.\\" <p>So let's put our minds together to build more economic opportunity in Indian Country, because every American, including every Native American, deserves the chance to work hard and get ahead&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;everybody. That means creating more jobs and supporting small businesses in places like Standing Rock, because young people should be able to live and work and raise a family right here in the land of your fathers and mothers. Let's put our minds together to advance justice, because like every American, you deserve to be safe in your communities and treated equally under the law. <p>My administration has gone further than any in history to strengthen the sovereignty of tribal courts, particularly when it comes to criminal sentencing and prosecuting people who commit violence against women. And Standing Rock has done a terrific job at building a court system that is open and efficient and delivers justice to your people. So we want to support more tribes as they follow your lead and strengthen justice in our communities. And that includes protecting important rights like the right to vote, because every Native American deserves a voice in our democracy. <p>Let's put our minds together to improve our schools, because our children deserve a world-class education too, that prepares them for college and careers. And that means returning control of Indian education to tribal nations with additional resources and support so that you can direct your children's education and reform schools here in Indian Country. And even as they prepare for a global economy, we want children, like these wonderful young children here, learning about their language and learning about their culture, just like the boys and girls do at Lakota Language Nest here at Standing Rock. We want to make sure that continues and we build on that success. <p>Before we came here, Michelle and I sat with an amazing group of young people. I love these young people. I only spent an hour with them. I've&mdash;they feel like my own. And you should be proud of them, because they've overcome a lot, but they're strong, and they're still standing, and they're moving forward. And they're all proud of their culture. But they talked about the challenges of living in two worlds and being both \\"Native\\" and \\"American.\\" And some bright young people like the ones we met today might look around and sometimes wonder if the United States really is thinking about them and caring about them and has a place for them too. <p>And when we were talking, I said, you know, Michelle and I knows what it feels like sometimes to go through tough times. We grew up at times feeling like we were on the outside looking in. But thanks to family and friends and teachers and coaches and neighbors that didn't give up on us, we didn't give up on ourselves. Just like these young people are not giving up on themselves. And we want every young person in America to have the same chance that we had, and that includes the boys and girls here in Indian Country. <p>There's no denying that for some Americans, the deck's been stacked against them, sometimes for generations. And that's been the case for many Native Americans. But if we're working together, we can make things better. We've got a long way to go. But if we do our part, I believe that we can turn the corner. We can break old cycles. We can give our children a better future. I know because I've talked to these young people. I know they can succeed. I know they'll be leaders not just in Indian Country, but across America. And we've got to invest in them and believe in them and love them, and that starts from the White House all the way down here. <p>I understand that the Lakota word for \\"children\\"&mdash;<i>wakanyeja</i>&mdash;comes from the word <i>wakan</i>&mdash;\\"sacred.\\" That's what young people are: They're sacred. They're sacred to your families, and they're sacred to your tribe, and they're sacred to this Nation. And every day that I have the honor of serving as your President, I will do everything I can to make sure that you see that our country has a place for everyone, including every single young person here and all across the Dakotas and all across America, and that you're getting the support and encouragement you need to go as far as your hard work and your talent will take you. That is my commitment to you, to every single young person here. <p>This community has made extraordinary contributions to the United States. Just look at all these flags. So many Native Americans have served our country with honor and with courage. And now it's up to us to keep strong what they've built, to keep America the place where no matter who you are and what you look like or where you come from, you can make it. And that you don't have to give up your culture to also be part of the American family. That's what I believe. And coming here today makes me believe it that much more. <p><i>Hechetu welo.</i> Thank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\" "
"139" "\"Hi, everybody. Sunday is Father's Day. If you haven't got Dad a gift yet, there is still time. Just barely. But the truth is, what we give our fathers can never match what our fathers can give us. <p>I know how important it is to have a dad in your life, because I grew up without my father around. I felt the weight of his absence. So for Michelle and our girls, I try every day to be the husband and father my family didn't have when I was young. And every chance I get, I encourage fathers to get more involved in their children's lives, because what makes you a man isn't the ability to have a child, it's the courage to raise one. <p>Still, over the past couple of years, I've met with a lot of young people who don't have a father figure around. And while there's nothing that can replace a parent, any of us can do our part to be a mentor, a sounding board, a role model for a kid who needs one. Earlier this year, I launched an initiative called My Brother's Keeper, an all-hands-on-deck effort to help more of our young men reach their full potential. And if you want to be a mentor to a young man in your community, you can find out how at whitehouse.gov/mybrotherskeeper. <p>Now, when I launched this initiative, I said that government can't play the primary role in a young person's life. Taking responsibility for being a great parent or mentor is a choice that we, as individuals, have to make. No government program can ever take the place of a parent's love. Still, as a country, there are ways we can help support dads and moms who make that choice. <p>And that's why, earlier this week, we brought working dads from across America to the White House to talk about the challenges they face. And in a few weeks, I'll hold the first-ever White House Working Families Summit. We've still got too many workplace policies that belong in the 1950s, and it's time to bring them up to date for today's families, where oftentimes, both parents are working. Moms and dads deserve affordable childcare and time off to care for a sick parent or child without running into hardship. Women deserve equal pay for equal work, and at a time when more women are breadwinners for a family, that benefits men too. And because no parent who works full time should have to raise a family in poverty, it's time for Congress to follow the lead of State after State, get on the bandwagon, and give America a raise. <p>Dads work hard. So our country should do what we can to make sure their hard work pays off, to make sure life for them and their families is a little less stressful, a little more secure so they can be the dads their kids need them to be. Because there's nothing more precious in life than the time we spend with our children. There's no better feeling than knowing that we can be there for them and provide for them and help give them every shot at success. <p>Let's make sure every dad who works hard and takes responsibility has the chance to know that feeling, not just on one Sunday, but every day of the year. <p>Thanks everybody. Happy Father's Day, and have a great weekend.\" "
"140" "\"Hello, Anteaters! That is something I never thought I'd say. [<i>Laughter</i>] Please, please take a seat. <p>To President Napolitano&mdash;which is a nice step up from Secretary; to Fred Ruiz, Vice Chair of the University of California Regents; Chancellor Drake; Representatives Loretta Sanchez and Alan Lowenthal; to the trustees and faculty: Thank you for this honor. And congratulations to the class of 2014! <p>Now, let me begin my saying all of you had the inside track in getting me here, because my personal assistant, Ferial, is a proud Anteater. Until today, I did not understand why she greets me every morning by shouting, \\"Zot, zot, zot!\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] It's been a little weird. But she explained it to me on the way here this morning, because she's very proud to see her brother Sina graduate today as well. So, graduates, obviously we're proud of you, but let's give it up for your proud family and friends and professors, because this is their day too. <p>And even though he's on the road this weekend, I also want to thank Angels centerfielder Mike Trout for letting me cover his turf for a while. He actually signed a bat for me, which is part of my retirement plan. [<i>Laughter</i>] I will be keeping that. And this is a pretty cool place to hold a commencement. I know that UC Irvine's baseball team opens College World Series play in Omaha right about now, so let's get this speech underway. If the hot dog guy comes by, get me one. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, in addition to Ferial, graduates, I'm here for a simple reason: You asked. For those who don't know, the UC Irvine community sent 10,000 postcards to the White House asking me to come speak today. Some tried to guilt me into coming. I got one that said, \\"I went to your first Inauguration, can you please come to my graduation?\\" [<i>Applause</i>] That was you? <p>Some tried bribery: \\"I'll support the Chicago Bulls.\\" Another said today would be your birthday. So happy birthday, whoever you are. <p>My personal favorite: Somebody wrote and said, \\"We are superunderrated!\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm sure she was talking about this school. But keep in mind, you're not only the number-one university in America younger than 50 years old, you also hold the Guinness World Record for biggest water pistol fight. You're pretty excited about that. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>\\"We are superunderrated.\\" This young lady could have just as well been talking, though, about this generation. I think this generation of young people is superunderrated. <p>In your young lives, you've seen dizzying change, from terror attacks to economic turmoil; from Twitter to Tumblr. [<i>Laughter</i>] Some of your families have known tough times during the course of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. And you're graduating into a still-healing job market, and some of you are carrying student loan debt that you're concerned about. And yet your generation&mdash;the most educated, the most diverse, the most tolerant, the most politically independent, and the most digitally fluent in our history&mdash;is also on record as being the most optimistic about our future. <p>And I'm here to tell you that you are right to be optimistic. [<i>Applause</i>] You are right to be optimistic. Consider this: Since the time most of you graduated from high school, fewer Americans are at war. More have health insurance. More are graduating from college. Our businesses have added more than 9 million new jobs. The number of states where you're free to marry who you love has more than doubled. [<i>Applause</i>] And that's just some of the progress that you've seen while you've been studying here at UC Irvine. <p>But we do face real challenges: rebuilding the middle class and reversing inequality's rise, reining in college costs, protecting voting rights, welcoming the immigrants and young dreamers who keep this country vibrant, stemming the tide of violence that guns inflict on our schools. We've got some big challenges. And if you're fed a steady diet of cynicism that says nobody's trustworthy and nothing works and there's no way we can actually address these problems, then the temptation is to just go it alone, to look after yourself, and not participate in the larger project of achieving our best vision of America. <p>And I'm here to tell you, don't believe the cynicism. Guard against it. Don't buy into it. Today I want to use one case study to show you that progress is possible and perseverance is critical. I want to show you how badly we need you&mdash;both your individual voices and your collective efforts&mdash;to give you the chance you seek to change the world and maybe even save it. <p>I'm going to talk about one of the most significant long-term challenges that our country and our planet faces: the growing threat of a rapidly changing climate. <p>Now, this isn't a policy speech. I understand it's a commencement, and I already delivered a long climate address last summer. I remember because it was 95 degrees and my staff had me do it outside, and I was pouring with sweat&mdash;as a visual aid. [<i>Laughter</i>] And since this is a very educated group, you already know the science. Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide traps heat. Levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere are higher than they've been in 800,000 years. <p>We know the trends. The 18 warmest years on record have all happened since you graduates were born. We know what we see with our own eyes. Out West, firefighters brave longer, harsher wildfire seasons; States have to budget for that. Mountain towns worry about what smaller snowpacks mean for tourism. Farmers and families at the bottom worry about what it will mean for their water. In cities like Norfolk and Miami, streets now flood frequently at high tide. Shrinking icecaps have National Geographic making the biggest change in its atlas since the Soviet Union broke apart. <p>So the question is not whether we need to act. The overwhelming judgment of science, accumulated and measured and reviewed over decades, has put that question to rest. The question is whether we have the will to act before it's too late. For if we fail to protect the world we leave not just to my children, but to your children and your children's children, we will fail one of our primary reasons for being on this world in the first place. And that is to leave the world a little bit better for the next generation. <p>Now, the good news is you already know all this. UC Irvine set up the first Earth System Science Department in America. A UC Irvine professor-student team won the Nobel Prize for discovering that CFCs destroy the ozone layer. A UC Irvine glaciologist's work led to one of last month's reports showing one of the world's major ice sheets in irreversible retreat. Students and professors are in the field working to predict changing weather patterns, fire seasons, and water tables; working to understand how shifting seasons affect global ecosystems; to get zero-emission vehicles on the road faster; to help coastal communities adapt to rising seas. And when I challenged colleges to reduce their energy use to 20 percent by 2020, UC Irvine went ahead and did it last year. Done. So UC Irvine is ahead of the curve. All of you are ahead of the curve. <p>Your generation reminds me of something President Wilson once said. He said: \\"Sometimes, people call me an idealist. Well, that is the way I know I am an American.\\" That's who we are. <p>And if you need a reason to be optimistic about our future, then look around this stadium. Because today, in America, the largest single age group is 22 years old. And you are going to do great things. And I want you to know that I've got your back, because one of the reasons I ran for this office was because I believed our dangerous addiction to foreign oil left our economy at risk and our planet in peril. So when I took office, we set out to use more clean energy and less dirty energy and waste less energy overall. <p>And since then, we've doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas by the middle of the next decade. We've tripled the electricity we harness from the wind, generating enough last year to power every home in California. We've multiplied the electricity we generate from the sun 10 times over. And this State, California, is so far ahead of the rest of the country in solar that earlier this year solar power met 18 percent of your total power demand one day. <p>The bottom line is, America produces more renewable energy than ever, more natural gas than anyone. And for the first time in nearly two decades, we produce more oil here at home than we buy from other countries. And these advances have created jobs and grown our economy and helped cut our carbon pollution to levels not seen in about 20 years. Since 2006, no country on Earth has reduced its total carbon pollution by as much as the United States of America. <p>So that's all reason for optimism. Here's the challenge: We've got to do more. What we're doing is not enough. And that's why, a couple weeks ago, America proposed new standards to limit the amount of harmful carbon pollution that power plants can dump into the air. And we also have to realize, as hundreds of scientists declared last month, that climate change is no longer a distant threat, but \\"has moved firmly into the present.\\" That's a quote. In some parts of the country, weather-related disasters like droughts and fires and storms and floods are going to get harsher, and they're going to get costlier. And that's why today I'm announcing a new $1 billion competitive fund to help communities prepare for the impacts of climate change and build more resilient infrastructure across the country. <p>So it's a big problem. But progress, no matter how big the problem, is possible. That's important to remember. Because no matter what you do in life, you're going to run up against big problems, in your own personal life and in your communities and in your country. There's going to be a stubborn status quo, and there are going to be people determined to stymie your efforts to bring about change. There are going to be people who say you can't do something. There are going to be people who say you shouldn't bother. I've got some experience in this myself. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, part of what's unique about climate change, though, is the nature of some of the opposition to action. It's pretty rare that you'll encounter somebody who says the problem you're trying to solve simply doesn't exist. When President Kennedy sets us on a&mdash;set us on a course for the Moon, there were a number of people who made a serious case that it wouldn't be worth it; it was going to be too expensive, it was going to be too hard, it would take too long. But nobody ignored the science. I don't remember anybody saying that the Moon wasn't there or that it was made of cheese. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Today's Congress, though, is full of folks who stubbornly and automatically reject the scientific evidence about climate change. They will tell you it is a hoax or a fad. One Member of Congress actually says the world is cooling. There was one Member of Congress who mentioned a theory involving \\"dinosaur flatulence\\"&mdash;which I won't get into, but&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>Now, their view may be wrong&mdash;and a fairly serious threat to everybody's future&mdash;but at least they have the brass to say what they actually think. There are some who also duck the question. They say&mdash;when they're asked about climate change, they say, \\"Hey, look, I'm not a scientist.\\" And I'll translate that for you. What that really means is, \\"I know that manmade climate change really is happening, but if I admit it, I'll be run out of town by a radical fringe that thinks climate science is a liberal plot, so I'm not going to admit it.\\" <p>Now, I'm not a scientist either&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but we've got some really good ones at NASA. I do know that the overwhelming majority of scientists who work on climate change, including some who once disputed the data, have put that debate to rest. The writer Thomas Friedman recently put it to me this way. We were talking, and he says, \\"Your kid is sick, you consult 100 doctors; 97 of them tell you to do this, 3 tell [you] to do that, and you want to go with the 3?\\" <p>The fact is, this should not be a partisan issue. After all, it was Republicans who used to lead the way on new ideas to protect our environment. It was Teddy Roosevelt who first pushed for our magnificent national parks. It was Richard Nixon who signed the Clean Air Act and opened the EPA. George H.W. Bush&mdash;a wonderful man who at 90 just jumped out of a plane with&mdash;in a parachute&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;said that \\"human activities are changing the atmosphere in unexpected and unprecedented ways.\\" John McCain and other Republicans publicly supported free market-based cap-and-trade bills to slow carbon pollution just a few years ago, before the Tea Party decided it was a massive threat to freedom and liberty. <p>These days, unfortunately, nothing is happening. Even minor energy efficiency bills are killed on the Senate floor. And the reason is because people are thinking about politics instead of thinking about what's good for the next generation. What's the point of public office if you're not going to use your power to help solve problems? <p>And part of the challenge is that the media doesn't spend a lot of time covering climate change and letting average Americans know how it could impact their futures. Now, the broadcast networks' nightly newscasts spend just a few minutes a month covering climate issues. On cable, the debate is usually between political pundits, not scientists. When we introduced those new antipollution standards a couple weeks ago, the instant reaction from Washington's political press wasn't about what it would mean for our planet; it was what would it mean for an election 6 months from now. And that kind of misses the point. Of course, they're not scientists either. <p>And I want to tell you all this not to discourage you, I'm telling you all this because I want to light a fire under you. As the generation getting shortchanged by inaction on this issue, I want all of you to understand you cannot accept that this is the way it has to be. <p>The climate change deniers suggest there's still a debate over the science. There is not. The talking heads on cable news suggest public opinion is hopelessly deadlocked. It is not. Seven in ten Americans say global warming is a serious problem. Seven in ten say the Federal Government should limit pollution from our power plants. And of all the issues in a recent poll asking Americans where we think we can make a difference, protecting the environment came out on top. <p>So we've got public opinion potentially on our side. We can do this. We can make a difference. You can make a difference. And the sooner you do, the better, not just for our climate, but for our economy. The reason&mdash;there's a reason that more than 700 businesses like Apple and Microsoft and GM and Nike, Intel, Starbucks have declared that \\"tackling climate change is one of America's greatest economic opportunities in the 21st century.\\" The country that seizes this opportunity first will lead the way. A low-carbon, clean energy economy can be an engine for growth and jobs for decades to come, and I want America to build that engine. Because if we do, others will follow. I want those jobs, I want those opportunities, I want those businesses right here in the United States of America. <p>Developing countries are using more and more energy, and tens of millions of people are entering the global middle class, and they want to buy cars and refrigerators and&mdash;so if we don't deal with this problem soon, we're going to be overwhelmed. These nations have some of the fastest rising levels of carbon pollution. They're going to have to take action to meet this challenge. They're more vulnerable to the effects of climate change than we are. They've got even more to lose. But they're waiting to see what does America do. That's what the world does. It waits to watch us act. And when we do, they move. And I'm convinced that on this issue, when America proves what's possible, then they're going to join us. <p>And America cannot meet this threat alone. Of course, the world cannot meet it without America. This is a fight that America must lead. So I'm going to keep doing my part for as long as I hold this office and as long as I'm a citizen once out of office. But we're going to need you, the next generation, to finish the job. <p>We need scientists to design new fuels. We need farmers to help grow them. We need engineers to invent new technologies. We need entrepreneurs to sell those technologies. We need workers to operate assembly lines that hum with high-tech, zero-carbon components. We need builders to hammer into place the foundations for a clean energy age. We need diplomats and business men and women and Peace Corps volunteers to help developing nations skip past the dirty phase of development and transition to sustainable sources of energy. <p>In other words, we need you. We need you. And if you believe, like I do, that something has to be done on this, then you're going to have to speak out. You're going to have to learn more about these issues. You're going to have to&mdash;even if you're not like Jessica and an expert, you're going to have to&mdash;you're going to have to work on this. You're going to have to push those of us in power to do what this American moment demands. You've got to educate your classmates and colleagues and family members and fellow citizens and tell them what's at stake. And you've got to push back against the misinformation and speak out for facts and organize others around your vision for the future. <p>You need to invest in what helps and divest from what harms. And you've got to remind everyone who represents you, at every level of government, that doing something about climate change is a prerequisite for your vote. <p>It's no accident that when President Kennedy needed to convince the Nation that sending Americans into space was a worthy goal, he went to a university. That's where he started. Because a challenge as big as that, as costly as that, as difficult as that, requires a spirit of youth. It requires a spirit of adventure, a willingness to take risks. It requires optimism. It requires hope. That day, a man told us we'd go to the Moon within a decade. And despite all the naysayers, somehow, we knew as a nation that we'd build a spaceship and we'd meet that goal. <p>That's because we're Americans, and that's what we do. Even when our political system is consumed by small things, we are a people called to do big things. And progress on climate change is a big thing. Progress won't always be flashy; it will be measured in disasters averted and lives saved and a planet preserved and days just like this one, 20 years from now and 50 years from now and 100 years from now. But can you imagine a more worthy goal, a more worthy legacy, than protecting the world we leave to our children? <p>So I ask your generation to help leave us that legacy. I ask you to believe in yourselves and in one another, and above all, when life gets you down or somebody tells you you can't do something, to believe in something better. <p>There are people here who know what it means to dream. When Mohamad Abedi was a boy, the suffering he saw in refugee camps in Lebanon didn't drive him into despair, it inspired him to become a doctor. And when he came to America, he discovered a passion for engineering. So here, at UC Irvine, he became a biomedical engineer to study the human brain. And Mohamad said, I had never come to the United States&mdash;\\"had I never come to the United States, I would have never had the ability to do the work that I'm doing.\\" He's now going to CalTech to keep doing that work. <p>Cinthia Flores is the daughter of a single mom who worked as a seamstress and a housekeeper. The first in her family to graduate from high school. The first in her family to graduate from college. And in college, she says, \\"I learned about myself that I was good at advocating for others and that I was argumentative&mdash;so maybe I should go to law school.\\" And today Cinthia is the first in her family to graduate from law school. And she plans to advocate for the rights of workers like her mom. She says, \\"I have the great privilege and opportunity to answer the call of my community.\\" \\"The bottom line,\\" she says, \\"is being of service.\\" <p>On 9/11, Aaron Anderson was a sophomore in college. Several months later, he was in training for Army Special Forces. He fought in Afghanistan, and on February 28, 2006, he was nearly killed by an IED. He endured dozens of surgeries to save his legs, months of recovery at Walter Reed. When he couldn't physically return to Active Duty, he devoted his time to his brothers-in-arms, starting two businesses with fellow veterans and a foundation to help fellow wounded Green Beret soldiers. And then he went back to school. And last December, he graduated summa cum laude from UC Irvine. And Aaron is here today, along with four soon-to-be-commissioned ROTC cadets and 65 other graduating veterans. And I would ask them to stand and be recognized for their service. <p>The point is, you know how to dream. And you know how to work for your dreams. And yes, sometimes, you may be \\"superunderrated.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] But usually, it's the underrated, the underdogs, the dreamers, the idealists, the fighters, the argumentative&mdash;those are the folks who do the biggest things. <p>And this generation&mdash;this 9/11 generation of soldiers, this new generation of scientists and advocates and entrepreneurs and altruists&mdash;you're the antidote to cynicism. It doesn't mean you're not going to get down sometimes. You will. You'll know disillusionment. You'll experience doubt. People will disappoint you by their actions. But that can't discourage you. <p>Cynicism has never won a war or cured a disease or started a business or fed a young mind or sent men into space. Cynicism is a choice. Hope is a better choice. <p>Hope is what gave young soldiers the courage to storm a beach and liberate people they never met. Hope is what gave young students the strength to sit in and stand up and march for women's rights and civil rights and voting rights and gay rights and immigration rights. <p>Hope is the belief, against all evidence to the contrary, that there are better days ahead and that together we can build up a middle class and reshape our immigration system and shield our children from gun violence and shelter future generations from the ravages of climate change. <p>Hope is the fact that, today, the single largest age group in America is 22-year-olds who are all just itching to reshape this country and reshape the world. And I cannot wait to see what you do tomorrow. <p>Congratulations. Thank you, class of 2014. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"141" "\"Edith, Robbie, thanks for the wonderfully brief introduction. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean that sincerely. The day that the Supreme Court issued its ruling, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Windsor</i>, was a great day for America, a clear victory for human decency and equality and justice and freedom. So we thank you for your courage and your inspiration. Give them a big round of applause. <p>I want to thank Debbie Wasserman Schultz for the great job she's doing as chair of the DNC. Andy Tobias, making sure the money goes to the right places. Yay, Andy! Henry Mu&ntilde;oz&mdash;thank you, Henry. Thanks to Sia for the beautiful performance. Our emcee, Jesse Tyler Ferguson. Jesse, congratulations on both your weddings. [<i>Laughter</i>] Mitch and Cam finally tied the knot. Michelle and the girls were crying. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>There are other newlyweds here. Eric Johnson and Mark Parker were married a couple of hours ago. They decided to make this their after-party, pretty cool. If you've got a glass, raise it for Eric and Mark: A lifetime of health and happiness to them. <p>So Pride Month is a time for celebration, and this year we've got a lot to celebrate. If you think about everything that's happened in the last 12 months, it is remarkable. In nine more States, you're now free to marry the person you love. That includes my two home States of Hawaii and Illinois. The NFL drafted its first openly gay player. The U.S. Postal Service made history by putting an openly gay person on a stamp: the late, great Harvey Milk, smiling from ear to ear. <p>So now you flash back 10 years ago. Maybe no single issue divided our country more than same-sex marriage. In fact, the Republican Party built their entire strategy for 2004 around this issue. You remember? They calculated, if they put constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage on State ballots, they'd turn out more voters, they'd win. And they frankly were right. People flocked to the polls. Those amendments were on the ballots in 11 States. They passed in every single one. <p>Now, here's a good bet. They're not going to try the same strategy in 2014. When I took office, only two States had marriage equality. Today, 19 States and the District of Columbia do. There are court rulings pending in other States as well. And despite the great work of some incredibly talented and courageous lawyers, it is important to understand, it's not just the laws that are changing, it's hearts and minds. <p>The conventional wisdom says that all this change is due to young people growing up with different attitudes and their parents&mdash;than their parents and their grandparents had. And anybody who has kids knows that there is some truth to that. The basic attitude is, I'm sorry, what is it that you're talking about here? What's the big deal? But what's been remarkable is the way Americans of all age groups are increasingly embracing marriage equality. And they understand love is love. And for many people whose minds have changed, it was love that did it: love for the child or the grandchild or the friend or the coworker who sat down one day and held their hands and took a deep breath and said, I'm gay. <p>Almost everybody in this room was that child or grandchild or friend or coworker at some point. And you may not have known it at the time, it may have seemed like an individual act, but in those moments, when you summoned that courage and reached out with that hopeful love, you were doing it for everybody. And that's why I'm here tonight, to say thank you for helping make America more just and more compassionate. <p>And I want to thank all the incredible friends in the room for the support and guidance that so many of you have offered my administration over the past 5&frac12; years. Now, sometimes, you guys were a little impatient. [<i>Laughter</i>] Sometimes, I had to say, will you just settle down for a second? We've got this. [<i>Laughter</i>] But because of your help, we've been able to do more to protect the rights of lesbian and gay and bisexual and transgender Americans than any administration in history. <p>We repealed \\"don't ask, don't tell,\\" because no one should have to hide who you love to serve the country we love. We reauthorized the Violence Against Women's Act with new protections. And I signed a hate crimes law bearing Matthew Shepard's name, because hate-driven violence has taken the lives of too many in this country. It has to end. <p>I lifted the 22-year ban on people with HIV traveling to the U.S. and prohibited discrimination in hospitals and housing that received Federal funding, because stigma and fear have no place in our laws. We've made it illegal for health insurers to deny coverage to people based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Starting next year, insurance companies that offer coverage to straight couples have to offer it to gay couples too. <p>We've worked to address and prevent bullying, because it's not enough to say it gets better. We've got to make it better. And today the Senate confirmed two openly gay judges in the same day. Before I took office, only one openly gay judge had been confirmed in history. We have 10 more. <p>And as I said in my second Inaugural Address, if we're truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well. That's why we stopped defending the so-called Defense of Marriage Act in the courts and argued alongside Edie and Robbie before the highest court in the land. That's why we're working to implement the Court's ruling to extend benefits to married same-sex couples wherever, whenever possible. People have been waiting a long time for justice, and we're working to deliver on it as fast as we can. <p>So we've got some pretty good reasons to celebrate. That doesn't mean, though, that we can grow complacent. Progress doesn't just have to be fought for, it has to be defended. Today, a lawmaker in Oklahoma is trying to ban all marriages rather than recognize same-sex marriage. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, that seems a little over the top, but that's just my opinion. [<i>Laughter</i>] The Texas Republican Party's State platform endorses gay conversion therapy in 2014. Fierce legal fights are underway to stop marriage equality from expanding any further or to prevent court rulings from taking effect. And most of all, there are still Americans out there who are vulnerable and alone and still need our support. <p>So we can't stop. We've got to keep fighting. We've got to keep fighting for the human rights of people around the world, to those who face violence and intimidation every single day and who live under governments that have made the existence of anybody who's LGBT illegal. We need to send a message to those folks. I want them to hear from the President of the United States: We believe in your dignity and your equality, and the United States stands with you. <p>And we've got to keep fighting to protect the lives of our brothers and sisters here at home. Last week, I got a chance to watch the film version of \\"The Normal Heart.\\" And I actually called Ryan Murphy afterwards to tell him to how much I admired it. It's more than just a story from our past. It's a reminder that we have to stay vigilant in the fight against HIV/AIDS, which still claims the lives of too many Americans, especially low-income Americans, especially the minority LGBT community that doesn't have all the resources, doesn't have all the information they need. It still takes a toll. <p>Now, I know that many people in this room have photographs with smiling friends from days gone by, and a lot of those friends are gone, taken before their time, both because of a disease and because there was a Government that failed to recognize that disease in time. And that can happen again if we're not careful. <p>And that's why my administration created the first comprehensive national HIV/AIDS strategy. That's why we're working toward an AIDS-free generation, so fewer people have to know the pain of this disease and so our country doesn't lose any more of its sons and daughters. <p>We've got to keep fighting for equality in the workplace. Right now there are more States that allow same-sex marriage than there are States that prohibit discrimination against LGBT workers. Think about that. <p>We have laws that say Americans can't be fired from their jobs because of the color of their skin or for their religion or because of a disability. But every day, millions of Americans go to work knowing that they could lose their job, not because of anything they did, but because of who they are. That is not right. It is wrong. <p>Now, Congress has been considering legislation to protect LGBT workers for decades. I want you to understand: for decades. Last November, it finally looked like we were getting somewhere. The Senate passed ENDA, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. Had strong bipartisan support. But shockingly enough, the House refused to act. Meanwhile, millions of Americans are still waiting. It's been decades. <p>The majority of Fortune 500 companies, small businesses, already have nondiscrimination policies that protect their employees, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it helps them attract and retain the best talent. They're right. We don't benefit as a country or an economy, businesses don't benefit if they're leaving talent off the field. <p>And that's why I've directed my staff to prepare for my signature an Executive order prohibiting discrimination by Federal contractors on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Because in the United States of America, who you are and who you love shouldn't be a fireable offense. It would be better, by the way, if Congress passed a more comprehensive law that didn't just cover Federal contractors. And we need to keep working on that, so don't take the pressure off Congress. <p>This seems to be a pattern these days. Everybody has just given up so much on Congress that we end up doing something through Executive order. And that's helpful, but it doesn't reach everybody that needs to be reached. Congress needs to start working again, so let's make sure that we keep the pressure up there. <p>This is a country where no matter who you are or what you look like or how you came up or what your last name is or who you love, if you work hard and you take responsibility, you should be able to make it. That's the story of America. That's the story of this movement: people who stand up and come out and march and organize and fight to expand the rights we enjoy and extend them to other people; people who work against the odds to build a nation in which nobody is a second-class citizen, everybody is free to who&mdash;to be who they are and that you're judged based on, are you kind and competent and work hard and treat each other with respect and are a team player and look after your community and care and love and cherish your kids? That's how we're supposed to be judged. <p>That's the fight that brought all of us here today. That's what made it possible for me to stand up here as your President. It's what gave many people in this room the freedom to live their lives freely. It's what should inspire us to keep working to make sure all our children grow up in an America where differences are respected and even celebrated and where love is love. <p>And it is also why those of us who in the past might have not always enjoyed the full liberty that this amazing country of ours has to offer, that we've got to be thinking about others who are still struggling. That's why this community has to be just as concerned about poor kids, regardless of sexual orientation. That's why this community should be fighting for workers who aren't getting paid a minimum wage that's high enough. <p>That's why this community has to show compassion for the illegal immigrant who is contributing to our society and just wants a chance to move out of the shadows. That's why this community should be concerned about equal pay for equal work, straight or gay. That's why this community has to be concerned about the remaining vestiges of racial discrimination. <p>If you've experienced being on the outside, you've got to be one to bring more folks in even once you are inside. That's our task. That's our job. That's why we're here tonight. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"142" "\"Everybody, have a seat. Thank you. Thank you. Well, good morning. And welcome to the first-ever White House Maker Faire, which is pretty exciting. Now, the&mdash;let me start off by saying, the only thing that I asked my staff about is, why is there an \\"e\\" at the end of \\"faire\\"? [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, I wasn't sure, is there jousting? Do we all have to get dressed up or what? So I'm just warning you, next year, the \\"e\\" may be gone. I don't know exactly who came up with that. This is America. We don't have \\"e's\\" at the end of \\"fair.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] All right? So I'm just saying. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm just saying. Whoever came up with that idea, you let me know. <p>We've got three outstanding Members of Congress who are here: Bill Foster, Rush Holt, and Russ [Mark; White House correction.] Takano. We've got National Science Foundation Director France C&oacute;rdova, who's here&mdash;France. Our NIH Director, Francis Collins. My science adviser, John Holdren. We've got innovators like Dale Dougherty, who's here, who helped launch the very first Maker Faire nearly a decade ago. Dale, stand up. We have Intel's youngest intern, who I know because he's probably the only person who was ever allowed to fire a marshmallow in the White House&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;Joey Hudy. Where's Joey? There he is. There's still a stain&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;from where the marshmallow hit. It was scary. The thing just went out a little&mdash;you don't want to be at the other&mdash;receiving end of that marshmallow. He also brought, by the way, his \\"3x3x3 LED Shield,\\" which is his. <p>And we've got some wonderful folks like our Science Guy, Bill Nye, who's here all the time, and Mr. Kamen, a great inventor. So this is a smart group right here. There are some innovative folks. <p>Before I begin, I have to ask: What on Earth have you done to my house? [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, there's a mobile factory on the South Lawn. There's a robotic giraffe. There's a giant red weather balloon in the Rose Garden. There's a paper-craft dinosaur head in the hallway. Over here is a 3-D-printed sculpture of my State of the Union Address. [<i>Laughter</i>] Clearly, there could have been some edits right there in the middle. [<i>Laughter</i>] It&mdash;the sculpture clearly goes on too long. [<i>Laughter</i>] So this is not your typical day at the White House. <p>We invited you here because today is D.I.Y.&mdash;today's D.I.Y. is tomorrow's \\"Made in America.\\" Your projects are examples of a revolution that's taking place in American manufacturing, a revolution that can help us create new jobs and industries for decades to come. <p>Five years after the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes, our businesses have created jobs for 51 straight months. That's 9.4 million new jobs in total. But we know we've got to create more. And one of the best ways to create more good jobs is by boosting American manufacturing. <p>So we've seen an auto industry that's come roaring back, and our manufacturing sector has been adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s, about 640,000 new manufacturing jobs since February of 2010. And in the absence of much action from Congress, we're doing what we can&mdash;I'm doing what I can on my own&mdash;to keep that progress going. So I've launched four new high-tech manufacturing hubs across the country, with more on the way. Yesterday I went to the TechShop in Pittsburgh, where you can use equipment like laser cutters and 3-D printers for about the cost of a gym membership. We announced new steps that we're taking to help entrepreneurs turn their ideas into products. More than 90 mayors made commitments to help entrepreneurs manufacture new things in their communities, and we're proud to have some of those mayors here today. <p>So we're going to do whatever we can to bring good manufacturing jobs back to our shores, because our parents and our grandparents created the world's largest economy and strongest middle class not by buying stuff, but by building stuff, by making stuff, by tinkering and inventing and building; by making and selling things first in a growing national market and then in an international market, stuff \\"Made in America.\\" <p>And the good news is, is that new tools and technologies are making the building of things easier than ever. There is a democratization of manufacturing that is potentially available because of technology. Across our country, ordinary Americans are inventing incredible things, and then they're able to bring them to these fairs like Makers Faires. And you never know where this kind of enthusiasm and creativity and innovation could lead. So in the 1970s, Steve Wozniak designed the Apple I to show off for the members of the Homebrew Computer Club. And today, Apple is worth about $550 billion. I wish I had been there. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'd like to think that I would have said, that's a good idea. [<i>Laughter</i>] Let me&mdash;here, take my hundred dollars. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And while I don't know if the projects here today are the next Apple, I do know that by looking at some of these exhibits, it was just incredible what is being done. <p>So you take the team from the Workshop School in West Philadelphia, and compared to most other schools, there are a lot of advantages they don't have. This is a poor community. They do have, however, Simon Hauger, a principal who is so talented, a student once said, \\"He could teach algebra to a guinea pig.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] And with Simon's help, we've got Derrick Bell here, Taliya Carter, Joshua Pigford. Their team built a biodiesel sports car that gets around a hundred miles per gallon, which is why the Secret Service didn't let me drive it. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But what's happening is, is that the young people now are able to learn by doing. So math, science all gets incorporated into the task of actually making something, which the students tell me makes the subject matter that much more interesting. <p>Or you've got Jen McCabe, who is setting up a space called Factorli, in Las Vegas, to provide custom, small-scale manufacturing, kind of like a Kinko's or a copy shop, but instead of printing flyers, they're going to be able to print custom parts for American products. <p>There's Marc Roth from San Francisco. A few years ago, Marc found himself homeless. And at a shelter, Marc heard about a local TechShop that teaches folks how to use new tools like laser cutters and 3-D printers, and he signed up. And within 16 months, he had started SF Laser, his own laser-cutting business. He just launched a program called the Learning Shelter to teach tech and manufacturing skills to other folks who are trying to get back on their feet. <p>As you were going through the exhibits, you saw young people who are students at places like MIT helping to design mobile factories that bring the tools for invention to communities that might have thought that kind of stuff was out of reach for them. An incredible story of a young woman who figured out how to make a cheap incubator that's already helping 60,000 newbies around the world who can't afford the sort of expensive equipment that we have in our hospitals. It gives you a sense that we are at the dawn of something big. And one of the professors who I had a chance to speak to as I was taking the tour described it as analogous to where we were with the Internet 25, 30 years ago. In the same way that we are at that&mdash;we were at that time reorganizing how we could use data and information, we are now at a point where we're going to be able to reorganize how we think about making things and marrying the information revolution to what's been an analogue manufacturing system. And it's incredibly exciting, and we're at the cutting edge of it, but we've got to make sure that we continue to be at the cutting edge of it. <p>And so as a country, we ought to be doing what Simon and Jen and Marc are doing every day, and we've got to make sure that more Americans have the skills and opportunities to land a job in a growing industry or to create entirely new industries. So that's why I'm declaring today a \\"National Day of Making,\\" and it's why I'm backing those words up with action. <p>We're helping schools take shop class into the 21st century, because one of the things I'm really interested in is how do we redesign high schools so that young people are able to do stuff as they are learning. And that's not just true for schools in inner-city Philadelphia, that's true for schools generally, in part because it also then gives new opportunities for young people who may have different learning styles to thrive in ways that they might not if they're just sitting there listening to a lecture. <p>We're providing new support for startups that want to file for a patent. From the Defense Department to the SBA and from the National Science Foundation to NASA, we're doing more to help entrepreneurs start new businesses that make things in America. <p>And of course, this is not just a job for Government. Today, more than 150 colleges and universities are committing to giving young people more hands-on opportunities to make things. So a few minutes ago, a young man named Partha Unnava showed me the letter announcing that commitment, and of course, it was on some metal that was 3-D printed. He couldn't just give me a piece of paper. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's harder to file, by the way, but it looks cooler. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>The private sector is stepping up as well. From Indiegogo and Etsy to Disney and Intel, companies have pledged to help unleash a new wave of innovation here in America. And these companies do different things, they come from different industries, but they share the belief that when we tap the potential of every American, all of us are better off. <p>Camille and Genevieve Beatty are here today from Asheville, North Carolina. They're 14 and 12 years old. Where are they? Raise your hands, guys. There you are. [<i>Applause</i>] See? They happen to be the cofounders of Beatty Robotics. Genevieve does the wiring, Camille machines the metal. As their website puts it, \\"Who needs a paper route when you can start a robotics company?\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] That's a pretty good motto. That's great, I love that. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But the Beattys say one of the main things they've learned over the last few years isn't about power tools or engineering or electronics. What they've learned is that, \\"If you can imagine it, then you can do it&mdash;whatever it is.\\" And that's a pretty good motto for America. <p>This is a country that imagined a railroad connecting a continent, imagined electricity powering our cities and towns, imagined skyscrapers reaching into the heavens and an Internet that brings us closer together. So we imagined these things, then we did them. And that's in our DNA. That's who we are. We're not done yet. And I hope every company, every college, every community, every citizen joins us as we lift up makers and builders and doers across the country. If we do, I know we're going to be able to create more good jobs in the years to come. We're going to create entire new industries that we can't yet imagine, although, I suspect Camille and Genevieve may have already figured it out. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And we're going to rebuild our economy and restore our middle class and give opportunities for people whose potential is not yet tapped. There are kids out there, there are adults out there right now who have a great idea. And they don't have access to the capital they need. They don't have the tools they need to put together a prototype. They don't know how to link up with folks who could help refine those ideas. And what the maker movement does, what technology does, what the information revolution does is it allows all those folks to suddenly be a part of this creative process. And what better place to do that than here in the United States of America? <p>This is a place where we know how to invent and we know how to dream and we know how to take risks. And this is a place where people who work hard have always been able to make it. We want to make sure that continues. So thanks for the great work you're all doing. It's very inspiring. <p>God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you.\" "
"143" "\"Sorry to mess up your meeting. <p>[<i>At this point, the President walked around and greeted members of the Council</i>.] <p>Well, hello, everybody. Sorry to interrupt the flow of the meeting. I just wanted to say thank you to all of you who are here. Some of you have been serving on our Export Council for quite some time. Some of you are here as new additions, but all of you have been extraordinarily successful in your various fields. And it gives us an enormous opportunity to hear from you in very concrete terms about how we can advance not just America's export agenda, but how we can build the kind of economic future that we want for our kids and our grandkids. <p>For the last 51 months, we have created jobs here in the United States, 9.4 million jobs in all. But we're going to have to create more. And one of the best ways to do it is to boost American manufacturing and American exports. That's why, since I came into office, we have been promoting American products and businesses when I travel overseas. It's why we created the President's Export Council in 2010. There are some of the most iconic companies in the world, Boeing being an example, Xerox being another one. <p>And with your help, exports have driven one-third of the economic growth in our recovery and now support over 11 million U.S. jobs. Last year, we exported $2.3 trillion in goods and services, which was an alltime high. And business executives around the globe say that the United States is the best place to locate, the best place to invest, and the best place to hire. And that's the first time that they've said that&mdash;that we are number one when it comes to their desirable location to invest&mdash;this is the first time they've said that in over a decade. <p>So the \\"Made in America\\" brand is stronger than ever. And as we saw yesterday at the first White House Maker Faire&mdash;I was out there watching these 22-year-olds coming up with incredible things&mdash;it is going to be a remarkable future that we have to look ahead to. Because in many ways, manufacturing is becoming easier; some of the barriers to entry are lowering. It gives inventors and entrepreneurs the opportunity to create new products and services in ways that we can't even imagine. And we want to make sure that all those trends accelerate here in the United States. <p>So this is a moment of opportunity. We've got a chance to expend&mdash;extend our competitive advantage in the world. That's what this meeting is about. One thing I want to focus on today is opening up even more new markets to \\"Made in America\\" products. We're working very hard to finalize trade agreements with our partners in Europe and in Asia that will make us the center of a free trade hub covering two-thirds of the world economy. And Mr. Michael Froman has been putting in a lot of miles trying to make sure that that happens. And I know he's consulted with some of you, not just big companies, but a lot of small and medium-sized businesses who have enormous opportunities if we're able to open up these markets and oftentimes are the ones that have the hardest time navigating through some of the barriers that are out there. <p>I especially want to increase trade and investment in the region. And this is going to be one of the issues we discuss in August. There has been some explosive growth in certain parts of the world where we're just not doing enough, Africa as being a prime example. You've got 6 of the 10 fastest growing economies in Africa, a young population that is growing rapidly. Some of these economies are doing very, very well, but we're not penetrating those markets as well as we should have. <p>And I think we've got a great opportunity in August with an African Leaders Summit that's going to be taking place for us to talk about trade and commerce, because that's really what that continent is interested in. They're not interested in aid as much as they are trade, development, and partnering with the private sector. <p>And as your businesses know well, when we export products overseas, we're creating jobs and opportunities here at home. That's the focus here today and every day of my Presidency: How do we create thriving businesses that are also able to create great jobs that allow people not just to stay in the middle class, but to work their way into the middle class if they work hard and take responsibility? And all of you have done that. <p>This Council is doing great work. And with that, I'm going to turn it back over to Jay to hear about some of the ideas that you've come up with and how we can help advance this agenda.\" "
"144" "\"Thank you, everybody. Please be seated. On behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the White House. <p>The man you see before you today, Corporal William Kyle Carpenter, should not be alive today. Hand grenades are one of the most awful weapons of war. They only weigh about a pound, but they're packed with TNT. If one lands nearby, you have mere seconds to seek cover. When it detonates, its fragments shoot out in every direction. And even at a distance, that spray of shrapnel can inflict devastating injuries on the human body. Up close, it's almost certain death. <p>But we are here because this man, this United States marine, faced down that terrible explosive power, that unforgiving force, with his own body&mdash;willingly and deliberately&mdash;to protect a fellow marine. When that grenade exploded, Kyle Carpenter's body took the brunt of the blast. His injuries were called \\"catastrophic.\\" It seemed as if he was going to die. While being treated, he went into cardiac arrest, and three times, he flatlined. Three times, doctors brought him back. <p>Along with his parents, who call Kyle's survival \\"our miracle,\\" we thank God they did. Because with that singular act of courage, Kyle, you not only saved your brother-in-arms, you displayed a heroism in the blink of an eye that will inspire for generations, valor worthy of our Nation's highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor. <p>Now, Kyle and I have actually met before. During his long recovery at Walter Reed, he and some of our other wounded warriors came to the White House to celebrate the World Series Champion St. Louis Cardinals. Some of you may be aware, I am a White Sox fan. [<i>Laughter</i>] Kyle likes the Braves. So it was a tough day for both of us. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But after the ceremony, Michelle and I had the chance to meet Kyle. And at the time, he was still undergoing surgeries. But he was up, and he was walking, and he was working his way toward being independent again, towards the man you see here today. And, Kyle, the main message we want to send is, welcome back. We are so proud to have you here. <p>We just spent some time not just with Kyle, but also with his wonderful family. And anybody who has had a chance to get to know this young man knows you're not going to get a better example of what you want in an American or a marine. Despite all the attention, he's still the same humble guy from Gilbert, South Carolina, population of about 600; I guess today it's only population 590-something. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>These days he's also at the University of South Carolina, \\"just a normal college student,\\" he says, cheering for the Gamecocks. You'll notice that Kyle doesn't hide his scars; he's proud of them and the service that they represent. And now, he tells me this, and so I'm just quoting him. He says, \\"The girls definitely like them.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] So he's kind of&mdash;he's working an angle on this thing. [<i>Laughter</i>] I wasn't sure whether I was supposed to say that in front of mom. [<i>Laughter</i>] But there's a quote there. In addition to our many distinguished guests, I want to welcome those who made this man the marine that he is: Kyle's father Jim, Kyle's lovely mom Robin, and his brothers Price and Peyton, one of whom is going to be joining Kyle at South Carolina, another Gamecock, and then we've got one who's going to be at the Citadel. We also have Kyle's Marine brothers who served with him in Afghanistan and through his recovery. And I also want to welcome the members of the Medal of Honor Society, whose ranks Kyle joins today. <p>Kyle and his fellow Marines served during the surge of forces that I ordered to Afghanistan early in my Presidency. Their mission was to drive the Taliban out of their strongholds, protect the Afghan people, and give them a chance to reclaim their communities. <p>Kyle and his platoon were in Helmand Province in Marja, pushing their way across open fields and muddy canals, bearing their heavy packs even as it could heat up to 115 degrees. In one small village, they turned a dusty compound into their base. The insurgents nearby gave their answer with sniper fire and automatic weapon fire and rocket-propelled grenades. <p>And that morning, Kyle said, \\"our alarm clock was AK-47 fire.\\" Some of the men were by their bunks, gearing up for another day. Some were heating up their MREs. Some were in makeshift ops centers&mdash;a simple mud building&mdash;planning the day's patrols. And up on the roof, behind a circle of sandbags, two marines manned their posts: Kyle and Lance Corporal Nicholas Eufrazio. <p>The compound started to take fire. Seeking cover, Kyle and Nick laid down low on their backs behind those sandbags. And then, the grenade landed with a thud, its pin already pulled. It was about to explode. <p>And Kyle has no memory of what happened next. What we do know is that there on that rooftop, he wasn't just with a fellow marine, he was with his best friend. Kyle and Nick had met in training. In Afghanistan, they patrolled together, day and night, a friendship forged in fire. Kyle says about Nick, \\"He was my point man, and I loved him like a brother.\\" <p>When the grenade landed, other marines in the compound looked up and saw it happen. Kyle tried to stand. He lunged forward toward that grenade, and then he disappeared into the blast. Keep in mind, at the time, Kyle was just 21 years old. But in that instant, he fulfilled those words of Scripture: \\"Greater love hath no man than this; that a man lay down his life for his friends.\\" <p>They found Kyle lying face down, directly over the blast area. His helmet was riddled with holes. His gear was melted. Part of his Kevlar vest was blown away. One of the doctors who treated him later said Kyle was \\"literally wounded from the top of his head to his feet.\\" <p>And for a moment, Kyle was still conscious. His eyes were open, but he couldn't see. Kyle remembers, \\"Everything went white.\\" And yet, even then, his thoughts were not of himself. One of the marines who was there remembers how Kyle kept asking one question, and that was whether Nick was okay. And then, as Kyle's strength drained away, he sensed the end was coming. So according to Kyle's memories: \\"My last thought [was to] make peace with God. I asked for His forgiveness. I was trying to make the best and most of my last few seconds here on Earth.\\" <p>The Medal of Honor is presented for gallantry on the battlefield. But today we also recognize Kyle Carpenter for his valor since, in the hard fight for recovery. Eventually, Kyle woke up after 5 weeks in a coma. I want you to consider what Kyle has endured just to stand here today: more than 2&frac12; years in the hospital, grueling rehabilitation, brain surgery to remove shrapnel from his head, nearly 40 surgeries to repair a collapsed lung, fractured fingers, a shattered right arm broken in more than 30 places, multiple skin grafts. He has a new prosthetic eye, a new jaw, new teeth&mdash;and one hell of a smile. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And Kyle is the first to give credit elsewhere. His doctors at Bethesda, he says, \\"put me back together well.\\" Today is also a reminder that in past wars, somebody with injuries as severe as Kyle's probably wouldn't have survived. So many of our wounded warriors from today's wars are alive not just because of remarkable advances in technology, but primarily because of the extraordinary dedication and skill of our military and our VA medical professionals. <p>So we need to keep doing everything we can in our power to give our wounded warriors and those who treat them the support that they need. And I think this is a wonderful opportunity to ask doctors Debra Malone and Lauren Greer and the rest of Kyle's medical team who are here to please stand. I see their amazing work every time I visit Bethesda, every time I visited Walter Reed. It's pretty rare where you've got a job where you just know you're doing God's work every single day. And they do an incredible job, so thank you. [<i>Applause</i>] Thank you. Thank you for the miracles you work for our wounded troops and veterans. <p>Now, Kyle says he'll wear this medal for all who serve and for those who didn't make it back and for those who struggle still. So today we also honor two members of his team who made the ultimate sacrifice in that deployment: Kyle's friends Lance Corporal Timothy M. Jackson of Corbin, Kentucky, and Lance Corporal Dakota R. Huse of Greenwood, Louisiana. <p>And our thoughts are also with the marine who Kyle saved that day, his brother, Nick. I had the opportunity to meet Nick as well nearly 2 years after the blast on one of my visits to Walter Reed. Nick also suffered grievous wounds. As a result of traumatic brain injury, he couldn't speak for more than a year. He also endured multiple surgeries. Today, his recovery continues. He lives at home with his family in Plymouth, Massachusetts, where he is watching this ceremony. So, Nick, on behalf of all of us, I want you to know we honor your sacrifice as well. Your perseverance is an inspiration. And just as Kyle was there for you, our Nation will be there for you and your family as you grow stronger in the years ahead. <p>If any of our wounded warriors seek an example&mdash;let me amend that&mdash;if any American seeks a model of the strength and resilience that define us as a people, including this newest 9/11 generation, I want you to consider Kyle. After everything he's been through, he skis, he snowboards, he's jumped from a plane, with a parachute, thankfully. [<i>Laughter</i>] He trudged through a 6-mile Mud Run, completed the Marine Corps Marathon, says he wants to do a triathlon. He's a motivational speaker, an advocate for his fellow wounded warriors. He's thinking about majoring in psychology so he can use his own experiences to help others. He got stellar grades. And by the way, he's only 24 years old and says, \\"I am just getting started.\\" <p>In other words, Kyle is a shining example of what our Nation needs to encourage: these veterans who come home and then use their incredible skills and talents to keep our country strong. And we can all learn from Kyle's example. <p>As we prepare for the reading of the citation, I'd like to close with his own words, a message, I think, for every American: \\"It took a life-changing event to get me to truly appreciate the precious and amazing life I have been blessed with. Please take it from me, enjoy every day to the fullest, don't take life too seriously, always try to make it count, appreciate the small and simple things, be kind and help others, let the ones you love always know you love them, and when things get hard, trust there is a bigger plan and that you will be stronger for it.\\" Pretty good message. <p>Corporal William Kyle Carpenter should not be alive today, but the fact that he is gives us reason to trust that there is indeed a bigger plan. So God bless you, Kyle. God bless all who serve and protect the precious and amazing life that we are blessed with. May God continue to bless and keep strong the United States of America. Semper Fi. <p>[<i>At this point, Lt. Cmdr. Timothy J. Myers, USN, Navy Aide to the President, read the citation. The President then presented the medal, assisted by Maj. Steven M. Schreiber, USMC, Marine Corps Aide to the President. Following the presentation, Rear Adm. Margaret G. Kibben, USN, Chaplain of the U.S. Marine Corps, said a prayer.</i>] <p>Well, that brings us to the conclusion of this ceremony, but not the reception and party. And so I want to thank everybody again for being here, especially Kyle's wonderful family and his parents. And I understand that the food here at the White House is pretty good&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;so I already told Kyle's brothers that they should be chowing down. But that goes for everybody else as well. And I think the drinks are free. I don't know what&mdash;although it's still early in the afternoon. All right? <p>Thank you very much, everybody. Let's big&mdash;give one more round of applause to our latest Medal of Honor winner, Kyle Carpenter.\" "
"145" "\"Hi, everybody. As President, my top priority is rebuilding an economy where everybody who works hard has the chance to get ahead. <p>That's what I'll spend some time talking about on Monday at the White House Summit on Working Families. We're bringing together business leaders and workers to talk about the challenges that working parents face every day and how we can address them together. <p>Take paid family leave. Many jobs don't offer adequate leave to care for a new baby or an ailing parent, so workers can't afford to be there when their family needs them the most. That's wrong. And it puts us way behind the times. Only three countries in the world report that they don't offer paid maternity leave. Three. And the United States is one of them. It's time to change that. A few States have acted on their own to give workers paid family leave, but this should be available to everyone, because all Americans should be able to afford to care for a family member in need. <p>Childcare is another challenge. Most working families I know can't afford thousands a year for childcare, but often, that's what it costs. That leaves parents scrambling just to make sure their kids are safe while they're at work. Forget about giving them the high-quality early childhood education that helps the kid succeed in life. <p>Then there's the issue of flexibility: the ability to take a few hours off for a parent-teacher conference or to work from home when your child is sick. Most workers want it, but not enough of them have it. What's more, it not only makes workers happier; studies show that flexibility can make workers more productive and reduce worker turnover and absenteeism. And that's good for business. <p>At a time when women make up about half of America's workforce, outdated workplace policies that make it harder for mothers to work hold our entire economy back. But these aren't just problems for women. Men also care about who's watching their kids. They're rearranging their schedules to make it to soccer games and school plays. Lots of sons help care for aging parents. And plenty of fathers would love to be home for their new baby's first weeks in the world. <p>In fact, in a new study, nearly half of all parents&mdash;women and men&mdash;report that they've said no to a job, not because they didn't want it, but because it would be too hard on their families. When that many talented, hard-working people are forced to choose between work and family, something's wrong. Other countries are making it easier for people to have both. We should too if we want American businesses to compete and win in the global economy. <p>Family leave, childcare, flexibility&mdash;these aren't frills, they're basic needs. They shouldn't be bonuses, they should be the bottom line. <p>The good news is, some businesses are embracing family-friendly policies, because they know it's key to attracting and retaining talented employees. And I'm going to keep highlighting the businesses that do. Because I take this personally. I take it personally as the son and grandson of some strong women who worked hard to support my sister and me and as the husband of a brilliant woman who struggled to balance work and has raised our girls when my job often kept me away and as the father of two beautiful young ladies, whom I want to be there for as much as I can and who I hope will be able to have families and careers of their own one day. <p>We know from our history that our economy grows best from the middle out, that our country does better when everybody participates, when everyone's talents are put to use, when we all have a fair shot. That's the America I believe in. And that's the America I'll keep fighting for every day. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"146" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. This crowd looks fired up. All right, everybody, have a seat, have a seat, have a seat. You look like you've been busy. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes! <p><i>Audience member.</i> We've been waiting on you. <p><i>The President.</i> I know that's right. I know that's right. [<i>Laughter</i>] Good afternoon, everybody. Have a seat, have a seat, have a seat. Take a&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> I love you, Mr. President. <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. [<i>Applause</i>] I do. Well, welcome to the White House Summit on Working Families. And thanks to all of you for joining us. I know that for most of you, you are taking time off of work or family, or both, to be here. And I know that's a sacrifice. And I know just juggling schedules can be tough. And in fact, that's one of the reasons that we are here today. <p>I want to thank our cohosts, Secretary of Labor Tom Perez&mdash;give him a big round of applause&mdash;as well as Neera Tanden and everyone at the Center for American Progress for the great work that they did. Thanks as well to all the Members of Congress who are participating, especially Nancy Pelosi and the members of the Democratic Women's Working Group. And a long-time friend and champion of families and women and veterans, Connie Milstein; we could not have pulled this off without Connie's great assistance, so we want to thank Connie. <p>So I just walked over to Chipotle's for lunch. [<i>Laughter</i>] I caused a lot of havoc, as you might expect. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member. </i>Burrito bowl! <p><i>The President</i>. It had been a while since I had the burrito bowl, and it was good. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I went there with four new buddies of mine. One of them is a father of a four-year-old and a two-month-old who has worked with his wife to come up with a flexible plan where he works 3 or 4 days a week. She works 3 or 4 days a week. And the reason is because, as Roger put it, he thinks it's important that he is able to bond with these kids just as much as his wife is. <p>Lisa, you just heard from, who had twins who were prematurely born. And because her company was supportive, she was able to not just thrive and watch her kids grow up, but she's also been able to be promoted and continue to succeed in her company without being on a slower track while maintaining that life-family balance, which is terrific&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;worth applauding. <p>Shirley Young from New York is&mdash;works at a nursing home, and she's got older children. And she was most interested in talking about the fact that when her son, it was discovered, had curvature of the spine, she had health care that she could count on. Otherwise, there was no way that she could deal with it. And her benefits on the job were good enough that she could use some vacation time when he was able&mdash;when he had to go to the doctor. And then Shelby from Denver&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;Shelby has got a little fan club here. Shelby talked about the fact that on her job, it's been a little more challenging. Her kids are older, and she's going back to school. And it is wonderful that she is actually now taking some classes with her children and they're helping explain math to her. [<i>Laughter</i>] On the other hand, she's also got an aging parent. And when he had to go to the doctor, they don't have a policy of paid family leave. And since it's hard making ends meet in the first place, her dad had to end up getting on a bus for eye surgery and come back on his own, because she couldn't afford to take the time off. <p>Now, each of these folks come from different parts of the country. They have different occupations, different income levels. And yet what bound all of us together was a recognition that work gives us a sense of place and dignity, as well as income. And it is critically important, but family is also the bedrock of our lives, and we don't want a society in which folks are having to make a choice between those two things. And there are better decisions that we can make and there are not-so-good decisions that we can make as a society to support this balance between work and family. <p>Most of us&mdash;most of our days consist of work, family, and not much else. And those two spheres are constantly interacting with each other. When we're with our family, sometimes, we're thinking about work; when we're at work, we're thinking about family. That's a pretty universal experience. It's true when you are President of the United States. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, I am lucky that my daughters were a bit older by the time I became President, so I never had to meet a world leader with Cheerios stuck to my pants. [<i>Laughter</i>] That has not happened. And I'm also lucky because we live above the store, so to speak. [<i>Laughter</i>] I have a very short commute. [<i>Laughter</i>] And as a consequence, we've been able to organize ourselves to have dinner with Michelle and the girls almost every night. And that's pretty much the first time we've been able to do that in our lives. <p>But before I moved into the White House, I was away a lot, sometimes with work, sometimes with campaigning. Michelle was working full time and was at home with the responsibility all too often of dealing with everything that the girls needed. And so we understand how lucky we are now, because there was a big chunk of time when we were doing what so many of you have to deal with every day, and that is, figuring out how do we make this whole thing work. <p>A lot of Americans are not as lucky as we have been. It is hard sometimes just to get by. Our businesses have created jobs for 51 consecutive months&mdash;9.4 [million; White House correction.] new jobs in all. But we all know somebody out there who is still looking for work. And there are a whole lot of people who are working harder than ever, but can't seem to get ahead and pay all the bills at the end of the month. Despite the fact that our economy has grown and those of us at the very top have done very well, the average wage, the average income hasn't gone up for 15 years in any meaningful way. And that means that relative to 15 years ago, a lot of families just aren't that much better off. And the sacrifices they make for their families go beyond just missing family dinner. <p>You look at something like workplace flexibility. This is so important to our family&mdash;this was so important to our family when I was away, because if Malia or Sasha got sick, or the babysitter did not show up, it was Michelle who got the call. And fortunately, she had an employer who understood if she needed to leave work in the middle of the day or change her schedule suddenly. In fact, actually, when she applied for the job, she brought Sasha, who was then about 6 months, in her car seat into the interview. She made&mdash;just to kind of explain, this is what you will be dealing with if you hire me. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And so they signed up for that. And that flexibility made all the difference to our families. But a lot of working moms and dads can't do that. They don't have the leverage. They're not being recruited necessarily where they can dictate terms of employment. And as a consequence, if they need to bring their mom to the doctor or take an afternoon off to see their kid's school play, it would mean them losing income that they can't afford to lose. And even when working from home from time to time is doable, it's often not an option, even though studies show that flexibility makes workers happier and helps companies lower turnover and raise productivity. <p>The same goes with paid family leave. A lot of jobs do not offer it. So when a new baby arrives or an aging parent gets sick, workers have to make painful decisions about whether they can afford to be there when their families need them the most. Many women can't even get a paid day off to give birth. Now, that's a pretty low bar. [<i>Laughter</i>] You would think&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that that we should be able to take care of. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>For many hourly workers, taking just a few days off can mean losing their job. And even though unpaid family leave is available, if you can't pay the bills already, the idea of taking a couple days off unpaid may mean you can't make the mortgage payment or the rent payment at the end of the month. <p>Or look at childcare. In most countries, it costs&mdash;or in most parts of the country, it costs thousands of dollars a year. In fact, in 31 States, decent childcare costs more than in-State college tuition&mdash;in 31 States, in more than half the States. I recently got a letter from a woman in Minnesota whose kids' preschool is so expensive, it costs more than her monthly mortgage payment. Now, she's made a determination to make that sacrifice for her kids, but a lot of working families can't make that sacrifice. And by the way, there are other countries that know how to do childcare well. I mean, this isn't rocket science. <p>Or look at the minimum wage. Low-wage occupations disproportionately represented by women. Nearly 28 million Americans would benefit if we raised the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. And we're not just talking about young people on their first job. The average worker who would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage is 35 years old. Many have kids; a majority are women. And right now many full-time minimum wage workers are not making enough to keep their children out of poverty. <p>So these are just a few of the challenges that working parents face. And every day, I hear from parents all across the country. They are doing everything right. They are working hard, they are living responsibly, they are taking care of their children, they're participating in their community. And these letters can be heartbreaking, because at the end of the day, it doesn't feel like they're getting ahead. And all too often, it feels like they're slipping behind. And a lot of the time, they end up blaming themselves, thinking, if I just work a little harder&mdash;if I plan a little bit better, if I sleep a little bit less, if I stretch every dollar a little bit farther&mdash;maybe I can do it. And that thought may have crossed the minds of some of the folks here from time to time. <p>Part of the purpose of this summit is to make clear, you're not alone. Because here's the thing: These problems are not typically the result of poor planning or too little diligence on the parts of moms or dads, and they cannot just be fixed by working harder or being an even better parent. All too often, they are the results of outdated policies and old ways of thinking. Family leave, childcare, workplace flexibility, a decent wage&mdash;these are not frills, they are basic needs. They shouldn't be bonuses. They should be part of our bottom line as a society. That's what we're striving towards. <p>Parents who work full time should earn enough to pay the bills, and they should be able to head off to work every day knowing that their children are in good hands. Workers who give their all should know that if they need a little flexibility, they can have it, because their employers understand that it's hard to be productive if you've got a sick kid at home or a childcare crisis. <p>Talented, hard-working people should be able to say yes to a promotion or a great new opportunity without worrying about the price that their family will pay. There was a new poll by Nielsen's that found that nearly half of all working parents say they have turned down a job not because they didn't want it, but because it would put too much of a burden on their families. Half. When that many members of our workforce are forced to choose between a job and their family, something's wrong. <p>And here's a critical point: All too often, these issues are thought of as women's issues, which, I guess, means you can kind of scoot them aside a little bit. At a time when women are nearly half of our workforce, among our most skilled workers, are the primary breadwinners in more families than ever before, anything that makes life harder for women makes life harder for families and makes life harder for children. When women succeed, America succeeds, so there's no such thing as a women's issue. [<i>Applause</i>] There's no such thing as a women's issue. This is a family issue and an American issue. These are commonsense issues. [<i>Applause</i>] These are commonsense issues. <p>This is about you too, men. [<i>Laughter</i>] Men care about having high-quality childcare. Dads rearrange their schedules to make it to teacher's meetings and school plays, just like moms. Although, somebody pointed out to me&mdash;this is a useful insight&mdash;that when dads say, yes, I've got to leave early to go to the parent-teacher's conference, everybody in the office says, oh, isn't that nice. [<i>Laughter</i>] And then, when women do it, everybody is all, like, is she really committed to the job? Right? So there can be a double standard there. But sons help care for aging parents. A whole lot of fathers would love to be home for their new baby's first weeks in the world. <p>People ask me what do I love most about being President, and it's true Air Force One is on the list. [<i>Laughter</i>] The Truman Balcony is a really nice view. [<i>Laughter</i>] But one of the&mdash;I was telling folks the other day that one of the best perks about being President is anybody will hand you their baby. They&mdash;here. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So I get this baby fix, like, two or three times a week, where I'm&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. But the reason it's so powerful is because I remember taking the night shift when Malia was born and when Sasha was born and being up at 2 in the morning changing diapers and burping them and singing to them and reading them stories, and watching SportsCenter once in a while&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;which I thought was good for their development. [<i>Laughter</i>] It was. We want them to be well rounded. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But the point is, I was lucky enough to be able to take some time off so that I was there for the 2 a.m. feeding and the soothing and just getting to know them and making sure they knew me. And that bond is irreplaceable. And I want every father and every child to have that opportunity. And&mdash;but that requires a society that makes it easier for us to give folks that opportunity. <p>So the bottom line is, 21st-century families deserve 21st-century workplaces. And our economy demands them, because it's going to help us compete. It's going to help us lead. And that means paid family leave, especially paid parental leave. There is only one developed country in the world that does not offer paid maternity leave, and that is us. And that is not the list you want to be on by your lonesome. It's time to change that, because all Americans should be able to afford to care for their families. <p>It means high-quality early education. We know that the investment we make in those early years pays off over a child's entire lifetime. And these programs give parents a great place to know that their kids are thriving while they're at work. Other countries know how to do this. If France can figure this out, we can figure it out. [<i>Laughter</i>] We can figure it out. All our kids need to benefit from that early enrichment. <p>It means treating pregnant workers fairly, because too many are still forced to choose between their health and their job. Right now, if you're pregnant, you could potentially get fired for taking too many bathroom breaks&mdash;clearly from a boss who has never been pregnant&mdash;or forced on unpaid leave. That makes no sense. Congress should pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act without delay. <p>Now, speaking of Congress, by the way&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> No, don't boo, vote. As long as Congress refuses to act on these policies, we're going to need you to raise your voices. We need you to tell Congress don't talk about how you support families, actually support families. Don't talk the talk, we want you to walk the walk. <p>In the meantime, if Congress will not act, we're going to need mayors to act. We'll need Governors and State legislators to act. We need CEOs to act. And I promise you, you will have a President who will take action to support working families. <p>The good news is, you don't have to do it alone, and I don't have to do it alone. Now, that's part of the purpose of this summit, is to recognize that there's all kinds of exciting stuff going on around the country. We just have to make sure that we lift up conversations that are taking place at the kitchen table every single day. Some businesses are already taking the lead, knowing that family-friendly policies are good business practices. That's how you keep talented employees. That's how you build loyalty and inspire your workers to go the extra mile for your company. <p>Some of those businesses are represented here today. So JetBlue, for example, has a flexible, work-from-home plan in place for its customer service representatives. They found it led to happier and more productive employees and it lowered their costs, which translated into higher profits and lower ticket prices for their customers. It was good business. <p>In 2007, Google realized that women were leaving the company at twice the rate that men left, and one of the reasons was that the maternity leave policy wasn't competitive enough. So they increased paid leave for new parents&mdash;moms and dads&mdash;to 5 months. And that helped to cut the rate of women leaving the company in half. Good business sense. Cisco estimates that by letting their employees telecommute, they save more than $275 million each year. They say it's the main reason why they're rated one of the best places to work in America. <p>So it's easy to see how policies like this make for better places to work. There's also a larger economic case for it. The strength of our economy rests on whether we're getting the most out of our Nation's talent, whether we're making it possible for every citizen to contribute to our growth and prosperity. We do better when we field an entire team, not just part of a team. <p>And the key to staying competitive in the global economy is your workforce, is your talent. Right now too many folks are on the sidelines: They have the desire and the capacity to work, but they're held back by one obstacle or another. So it's our job to remove those obstacles: help working parents, improve job training, improve early childhood education, invest in better infrastructure so people are getting to work safely. Just about everything I do as President is to make sure that we're not leaving any of our Nation's talent behind. That's what this summit is all about. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Working families love you, Mr. President. <p><i>The President.</i> Well, thank you. [<i>Laughter</i>] So we're seeing businesses set a good example. We've got States who are setting a good example. California, Rhode Island, New Jersey all gave workers paid family leave. Connecticut offers paid sick days, and so does New York City. Since I asked Congress to raise the minimum wage last year&mdash;they've been a little slow, shockingly, but 13 States have taken steps to raise it on their own. In my State of the Union Address this year, I asked mayors and Governors and CEOs, do what you can to raise your workers' wages, and a lot of them are. A lot of them are doing it. <p>Because even if Republicans in Congress refuse to budge on this issue this year, everybody knows America deserves a raise, including Republican voters out there. There are a lot of them who support it. And I've said I will work with anybody, Democrat or Republican, to increase opportunities for American workers. And Nancy Pelosi is ready to work. <p>And we should. Now, many of these issues, they're not partisan until they get to Washington. Back home, folks sitting around the kitchen table, this isn't partisan. Nobody says, well, I don't know, I'm not sure whether the Republican platform agrees with paid family leave. They're thinking, I could really use a couple of paid days off to take care of dad, regardless of what their party affiliation is. <p>So even as we're waiting for Congress, whenever I can act on my own, I'm going to. That's why we raised the minimum wage for employees of Federal contractors. Nobody who cooks our troops' meals or washes their dishes should have to live in poverty. That's a disgrace. That's why I ordered Tom Perez, our Secretary of Labor, to review overtime protections for millions of workers to make sure they're getting the pay that they deserve. <p>That's why I signed an Executive order preventing retaliation against federally contracted workers who share their salary information or raise issues of unequal compensation, because I think if you do the same work, you should get the same pay and you should be able to enforce it, which is why Congress should pass the Paycheck Fairness Act today for all workers and not just federally contracted workers. <p>And yes, that's why I fought to pass the Affordable Care Act, to give every American access to high-quality affordable care no matter where they work. So far, over 8 million people have enrolled in plans through the ACA. Millions with preexisting conditions have been prevented or have been confident that their insurance companies have not been able to block them from getting health insurance. And by the way, women are no longer charged more for being women. <p>They're getting the basic care they need, including reproductive care. And millions are now free to take the best job for their families without worrying about losing their health care. Today I'm going to sign a Presidential memorandum directing every agency in the Federal Government to expand access to flexible work schedules and giving employees the right to request those flexible work schedules. <p>Because whether it's the public sector or the private sector, if there's a way to make our employees more productive and happier, every employer should want to find it. And to help parents trying to get ahead, I'm going to direct my Secretary of Labor, Tom Perez, to invest $25 million in helping people who want to enroll in jobs programs, but don't currently have access to the childcare that they need, to enroll in those job training programs. We're going to make it easier for parents to get the training they need to get a good job. <p>So we're going to do everything we can to create more jobs and more opportunity for Americans. And then, let me just close by saying that I was interviewed in the runup to this on Friday. Somebody asked, well, it's well known that women are more likely to vote for Democrats, now&mdash;which I said, women are smarter. This is true. <p>But they said, so isn't this Working Families Summit political? And I said, no, I take this personally. I was raised by strong women who worked hard to support my sister and me. I saw what it was like for a single mom who was trying to go to school and work at the same time. And I remember her coming home and having to try to fix us dinner, and me saying, are we eating that again? [<i>Laughter</i>] And she saying, you know what, buddy, I really don't want to hear anything out of you right now, because I've got to go do some homework after this. <p>And I remember times where my mom had to take some food stamps to make sure that we had enough nutritious food in the house, and I know what she went through. I know what my grandmother went through, working her way up from a secretary to the vice president of a bank. But she should have run the bank, except she hit a glass ceiling and was training people who would leapfrog ahead of her year after year. I know what that's like. I've seen it. <p>I take this personally, because I'm the husband of a brilliant woman who struggled to balance work and raising our girls when I was away. And I remember the stresses that were on Michelle, which I'm sure she'll be happy to share with you later today. [<i>Laughter</i>] And most of all, I take it personally because I am the father of two unbelievable young ladies. And I want them to be able to have families. And I want them to be able to have careers. And I want them to go as far as their dreams will take them. And I want a society that supports that. <p>And I take this personally as the President of the country that built the greatest middle class the world has ever known and inspired people to reach new heights and invent and innovate and drew immigrants from every corner of the world because they understood that no matter what you look like or where you come from, here in America, you can make it. That's the promise of America. That's what we're going to keep on fighting for. That's what you're fighting for. That's what this summit is all about. <p>Let's go out there and get to work. Thank you, guys. I love you. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"147" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Well, welcome to the White House. And thank you, Mr. Commissioner, for the introduction. I am joined by two of my favorite golf partners, the Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, and the Speaker of the House, John Boehner. In each instance, they have to give me strokes. My good friend, former Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, is with us as well. Where's Ray? He was back here somewhere. Well, okay. He probably went out because it's a nice day to play, and we should actually be outside. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Let me make a couple of observations. First of all, I'm not used to seeing these guys in suits. Spieth told me that this is the first suit he's ever bought. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm pointing out Jordan now because they might card him later at the reception. [<i>Laughter</i>] We've got some outstanding players, both on the American team and the international team. We've got extraordinary veterans like Ernie Els and Tiger Woods. We've got rookies like Jordan. We've got last year's team captains: Fred Couples from the United States and Nick Price for the world. We've got next year's captains: Jay Haas for the Americans and Nick Price for the world. <p>Now, last year was the second time I'd been honorary chairman of the President's Cup. The United States won both times. I'm just saying. [<i>Laughter</i>] As much as I'd like to take all the credit, the truth is that the U.S. has now beaten the international team in five straight tournaments. Any comment on that, gentleman? [<i>Laughter</i>] Okay, I didn't think so. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I do want to give the international team credit for keeping things interesting. After 2 days of match play, the U.S. led by only a point. And for those of you at home who don't exactly follow international team golf, that means it was close. But on the morning of day 3, the Americans won four of five matches. And on Sunday, Tiger clinched the victory for the third straight President's Cup. So we are extraordinarily proud of the President's Cup team. We hope our World Cup team takes a page out of their playbook when they take on Germany this Thursday. <p>I want folks from the international team [to know; White House correction.] that we didn't just invite them to rub it in. We want to say thank you to both teams and to the PGA Tour, because as was already pointed out by the commissioner, the money raised by the President's Cup goes to charities chosen by the players. Last year, you raised more than $5 million, which was a new record. <p>It happens that philanthropy is a second job for many of these players. Ernie's \\"Els for Autism\\" foundation just broke ground on a new children's education center in Florida. And I was mentioning to Ernie that families who have an autistic child couldn't be more thankful for the work that his foundation does and the education and awareness that it's brought about. Zach Johnson, with his foundation, supports a free clinic in Zach's hometown of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Through the \\"Blessings in a Backpack\\" program, Jason Dufner and his wife Amanda help make sure the kids in their home State of Alabama have enough to eat. The Tiger Woods Foundation creates learning centers and scholarships to help low-income young people succeed in school. And they're holding a tournament in Maryland this Thursday, and Tiger is getting back to the course early in order to host it in person. So the list goes on. All of these guys are giving back to their respective communities. And we want to thank them for being such outstanding ambassadors for golf, who use their success not just on the course, but also to support worthy causes off of the course. I want to congratulate Team U.S.A. on another big win. Best of luck as you defend the title in South Korea next year. <p>And I want to thank Phil Mickelson for giving me an excellent tip on my sand game, because I'm pretty sure I can shave at least two or three strokes if I can just get out of the darn sand. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Vice President Joe Biden.</i> Absolutely. I'm confident that's true, Mr. President. <p><i>The President.</i> You sure? <p><i>Vice President Biden.</i> I'm positive. <p><i>The President.</i> Okay. Thank you very much, everybody. Congratulations to the two outstanding teams. Appreciate it.\" "
"148" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody. Please have a seat. And welcome to the White House. Welcome to all of you and, most of all, it's great to welcome back the six-time NASCAR Sprint Champion, Mr. Jimmie Johnson. Give him a big round of applause. <p>We've got some big NASCAR fans here today, including some Members of Congress. And I want to recognize Rick Hendrick, the owner of Hendrick Motorsports, Crew Chief Chad Knaus, as well as Brian France, and the entire NASCAR community. <p>Now, everybody knows I'm a Chicago guy, and usually, when we do these sports events, I make some crack about how the football team is not as good as the '85 Bears or the basketball team is not as good as the Bulls. But today I can't really say anything because Jimmie Johnson is pretty much the Michael Jordan of NASCAR. [<i>Laughter</i>] Like Mike, Jimmie has won six championships in 8 years. He won a few titles, took a 2-year break, decided, you know what, it's not that interesting, and then got back to winning again. And now opposing drivers are saying things like, unfortunately, we're driving during the Jimmie Johnson era. He's the best there ever was. <p>So these days we've got a lot of kids, all across the country, who want to be like Jimmie, and why shouldn't they? He is the only driver to make the Chase all 10 years it's been in existence. He won his \\"Six Pack\\" faster than anybody in NASCAR history. This season, he is chasing his seventh title, which would tie him with Dale Earnhardt and \\"The King,\\" Richard Petty, for the most ever. And as Chad once said, he can do things with a race car that most mortals cannot. And Chad should know, because he has been Jimmie's crew chief for 13 years. And while sometimes, the two might sound like an old married couple&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;sniping at each other over the radio, Jimmie knows that without Chad and Rick and the entire team at Hendrick Motorsports, he'd be just another mortal making left turns. And that's why Jimmie brought along the over-the-wall guys from his pit crew to share in today's celebration. <p>I will say, by the way, I love watching the pit crew. I don't know how you all do it, but it is amazing. And to see the teamwork and athleticism, it's just remarkable. And that's the kind of teamwork and leadership that has made Jimmie a champ not only on the racetrack, but off it. <p>Since 2006, the Jimmie Johnson Foundation has donated almost $7 million toward grants and resources for public schools and charities like Ronald McDonald House and Habitat for Humanity. He is running a Wellness Challenge to encourage his fans to get healthy and get in shape, which Michelle is very happy about. He met some of our brave wounded warriors before this event and obviously is grateful for their sacrifice. <p>And this spring, Jimmie joined in the Ban Bossy campaign to help encourage leadership among young girls. Jimmie caught some flak, I understand, for doing it, but he is the father of two girls, and he understands how important it is for us to lift up our young women and make sure that they know they can do the same stuff that any boy can. So as somebody who is accustomed to being criticized once in a while, I just want to give you some advice: Keep at it. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>NASCAR Driver Jimmie Johnson.</i> Thank you. <i>The President.</i> Do what you think is right, and you're right on this one. <p>For Jimmie, it also means giving back to his community, being a good husband to his gorgeous wife Chani, and his daughters, Evie and Lydia, and of course, dominating the track. And this year he is back at it. He has already got more wins than any other driver, so maybe we should just make it easier on everybody, give the number-48 car a permanent White House pass. [<i>Laughter</i>] Don't take my parking spot. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Mr. Johnson.</i> Yes, sir. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> And no burnouts in the Portico. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I just want to say to the entire team, to Hendrick Motorsports, to Chad, to the pit crew, most of all, to Jimmie Johnson: Congratulations. Keep up the great work.\" "
"149" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, hello, hello! Hello! Well, it's good to be back. First of all, I just want to thank Carol Browner, one of my favorite people. We miss her in the White House, but it looks like she has occupied herself. [<i>Laughter</i>] We appreciate all the work that you do helping to protect our planet and to give our children a brighter future, so give Carol a big round of applause. I want to thank Gene Karpinski and everybody at LCV for having me here tonight. <p>I was telling the story&mdash;many people know this&mdash;I know you think I'm here just because, like, I care about the environment&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. No, it's deeper than that. I guess Gene told this story: When I ran for the U.S. Senate, I was decidedly the underdog; really, nobody knew me. And LCV, because it's a good-government type, goes through process, and they had the board interview all the candidates. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I went in, and I did my shtick&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and they endorsed me. And I was not at all favored to win, and it was the first and probably only prominent national organization to endorse me in the primary; everybody endorsed me in the general. [<i>Laughter</i>] But it was&mdash;for me, at least, it was a testament that this was an organization that cared about ideas and obviously had a really good eye for talent. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I am here primarily out of loyalty. There's a little payback going on here. [<i>Laughter</i>] But then, there is also the whole protecting the planet thing. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>The work you do to protect our planet and our country and dealing with the rapidly growing threat of climate change is even more urgent and more important than the last time I spoke to you back in 2006 when I was still a Senator. Because we know two big things: We know more about the threat than we did back then, and we know through experience that we can act; that we don't have to be passive, that we can act in ways that protect our environment and promote economic growth at the same time. We know we can do it. We've shown we can do it. <p>So exactly 1 year ago today, I was at Georgetown University to announce my climate action plan. And I remember this because it was 95 degrees. [<i>Laughter</i>] The staff purposely put the speech outside, and so there are a number of photographs of me wiping my brow, and I don't sweat usually. I was hot. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I started my speech the same way I start all my speeches on climate change, with the facts. Not a lot of spin, just the facts. <p>We know that burning fossil fuels release carbon dioxide. We know that carbon dioxide traps heat. We know that the levels of carbon dioxide are higher than they've been in 800,000 years. We know that the 20 warmest years on record for our planet all happened since 1990 and last month was the warmest May ever recorded. We know that communities across the country are struggling with longer wildfire seasons, more severe droughts, heavier rainfall, more frequent flooding. That's why, last month, hundreds of experts declared that climate change is no longer a distant threat, it's \\"moved firmly into the present.\\" Those are the facts. You can ignore the facts; you can't deny the facts. <p>So the question is not whether we need to act. The overwhelming judgment of science, accumulated and measured and reviewed and sliced and diced over decades, has put that to rest. The question is whether we have the will to act before it's too late. Because if we fail to protect the world we leave our children, then we fail in the most fundamental purpose of us being here in the first place. For more than 40 years, that has been your mission: preserve and protect this planet we call home. And by the way, it's been the mission of a lot of Members of Congress who are here today. It's been a priority of mine for as long as I've been in office. And part of it, maybe, is growing up in Hawaii, where every day you appreciate the wonder of your planet, but you also understand how fragile it is. So we're working in a few ways to do our part: by using more clean energy, less dirty energy, and wasting less energy throughout our economy. <p>Right now America generates more clean energy than ever before. Thanks in part to the investments we made in the Recovery Act. You remember that old Recovery Act? [<i>Laughter</i>] It was the largest investment in green energy and technology in U.S. history. That was just one of its attributes. <p>As a consequence of those investments, the electricity we generate from wind has tripled since 2008. The energy we generate from the sun has increased more than tenfold. Every 4 minutes, another American home or business goes solar. And last year alone, solar jobs jumped 20 percent. <p>And the good news is, we can do even better. So my climate action plan will help us double our electricity from renewable energy again by 2020. And I've&mdash;I directed the Interior Department to green-light enough private renewable energy capacity on public lands to power more than 6 million homes. The Department of Defense, the biggest energy consumer in America, is installing 3 gigawatts of renewable power on its bases. So we are going to continue to incentivize the adaptation of technologies that are not going to solve our entire problem&mdash;there's no silver bullet&mdash;but what we're seeing is unit costs go down, efficiency and power generation going up. We're moving, and it's making a difference. <p>So that's the first part of our plan: generating and using more clean energy. Then we've got to use less dirty energy. Since I took office, we've doubled how far our cars and trucks will go on a gallon of gas by the middle of the next decade. We're helping families and businesses save billions of dollars with more efficient homes and buildings and appliances. By the end of the next decade, these combined efficiency standards for appliances and Federal buildings will reduce carbon pollution by at least 3 billion tons compared to when I took office, and that's an amount equal to what our entire energy sector emits in nearly half a year. <p>So together, we've held our carbon emissions to levels not seen in about 20 years. And since 2006, no country on Earth has reduced its total carbon pollution by as much as the United States of America. <p>And by the way, the private sector knows how important this is. Today, at the White House, some of America's leading foundations and impact investors committed more than $300 million to accelerate clean energy technology and energy-efficient buildings. So we're making progress on that front. <p>But everybody here knows, for the sake of our kids, we've got to do more. Today, about 40 percent of America's carbon pollution comes from our power plants. There are no Federal limits to the amount those plants can pump into the air. None. We limit the amount of toxic chemicals like mercury and sulfur and arsenic in our air and water, but power plants can dump as much carbon pollution into our atmosphere as they want. It's not smart, it's not right, it's not safe, and I determined it needs to stop. <p>And so that's why, in my speech a year ago, I directed the EPA to build on the efforts of a lot of States and cities and companies, and I told them, come up with commonsense standards for reducing dangerous carbon pollution from our power plants. Last month, I unveiled those proposed standards, which will cut down our carbon pollution and our smog and our soot that threaten the health of our most vulnerable Americans, including children and the elderly. We've constructed it so that States have the flexibility to meet these standards with whatever clean energy sources make sense for them, including renewables and taking advantage of natural glass&mdash;natural gas, replacing even dirtier energy sources. And in just the first year that these standards go into effect, they'll help avoid up to 100,000 asthma attacks, about 2,100 heart attacks. Those numbers keep on going up after the first year. And we're taking a whole bunch of carbon out of the atmosphere. <p>So I say all this to say that, no matter how big a problem, progress is possible. It's not instantaneous; we've got to sometimes cut these things into pieces. But as I told graduates at UC Irvine a couple weeks ago at&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;there you go, UC Irvine. [<i>Laughter</i>] You got the little anteater. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's a&mdash;I've got to say, it's a pretty cute mascot. [<i>Laughter</i>] An anteater, it's nice, I like it. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>It's pretty rare that you encounter people who say that the problem of carbon pollution is not a problem. You've all&mdash;in most communities and workplaces, et cetera, when you talk to folks, they may not know how big a problem, they may not know exactly how it works, they may doubt that we can do something about it, but generally, they don't just say, no, I don't believe anything scientists say. [<i>Laughter</i>] Except where? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Congress! <p><i>The President.</i> In Congress. [<i>Laughter</i>] In Congress. Folks will tell you climate change is a hoax or a fad or a plot. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's a liberal plot. [<i>Laughter</i>] And then most recently, because many who say that actually know better and they're just embarrassed, they duck the question. They say, hey, I'm not a scientist, which really translates into, I accept that manmade climate change is real, but if I say so out loud, I will be run out of town by a bunch of fringe elements that think science&mdash;climate science is a liberal plot, so I'm going to just pretend like, I don't know, I can't read. <p>I mean, I'm not a scientist either, but I've got this guy, John Holdren; he's a scientist. [<i>Laughter</i>] I've got a bunch of scientists at NASA, and I've got a bunch of scientists at EPA. I'm not a doctor either&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but if a bunch of doctors tell me that tobacco can cause lung cancer, then I'll say, okay. [<i>Laughter</i>] Right? [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, it's not that hard. <p>Now, the good news is, the American people are wiser than this. Seven in 10 Americans say global warming is a serious problem. Seven in 10 say the Federal Government should limit pollution from our power plants. And of all the issues in the&mdash;a recent poll asking Americans where we&mdash;where they think we can make a difference, protecting the environment came out on top. We actually believe we can do this. We can make a difference. <p>And that's in large part thanks to you. Many of you have done just terrific work at the grassroots level: educating, mobilizing. That isn't to say, by the way, and I say this sometimes to environmental groups, it's not to say that it's not easy and that we should not take seriously the very real concerns people have about their current economic state. People don't like gas prices going up. They don't like electricity prices going up. And we ignore those very real and legitimate concerns at our peril, so if we're blithe about saying this is the defining issue of our time, but we don't address people's legitimate economic concerns, then even if they are concerned about climate change, they may not support efforts to do something about it. So we've got to shape our strategies to speak to the very real and legitimate concerns of working families all across America. But we can do that. That's the good news. We can do it. And the sooner we do it, the better. Right now developing countries have some of the fastest rising levels of carbon pollution. They are less equipped to cope with the effects of climate change than we are. But they're also trying to deal with hundreds of millions of people in poverty. And so the tradeoffs for them are even tougher than for us sometimes, unless we describe how development should leapfrog some of the old technologies, learn lessons from us, and go right to a clean energy future. And we should be part of that conversation, but we've got to lead by example. They're waiting to see what America does. And I'm convinced, when America proves what's possible, other countries are going to come along. <p>I should point out, by the way, that we're not just acting on climate change; we're also doing more for conservation. Since I took office, we've established 10 new national parks, 10 new national wildlife refuges, 11 new national monuments. I just announced plans to further protect our oceans. And I'm not just going to stand with environmentalists, I'm going to stand with sportsmen and conservationists against Members of Congress who want to dismantle the Clean Water Act. We've got to dredge up that old tape of the Cuyahoga River on fire and the Chicago River and just remind people that this thing worked. It was&mdash;one of the great achievements of modern American politics was realizing that we didn't have to trade off a healthy environment for our kids and economic growth. Because, as Americans, we have an obligation to be good stewards of the gifts that have been given and make sure that they're around for our kids and our grandkids. <p>I don't have to tell you all this. Whether it's shifting to clean energy, preserving our landscapes and natural resources, you understand our mission. You've helped define it. And it's not going to happen overnight. This is a generational project. And sometimes, it can be easy to get discouraged, and to feel like, oh, we're not setting high enough goals, we're not reaching them quickly enough. I know. I read the science. I'm not a scientist, but I read it. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But what I also know is, is that when you take those first steps, even if they're hard and even if they're halting sometimes, that you start building momentum and you start mobilizing larger and larger communities. And when it comes to a challenge as far reaching and important as protecting our planet, every step makes a difference. <p>And one of the great things about it is, is that this is a generational fight, but the younger generation is more attuned to this than just about anybody. You talk to Malia, you talk to Sasha, you talk to your kids or your grandkids, and this is something they get. It's&mdash;they don't need a lot of persuading. They understand how important this is. And that should make us hopeful and optimistic. <p>And I'll close with a story I heard recently that illustrates the point. I called Gregg Popovich, coach of the San Antonio Spurs, to congratulate him on winning the NBA Championship. And by&mdash;and I love Pop. He is not just a great coach, he is a great guy. And I've gotten to know him and really love the guy. And for more than a decade, Coach Pop has hung a sign in the Spurs locker room for all his players to see. And on that sign is a quote from a 19th-century reformer, which is not what you'd expect to see in an NBA locker room, but that's the kind of guy Coach Popovich is, and the quote goes something like this: \\"When nothing seems to help, I go look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at that&mdash;at the hundred and first blow, it will split in two, and I know it was not that blow that did it, but all that had gone before.\\" <p>So that's what we're doing. Together, we are pounding the rock. And together, we are making progress. And sometimes, it feels like, man, I'm getting tired. [<i>Laughter</i>] And we're not moving fast enough. But then one day, the rock splits open, not because one person comes up or one President comes up and strikes a mighty blow, but because of all the work that has gone on before. Our work. So until the day comes that the rock is split, we've all got to take turns pounding. We've got to keep fighting. We've got to keep mobilizing. We've got to keep making sure that your voices are heard in Congress, in State capitals, in city halls. Because that's the only way we're going to build the kind of future that we want: cleaner, more prosperous, more good jobs; a future where we can look our kids in the eye and tell them we did our part, we served you well, we were good stewards, we're passing this on. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"150" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Minneapolis! How is everybody doing today? You look good. It is good to see all of you. I miss Minneapolis. I missed you guys. Go ahead and have a seat, I'm going to be talking for a while. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So we've got some wonderful folks here today. I want to acknowledge a few of them. First of all, your outstanding Governor, Mark Dayton. Your wonderful Senators, Al Franken and Amy Klobuchar. Congressman Keith Ellison. Your mayor, Betsy Hodges. And all of you are here, and that's special. <p>I want to thank Rebekah for not just the introduction and for sharing her story, but for letting me hang out with her and her family for the last couple of days. I really like her. [<i>Laughter</i>] I&mdash;and her husband is, like, the husband of the year. Generally, you don't want your wife to meet Rebekah's husband, because she'll be, like, well, why don't you do that? [<i>Laughter</i>] Why aren't you like that? <p>I've been wanting to visit a place where all the women are strong and the men are good looking and the children above average. And this clearly is an example of what Minnesota produces. So yesterday Rebekah and I had lunch at Matt's Bar. Yes, had a \\"Jucy Lucy,\\" which was quite tasty. We had a town hall at Minnehaha Park, although I did not take a kayak over the falls, which seemed dangerous. [<i>Laughter</i>] We got ice cream at Grand Ole Creamery&mdash;very good, very tasty. <p>And then this morning Al Franken and I and Secretary Tom Perez, our Secretary of Labor, who's here&mdash;Tom, stand up&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;we stopped by a community organization that helps with a lot of job programs and job placement programs. And this program in particular was focused on young moms. It was really interesting talking to them, because these are teenage mothers, 16 to 18, and it was a great pleasure for me to be able to say to all of them that my mom was a teenage mom and she was 18 when she had me and to be able to say to all of them that here in this country, it is possible for the child of a teenage mom, a single mom, to end up being President of the United States. And I think that it maybe gave them something to think about. <p>So you guys have been great hosts, Minnesota. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Yeah! Thank you! <p><i>The President.</i> You're welcome. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, so I want to give you a sense of how this visit came up. As some of you know, every day we get tens of thousands of correspondence at the White House. And we have a big correspondence office, and every night, the folks who manage the correspondence office select 10 letters for me to read. <p>And the job of these letters is not to just puff me up, so it's not like they only send me letters saying, Mr. President, you're doing great. [<i>Laughter</i>] Sometimes, the letters say thank you for something I may have done. Sometimes, the letters say, you are an idiot and the worst President ever. And most of the stories, though, are stories of hardship or hard-won success or hopes that haven't been met yet. Some appreciate a position that I may have taken; some disagree with what I'm doing. Some consider policies like the Affordable Care Act to be socialism; some tell stories about the difference that same policy may have made in folks' lives. <p>So I'm getting a good sample of what's happening around the country. And last month, three young girls wrote to me that boys aren't fair because they don't pass the ball in gym class. [<i>Laughter</i>] So there's a wide spectrum&mdash;and I'm going to prepare an Executive order on that. <p>But the letter that Rebekah sent stood out, first of all, because she's a good writer, and also because she's a good person. And the story that she told me reminded Michelle and I of some of our own experiences when we were their&mdash;Rebekah and her husband's age. And in many ways, her story for the past 5 years is our story, it's the American story. <p>In early 2009, Rebekah and Ben, her husband, they were newly married, expecting their first son Jack. She was waiting tables; he was in construction. Like millions of middle class families who got hammered by the great recession&mdash;the worst recession since the Great Depression&mdash;life was about to get pretty hard. \\"If only we had known,\\" she wrote, \\"what was about to happen to the housing and construction market.\\" <p>Ben's business dried up. But as a new husband and dad, he did what he had to, so he took whatever jobs he could, even if it forced him to be away from his family for days at a time. Rebekah realized she needed to think about how her career would unfold, so she took out student loans and enrolled in St. Paul College and retrained for a new career as an accountant. <p>And it's been a long, hard road for them. They had to pay off debt. They had to sacrifice for their kids and for one another. But then last year, they were able to buy their first home, and they've got a second son. And they love where they work, and Ben's new job lets him to be home for dinner each night. And so what Rebekah wrote was: \\"It's amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to. We're a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.\\" <p>And that describes the American people. We too are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times. And today, over the past 51 months, our businesses have created 9.4 million new jobs. Our housing market is rebounding. Our auto industry is booming. Our manufacturing sector is adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s. We've made our Tax Code fairer. We've cut our deficits by more than half. More than 8 million Americans have signed up for private insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act. So here in Minnesota, you can now say that the women are strong, the men are good looking, the children are above average, and 95 percent of you are insured. <p>And it's thanks to the hard work of citizens like Rebekah and Ben and so many of you that we've come farther, we've recovered faster, than just about any other advanced economy on Earth. More and more companies are deciding that the world's number-one place to create jobs and invest is once again the United States of America. That's the good news. And you don't hear it very often. <p>By every economic measure, we are better off now than we were when I took office. You wouldn't know it, but we are. We've made some enormous strides. But that's not the end of the story. We have more work to do. It wasn't the end of Rebekah's story, because she went on to write in her letter, \\"We did everything right. The truth is, in America, where two people have done everything they can to succeed and fight back from the brink of financial ruin&mdash;through job loss and retraining and kids and credit card debts that are set up to keep you impoverished forever and the discipline to stop spending any money on yourselves or take a vacation in 5 years&mdash;it's virtually impossible to live a simple middle class life.\\" That's what Rebekah wrote. Because their income is eaten up by childcare for Jack and Henry that costs more each month than their mortgage. And as I was telling Rebekah, Michelle and I, when we were their age, we had good jobs, and we still had to deal with childcare issues and couldn't figure out how to some months make ends meet. <p>They forego vacations so they can afford to pay off student loans and save for retirement. \\"Our big splurge,\\" Rebekah wrote, \\"is cable TV so we can follow our beloved Minnesota Wild and watch Team U.S.A. in the Olympics!\\" They go out once a week for pizza or a burger. But they're not splurging. And at the end of the month, things are tight. And this is, like, this wonderful young couple, with these wonderful kids, who are really working hard. <p>And the point is, all across this country, there are people just like that, all in this audience. You're working hard, you're doing everything right. You believe in the American Dream. You're not trying to get fabulously wealthy. You just wanted a chance to build a decent life for yourselves and your families, but sometimes, it feels like the odds are rigged against you. <p>And I think sometimes what it takes for somebody like Rebekah to sit down and write one of these letters. And I believe that even when it's heartbreaking and it's hard, every single one of those letters is by definition an act of hope. <p>Because it's a hope that the system can listen, that somebody is going to hear you; that even when Washington sometimes seems tone deaf to what's going on in people's lives and around kitchen tables, that there's going to be somebody who's going to stand up for you and your family. <p>And that's why I came here, because I wanted to let Rebekah know and I wanted to let all of you know that&mdash;because you don't see it on TV sometimes. It's not what the press and the pundits talk about. I'm here to tell you I'm listening, because you're the reason I ran for President. Because those stories are stories I've lived. The same way that when I saw those young teenage moms, I thought of my mother. And when I see Rebekah and Ben, I think of our struggles when Malia and Sasha were young. And they're not distant from me and everything we do. <p>I ran for President because I believe this country is at its best when we're all in it together and when everybody has a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share. And the reason I believe that is because that's how I came here. That's how I got here. That's how Michelle and I were able to succeed. And I haven't forgotten. <p>And so even though you may not read about it or see it on TV all the time, our agenda, what we're fighting for every day, is designed not to solve every problem, but to help just a little bit. To create more good jobs that pay good wages, jobs in manufacturing and construction and energy and innovation. That's why we're fighting to train more workers to fill those jobs. That's why we're fighting to guarantee every child a world-class education, including early childhood education and better childcare. That's why we're fighting to make sure hard work pays off with a wage you can live on and savings you can retire on and making sure that women get paid the same as men for the same job and folks have flexibility to look after a sick child or a sick parent. That's what we're fighting for. We're fighting so everybody has a chance. We're fighting to vindicate the idea that no matter who you are or what you look like or how you grew up or who you love or who your parents were or what your last name is, it doesn't matter; America is a place where if you're doing the right thing, like Ben and Rebekah are, and you're being responsible and you're taking care of your family, that you can make it. <p>And the fact is, we can do that. If we do the&mdash;some basic things, if we make some basic changes, we can create more jobs and lift more incomes and strengthen the middle class. And that's what we should be doing. And I know it drives you nuts that Washington isn't doing it. And it drives me nuts. And the reason it's not getting done is, today, even basic, commonsense ideas can't get through this Congress. <p>No&mdash;and sometimes, I'm supposed to be politic about how I say things&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but I'm finding lately that I just want to say what's on my mind. So let me just be clear&mdash;think&mdash;I want you think about this: So far this year, Republicans in Congress have blocked or voted down every single serious idea to strengthen the middle class. Now, you may think I'm exaggerating; let me go through the list. They've said no to raising the minimum wage. They've said no to fair pay. Some of them have denied that there's even a problem, that&mdash;despite the fact that women are getting paid 77 cents for every dollar a man is getting paid. <p>They've said no to extending unemployment insurance for more than 3 million Americans who are out there looking every single day for a new job, despite the fact that we know it would be good not just for those families who are working hard to try to get back on their feet, but for the economy as a whole. Rather than invest in working families getting ahead, they actually voted to give another massive tax cut to the wealthiest Americans. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> They&mdash;don't boo, by the way. I want you to vote. But&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. I mean, over and over again, they show that they'll do anything to keep in place systems that really help folks at the top, but don't help you. And they don't seem to mind. And their obstruction is keeping a system that is rigged against families like Ben's and Rebekah's. <p>Now, I'm not saying these are all bad people; they're not. I&mdash;when I'm sitting there just talking to them about family, we get along just fine. Many of them will acknowledge when I talk to them, \\"Yes, I know, I wish we could do something more, but I can't.\\" But they can't be too friendly towards me because they'd be run out of town by the Tea Party. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But sometimes, I get a sense, they just don't know what most folks are going through. They keep on offering a theory of the economy that's, time and again, failed for the middle class. They think we should give more tax breaks to those at the top. They think we should invest less in things like education. They think we should let big banks and credit card companies and polluters and insurers do only whatever is best for their bottom line without any responsibility to anybody else. They want to drastically reduce or get rid of the safety net for people trying to work their way into the middle class. <p>And if we did all these things, they think the economy will thrive and jobs will prosper and everything will trickle down. <p>And just because they believe it, it doesn't mean the rest of us should be believing it, because we've tried what they're peddling, and it doesn't work. We know from our history that our economy does not grow from the top down, it grows from the middle out. We do better when the middle class does better. We do better when workers are getting a decent salary. We do better when they've got decent benefits. We do better when some&mdash;we do better when a young family knows that they can get ahead. And we do better when people who are working hard know that they can count on decent childcare at an affordable cost and that they, if they get sick, they're not going to lose their homes. <p>We do better when if somebody is stuck in a job that is not paying well enough, they know they can go get retrained without taking on huge mountains of debt. That's when things hum. And with just a few changes in priorities, we could get a lot of that done right now if Congress would actually just think about you and not about getting reelected, not about the next election, not about some media sound bite, but just focus on you. <p>So that's why I've said, look, I want to work with Democrats and Republicans. My favorite President, by the way, is&mdash;was the first Republican President, a guy named Abraham Lincoln. So I'm not&mdash;this is not a statement about partisanship. This is a statement about America and what we're fighting for. And I'm not going to let gridlock and inaction and willful indifference and greed threaten the hard work of families like yours. And so we can't afford to wait for Congress right now. And that's why I'm going ahead and moving ahead without them wherever I can. <p>That's why I acted to raise more workers' wages by requiring Federal contractors to pay their employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour. That's why I acted to help nearly 5 million Americans make student loan payments cap those payments at 10 percent of their income. That's why I made sure more women have the protections they need to fight for a fair pay in the workplace. That's why we went ahead and launched new hubs to attract more high-tech manufacturing jobs to America. <p>And now, some of you may have read&mdash;so we take these actions, and then now Republicans are mad at me for taking these actions. They're not doing anything, and then they're mad that I'm doing something. I'm not sure which of the things I've done they find most offensive, but they've decided they're going to sue me for doing my job. <p><i>Audience member</i>. [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President</i>. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, I might have said in the heat of the moment during one of these debates, \\"I want to raise the minimum wage, so sue me when I do.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] But I didn't think they were going to take it literally. <p>But giving more working Americans a fair shot is not about simply what I can do, it's about what we can do together. So when Congress doesn't act, not only have I acted, I've also tried to rally others to help. I told CEOs and Governors and mayors and State legislatures, for example, they don't have to wait for Congress to raise the minimum wage. Go ahead and raise your workers' wages right now. And since I first asked Congress to raise the minimum wage, 13 States and DC have raised theirs, including Minnesota, where more than 450,000 of your neighbors are poised to get a raise. <p>When Gap raised wages for its employees, job applications went up through the roof. It was good for business. I even got a letter from a proud mom right here in Minneapolis who just wanted me to know that her son starts his employees at $15 an hour, at Aaron's Green Cleaning here in town. [<i>Applause</i>] There they are! So here&mdash;the letter said: \\"We are very proud of his people-centered business philosophy! Three cheers for a decent living wage!\\" <p>So we don't have to wait for Congress to do some good stuff. On Monday, we held the first-ever White House Summit on Working Families, and we heard from a lot of other families like Ben and Rebekah. They count on policies like paid leave and workplace flexibility to juggle everything. We had business owners who came and told me they became more profitable when they made family life easier for their employees. <p>So more companies are deciding that higher wages and workplace flexibility is good for business: reduces turnover, more productive workers, more loyal workers. More cities and States are deciding, this is good policy for families. So the only holdout standing in the way of change for tens of millions of Americans are some Republicans in Congress. <p>So&mdash;because I just want to be real blunt: If you watch the news, you'd just see, okay, Washington is a mess, and the basic attitude is, everybody is just crazy up there. And&mdash;but if you actually read the fine print, it turns out that the things you care about, right now Democrats are promoting. And we're just not getting enough help. <p>And my message to Republicans is: Join us. Get on board. If you're mad at me for helping people on my own, then why don't you join me and we'll do it together? [<i>Applause</i>] We'll do it together. I'm happy to share the credit. You're mad at me for doing some things to raise the minimum wage, let's pass a law, Republicans and Democrats giving America a raise. <p>If you're mad at me for taking executive action to make it easier for women to find out if they're not getting treated fairly in the workplace, let's do it together. You can share the credit. You're worried about me trying to fix a broken immigration system, let's hold hands and go ahead and make sure that this country continues to be a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. I want to work with you, but you've got to give me something. You've got to try to deliver something, anything. <p>They don't do anything&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;except block me. And call me names. And it can't be that much fun. [<i>Laughter</i>] It'd be so much more fun if they said, you know what, let's do something together. If they were more interested in growing the economy for you and the issues that you're talking about, instead of trying to mess with me&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;then we'd be doing a lot better. That's what makes this country great, is when we're all working together. That's the American way. <p>Now more than ever, with the Fourth of July next week, Team U.S.A. moving on down in Brazil, we should try to rally around some economic patriotism that says we rise or fall as one Nation and one people. Let's rally around the idea that instead of giving tax breaks for millionaires, let's give more tax breaks for working families to help pay for childcare or college. <p>Instead of protecting companies that are shifting profits overseas to avoid paying their fair share, let's put people to work rebuilding our roads and our bridges and our airports. Let's invest in manufacturing startups so that we're creating good jobs making products here in America, here in Minnesota. Rather than stack the deck in favor of those who have already got an awful lot, let's help folks who have huge talent and potential and ingenuity, but just need a little bit of a hand up so that we can tap the potential of every American. <p>I mean, this isn't rocket science. So there are some things that are complicated; this isn't one of them. Let's make sure every 4-year-old in America has access to high school&mdash;high-quality preschool, so that moms like Rebekah and dads like Ben know their kids are getting the best quality care and getting a head start on life. Let's redesign our high schools to make sure that our kids are better prepared for the 21st-century economy. Let's follow the lead of Senator Franken and Secretary Perez and give more apprenticeships that connect young people to rewarding careers. Let's tell every American, if they've lost their job because it was shipped overseas, we're going to train you for an even better one. Let's rally around the patriotism that says our country is stronger when every American can count on affordable health insurance and Medicare and Social Security and women earn pay equal to their efforts and family can make ends meet if their kid gets sick and when nobody who works full time is living in poverty. We can do all these things. <p>And so let me just&mdash;let me wrap up by saying this. I know sometimes things get kind of discouraging. And I know that our politics looks profoundly broken and Washington looks like it's never going to deliver for you. It seems like they're focused on everything but your concerns. And I know that when I was elected in 2008 and then reelected in 2012, so many of you were hoping that we could get Washington to work differently, and sometimes, when I get stymied, you'd think, oh, maybe not; maybe it's just too tough, maybe things won't change. And I get that frustration. And the critics and the cynics in Washington, they've written me off more times than I can count. <p>But I'm here to tell you, don't get cynical. Despite all of the frustrations, America is making progress. Despite the unyielding opposition, there are families who have health insurance now who didn't have it before. And there are students in college who couldn't afford it before. And there are workers on the job who didn't have jobs before. And there are troops home with their families after serving tour after tour. Don't think that we're not making progress. <p>So yes, it's easy to be cynical; in fact, these days it's kind of trendy. Cynicism passes off for wisdom. But cynicism doesn't liberate a continent. Cynicism doesn't build a transcontinental railroad. Cynicism doesn't send a man to the Moon. Cynicism doesn't invent the Internet. Cynicism doesn't give women the right to vote. Cynicism doesn't make sure that people are treated equally regardless of race. <p>Cynicism is a choice, and hope is a better choice. And every day, I'm lucky to receive thousands of acts of hope, every time somebody sits down and picks up a pen and writes to me and shares their story, just like Rebekah did. And Rebekah said in her letter&mdash;she ended it, she said: \\"I'm pretty sure this is a silly thing to do to write a letter to the President, but on some level, I know that staying silent about what you see and what needs changing never makes any difference. So I'm writing to you to let you know what it's like for us out here in the middle of the country, and I hope you will listen.\\" <p>And I'm here because Rebekah wrote to me and I want her to know I'm listening. I'm here as President, because I want you all to know that I'm listening. I ran for office to make sure that anybody who is working hard to meet their dreams has somebody in Washington that is listening. And I'm always going to keep listening. And I'm always going to keep fighting. <p>And your cares and your concerns are my own, and your hopes for your kids and your grandkids are my own. And I'm always going to be working to restore the American Dream for everybody who's willing to work for it. And I am not going to get cynical; I'm staying hopeful, and I hope you do too. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"151" "\"Hi, everybody. This week, I spent a couple of days in Minneapolis, talking with people about their lives: their concerns, their successes, and their hopes for the future. <p>I went because of a letter I received from a working mother named Rebekah, who shared with me the hardships her young family had faced since the financial crisis. She and her husband Ben were just newlyweds expecting their first child Jack when the housing crash dried up his contracting business. He took what jobs he could, and Rebekah took out student loans and retrained for a new career. They sacrificed for their kids and for each other. And 5 years later, they've paid off their debt, bought their first home, and had their second son Henry. <p>In her letter to me, she wrote, \\"We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.\\" And in many ways, that's America's story these past 5 years. We are a strong, tight-knit family that's made it through some very tough times. Today, over the past 51 months, our businesses have created 9.4 million new jobs. By measure after measure, our economy is doing better than it was 5 years ago. <p>But as Rebekah also wrote in her letter, there are still too many middle class families like hers who do everything right&mdash;who work hard and who sacrifice&mdash;but can't seem to get ahead. It feels like the odds are stacked against them. And with just a small change in our priorities, we could fix that. <p>The problem is, Republicans in Congress keep blocking or voting down almost every serious idea to strengthen the middle class. This year alone, they've said no to raising the minimum wage, no to fair pay, no to student loan reform, no to extending unemployment insurance. And rather than invest in education that helps working families get ahead, they actually voted to give another massive tax cut to the wealthiest Americans. <p>This obstruction keeps the system rigged for those at the top and rigged against the middle class. And as long as they insist on doing it, I'm going to keep taking actions on my own, like the actions I've already taken to attract new jobs, lift workers' wages, and help students pay off their loans. I intend do my job. And if it makes Republicans in Congress mad that I'm trying to help people out, then I welcome them to join me so we can do it together. <p>The point is, we could do so much more as a country&mdash;as a strong, tight-knit family&mdash;if Republicans in Congress were less interested in stacking the deck for those at the top&mdash;or obstructing me&mdash;and more interested in growing the economy for everybody. <p>So rather than more tax breaks for millionaires, let's give more tax breaks to help working families pay for childcare or college. Rather than protecting tax loopholes that let big corporations set up tax shelters overseas, let's put people to work rebuilding roads and bridges right here in America. Rather than stack the deck in favor of those who've already succeeded, let's realize that we are stronger as a nation when we offer a fair shot to every American. <p>I'm going to spend some time talking about these very choices in the weeks ahead. That's because we know from our history that our economy does not grow from the top down, it grows from the middle out. We do better when the middle class does better. That's the American way. That's what I believe in. And that's what I'll keep fighting for. Have a great Fourth of July, everybody. And good luck to Team U.S.A. down in Brazil.\" "
"152" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. One year ago this month, Senators of both parties&mdash;with support from the business community, labor, law enforcement, faith communities&mdash;came together to pass a commonsense immigration bill. <p>Independent experts said that bill would strengthen our borders, grow our economy, shrink our deficits. As we speak, there are enough Republicans and Democrats in the House to pass an immigration bill today. I would sign it into law today, and Washington would solve a problem in a bipartisan way. <p>But for more than a year, Republicans in the House of Representatives have refused to allow an up-or-down vote on that Senate bill or any legislation to fix our broken immigration system. And I held off on pressuring them for a long time to give House Speaker Boehner the space he needed to get his fellow Republicans on board. <p>Meanwhile, here's what a year of obstruction has meant. It's meant fewer resources to strengthen our borders. It's meant more businesses free to game the system by hiring undocumented workers, which punishes businesses that play by the rules and drives down wages for hard-working Americans. It's meant lost talent when the best and brightest from around the world come to study here, but are forced to leave and then compete against our businesses and our workers. It's meant no chance for 11 million immigrants to come out of the shadows and earn their citizenship if they pay a penalty and pass a background check, pay their fair share of taxes, learn English, and go to the back of the line. It's meant the heartbreak of separated families. <p>That's what this obstruction has meant over the past year. That's what the Senate bill would fix if the House allowed it to go to a vote. <p>Our country and our economy would be stronger today if House Republicans had allowed a simple yes-or-no vote on this bill or, for that matter, any bill. They'd be following the will of the majority of the American people who support reform. And instead, they've proven again and again that they're unwilling to stand up to the Tea Party in order to do what's best for the country. And the worst part about it is, a bunch of them know better. <p>We now have an actual humanitarian crisis on the border that only underscores the need to drop the politics and fix our immigration system once and for all. In recent weeks, we've seen a surge of unaccompanied children arrive at the border, brought here and to other countries by smugglers and traffickers. <p>The journey is unbelievably dangerous for these kids. The children who are fortunate enough to survive it will be taken care of while they go through the legal process, but in most cases, that process will lead to them being sent back home. I've sent a clear message to parents in these countries not to put their kids through this. I recently sent Vice President Biden to meet with Central American leaders and find ways to address the root causes of this crisis. Secretary Kerry will also be meeting with those leaders again tomorrow. With our international partners, we're taking new steps to go after the dangerous smugglers who are putting thousands of children lives at risk. Today I sent a letter to congressional leaders asking that they work with me to address the urgent humanitarian challenge on the border and support the immigration and Border Patrol agents who already apprehend and deport hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants every year. And understand, by the way, for the most part, this is not a situation where these children are slipping through. They're being apprehended. But the problem is, is that our system is so broken, so unclear, that folks don't know what the rules are. <p>Now, understand, there are a number of Republicans who have been willing to work with us to pass real, commonsense immigration reform, and I want to thank them for their efforts. There are a number of Republican leaders in the Senate who did excellent work and deserve our thanks. And less visibly, there have been folks in the House who have been trying to work to get this done. And quietly, because it doesn't always help me to praise them, I've expressed to them how much I appreciate the efforts that they've made. <p>I believe Speaker Boehner when he says he wants to pass an immigration bill. I think he genuinely wants to get something done. But last week, he informed me that Republicans will continue to block a vote on immigration reform at least for the remainder of this year. Some in the House Republican Caucus are using the situation with unaccompanied children as their newest excuse to do nothing. Now, I want everybody to think about that. Their argument seems to be that because the system is broken, we shouldn't make an effort to fix it. It makes no sense. It's not on the level. It's just politics, plain and simple. <p>Now, there are others in the Republican Caucus in the House who are arguing that they can't act because they're mad at me about using my executive authority too broadly. This also makes no sense. I don't prefer taking administrative action. I'd rather see permanent fixes to the issue we face. Certainly, that's true on immigration. I've made that clear multiple times. I would love nothing more than bipartisan legislation to pass the House, the Senate, land on my desk so I can sign it. That's true about immigration, that's true about the minimum wage, it's true about equal pay. There are a whole bunch of things where I would greatly prefer Congress actually do something. I take executive action only when we have a serious problem, a serious issue, and Congress chooses to do nothing. And in this situation, the failure of House Republicans to pass a darn bill is bad for our security, it's bad for our economy, and it's bad for our future. <p>So while I will continue to push House Republicans to drop the excuses and act&mdash;and I hope their constituents will too&mdash;America cannot wait forever for them to act. And that's why, today, I'm beginning a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own, without Congress. As a first step, I'm directing the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General to move available and appropriate resources from our interior to the border. Protecting public safety and deporting dangerous criminals has been and will remain the top priority, but we are going to refocus our efforts where we can to make sure we do what it takes to keep our border secure. <p>I have also directed Secretary Johnson and Attorney General Holder to identify additional actions my administration can take on our own, within my existing legal authorities, to do what Congress refuses to do and fix as much of our immigration system as we can. If Congress will not do their job, at least, we can do ours. I expect their recommendations before the end of summer, and I intend to adopt those recommendations without further delay. <p>Of course, even with aggressive steps on my part, administrative action alone will not adequately address the problem. The reforms that will do the most to strengthen our businesses, our workers, and our entire economy will still require an act of Congress. And I repeat: These are reforms that already enjoy the wide support of the American people. It's very rare where you get labor, business, evangelicals, law enforcement all agreeing on what needs to be done. And at some point, that should be enough. Normally, that is enough. The point of public service is to solve public problems. And those of us who have the privilege to serve have a responsibility to do everything in our power to keep Americans safe and to keep the doors of opportunity open. <p>And if we do, then 1 year from now, not only would our economy and our security be stronger, but maybe the best and the brightest from around the world who come study here would stay and create jobs here. Maybe companies that play by the rules will no longer be undercut by companies that don't. Maybe more families who have been living here for years, whose children are often U.S. citizens, who are our neighbors and our friends, and whose children are our kids' friends and go to school with them, and play on ball teams with them, maybe those families would get to stay together. But much of this only happens if Americans continue to push Congress to get this done. <p>So I've told Speaker Boehner that even as I take those steps that I can within my existing legal authorities to make the immigration system work better, I'm going to continue to reach out to House Republicans in the hope that they deliver a more permanent solution with a comprehensive bill. Maybe it will be after the midterms, when they're less worried about politics. Maybe it will be next year. Whenever it is, they will find me a willing partner. I have been consistent in saying that I am prepared to work with them even on a bill that I don't consider perfect. And the Senate bill was a good example of the capacity to compromise and get this done. The only thing I can't do is stand by and do nothing while waiting for them to get their act together. <p>And I want to repeat what I said earlier. If House Republicans are really concerned about me taking too many executive actions, the best solution to that is passing bills. Pass a bill; solve a problem. Don't just say no on something that everybody agrees needs to be done. Because if we pass a bill, that will supplant whatever I've done administratively. We'll have a structure there that works, and it will be permanent. And people can make plans and businesses can make plans based on the law. And there will be clarity both here inside this country and outside it. <p>Let me just close by saying Friday is the Fourth of July. It's the day we celebrate our independence and all the things that make this country so great. And each year, Michelle and I host a few hundred servicemembers and wounded warriors and their families right here on the lawn for a barbecue and fireworks on the Mall. <p>And some of the servicemembers coming this year are unique because they signed up to serve, to sacrifice, potentially to give their lives for the security of this country even though they weren't yet Americans. That's how much they love this country. They were prepared to fight and die for an America they did not yet fully belong to. I think they've earned their stripes in more ways than one. And that's why on Friday morning we're going to naturalize them in a ceremony right here at the White House. This Independence Day will be their first day as American citizens. <p>And one of the things we celebrate on Friday, one of the things that make this country great, is that we are a nation of immigrants. Our people come from every corner of the globe. That's what makes us special. That's what makes us unique. And throughout our history, we've come here in wave after wave from everywhere understanding that there was something about this place where the whole was greater than the sum of its parts, that all the different cultures and ideas and energy would come together and create something new. <p>We won this country's freedom together. We built this country together. We defended this country together. It makes us special. It makes us strong. It makes us Americans. That's worth celebrating. And that's what I want not just House Republicans, but all of us as Americans, to remember. <p>Thanks very much.\" "
"153" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody. Hey! Well, I want to thank Jim and Patrick. First of all, I think they supported me in my State senate campaign. [<i>Laughter</i>] So those were some early supporters, and we might not be here if it hadn't been for them. Congratulations on finally tying the knot after 51 years. I looked it up, and depending on how you count, the traditional gift for your next anniversary is either paper, for year 1, or whatever you want, because there is no traditional gift for 52 years. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I think it's so important to understand how rare relationships like yours are. And however you celebrate, we hope you have many, many more years together. <p>And then, with that, why don't you guys sit down, because that knee is acting up. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want all of you to know how much it means to us for you to be able to join here at this year's Pride Celebration. We've got some terrific public servants who are here today, including our Secretary of Labor Tom Perez. Hey! We've got mayors, and we've got State legislators, and we've got LGBT members of my administration. We also have three judges that I was proud to name to the Federal bench: Todd Hughes, Judy Levy, and Nitza Qui&ntilde;ones Alejandro. Give them a big round of applause. <p>Before I took office, we had only one openly gay Federal judge to be confirmed by the Senate. Now, along with Todd, Judy, and Nitza, that number is 11. So we're making some progress. <p>Three other people I want to mention. First of all, Tobias Wolff, who's been advising me for&mdash;since my first Presidential campaign and has had a great impact on my administration and how we've thought about a bunch of issues. Please give Tobias a big round of applause. <p>Number two&mdash;a special treat for me&mdash;my college professor when I was a freshman in college at Occidental, Dr. Lawrence Goldyn is here. I want to just talk a little bit about Lawrence. When I went in as a freshman&mdash;this is 1979 at Occidental College&mdash;and according to Lawrence, I guess there were maybe a couple of other gay professors, but they weren't wildly open about it. Lawrence was not shy. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I took a class from him, and because he was one of the younger professors, we became really good friends. But also, he was the first openly gay person that I knew who was unapologetic, who stood his ground. If somebody gave him guff, he'd give them guff right back, and was, I think, part of a generation that really fought so many battles that ultimately came into fruition later. And he also played a huge role in advising lesbian, gay, and transgender students at the school at a time when that was still hard for a lot of young college kids. And he went on to become a doctor and ran an AIDS clinic and now is the head of a health center. <p>But I just wanted to acknowledge him because he helped shape how I think about so many of these issues, and those sort of quiet heroes that sometimes don't get acknowledged. So give Lawrence a big round of applause. So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. Finally, I have to mention a man who's made life at the White House very sweet. This is one of Michelle and my favorite people, our Executive Pastry Chef, Bill Yosses&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;who's here tonight with his husband Charlie. Where's Bill? <p><i>The First Lady.</i> But he's leaving. <p><i>The President.</i> He's&mdash;this is the problem. We call Bill the Crustmaster because his pies&mdash;I don't know what he does, whether he puts crack in them, or&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The First Lady.</i> No, he doesn't. [<i>Laughter</i>] There is no crack in our pies. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> I'm just saying that when we first came to the White House&mdash;I don't know if you&mdash;some of you remember this&mdash;the first year, like, my cholesterol shot up. [<i>Laughter</i>] And the doctor was like, what happened? You had, like, this really low cholesterol. You were really healthy. And I thought, it's the pie. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's the pie. So we had to establish, like, a really firm rule about no pie during the week. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The First Lady. </i>We had to be disciplined. <p><i>The President. </i>But he's also just a wonderful person. And after 7 years, he's leaving the White House. So we just want to give Bill and Charlie the best of luck. And we love them. Thank you. <p>So a lot has happened in the year since we last gathered here together. Same-sex marriage has gone into effect in 10 more States, which means that 43 percent of Americans now live in States where you're free to marry who you love. The NFL drafted its first openly gay player. Harvey Milk got a stamp. Laverne Cox was on the cover of Time. Coca-Cola and Honeymaid were unafraid to sell their products in commercials showing same-sex parents and their children. And perhaps most importantly, Mitch and Cam got married, which caused Michelle and the girls to cry. [<i>Laughter</i>] That was big. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The First Lady.</i> It was big. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> This year, we mark the 45th anniversary of Stonewall. And I know some of you were there. And this tremendous progress we've made as a society is thanks to those of you who fought the good fight and to Americans across the country who marched and came out and organized to secure the rights of others. So I want to thank all of you for making the United States a more just and compassionate place. <p>I want to thank you for offering support and guidance to our administration. Because of your help, we've gone further in protecting the rights of lesbian and gay and bisexual and transgesture Americans than any administration in history. <p>In 2009, I told you at this reception that I would sign an inclusive hate crimes bill with Matthew Shepard's name on it, and I did. Because hate-driven violence has taken the lives of too many people in this community, and it has to end. <p>When we came together in 2010, I told you we'd repeal \\"don't ask, don't tell.\\" Some of you didn't believe me. [<i>Laughter</i>] You know who you are. [<i>Laughter</i>] We did that too, because nobody should have to hide who you love to serve the country you love. That same year, we released the first-ever comprehensive national HIV/AIDS strategy to unite our entire Government behind fighting this disease and helping those most at risk. <p>In 2011, I said my administration would no longer defend the so-called Defense Against Marriage Act. And thanks to Edie Windsor and Robbie Kaplan and the Department of Justice, that law was overturned, and we've extended benefits to legally married same-sex couples across the country. <p>In 2012, I promised that my administration would do more to address and prevent bullying and discrimination in our classrooms. And we have, because it's not enough just to say it gets better, we have to actually make it better, like so many Americans are trying to do every day. <p>We've got here today Pete Cahall, who is the principal of Woodrow Wilson High here in Washington. At a school pride events this month, inspired by brave students, Pete stood up and said something he'd never said at the school before, which is, \\"I am a proud gay man.\\" And the students all cheered. Pete is here today. Because of his example, more young people know they don't have to be afraid to be who they are; no matter who they love, people have their backs. So we're proud of Pete. <p>Last year, I promised to implement the Affordable Care Act so this community could get quality, affordable health care like you deserve. And we did that too. And thanks to that law, you can no longer be denied health insurance on the basis of your sexual orientation or gender identity. <p>We've still got a little more work to do. I've repeatedly called on Congress to pass the \\"Employment Non-Discrimination Act.\\" Right now there are more States that let same-sex couples get married than there are States who prohibit discrimination against their LGBT workers. We have laws that say Americans can't be fired on the basis of the color of their skin or their religion or because they have a disability. But every day, millions of Americans go to work worried that they could lose their job, not because of anything they've done&mdash;&mdash; <p>[<i>At this point, a baby cried.</i>] <p><i>The President. </i>I know, it's terrible&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but because of who they are. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's upsetting. It is wrong. <p>The majority of Fortune 500 companies already have nondiscrimination policies to protect their employees because it's the right thing to do and because many say it helps to retain and attract the best talent. And I agree. So if Congress won't act, I will. I have directed my staff to prepare an Executive order for my signature that prohibits discrimination by Federal contractors on the basis of sexual orientation and identity. <p>And I've asked my staff to prepare a second Executive order so that Federal employees, who are already protected on the basis of sexual orientation, will now be formally protected from discrimination based on gender identity as well. <p>So we've got a lot to be proud of, but obviously, we can't grow complacent. We've got to defend the progress that we've made. We've got to keep on reaching out to LGBT Americans who are vulnerable and alone and need our support, whether it's teenagers in rough situations to seniors who are struggling to find housing and care. <p>[<i>A baby cried.</i>] <p><i>The President. </i>I know, it's tough. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We've got to keep fighting for an AIDS-free generation and for the human rights of LGBT persons around the world. And we've got to&mdash;and I would also ask all of us to direct some of the energy and passion and resources of this movement towards other injustices that exist. Because one of the things that I think we should have learned&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;Dr. King said an \\"injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\\" And that's&mdash;and that means that we've got to be able to set up a community that extends beyond our own particular narrow interests; we've got to make sure that we're reaching out to others who need our help as well. <p>And that means fighting for poor kids. And it means fighting for workers to get a decent wage. It means showing compassion for the undocumented worker who is contributing to our society and just wants a chance to come out of the shadows. It means fighting for equal pay for equal work. It means standing up for sexual&mdash;standing up against sexual violence wherever it occurs. It means trying to eliminate any vestige of racial or religious discrimination and anti-Semitism wherever it happens. <p>That's how we continue our Nation's march towards justice and equality. That's how we build a more perfect Union, a country where no matter what you look like, where you come from, what your last name is, who you love, you've got a chance to make it if you try. You guys have shown what can happen when people of goodwill organize and stand up for what's right. We've got to make sure that that's not applied just one place, in one circumstance, in one time. That's part of the journey that makes America the greatest country on Earth. <p>So thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"154" "\"I thought I'd get the Cabinet together this morning because we all know that America will be busy this afternoon. Go Team U.S.A. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>About the halfway point through this year, we can look back and see some enormous progress that we've been able to make on the economy. We continue to create jobs, over 9.4 million created over the last several years. We're continuing to see improvement in the housing market. We're continuing to see real progress in terms of the energy sector. But what we also know is, is that there's so much more that's possible. <p>And part of the reason that I wanted to bring the Cabinet together today is to underscore for them my belief&mdash;I think, shared by most Americans&mdash;that we can't wait for Congress to actually get going on issues that are vital to the middle class. <p>We've already seen the power of some of our executive actions in making a real difference for ordinary families, whether it's on minimum wage for Federal workers&mdash;or for workers who are with Federal contractors, equal pay, the terrific work that's being done around climate change so we're transitioning to a clean-energy economy. <p>But what I'm going to be urging all of you to do, and what I'm going to be continually pushing throughout this year and for the next couple of years, is that if Congress can't act on core issues that would actually make a difference in helping middle class families get ahead, then we're going to have to be creative about how we can make real progress. <p>Keep in mind that my preference is always going to be to work with Congress and to actually get legislation done. That's how we get some more permanent fixes. And as I mentioned yesterday with respect to immigration, whatever we do administratively is not going to be sufficient to solve a broken immigration system. <p>The same is true when it comes to infrastructure. We'll be talking a little bit about how we need to renew the highway trust fund. But more importantly, we could potentially put people to work all across the country, rebuilding roads and bridges, putting construction workers back to work. That could boost our economy enormously. And now is the time to do it, but that requires congressional action. <p>And so we're always going to prefer working on a bipartisan basis to get things done. That's what folks expect out of Washington. They're not looking for excuses, and they're not looking for a lot of partisan sniping. But if Congress is unable to do it, then all of our Cabinet members here head up big agencies that touch people's lives in all sorts of ways, and I'm going to be continually looking for ways in which we can show some real progress. <p>And the second topic that we're going to be spending a lot of time talking about is how do we continue to improve the functioning of Government to make it more customer friendly. This is something that we've been working on since Sylvia was head of OMB. And this is something that Shaun will be prioritizing. I expect every agency to look and see, how can we get more bang for the buck in the agencies that we operate? And I know that many of you can report some significant progress in reducing paperwork and bureaucracy and redtape for projects and initiatives around the country in education, in energy, in housing, and in transportation. But I think we can do even better. <p>So I'm looking forward to getting a report from you on the progress that has been made. And hopefully, we can share some ideas to see if we can make even more progress. <p>The bottom line is this: I went to Minnesota&mdash;many of the press here accompanied me&mdash;and had a wonderful conversation with folks around the country who are doing their jobs every single day, raising families, working hard, contributing to their communities. And their hopes and aspirations are my primary focus and should be the primary focus of this town. They are extraordinarily cynical about Washington right now, and rightfully so. They just don't see any capacity by Congress to do anything. And we've seen a Congress that said no to increasing the minimum wage, said no to immigration reform, has said no to equal pay legislation. The only thing they seem to say yes to, the Republicans in the House at least, is more tax breaks for folks at the top. And as a consequence, the people who sent us here, they just don't feel as if anybody is fighting for them and working for them. <p>We're not always going to be able to get things through Congress, at least this Congress, the way we'd want to. But we sure as heck can make sure that the folks back home know that we're pushing their agenda and that we're working hard on their behalf and we're doing every single thing we can do to make a difference in their lives. So I want to make sure that we emphasize not what we can't do, but what we can do, in the coming months. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"155" "\"Well, hello, everybody. Have a seat, have a seat. It's hot. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's hot out. Anthony, take off your coat, man. [<i>Laughter</i>] It is hot, and Team U.S.A. takes the pitch in a couple hours, so we've got to get down to business. We don't have time for a lot of small talk. Am I right, Mr. Mayor? We've got to get going. <p>Behind me is one of the busiest bridges in Washington. And with the Fourth of July on Friday&mdash;also Malia's birthday, for those of you who are interested; she will be 16; it's a little, little worrisome&mdash;I would note that this bridge is named for the man who wrote \\"The Star-Spangled Banner,\\" Francis Scott Key. <p>Three years ago, I came here to this very spot, to the Key Bridge, to talk about how two of the five major bridges connecting DC to Virginia&mdash;including this one&mdash;were rated \\"structurally deficient.\\" And with almost 120,000 vehicles crossing these bridges every day, I said it was important to fix them. <p>And today, that's exactly what we're doing. So, soon, construction workers will be on the job making the Key Bridge safer for commuters and for families and even for Members of Congress to cross. [<i>Laughter</i>] This is made possible by something called the Highway Trust Fund, which Congress established back in the 1950s and which helps States repair and rebuild our infrastructure all across the country. It's an example of what can happen when Washington just functions the way it was supposed to. <p>Back then, you had Eisenhower, a Republican President; over time, you would have Democratic Presidents, Democratic and Republican Members of Congress all recognizing, building bridges and roads and levees and ports and airports&mdash;that none of that is a partisan issue. That's making sure that America continues to progress. <p>Now, here is the problem. Here is the reason we're here in the heat. If this Congress does not act by the end of the summer, the Highway Trust Fund will run out. Won't be any money there. All told, nearly 700,000 jobs could be at risk next year. That would be like Congress threatening to lay off the entire population of Denver or Seattle or Boston. That's a lot of people. It would be a bad idea. Right now there are more than a hundred thousand active projects across the country where workers are paving roads and rebuilding bridges and modernizing our transit systems. And soon, States may have to choose which projects to continue and which ones to put the brakes on because they're running out of money. Some have already done just that, just because they're worried that Congress will not get its act together in time. <p>Now, earlier this year, I put forward a plan not just to replenish the Highway Trust Fund, I put forward a plan to rebuild our transportation infrastructure across the country in a responsible way. And I want to thank Secretary Anthony Foxx, who is here today, for his hard work in putting this plan together. Because we are not spending enough on the things that help our economy grow, the things that help businesses move products, the thing that help workers get to the job, the things that help families get home to see their loved ones at night. We spend significantly less as a portion of our economy than China does, than Germany does, than just about every other advanced country. They know something that I guess we don't, which is, that's the path to growth, that's the path to competitiveness. <p>So the plan we put together would support millions of jobs. It would give cities and States and private investors the certainty they need to plan ahead. It would help small businesses ship their goods faster, help parents get home to their kids faster. And it wouldn't add to the deficits, because we'd pay for it in part by closing tax loopholes for companies that are shipping their profits overseas to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. Seems like a sensible thing to do. <p>It's not crazy, it's not socialism. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's not the imperial Presidency or&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. No laws are broken. We're just building roads and bridges like we've been doing for the last, I don't know, 50, 100 years. But so far, House Republicans have refused to act on this idea. I haven't heard a good reason why they haven't acted. It's not like they've been busy with other stuff. [<i>Laughter</i>] No, seriously. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, they're not doing anything. Why don't they do this? <p>Now, Republican obstruction is not just some abstract political stunt, it has real and direct consequences for middle class families all across the country. <p>We went through the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, we've climbed back. Since then, we've created 9.4 million new jobs over the past 51 months. Corporate profits are up, stock market is up, housing is improving. Unemployment is down. The deficits have been cut in half. We're making progress, but we still have a situation where those at the top are doing as well as ever, but middle class families all across the country are still struggling to get by. There are people who are working hard, they believe in the American Dream; it feels sometimes like the system is rigged against them. <p>And they have good reason to think that way. So far this year, Republicans in Congress have blocked or voted down every serious idea to strengthen the middle class. Not ideas that are unique to me&mdash;they're not. This isn't Obama bridge. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's Key's Bridge. But the Republicans have said no to raising the minimum wage, they've said no to fair pay, they've said no to extending unemployment insurance for over 3 million Americans looking for a new job. <p>And this obstruction keeps the system rigged for those who are doing fine at the very top. It prevents us from helping more middle class families. And as long as they insist on taking no action whatsoever that will help anybody, I'm going to keep on taking actions on my own that can help the middle class, like the actions I've already taken to speed up construction projects and attract new manufacturing jobs and lift workers' wages and help students pay off their student loans. <p>And they criticized me for this. Boehner sued me for this. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I told him, I'd rather do things with you, pass some laws, make sure the Highway Trust Fund is funded so we don't lay off hundreds of thousands of workers. It's not that hard. Middle class families can't wait for Republicans in Congress to do stuff. So sue me. [<i>Laughter</i>] As long as they're doing nothing, I'm not going to apologize for trying to do something. <p>And look, I just want to be clear, Republicans in Congress, they're patriots, they love their country, they love their families. They just have a flawed theory of the economy that they can't seem to get past. They believe that all we should be doing is giving more tax breaks to those at the top, eliminating regulations that stop big banks or polluters from doing what they want, cut the safety net from people trying to work their way into the middle class, and then somehow the economy is going to get stronger, and jobs and prosperity trickle down to everybody. That's their worldview. I'm sure they sincerely believe it. It's just not accurate. It does not work. We know from our history our economy doesn't grow from the top down, it grows from the middle out. We do better when you've got some construction workers on the job. They then go to a restaurant, and they buy a new car. That means the workers there start doing better. Everybody does better. And we could be doing so much more if Republicans in Congress were less interested in stacking the deck in favor of those at the top or trying to score political points or purposely trying to gridlock Washington and just tried to get some things done to grow the economy for everybody. We could do so much more if we just rallied around an economic patriotism, a sense that our job is to get things done as one Nation and as one people. <p>Economic patriotism would say that instead of protecting corporations that are shipping jobs overseas, let's make sure they're paying their fair share of taxes, let's reward American workers and businesses that hire them. Let's put people to work rebuilding America. Let's invest in manufacturing so the next generation of good manufacturing jobs are right here, made in the U.S.A. That'd be something to celebrate on the Fourth of July. <p>Economic patriotism says that instead of stacking the deck in the favor of folks just at the top, let's harness the talents and ingenuity of every American and give every child access to quality education and make sure that if your job was stamped obsolete or shipped overseas, you're going to get retrained for an even better job. <p>Economic patriotism says that instead of making it tougher for middle class families to get ahead, let's reward hard work for every American. Let's make sure women earn pay that's equal to their efforts. Let's make sure families can make ends meet if their child gets sick and they need to take a day off. Let's make sure no American who works full time ever has to live in poverty. <p>Let's tell everybody they're worth something. No matter who you are, no matter what you look like, where you come from, who you love, if you work hard, if you're responsible, you can make it here in America. That's what this country was founded on, that idea. That's why I ran for this office. <p>I think sometimes about what we could be accomplishing, what we could have accomplished this past year, what we could have accomplished the year before that. And typically, what gets reported on is just the politics: \\"Well, you know, they're not doing this because they don't want to give Obama a victory,\\" or \\"Oh, well, we don't want to do this right now because maybe the midterm election is coming up,\\" and, \\"Oh, well, what's happening with the polls?\\" People don't care about that. People just want to see some results. And objectively, if you look at the agenda I'm putting forward, the things that we're trying to get done like just fixing bridges and roads, it really shouldn't be controversial. It hasn't been controversial in the past. <p>And so part of the reason that I'm going to be spending a lot of time over the next several weeks and months getting out there with ordinary folks is just to report to you, it's not as if I don't know that you could use some help. I know. It's not as if we don't have good plans to put more people back to work and raise their incomes and improve the quality of education. We know how to do it. That's not the reason it's not happening. It's not happening because of politics. <p>And the only folks that can fix that are going to be you, the American people and voters. We&mdash;sometimes in our culture right now, we just get cynical about stuff, and we just assume things can't change because nothing seems to change in this town. But that's not true. It can change, as long as everybody gets activated, as long as people still feel hopeful and we don't fall prey to cynicism. <p>And so I just want everybody here to understand that as frustrating as it may be sometimes, as stuck as Congress may be sometimes, if the American people put pressure on this town to actually get something done and everybody is looking at some commonsense agenda items that we should be able to do because Democrats and Republicans were able to do them in the past, we can grow our economy, we can lift people's incomes, we can make sure that people who are fighting hard can get into the middle class and stay there. But it's going to take you. It's going to take you. This is not going to happen on its own. And I'm confident, if that's what we do, if all of you are fighting alongside me every single day instead of just giving up on this place, then we're going to make America better than ever. That's a promise. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America. Go Team U.S.A.! Let's build some bridges!\" "
"156" "\"So the&mdash;we're going into Fourth of July weekend, and what more appropriate place to be than 1776. This is an incubator for all sorts of tech startups, a lot of them focused on social change issues, on education, on health care. And so we've got a range of entrepreneurs who are trying to figure out how can we do well by doing good, in many cases. <p>And I just have to say that the young people&mdash;and some not so young people that I spoke to&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;coming from a wide range of backgrounds&mdash;we had former Army Rangers, we had lawyers, we had former HR folks, transportation experts, engineers&mdash;all of them had the kinds of energy and drive and creativity and innovation that has been the hallmark of the American economy. <p>And part of the reason I wanted to come here today is to focus on what's happened in the U.S. economy over the last several months and last several years. We just got a jobs report today showing that we've now seen the fastest job growth in the United States in the first half of the year since 1999. [<i>Applause] </i>All right? So this is also the first time we've seen 5 consecutive months of job growth over 200,000 since 1999. And we've seen the quickest drop in unemployment in 30 years. <p>So it gives you a sense that the economy has built momentum, that we are making progress. We've now seen almost 10 million jobs created over the course of the last 52 months. And it should be a useful reminder to people all across the country that, given where we started back in 2008, we have made enormous strides, thanks to the incredible hard work of the American people and American businesses that have been out there competing, getting smarter, getting more effective. And it's making a difference all across the country. <p>Now, what we also know is, as much progress has been made, there are still folks out there who are struggling. We still have not seen as much increase in income and wages as we'd like to see. A lot of folks are still digging themselves out of challenges that arose out of the great recession. <p>Historically, financial crises take a longer time to recover from. We've done better than the vast majority of other countries over the last 5 years, but that drag has still meant a lot of hardship for a lot of folks. And so it's really important for us to understand that we could be making even stronger process, we could be growing even more jobs, we could be creating even more business opportunities for smart, talented folks like these if those of us here in Washington were focused on them, focused on you, the American people, rather than focused on politics. <p>And I've given a number of examples over the last several months of things we know would work. If we are investing in rebuilding our infrastructure, that doesn't just put construction workers back to work, that puts engineers back to work, that puts landscape architects back to work, it puts folks who are manufacturing concrete or steel back to work. It makes a difference, and it has huge ripple effects all across the economy. <p>If we are serious about increasing the minimum wage, that puts more money in the pockets of people who are most likely to spend it. They, in turn, are most likely to hire more people because they now have more customers who are frequenting their businesses. If we are making sure that there's equal pay for equal work, that's helping families all across the country. If we're focused on making sure that childcare is accessible and affordable and high quality, that frees up a whole bunch of potential entrepreneurs, as well as people who are just going to work every single day, doing the right thing, being responsible, but often are hampered by difficult situations in terms of trying to manage parenting and families. <p>And so there are just a series of specific things we can do right now, many of them I'm doing on my own because we have the administrative authority to do it, but some of them we can't do without Congress. We can't fix a broken immigration system that would allow incredibly talented folks who want to start businesses here and create jobs here in the United States, would allow them to stay and make those investments. That's something that we need Congress to help us on. We're not going to be able to fund the Highway Trust Fund and to ramp up our investment in infrastructure without acts of Congress. <p>So my hope is, is the American people look at today's news and understand that, in fact, we are making strides. We have not seen more consistent job growth since the nineties. But we can make even more progress if Congress is willing to work with my administration and to set politics aside, at least occasionally&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;which I know is what the American people are urgently looking for. <p>It's a sort of economic patriotism to&mdash;where you say to yourself, how is it that we can start rebuilding this country to make sure that all of the young people who are here, but their kids and their grandkids, are going to be able to enjoy the same incredible opportunities that this country offers as we have? That's our job. That's what we should be focused on. And it's worth remembering as we go into Independence Day. <p>Thanks, everybody. Appreciate it. Thanks.\" "
"157" "\"Hi, everybody. I hope you're enjoying your Fourth of July weekend. <p>I want to begin today by saying a special word to the U.S. Men's soccer team, who represented America so well the past few weeks. We are so proud of you. You've got a lot of new believers. And I know there's actually a petition on the White House website to make Tim Howard the next Secretary of Defense. Chuck Hagel's got that spot right now, but if there is a vacancy, I promise to think about it. <p>It was 238 years ago that our Founders came together in Philadelphia to launch our American experiment. There were farmers and businessmen, doctors and lawyers, ministers and a kite-flying scientist. <p>Those early patriots may have come from different backgrounds and different walks of life, but they were united by a belief in a simple truth: that we are all created equal, that we are all endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these rights are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. <p>Over the years, that belief has sustained us through war and Depression, peace and prosperity. It's helped us build the strongest democracy, the greatest middle class, and the most powerful military the world has ever known. And today, there isn't a nation on Earth that wouldn't gladly trade places with the United States of America. <p>But our success is only possible because we have never treated those self-evident truths as self-executing. Generations of Americans have marched, organized, petitioned, fought, and even died to extend those rights to others, to widen the circle of opportunity for others, and to perfect this Union we love so much. <p>That's why I want to say a special thanks to the men and women of our Armed Forces and the families who serve with them, especially those servicemembers who spent this most American of holidays serving your country far from home. <p>You keep us safe, and you keep the United States of America a shining beacon of hope for the world. And for that, you and your families deserve not only the appreciation of a grateful nation, but our enduring commitment to serve you as well as you've served us. <p>God bless you all, and have a great weekend.\" "
"158" "\"Thank you, everybody. Please be seated. Good morning to the&mdash;good morning and welcome to the White House. And Happy Fourth of July! <p>Now, Deputy Secretary Mayorkas, thank you for taking care of the important part of this morning, which is administering the oath. That's the thing that we wanted to make sure we got right. To Acting Deputy Director Jones; to family, friends, distinguished guests: Thank you all for being here. And finally, to these 25 men and women, servicemembers and spouses, it is an honor to join everyone here, for the first time, in calling you \\"our fellow Americans.\\" <p>Now, this is one of my favorite events to do, and not just because we get to have a barbecue and watch fireworks later. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's because each of you has traveled a long journey to this moment, journeys that began in places like Jamaica and Germany, China and Guatemala. And yet somehow&mdash;either because your parents brought you here as children or because you made the choice yourselves as adults&mdash;you ended up here in America. <p>And then many of you did something extraordinary: You signed up to serve in the United States military. You answered the call to fight and potentially to give your life for a country that you didn't fully belong to yet. You understood what makes us American is not just circumstances of birth or the names in our family tree, it's that timeless belief that from many we are one; that we are bound together by adherence to a set of beliefs and unalienable rights; that we have certain obligations to each other, to look after each other, and to serve one another. And over the years, that's exactly what you've done. <p>Rodrigo Laquian came to the United States from the Philippines. He joined the Navy because, he said, he \\"wanted to be a part of something big and important. To be a part of a great cause.\\" Today Petty Officer Second Class Laquian is still part of that great cause, and today he's also an American citizen. <p>Stephanie Van Ausdall moved here from Canada with her mom when she was 18 years old. And today she's 26 and a sergeant in the Army. Stephanie says she joined the military \\"to give my children someone to look up to and someone they can be proud of.\\" Stephanie, I know that you've made your children and all of us very proud. <p>Oscar Gonzalez was born in Guatemala and became a marine last year. Becoming a citizen, he says, means becoming part of a \\"society that strives and stands for good all around the world&mdash;just being a part of that makes me complete.\\" Well, Oscar, welcoming you as an American citizen makes our country a little more complete, so thank you. <p>And then there are those of you who married an American servicemember, and as a military spouse, you've been serving our country as well. Diana Baker is originally from Kenya and met her husband Kowaine in Germany. Today she's a nurse at Frederick Memorial Hospital in Maryland, and she and her husband have four beautiful children. In Diana's words, \\"Becoming a citizen of the United States is like joining a club of the best of the best.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] And I agree. Congratulations, Diana, on joining the club. Together, all of you remind us that America is and always has been a nation of immigrants. Throughout our history, immigrants have come to our shores in wave after wave, from every corner of the globe. Every one of us, unless we're Native American, has an ancestor who was born somewhere else. <p>And even though we haven't always looked the same or spoken the same language, as Americans, we've done big things together. We've won this country's freedom together. We've built our greatest cities together. We've defended our way of life together. We've continued to perfect our Union together. <p>And that's what makes America special. That's what makes us strong. The basic idea of welcoming immigrants to our shores is central to our way of life, it is in our DNA. We believe our diversity, our differences, when joined together by a common set of ideals, makes us stronger, makes us more creative, makes us different. From all these different strands, we make something new here in America. And that's why, if we want to keep attracting the best and the brightest from beyond our shores, we're going to have to fix our immigration system, which is broken, and pass commonsense immigration reform. <p>We shouldn't be making it harder for the best and the brightest to come here and create jobs here and grow our economy here. We should be making it easier. And that's why I'm going to keep doing&mdash;&mdash; <p>[<i>At this point, an audience member applauded.</i>] <p>He agrees with me. [<i>Applause</i>] So I'm going to keep doing everything I can do to keep making our immigration system smarter and more efficient so hard-working men and women like all of you have the opportunity to join the American family and to serve our great Nation, so we can be stronger and more prosperous and more whole together. <p>I'll close with a quick story. George Mardikian was an immigrant from Armenia who became a famous chef. And George had a quote that I think will ring true for most immigrants. He said, \\"You who have been born in America, I wish I could make you understand what it is like not to be an American&mdash;not to have been an American all your life&mdash;and then suddenly, to be one, for that moment and forever after.\\" <p>Today, on this Fourth of July, all across the country&mdash;from Thomas Jefferson's Monticello to the Alamodome in Texas&mdash;immigrants from around the world are taking the oath of citizenship. And many of them have worked and sacrificed for years to get to this moment. All of them have done it for something none of us should ever take for granted: the right to be called an American, from this moment and forever after. <p>And that fact should give us hope and should make us confident about the future of our country. Because as long as there are men and women like all of you who are willing to give so much for the right to call yourselves Americans, and as long as we do our part to keep the door open to those who are willing to earn their citizenship, then we're going to keep on growing our economy, we'll continue to journey forward, and we'll remind the world why the United States of America is and always will be the greatest nation on Earth. And we're very proud of you. Congratulations. <p>God bless you. God bless the United States of America. And now I'd like to turn it over to Deputy Secretary Mayorkas. Congratulations.\" "
"159" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! Happy Fourth of July! Welcome to the White House! <p><i>Audience member.</i> Thank you! <p><i>The First Lady.</i> You're welcome! <p><i>The President.</i> No, thank you. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, this little party is something we've been doing every year, because there's no group that we'd rather spend time with on this most American of holidays than with you: the extraordinary men and women of America's military. And because of you, we're safe, we're free. You depend&mdash;we depend on you for our way of life, and the sacrifices you make are extraordinary. <p>Now, in the house we've got Army. We've got Navy. We've got Air Force. We've got Marines. We've got Coast Guard. And most important, we've got the incredible spouses and children. Give it up for our outstanding military families. <p>To help us celebrate, we've got our outstanding Marine Band. Later on, we're going to bring out Pitbull and his band. So we want to see if you like to party. [<i>Laughter</i>] And of course, this is always a special day for us because this is Malia's birthday. <p><i>Audience member.</i> She can get her license! <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Oh, she's going to get her license. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> She is. She's getting her license, but she has to practice a little bit before that happens. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, this is a gorgeous day. We want you to enjoy yourselves, so I'm going to keep my remarks brief. But it is important to remember why we're here. <p>Two hundred and thirty-eight years ago, our Founders came together and declared a new nation and a revolutionary idea: the belief that we are all created equal, that we're free to govern ourselves, that each of us is entitled to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. <p>And in the generations that have followed&mdash;through war and peace, through depression and prosperity&mdash;these truths have guided us as we have built the greatest democratic, economic, and military force the world has ever known. <p>So today, immigrants from around the world dream of coming to our shores. Young people aspire to study at our universities. Other nations look to us for support and leadership in times of disaster and conflict and uncertainty. And when the world looks to America, so often they look to all of you, the men and women of our Armed Forces. Every day, at home and abroad, you're working to uphold those ideals first declared in that Philadelphia hall more than two centuries ago. Every day, you give meaning to that basic notion that as Americans, we take care of each other. And so today we honor all of you. <p>And we salute some of the folks who are here with us on this balcony. We salute our soldiers, like Chief Warrant Officer Tommy Oroho, who has served this Nation in uniform for 27 years, including deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. Two summers ago, Tom was at the beach, saw a young girl and her father who had been swept out to sea, and jumped into dangerous riptide and pulled them back to safety. That's the kind of service we expect from our outstanding soldiers. Please give it up for Tom. Thank you. <p>We salute our sailors, like Seaman Reverlie Thomas, who came to America 21 years ago from Trinidad. She served a tour in the Persian Gulf for the Navy. Just a few hours ago here at the White House, I was proud to welcome Seaman Thomas and 24 other servicemembers and military spouses as our newest American citizens. Thank you Reverlie, and congratulations. <p>We salute our airmen, like Technical Sergeant Cheryl Uylaki, who manages the Fisher House at Dover Air Force Base, ensuring the families of our fallen are always provided comfort and care worthy of their profound sacrifice. We're so grateful to you, Cheryl, for your great work. <p>We salute our marines, like Sergeant Isaac Gallegos, who was severely wounded after an IED explosion in Iraq 8 years ago. He suffered burns on almost every inch of his face. He was pronounced dead three separate times. Undergone 161 surgeries. But he is here standing with us today, pursuing a master's degree, working full time for the Navy. That's what we're talking about when we talk about marines. Give it up for Isaac. <p>We salute our coasties, like Lieutenant Commander Sean Plankey, who helped lead a cyber team in Afghanistan that supported our troops during firefights and helped prevent the detonation of remote-controlled IEDs, saving countless of lives. So thank you, Sean. <p>And we salute our military families: the spouses who put their careers on hold for their loved ones, the children who pick up extra chores while Mom or Dad is deployed, the siblings and parents and extended family members who serve the country every single day. You're the reason Michelle and Jill Biden started the Joining Forces initiative, to make sure America is supporting you too. And today we honor your service here today. <p>So as we pause on this Fourth of July to celebrate what makes us American, we salute all of you whose service and sacrifice renews that promise of America every single day. On behalf of the entire country, Michelle and I simply want to say thank you to all of you for your courage and your strength and your unending service to this Nation. <p>Happy Fourth of July, everybody. Have a great party. Have a hotdog. Have a hamburger. We want to see you dancing. God bless you all. God bless the United States of America. Hey! Thank you.\" "
"160" "\"Well, good afternoon, everybody. I am here with some outstanding teachers as well as Secretary Arne Duncan. And the reason we're here is with the school year now over, it is a great time for us to focus on what we need to do to make sure that next year and the year after that and the year after that continues to improve for students all across this country. <p>The one ingredient that we know makes an enormous difference is a great teacher, and we have four of the best teachers in the country here. But what we also know is that there are outstanding teachers all across the country, and Arne, myself, I suspect many of you had wonderful teachers that made all the difference in your lives and allowed you to be excited about learning and set you on a path for an extraordinary career. <p>Unfortunately, there are a lot of kids around the country who are not getting the kind of teaching that they need, not because there aren't a whole lot of great potential teachers out there, but because we're not doing enough to put a lot of our teachers in a position to succeed. They may not be getting the training they need; they may not be getting the professional development and support that they need in the classroom. And part of our goal since we came into office, since Arne became Secretary of Education, is how do we continually improve how teachers can get better each and every year. <p>Of particular concern is the fact that, typically, the least experienced teachers, the ones with the least support, often end up in the poorest schools. So we have a problem in which the kids who need the most skilled teachers are the least likely to get them. And the most talented and skilled teachers oftentimes are teaching the kids who are already the best prepared and have the most resources outside of the school in order to succeed. <p>So what we're trying to do today&mdash;and Arne is going to have more to say about this this afternoon because there are a whole bunch of other teachers who are here in town&mdash;is to highlight what we're calling Excellent Educators for All. It's going to be a program in which we ask States to take a look at where they're distributing great teachers, what are they doing in order to train and promote and place teachers in some of the toughest environments for children. And what we're also going to be doing is providing technical assistance, highlighting best practices, all with the intention of making sure that wherever a child is, anywhere in the country, they've got that opportunity to have somebody in front of the classroom or beside them, guiding them, mentoring them, helping them learn. <p>And when I think about my own experience, the only reason I'm here in the White House is because I had some extraordinary teachers as well as a pretty extraordinary mom and grandparents. And I think everybody sitting around this table probably feels the same way. I suspect that's part of what inspired some of these people to become teachers. We want to make sure every child has that access to excellent teachers, and we're very confident that if we can lift up what works, that there are going to be a lot of States that want to adapt it. <p>So, unfortunately right now, they don't necessarily have the information, and as I said, if we do nothing, if we don't highlight the problem, then inevitably, the kids who probably need the less help get the most, and the kids who need the most help are getting the least. That's something that we're going to need to reverse not just because it's good for these kids; we know that if they've got a great teacher, they're more likely to graduate, more likely to go to college, more likely to succeed in their career. It's also necessary for our economy, because we've got too many kids who are trapped in situations in which they're not able to realize their full potential. <p>So I want to thank all these folks for being here, and I'm really looking forward to listening to them to find out what they think can be most helpful in promoting excellence in teaching. All right? <p>Thank you, everybody.\" "
"161" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Denver! <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hello! <p><i>The President.</i> Everybody, have a seat. So I think we should just stay here all afternoon and have a picnic. This is really nice around here. Wow! What a gorgeous day. <p>Can everybody please give Alex a big round of applause for that great introduction? It is so good to be back in Denver. It is great to be back in Colorado. As all of you know, I spent a lot of time here in my last campaign. I have been itching to get back. <p>I got to have dinner last night with Alex and four other Coloradans&mdash;Elizabeth Cooper, Leslie Gresham, Carolyn Reed and her husband David&mdash;at the Wazee Supper Club. It was tasty. That was some good pizza. [<i>Laughter</i>] And then, I walked down the block to shoot some pool with Governor Hickenlooper at his old bar, the Wynkoop Brewing Company. You should not ask him who won. [<i>Laughter</i>] No, no, you just&mdash;really, don't ask Governor Hickenlooper who won at pool. [<i>Laughter</i>] And it's a great time to be in this beautiful park with my friend Ken Salazar, who I love and I haven't seen in a while. There he is right there. As well as your Congressman, Ed Perlmutter. Yay, Ed. <p>So let me tell you why I'm here. Every day, we get thousands of letters and e-mails at the White House. I think it's something like 40,000 a day of some sort of correspondence. And every night, our Correspondence Office selects 10 letters for me to read. And I've been doing that since I first came into office. And it's one of the most important things I do&mdash;it's right there next to my national security briefing and whatever policy issues that we're supposed to be working on&mdash;because it reminds me of why I ran for office. <p>And so I have a chance just to hear from people as they tell their stories. They talk about the hardships that they're going through; sometimes, they talk about a success that they've had. Kids write to me, asking questions about what I'm doing about climate change or how old is Bo. [<i>Laughter</i>] So people describe to me their fears and their hopes not just for themselves, but also for their children and their grandchildren and for the country. And sometimes, they thank me for taking a position on an issue. And sometimes, they say, how dare you take that position on an issue? And sometimes, people say they're proud of the work that I've done, and sometimes, people call me an idiot&mdash;or worse than an idiot&mdash;which is how I know that I'm getting a good sample. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So Alex wrote to tell me that the day after my State of the Union Address, her boss gave her a raise to $10.10 an hour. Alex actually, last night, confessed she actually didn't watch my State of the Union Address. [<i>Laughter</i>] Which, hey, I understand. [<i>Laughter</i>] When I was her age, I'm sure I missed a whole bunch of State of the Union Addresses. But her boss caught it, and he decided, let me make sure I'm paying my employees a fair wage. <p>Carolyn, from up in Wellington, wrote to say she and David used an SBA loan from the Recovery Act to open the third of their six Silver Mine Subs shops. They had&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. Oh, you know Silver Mine? All right. Everybody is happy about that. It was a wonderful story because both her and her husband were Teamsters. See, she worked at UPS, and he worked for Bud. And they just knew that they wanted to start something of their own. And she described to us last night what it was like to take the risk to mortgage the house, make a business for herself, and then now to have a hundred employees and to be giving those folks an opportunity. They're hiring, by the way&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;in case people are interested. <p>Leslie, from Parker, wrote to say she'd been teaching preschool for 26 years and was an early childhood education educator of the year, just a wonderful teacher. But she described the difference she could see in children who had that early exposure to the kind of classroom education that she's providing. <p>And Elizabeth, who's going to be a junior this fall at the University of Northern Colorado, wrote to tell me how hard it is for middle class families like hers to afford college. And she shared something I know many of you feel when you wonder what the heck is going on in Washington. She wrote she feels \\"not significant enough to be addressed, not poor enough for people to worry about, and not rich enough to be cared about.\\" That's what she wrote. <p>So part of the reason I wanted to have dinner with these folks is because they reminded me of why I ran for office and what I'm supposed to be doing every single day. And the reason I'm here today is very simple: I'm here because of Elizabeth and Alex and Carolyn and Leslie. And I'm here for every American who works their tail off and does everything right and who believes in the American Dream and asks for nothing but a chance at a decent life for themselves and their families. That's why I'm here. And to tell all of you that I hear you. <p>I mean, sometimes, it's as simple as that, that I am listening and paying attention, partly because when I listen to Alex or I listen to Carolyn or I listen to any of the folks that I met with, I see myself in them. Because I remember my first minimum wage job&mdash;at Baskin Robbins, by the way&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I had to wear a cap and an apron&mdash;and how, like, a little raise would have really helped. I think about what it was like for me to finance college. I think about childcare costs when Michelle and I were first starting out with Malia and Sasha. Your stories are ours. You're why I ran. <p>And so what I want to make sure of is, is that as screwed up sometimes as Washington gets, that everybody here understands that there's progress to be made and that there's somebody out there who's fighting for them, even if it sometimes feels like the system's rigged against them. <p>The other thing I want to make sure people understand is, is that we are making progress, as bad as the news looks if all you were doing was watching cable TV all day long. Yes, the crisis that hit towards the end of my first campaign hit us all really badly; 2007, 2008, that was rough. But today, our businesses have added nearly 10 million new jobs over the past 52 months. Construction and housing are rebounding. Our auto industry is booming. Manufacturing is adding jobs for the first time since the nineties. The unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest point since September of 2008, the fastest 1-year drop in nearly 30 years. <p>And look, most of this is attributable to you, the American people, starting businesses and paying down debt and tightening belts and doing all kinds of stuff just to make sure that you kept on and were able to look after your families. But the decisions we made early on not only stopped the slide, but also built a new foundation for our economy, and they're paying off now. <p>We're more energy independent. We've tripled the electricity we generate from the wind, ten times from the sun, creating jobs across the country, while producing more oil at home than we buy abroad for the first time in nearly 20 years. Our energy sector is booming. And by the way, we're doing that while reducing our carbon emissions more than any other country over the last 5 years. So we're making progress on climate change as well. <p>In education, our high school graduation rate is at a record high. The Latino dropout rate has dropped in half. More young people are graduating from college than ever before. We made our Tax Code fairer. We cut our deficits by more than half. We've given millions more Americans the security of health care that means you won't go broke just because you get sick. <p>So thanks to the hard work of you, and some actually pretty smart policies by us&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;we have come farther and recovered faster than almost any other advanced nation on Earth. More companies are choosing to bring back jobs from overseas. Thanks to our leadership in technology and innovation, for the first time in more than a decade, business leaders around the world have declared, China is not number one when it comes to the place to invest, the United States is. And our lead is growing. <p>So despite what you may hear, there is no doubt we are making progress. By almost every measure, we are better off than when I took office&mdash;by almost every measure. But here's the thing, and this is why I've got to get out more and have lunch with&mdash;and pizza with the&mdash;with my friends, because the fact is, we know we've still got a long way to go. <p>Here's the challenge: We've created more jobs at this point of the year than any year since 1999. More jobs have been created in the first half of this year than we have since the nineties. But many families barely earn what they did in the nineties. Corporate profits are higher than ever. CEOs make more than ever. But most people are working harder than ever just to get by. Wages, incomes have flatlined. They have not gone up. <p>So as a whole, the country is doing better, but too much improvement goes to the folks at the top and not enough of it is making a difference in the lives of ordinary Americans. And that's what we should be spending all our time talking about: How do we reverse some of those trends? That's what I came to Denver to talk about: that. That issue: How do we make sure if you work hard, do the right thing, you can get ahead? Washington may chase whatever political story they think will get attention, but to me the only story that matters is your story. And I am here to say that this country does not succeed when just a few at the top do well and everybody else is treading water. America does better when the middle class does better, when folks who work hard can afford to buy what they make and provide for our families and leave something better for our kids. <p>So this is what I'm spending time on. This is what I'm fighting for. This is my opportunity agenda. I'm focused on how do we create good jobs that pay good wages, jobs in American manufacturing and construction, in American energy and innovation. <p>I'm fighting for an opportunity agenda that trains more workers with the skills to fill those jobs at community colleges and in apprenticeships and internships that give young people a solid start. <p>We're fighting for an opportunity agenda that guarantees every child a world-class education, from high-quality pre-K to a redesigned high school, to colleges and a rewarding career that's affordable and you're not loaded up with debt. <p>We're fighting to make sure your hard work pays off with higher wages that you can live on and savings you can retire on; workplace flexibility so if your kids get sick or you've got an ailing parent, you're not looking at losing your job; overtime pay that you've earned; affordable health care that's there when you get sick and you need it most. We're fighting for the idea that everybody gets opportunity, no matter what you look like or where you come from or who you love or how you grew up or what your last name is. America is a place where you should be able to make it if you try. <p>And the good news is, we actually know how to do some of these things. If we make just some modest changes&mdash;we don't need revolutionary changes. If we made some modest changes, made some sensible decisions we'd create more jobs, we'd lift more income, we'd strengthen the middle class. We wouldn't solve every problem overnight, but we'd be making more progress even than we're already making. That's what we should be doing. And of course, that's what drives you nuts about Washington, because that's not what it's doing. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>After everything we've been through together, you'd think that these challenges would absorb the attention of folks in Washington. But these days, basic, commonsense ideas cannot get through Congress. Basic stuff, stuff that used to be uncontroversial. It used to be that Republicans, Democrats, everybody said, you know what, America, it's a good thing when we build roads and bridges and a smart grid and&mdash;to transmit energy. All those things are good for business, they're good for workers, it helps. Now can't&mdash;they can't seem to pass a bill just to fund basic projects that we know are good for our economy. <p>We have evidence that early childhood education, every dollar we spend there, you get 7 bucks back because kids do better in school, they don't drop out, they're less likely to get in trouble. They're less likely to go to jail. They're less&mdash;more likely to be taxpayers later on. But you look at Congress: They can't do it. <p>Think about it. So far this year, Republicans in Congress have blocked or voted down every serious idea to strengthen the middle class. They've said no to raising the minimum wage. They said no to fair pay legislation so that women are getting paid the same as men for doing the same work. They said no to unemployment insurance for Americans who are out there looking for a new job. I know, because I get letters from them every day, folks who have worked all their lives, paid taxes all their lives. And now, right when they're having a tough time because of an unprecedented recession that we just went through, and they need a little help so they don't lose their house or they don't lose their car, suddenly, Congress can't do it. <p>Congress just said no to fixing our broken immigration system in a way that strengthens our borders and our businesses, despite the fact that everybody from law enforcement to corporations to evangelicals&mdash;there's a coalition around immigration reform that's unprecedented. These guys still can't get their act together. <p>Rather than invest in education that lets working families get ahead, they voted to give another massive tax cut to the wealthiest Americans. Rather than invest in roads and bridges to create construction jobs and help our businesses succeed, they've chosen to preserve and protect tax loopholes for companies that shift their profits overseas that don't do anybody any good. <p>Republicans in Congress right now have shown over and over, they'll do anything to rig the system for those at the top or to try to score political points on me, even if the obstruction keeps the system rigged against the middle class. I mean, the best thing you can say for them this year is they haven't yet shut down the Government so far or threatened to go deadbeat on America's obligations. But it is still early, so&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>Now, I always have to say this: I don't think that they're all terrible people. I think they love their families. They love the country. They've got a different economic theory. Maybe they don't know what ordinary folks are going through. But maybe it's not that they don't get it. Maybe it's just because the theory they have is, is that if the economy is doing good for folks at the very top, then it's going to help everybody else, despite the fact that we have evidence over and over again that those theories have failed the middle class. <p>More tax breaks to those at the top, fewer investments in things like education. Looser rules for big banks or credit card companies or polluters or insurers&mdash;they believe all that stuff really makes the economy hum and prosperity trickles down. <p>Just because they believe it doesn't mean the rest of us believe it, because we know from our history, it doesn't work. Our economy grows best from the middle out, when everybody has a shot, everybody is doing well. And with a slight change of priorities, we could do it. We could help a lot more Americans get ahead. And folks at the top will do well too. Everybody will do better. <p>And by the way, that&mdash;Republicans used to understand this. This is not, like, a crazy Democratic, socialist idea. [<i>Laughter</i>] My favorite President is a Republican, Abraham Lincoln, who built&mdash;helped build a transcontinental railroad and invested in the Homestead Act that helped people get land and invested in our first major Federal scientific research; understood that you make these common investments&mdash;land-lease colleges&mdash;or land-grant colleges, that all these things would end up giving people tools to improve themselves and thereby improve the country. And we couldn't all do it alone. We had to do it with each other. <p>This wasn't just a Democratic idea. Eisenhower built the Interstate Highway System. Teddy Roosevelt started our national parks. These are basic ideas that made America work. They're not partisan. So I'm going to keep on working with Republicans and Democrats to try to get things moving over there. <p>In the meantime, I'm not going to stand by while partisan gridlock or political games threaten the hard work of millions of Americans. So wherever and whenever I can go ahead and help families like yours&mdash;I've got the legal authority to do it&mdash;I'm going to do it. I'm not going to wait. [<i>Applause</i>] Not going to wait. <p>That's why I've taken a bunch of actions this year just to help working Americans while still reaching out to Congress. What I've said to them is, if you're not acting, I'm going to go ahead and do what I can. <p>So if Congress won't act to make sure woman&mdash;women have the ability to get equal pay for equal work, I made sure that women had the protections they need to fight for fair pay in the workplace. I think when women succeed, America succeeds. We're going to keep on investing in that. <p>If Congress won't act to create jobs in construction or manufacturing, we're going to go ahead and speed up permits for big projects that are already funded and launch new hubs to attract more high-tech manufacturing jobs. Because I want to make sure the next revolution in manufacturing and technology is an American revolution, right here in the United States. I don't want it going to France or Germany or China. I want it to happen here. <p>If Congress won't act to help more young people manage their student loan debt so far&mdash;and Republicans voted against a bill that would have allowed young people to refinance at lower rates&mdash;I went ahead and gave nearly 5 million Americans the opportunity to cap their student loan payments at 10 percent of their income. I don't want them saddled with debt before they start out in life. I want to make sure that they're able to pursue a career in teaching or social work or work in a non-for-profit, and they can still afford it. Republicans so far refuse to raise workers' wages. I did what I could. I'm&mdash;it turns out, I'm a pretty big employer. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I said, any Federal worker&mdash;anybody who works for Federal contractors, they're going to have to pay their employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour. And I asked business owners and Governors and mayors and State legislators to do what they could on their own. <p>And by at way, since I first asked Congress to raise the minimum wage, 13 States have gone ahead and raised theirs, and those States have seen higher job growth than the States that haven't raised their minimum wage. And more and more business owners are choosing to lift wages for workers like Alex. America needs a raise. And when&mdash;by the way, when America needs a raise&mdash;I was talking to Carolyn, our sub owner, last night, and she made the simple point, look, I want tax cuts and raises for my workers and for others who don't have a lot because that means they're going to buy more sandwiches. I mean, I can already afford a sub sandwich. If you give me a tax cut, I'm not going to spend&mdash;I'm not going to buy more sub sandwiches; I can only eat so many. [<i>Laughter</i>] But that's true about the economy generally. When you give tax breaks and you give raises, you raise the minimum wage, you give a bigger chance to folks who are climbing the ladder, working hard, don't have a lot at the end of the month, that money gets churned back into the economy. And the whole economy does better, including the businesses. <p>Now, I gather that some of the Republicans in Congress are mad at me for going ahead and doing things. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I don't know which things they find most offensive, whether it's creating jobs or easing student loan burdens or raising wages, but it's really bothering them. They have a plan to sue me. They have plans to sue me for taking executive actions that are within my authority, while they do nothing. <p>I have a better idea. They should do something. I will work with them. Rather than engage in political stunts that waste time and taxpayer money, join me. Let's do some things together. Let's build some roads. Let's give America a raise. Let's help families with childcare costs. There are all kinds of things we can do. Don't be mad at me for doing something. How about teaming up with me? Let's all do something. Let's all get America working. <p>We are better than this. Gosh, aren't&mdash;doesn't it get you just frustrated? [<i>Laughter</i>] We could do so much more if Republicans in Congress focused less on protecting the folks who've got the lobbyists and all that soft money out there. Stop worrying about the folks who already got&mdash;are doing just fine. Focus more on stoking opportunity for all people. Work with me. That's the American way. That's what makes this country great, a sense of common purpose and patriotism, an economic patriotism that says we fall and we rise as one Nation, as one people. <p>So we can rally America around an economic patriotism that says, don't give tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires, let's give more tax breaks to help working families pay for childcare or college. <p>Let's rally around a patriotism that says, don't give tax loopholes to corporations shifting jobs overseas, let's put people back to work here rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our airports, making sure the next generation of manufacturing is made in America. That's patriotism. [<i>Applause</i>]<i> </i>That's patriotism. <p>Don't stack the deck in favor of those who've already succeeded. We're stronger when we're helping everybody succeed, cultivating every talent of every child. Every 4-year-old in America, give them high-quality preschool so they're safe and taught well while we go to work, and redesign our high schools to prepare our kids for the 21st century. And tell every American, you know, if your job was stamped \\"obsolete,\\" if it was shipped overseas, we're going to train you for an even better one. <p>We need an economic patriotism that says it's a good thing that everybody gets health insurance. That's not a bad thing. That's a good thing. It's a good thing when women are paid the same as men for doing the same work. That's not un-American. It's a good thing when parents have some flexibility when their kids are sick. It will make the employees more loyal; they're more productive. It's a good thing when nobody who works full time is living in poverty. That's not un-American. It's not radical. It's right. It's what built this country. <p>I know that sometimes, it must be frustrating watching what's going on. I guarantee, I get frustrated. There are some things that I have to mutter under my breath sometimes. [<i>Laughter</i>] And the hardest thing to change in politics is a stubborn status quo. And it's harder when Washington seems distracted by everything except the things you care about. And there's a cottage industry in Washington that counts on you just being cynical about stuff so that you don't vote, you don't get involved, you get discouraged, you say a plague on both your houses. But you can't give into that cynicism. Do not let them win by you being cynical, because despite everything that's happened, despite all the obstruction, America is making progress. <p>We're better off now than we were 5 years ago. We're going to be better off 5 years from now than we are right now. Despite the unyielding opposition of a few, there are workers who have jobs who didn't have them before. There are families who have health insurance who didn't have them before. There are students who can afford to go to college who couldn't afford to go before. There are troops who are home with their families after serving tour after tour of war. Don't get cynical. Don't do it. <p>Cynicism is a popular choice these days. It's what passes off for wisdom. [<i>Laughter</i>] But cynicism isn't wise. And remember that it is a choice. Cynicism is a choice, and hope is a better choice. And it's a choice that I make every time I sit down with these incredible people that I had dinner with last night. They make me hopeful. <p>It's the hope that Alex has when she sits down and she picks up a pen and she writes to the President hoping that the system still works; hoping maybe the letter gets there; hoping that I'll listen; hoping that even when Washington seems tone deaf, your voice might reach a President, your voice might reach a crowd in a park, your voice might move fellow citizens to change what needs changing. <p>Every day, I receive these thousands of acts of hope from you. I'm listening. It's why I ran for office. It's why I'm fighting for you. I will keep treating your cares and concerns as my own. I will keep trying to restore the American Dream for everybody who is willing to work for it. <p>Thank you, Denver. God bless you. God bless America. Thank you.\" "
"162" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Austin! Hey! Hello, Austin! All right, everybody, have a seat, have a seat. It's good to be in Austin, Texas. Can everybody please give Kinsey a big round of applause for the great introduction? <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you! <p><i>The President.</i> That's because I love you. I&mdash;everybody knows I love Austin, Texas. Every time I come here I tell you how much I love you. I love Austin. I love the people. I love the barbecue, which I will get right after this. [<i>Laughter</i>] I like the music. I've got good memories here; I've got good friends. <p>I was telling somebody that the last time I walked, a real walk, where I was kind of left alone was in Austin, Texas. Right before the debate here during the primary in 2007, 2008? It must have been 2008. And I was walking along the river, and nobody noticed me, and I felt great. [<i>Laughter</i>] And then, on the way back, somebody did notice me, and Secret Service started coming around and&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but that first walk was really good. So let's face it, I just love Austin. Love the people of Austin. <p>I want to thank a proud Texan, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, for being here today. We appreciate her. <p>It is great to play at the Paramount. I think I finally made it. I finally arrived. I've enjoyed the last couple of days, just getting out of Washington. And we started in Colorado, in Denver, and then went to Dallas and then came down here. And at each stop, I've been able to just meet people and talk about people's lives, their hopes, their dreams. <p>I just had some coffee, as Kinsey may have mentioned, at the Magnolia Cafe, which was very nice. It was fun too because I had a chance to&mdash;there were a bunch of folks there, and some EMT folks were there on their break after their shift, and there were a group of high school kids who were getting together. They were about to go on a 2-week-long service trip to Peru, which, by the way, reminds you, you should be optimistic whenever you meet young people because they're full of energy and idealism. And so they were going to do this service trip, and they were going to go for 2 days, then, to Machu Picchu, the old Inca ruins in Peru. And I said, I always wanted to go there. And they said, well, you can come with us if you want. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I said, I'm really tempted, but I think there are some things I've got to do. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But I got them&mdash;in exchange for a selfie with them, they promised that they would send me a picture of them when they get there. So I'm going to hold them to it. We got their e-mail, and if I don't get it, I'll be upset. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Anyway, so I was talking to Kinsey because she wrote me a letter and I wanted to reply in person. Because, as some of you may know, every day, we get tens of thousands of letters or correspondence, e-mails at the White House. And ever since&mdash;of the first day I was in office, what I've asked our Correspondence Office to do is to select 10 of them for me to read every night. And in these letters, people tell me their stories. They talk about losing a job or finding a job. They talk about trying to finance a college education. They talk about challenges because maybe they're the children of immigrants, and they're worried about their status. They talk about the hardships they're going through, successes they had, things they hope for, things that they're afraid of when it comes to the future and their lives. <p>Sometimes, people say thank you for something I've done or a position I've taken, and some people say, \\"You're an idiot.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member.</i> Wrong! <p><i>The President. </i>And that's how I know that I'm getting a good representative sampling because&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;half the letters are less than impressed with me. <p>So Kinsey wrote me to tell me about her family. Her mom was a preschool teacher, her dad was an engineer. Together, obviously, they worked really hard, raised a family. They were responsible, did all the right things, were able to put their kids through college. Then they lost their jobs. And because they lost their jobs as midcareer persons, a lot of their r&eacute;sum&eacute;s didn't get answered. And their savings started to dwindle. And Kinsey works to pay for school, but it's not enough. <p>And she told me that she's always been passionate about politics and the issues of the day, but after last year's Government shutdown, all this stuff has happened with her family, it doesn't seem like anybody in Washington is thinking about them. She wrote: \\"I became a disgruntled citizen. I felt as if my Government, my beloved Government that's supposed to look out for the needs of all Americans had failed me. My parents have always supported my siblings and me,\\" she wrote, \\"now it's my turn to help them. I want to be involved. President Obama, what can I do?\\" <p>So I wanted to meet with Kinsey to let her know that I had heard her, that I listened to what was happening with her family and I was thinking about her parents and I was thinking about her and her sisters. And I'm here today because of Kinsey. And I'm here today because of every American who is working their tail off and does everything right and who believes in the American Dream and just wants a chance to build a decent life for themselves and their families. <p>And you and folks like Kinsey are the reason I ran for President in the first place, because your lives are the lives that I lived. When I listen to Kinsey, I think about me and Michelle trying to finance our college education. When I think about somebody who didn't have health care, I think about my mom when she had cancer that would ultimately end her life at about the age I am now. When I think about equal pay, I think about my grandmother working her way up at a bank with nothing but a high school education and becoming the vice president of the bank, but always being kind of passed over for the next stage by men who were less qualified than she was. <p>So the stories that I hear in these letters, they're my story, and they're Michelle's story, and they're the story that we had before I became Senator: worrying about childcare, trying to figure out how to have a balanced life so that if your&mdash;Malia or Sasha got sick we could take time off and how do you manage all that. <p>So that's why these letters are so important to me. And that's why whenever I'm out of Washington, part of what I want to do is just to remember and to connect with your stories so that you know that what I'm trying to do every single day is based on that experience. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Thank you! <i>The President.</i> And when I see&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;and when you see the trajectory of Kinsey's family, in some ways, it's a little bit a story of what's happened to America. <p>The crisis in 2008 hurt us all badly, worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. But you think about the progress we've made. Today, our businesses have added nearly 10 million new jobs over the past 52 months. Our housing is rebounding. Our auto industry is booming. Manufacturing is adding more jobs than any time since the 1990s. The unemployment rate is the lowest point it's been since September of 2008. Kinsey's dad found a new job that he loves in a field&mdash;in the field he was trained for. So a lot of this had&mdash;was because of the resilience and hard work of the American people. That's what happens. Americans bounce back. <p>But some of it had to do with decisions we made to build our economy on a new foundation. And those decisions are paying off. We're more energy independent. For the first time in nearly 20 years, we produce more oil here at home than we buy from abroad. The world's largest oil and gas producer isn't Russia, it's not Saudi Arabia, it's the United States of America. <p>At the same time, we've reduced our total carbon pollution over the past 8 years more than any country on Earth. We have tripled the amount of electricity we generate from wind. We've increased the amount of solar energy we have by 10 times. We're creating jobs across the country in clean energy. <p>In education, our high school graduation rate is at a record high; the Latino dropout rate has been cut in half since 2000. More young people are graduating from college than ever before. <p><i>Audience member.</i> <i>S&iacute;, se puede!</i> <p><i>The President.</i> <i>S&iacute;, se peude.</i> [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>The Affordable Care Act has given millions more families peace of mind. They won't go broke just because they get sick. Our deficit has been cut by more than half. <p>We have come farther and recovered faster, thanks to you&mdash; <p><i>Audience member. </i>Thanks to you!<i> </i><p><i>The President. </i>&mdash;&mdash;than just about any other nation on Earth. And so we've got a lot to be encouraged by, just as the story of Kinsey's family makes us feel more encouraged. For the first time in a decade, business leaders around the world have said the number-one place to invest is not China, it's the United States of America. So we're actually seeing companies bring jobs back. So there's no doubt that we are making progress. By almost every measure, we are better off now than we were when I took office. <p>But the fact is, we've still got a long way to go. We've still got a long way to go, because while we're creating more jobs faster these first 6 months of this year than any time since 1999, we know there are still a lot of folks out there who are looking for work or looking for more full-time work or looking for a better paying job. Corporate profits are higher than ever. CEOs make more than ever. But you're working harder than ever just to get by and pay the bills. <p>So as a whole, the country is doing better. But the problem is, is that so much of the improved productivity and profits have gone to the folks at the very top, and the average person, their wages and incomes haven't really gone up at all, and in some cases, haven't kept up with the rising cost of health care or college or all the basic necessities that people need. And so, Austin, I'm here to say that this country is not going to succeed if just a few are doing well. This country succeeds when everybody has got a shot. The country does better when the middle class does better and when there are more ladders of opportunity into the middle class. That's the kind of economy that works here in America. And that's what's at stake right now. <p>That's why we're fighting for an opportunity agenda that creates more good jobs and creates more good wages, jobs in American manufacturing, jobs in construction. We should be rebuilding infrastructure all across America, putting people back to work rebuilding roads and bridges and schools, creating a smart grid to transmit clean energy across the country more efficiently. <p>We can create good jobs in American energy and&mdash;&mdash; <p>[<i>At this point, the President sneezed.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i>&mdash;&mdash;bless you&mdash;and innovation. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm okay, I'm just&mdash;just haven't had enough sleep. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We're fighting for an opportunity agenda that trains more workers with the skills to fill the jobs that are being created. I was talking to some folks from a community college before I came out here. We've learned that if we reach out to businesses and help them design the training programs in the community colleges, then when somebody finishes that training, they know they can get a job right away. <p>We're fighting for an opportunity agenda that guarantees every child gets a world-class education from the time that they are 3 until the time that they graduate from college. <p>We're fighting for an opportunity agenda that makes sure your hard work pays off with higher wages and equal pay for equal work and workplace flexibility and overtime pay that you've earned. <p>We're fighting for opportunity for all and the idea that no matter who you are and what you look like and where you come from and who you love, if you work hard in America, if you work hard in Austin, if you work hard in Texas, you can make it here. [<i>Applause</i>] You can make it. <p>So that's what we're working for. And the good news is, is that the things that we need to do are well within our capabilities, our grasp. We know we can&mdash;we know how to build roads. We know how to put people back to work on infrastructure. We know that if we invest in early childhood education, every dollar we put in, we get $7 back, and fewer dropouts and fewer teen pregnancies and fewer folks going into the criminal justice system. <p>We know that if we do some basic things, if we make some basic changes, we'll see more jobs, faster economic growth, lift more incomes, strengthen the middle class. They are commonsense things. They're not that radical. We know it's what we should be doing. And what drives me nuts&mdash;and I know drives you nuts&mdash;is Washington isn't doing it. <p>And let me be clear about why Washington is broken, because sometimes, everybody says, well, you know what, all politicians are the same, all the parties&mdash;the Democrats, Republicans, it doesn't matter, it's all&mdash;look, Democrats are not perfect, I promise you. [<i>Laughter</i>] I know a lot of them. [<i>Laughter</i>] And yes, every Member of Congress, they're thinking about, I'd like to be reelected, and I'd like to keep my job. That's human nature. We all understand that. But let me be clear. On the commonsense agenda that would help middle class families, the overwhelming number of Democrats are in favor of these things. <p>They're in favor of minimum wage. They're in favor of equal pay. They're in favor of extending unemployment benefits. They're in favor of infrastructure. They're in favor of investing in research and development. They're in favor of making college more affordable. They've got specific proposals. They're willing to compromise. They're prepared to go forward. <p>So when you&mdash;when folks say they're frustrated with Congress, let's be clear about what the problem is. I'm just telling the truth now. I don't have to run for office again, so I can just, you know, let her rip. And I want to assure you, I'm really not that partisan of a guy. My favorite President is the first Republican President, a guy named Abraham Lincoln. You look at our history, and we had great Republican Presidents who&mdash;like, Teddy Roosevelt started the National Park System, and Dwight Eisenhower built the Interstate Highway System, and Richard Nixon started the EPA. <p>This is&mdash;the statement I'm making is not a partisan statement, it is a statement of fact. So far this year, Republicans in Congress have blocked or voted down every serious idea to strengthen the middle class. They have said no&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> Don't boo now, because what I wanted you to do is vote. <p>They've said no to raising the minimum wage. They've said no to fair pay. They said no to unemployment insurance for hard-working folks like Kinsey's parents who have paid taxes all their lives and never depended on anything and just needed a little help to get over a hump. They said no to fixing our broken immigration system that we know would strengthen our borders and our businesses and help families. <p>Instead of investing in education that helps working families, they voted to give another massive tax cut to the wealthiest Americans. Instead of creating jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our ports that help every business, they've decided to protect tax loopholes for companies that are shifting jobs overseas and profits overseas. <p>The best thing you can say about this Congress&mdash;the Republicans in Congress, and particularly the House of Representatives&mdash;the best you can say for them this year is that so far they have not shut down the Government or threatened to have America welch on our obligations and ruin our credit rating. That's the best you can say. But of course, it's only July, so who knows what they may cook up in the next few months. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So even as they're blocking policies that would help middle class families, they keep on offering these theories of the economy that have failed over and over again. They say, well, if we give more tax cuts to folks at the top that's going to be good. If we make fewer investments in things like education, everything will work out. If we loosen the rules for big banks and credit card companies and polluters and insurers, somehow, that's going to make the economy better. If we shrink the safety net and cut Medicaid and cut food stamps and make sure that folks who are vulnerable and trying to get back on their feet suffer more hardship, somehow, that's going to improve the economy. <p>Now, they believe these things&mdash;sincerely, I assume&mdash;that if they&mdash;if we do these things, if we just take care of folks at the top, or at least if we don't empower our Government to be able to help anybody, that somehow jobs and prosperity will trickle down and we'll all be better off. And that may work just fine for folks at the top. It worked fine for me. I don't need Government. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, the&mdash;Michelle and I now are in a position where we can pretty much finance Malia and Sasha's college education. But I remember when Michelle's parents couldn't; they needed help. And I don't know about you, but I don't believe in pulling up the ladder once I'm up. I believe in extending it down and making sure that everybody has a chance to climb up. <p>The status quo certainly works for the special interests in Washington who like things just as they are. They'll be fine whether Congress ever passes a bill again or not. But it doesn't help you. It doesn't help your neighbors. It doesn't help your friends. It doesn't help your communities. <p>And what it does, is it just feeds people's cynicism about Washington. It just makes people think, well, nothing can happen, and people start feeling hopeless. And we have to understand, in the face of all the evidence to the contrary in Washington, we can do better than we're doing right now. [<i>Applause</i>] We can do better than what we're doing right now. <p>We know from our history, our economy does not grow from the top down, it grows from the middle up. It grows from a rising, thriving middle class. It grows when we got ladders of opportunity for everybody and every young person in America is feeling hopeful and has a chance to do what they can with the God-given talents that they have. That's what we're fighting for. That is what you should be fighting for. <p>And I will always look&mdash;I'll always look for ways to get Republicans and Democrats together in this effort. But I'm not&mdash;I can't stand by with partisan gridlock that's the result of cynical political games that threaten the hard work of millions of Americans. I'm not just going to stand by and say, okay, that's&mdash;I guess that's the way it is. Whenever and wherever I have the power, the legal authority to help families like yours, even if Congress is not doing anything, I will take that opportunity. I will try to make something happen. <p>And that's the reason why my administration has taken more than 40 different actions just this year to help working Americans: because Congress won't. Congress won't act to make sure a woman gets equal pay for equal work. So I made more women have the protections they need to fight for fair pay in the workplace, because I think when women succeed, America succeeds. So we went ahead and did that. <p>Congress won't act to create jobs in manufacturing or construction. Well, I went ahead and speeded up permits for big projects. We launched a new hub to attract more high-tech manufacturing jobs to America. I want to make sure the next revolution in manufacturing is right here in America; it's an American revolution, not a German or a Chinese revolution. I want it happening right here in Austin, Texas. <p>Congress so far hasn't acted to help more young people manage their student loan debt. So I acted with my lawful authority to give nearly 5 million Americans the chance to cap their student loan payments at 10 percent of their income so they can manage it better, so that if they go into teaching or they go into social work or they're doing something in a non-for-profit, that they're not encumbered by mountains of debt. I don't want our future leaders saddled with debt before they start out in life. <p>And Republicans in Congress so far have refused to raise workers' wages with a higher minimum wage. So I acted to require that Federal contractors pay their employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour, which would give hundreds of thousands of workers a raise. I asked business owners and Governors and mayors and State legislators&mdash;anybody I could work with&mdash;do what you can on your own, I told them. <p>Since the first time I asked Congress to raise the minimum wage, Congress hasn't done anything, but 13 States have gone ahead and raised theirs. And by the way&mdash;this is important to remember, just because folks are always trying to run the okey-doke on you and&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;the States that have increased their minimum wages this year have seen higher job growth than the States that have not increased their minimum wages. And more and more business owners are choosing to lift wages for their workers because they understand that it's going to be good to have productive workers, loyal workers, invested workers. <p>Just yesterday, before I came down to Texas, when I was in Denver, I met with Carolyn Reed. She owns six Silver Mine sub shops. She started her own business. She was working at UPS and decided she wanted to be a business owner, got her first franchise. Her and her husband mortgaged their house. Eventually, they got an SBA loan. Now, she's got six stores. A wonderful woman. And today she decided to raise her hourly employees' wages to a minimum of $10.10 an hour. She just went ahead and did it on her own, because she realized that she'll have less turnover and she's going to have more productive workers. <p>As long as Congress will not increase wages for workers, I will go and talk to every business in America if I have to. There's no denying a simple truth: America deserves a raise, and if you work full time in this country, you shouldn't live in poverty. That's something that we all believe. <p>Now, here's where it gets interesting. There are a number of Republicans in Congress, including a number in the Texas delegation, who are mad at me for taking these actions. They actually plan to sue me. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, I don't know which things they find most offensive, me helping to create jobs or me raising wages or me easing the student loan burdens or me making sure women can find out whether they're getting paid the same as men for doing the same job. I don't know which of these actions really bug them. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>The truth is, even with all the actions I've taken this year, I'm issuing Executive orders at the lowest rate in more than a hundred years. So it's not clear how it is that Republicans didn't seem to mind when President Bush took more executive actions than I did. Maybe it's just me they don't like. I don't know. Maybe there's some principle out there that I haven't discerned, that I haven't figure out. [<i>Laughter</i>] You hear some of them&mdash;\\"Sue him,\\" \\"Impeach him.\\" Really? [<i>Laughter</i>] Really? For what? You're going to sue me to do&mdash;for doing my job? Okay. <p>I mean, think about that. You're going to use taxpayer money to sue me for doing my job&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;while you don't do your job. <p>There's a great movie called \\"The Departed,\\" a little violent for kids. But there's a scene in the movie where Mark Wahlberg&mdash;they're on a stakeout, and somehow the guy loses the guy that they're tracking. And Wahlberg is all upset and yelling at the guy. And the guy looks up, and he says, \\"Well, who are you?\\" And Wahlberg says: \\"I'm the guy doing my job. You must be the other guy.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Sometimes, I feel like saying to these guys, I'm the guy doing my job, you must be the other guy. <p><i>Audience member</i>. Obama, I love you! <p><i>The President</i>. [<i>Laughter</i>] So rather than wage another political stunt that wastes time, wastes taxpayers' money, I've got a better idea: Do something. If you're mad at me for helping people on my own, let's team up. Let's pass some bills. Let's help America together. It is lonely, me just doing stuff. I'd love if the Republicans did stuff too. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, on immigration issues, we've got&mdash;and to their credit, there are some Republicans in the Senate who actually worked with Democrats, passed a bill, would strengthen the borders, would help make the system more fair and more just. But the House Republicans, they haven't even called the bill. They won't even take a vote on the bill. They don't have enough energy or organization or I don't know what to just even vote no on the bill. [<i>Laughter</i>] And then, they're mad at me for trying to do some things to make the immigration system work better. So it doesn't make sense. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Obama! [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> So I'm sorry, what are you yelling about now? Sit down, guys. I'm almost done. Come on, sit down. Now, I'll talk to you afterwards, I promise. I'll bring you back. I'm wrapping things up here. <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> I understand. See, everybody is going to start&mdash;I'm on your side, man. Sit down, guys, we'll talk about it later, I promise. <p>So look, here's what we could do. We could do so much more&mdash;no, you don't have to escort them out. They'll sit down. I promise, I'll talk to you afterwards. <p>We could do so much more if Republicans in Congress would focus less on stacking the deck for those on the top and focus more on creating opportunity for everybody. And I want to work with them. I don't expect them to agree with me on everything, but at least agree with me on the things that you used to say you were for before I was for them. <p>You used to be for building roads and infrastructure. Nothing has changed. Let's go ahead and do it. Ronald Reagan passed immigration reform, and you love Ronald Reagan. Let's go ahead and do it. <p>I mean, what changed? <p><i>Audience member</i>. They don't like us! <p><i>The President</i>. I'm just saying. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's what made our country great, a sense of common purpose, a sense we're all in it together as one Nation, as one people. We can debate the issues, we can have our differences, but let's do something. Let's rally around an economic patriotism that says, instead of giving more tax breaks to millionaires, let's give tax breaks to working families to help pay for childcare or college. <p>Instead of protecting tax loopholes that let corporations keep their profits overseas, let's put some of that money to work right here in the United States rebuilding America. We can rebuild our airports, create the next generation of good manufacturing jobs, make sure those are made in America. <p>Let's rally around a patriotism that says we're stronger as a nation when we cultivate the ingenuity and talent of every American and give every 4-year-old in America access to high-quality education, good-quality preschool. Let's redesign our high schools to make them more relevant to the 21st-century economy. Let's make college more affordable. Let's make sure every worker, if you lose your job, you can get a good job, training that gives you an even better job. Let's embrace the patriotism that says it's a good thing when our fellow citizens have health care. It's not a bad thing. [<i>Applause</i>] That's not a bad thing. It's a good thing when women earn what men do for the same work. That's an all-American principle. Everybody has got a mom out there or a wife out there or a daughter out there. They don't want them to not get treated the&mdash;fairly. Why would you be against that? <p>It's a good thing when parents can take a day off to care for a sick child without losing their job or losing pay and they can't pay their bills at the end of the month. It's a good thing when nobody who works full time is living in poverty. That is not radical. It's not un-American. It's not socialist. That's how we built this country. It's what America is all about, us working together. <p>So let me just wrap up by saying this: The hardest thing to change in politics is a stubborn status quo. It's hard to&mdash;our democracy is designed where folks who have power, who have clout, they can block stuff, they can keep things as they are. It's hard. It's even harder when Washington seems focused on everything but your concerns, Kinsey's concerns. <p>There are plenty of people who count on you getting cynical and count on you not getting involved so that you don't vote, so you give up. And you can't give into that. America is making progress, despite what the cynics say. Despite unyielding opposition and a Congress that can't seem to do anything, there are workers with jobs who didn't have them before; there are families with health insurance who didn't have them before; there are students in college who couldn't afford it before; there are troops who served tour after tour who are home with their families today. <p>Cynicism is popular. [<i>Applause</i>] Cynicism is popular these days. It's what passes off as wisdom. But cynics didn't put a man on the Moon. Cynics never won a war. Cynics didn't cure a disease or start a business or feed a young mind. Cynicism didn't bring about the right for women to vote or the right for African Americans to be full citizens. Cynicism is a choice. <p>Hope is a better choice. Hope is what gave young soldiers the courage to storm a beach. Hope is what gave young people the strength to march for women's rights and civil rights and voting rights and gay rights and immigration rights. <p>Hope is what compelled Kinsey to sit down and pick up a pen and ask, \\"What can I do?,\\" and actually think maybe the President might read that story and it might make a difference. And her voice rang out here in the Paramount Theatre. And it's her voice and your voice that's going to change this country. That's how we're going to make sure that we remain the greatest nation on Earth, not by asking what we can do for ourselves, but what we can do for each other and what we can do for our country. <p>And so, as President, I'm going to keep a promise that I made when I first ran: Every day, I will keep asking the same question, and that is, how can I help you? And I'll keep treating your cares and your concerns as my own. And I will keep fighting to restore the American Dream for everybody who's willing to work for it. <p>And I am going to need you to be right there with me. Do not get cynical. Hope is the better choice. <p>Thank you, Texas. Thank you, Austin. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"163" "\"Hi, everybody. This week, I spent some time in Colorado and Texas, talking with people about what's going on in their lives. <p>One of them was Elizabeth Cooper, who will be a college junior this fall. She wrote to tell me something I hear often: how hard it is for middle class families like hers to afford college. And she shared something I know many of you feel when you wonder what's going on in Washington. She said she feels \\"not significant enough to be addressed, not poor enough for people to worry [about], and not rich enough to be cared about.\\" <p>I ran for President to fight for Americans just like Elizabeth, people who work hard, do everything right, and just want a chance to build a decent life for themselves and their families. <p>And after the worst economic crisis in generations, our businesses have now created nearly 10 million new jobs over the past 52 months. The unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest point since 2008. By almost every measure, our economy is better off than it was 5 years ago. <p>But while we've created more jobs at this point of the year than any year since 1999, too many families barely earn what they did in 1999. It's harder to pay for college, save, or retire because people's wages and incomes have not gone up. Nearly all the gains of the recovery are going to the very top and aren't making a difference in your lives. <p>Now, I believe America does better when the middle class does better. And I've laid out an opportunity agenda to create jobs, train workers, educate our kids, and make sure hard work actually pays off. These are the things we should be doing to grow the middle class and to help folks work their way into the middle class. And it's pretty uncontroversial stuff. I hope we can work together on it. And I'm always willing to compromise if folks have other ideas or if it advances generally the interests of working Americans. <p>But so far this year, Republicans in Congress have blocked every serious idea to strengthen the middle class. Lifting the minimum wage, fair pay, student loan reform&mdash;they've said no to all of it. And that's when I've acted this year to help working Americans on my own: when Congress won't act. <p>I've taken actions to attract new jobs, lift workers' wages, help students pay off their loans, and more. And the Republican plan right now is not to do some of this work with me; instead, it's to sue me. That's actually what they're spending their time on. It's a political stunt that's going to waste months of America's time. And by the way, they're going to pay for it using your hard-earned tax dollars. <p>I have a better idea: Do something, Congress. Do anything to help working Americans. Join the rest of the country. Join me, I'm looking forward to working with you. <p>You know, on Tuesday, I met with Carolyn Reed and her husband David, who own six Silver Mine Sub shops in Colorado. Two days later, they announced they're giving their hourly employees a raise to $10.10 an hour. They're not waiting for Congress. Carolyn said, \\"We are happy to be a part of what I hope will be a growing voluntary trend in increased wages.\\" Carolyn and Americans like her all across the country are happy to do their part. Congress now needs to step up and do its part. And next week, I'll travel to a couple of job sites to talk about how Democrats and Republicans can work together to grow the economy and protect nearly 700,000 jobs by passing a highway bill by the end of the summer. <p>I'm here because of hard-working Americans like Elizabeth and Carolyn. That's something I'll never forget; it's something I'll never stop fighting for. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"164" "\"Good evening, everyone, and welcome to the White House. Every year, our iftar is a chance to join in fellowship with friends, old and new, and to celebrate the incredible diversity of our great Nation. And I want to recognize members of our diplomatic corps who are here&mdash;and it's wonderful to have you back&mdash;as well as Members of Congress who are joining us here tonight. We have leaders from my administration. And most importantly, we welcome Muslim Americans from across the country. So I want to thank you all for being here. <i>Ramadan Kareem.</i> It's late, you're hungry, I will be brief. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Tonight we honor the traditions of one of the world's great faiths. For Muslims, Ramadan is a time to reflect and to remember that discipline and devotion is the essence of a life of faith. And for all of us, whatever our faiths, Ramadan is a reminder of just how much we share. The values of peace and charity, the importance of family and community&mdash;these are universal values. The command to love one another, to uphold justice, and to care for the least among us&mdash;these are common threads in our faith traditions. <p>Tonight we reaffirm a simple truth. Fundamental to the character of our country is our freedom of religion, the right to practice our faith as we choose, to change our faith if we choose, or to practice no faith at all, and to do all this free from fear of persecution. All of us are deserving of an equal opportunity to thrive, no matter who we are, what we look like, what we believe, or how we pray. And all of us have an obligation to do our part to help others overcome barriers, to reverse the injustice of inequality, and to help more of our fellow citizens share in the promise of America. <p>In Islam, there is a hadith that says, God helps the servant as long as the servant helps his brother. In other words, we're summoned to serve and lift up one another, and that's the lesson of several of our guests here tonight. <p>I'm just going to mention a couple. Kelly Carlisle served our country in the Navy. And more recently, she founded Acta Non Verba&mdash;deeds, not words. And in a very tough part of Oakland, California, she started an urban farm where local children can grow and sell fresh food, which Michelle would appreciate very much. [<i>Laughter</i>] Then, Kelly deposits a hundred percent of the profits they earn into individual savings accounts for those children, because studies show that a child with a savings account is more likely to attend college. So thanks to Kelly, these boys and girls are not only learning the value of hard work at an early age, they're changing how they think about themselves and opening their minds to what's possible in their lives. So we want to thank Kelly for that great work. <p>Growing up in Pakistan,Muhammed Chaudhry and his family, part of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community, were mistreated because of their beliefs. And they immigrated to America, and in California, Muhammed saw world-changing technologies being launched in the same neighborhoods where too many students struggled just to stay in school. Today, he runs a foundation that works with schools, parents, and local IT startups to better prepare students to embrace science and math. And they've started turning the tables. Thanks to Muhammed's foundation, so many of these students are now taking classes that put them on track for college. So we want to thank Muhammed for being such a great example. And you can see the kind of impact Muhammed's work can have&mdash;how each generation can help bring along the next&mdash;in young people like Aala Mohamed. Aala's family immigrated to the United States from Sudan. Both her parents worked several jobs in order to send her to a good high school in Chicago, a great town. I added that. That's not in the remarks. [<i>Laughter</i>] But according to Aala, applying for college was a depressing time because she didn't know what opportunities were out there and she didn't know how her family would pay for her college. <p>But with the help of a nonprofit that focuses on young people like her, she set her sights high. She earned admission to Yale, which I understand is quite good. [<i>Laughter</i>] She graduated with a double major. Today she works in finance, and now she's paying it forward by developing a curriculum to inspire Muslim high school students, especially girls, to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math. So we want to thank Aala for that. <p>So these three individuals are just an example of the wonderful work that is done. You've made it your mission, each in your own way, to help others overcome barriers and to push back on those forces of inequality and to help the next generation share in the American Dream. These folks realize that sometimes, all a young person needs is knowing that somebody cares about them and believes in them. I know I'm only here because a few people&mdash;my mother and my grandparents and dedicated teachers&mdash;took time to invest in me. <p>And so we've got to do everything in our power&mdash;as a nation and as individuals&mdash;to make sure more Americans have the opportunity to move ahead and move up, whether it's good wages that reward hard work, good jobs that help provide for a career and a family, or the education that allows every child to realize his potential or her God-given potential. And that's my mission as President. I want to thank all of those here tonight who, in their respective, communities try to do the same thing. <p>And finally, tonight reminds us of our responsibilities to each other beyond our borders, as well as within. Even as we celebrate all that we have in common, we know that in too many corners of the world we see violence and terror of those who would destroy rather than build. These are particularly difficult times in the Middle East. In Syria, the Asad regime continues its brutality against the Syrian people, and so we continue to help Syrians stand up to Asad and deal with the humanitarian crisis and push back against extremists. In Iraq, where ISIL's attacks on civilians and destruction of religious sites seek to inflame sectarian tensions, we continue to call for a new Government that can unite Iraqis and show all communities in Iraq that they can advance their aspirations through the political process. <p>Separately, the pictures we are seeing in Gaza and Israel are heart wrenching. People here in the United States care deeply about what's happening there, and I know there are strong views, as well as differences, about how we should move forward, which is part of American democracy. We welcome that debate. That makes us stronger. <p>Our goal has been and continues to be peace and security for both Israelis and Palestinians. Now, I will say very clearly: No country can accept rockets fired indiscriminately at citizens. And so we've been very clear that Israel has the right to defend itself against what I consider to be inexcusable attacks from Hamas. At the same time, on top of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza that we've worked long and hard to alleviate, the death and injury of Palestinian civilians is a tragedy, which is why we've emphasized the need to protect civilians, regardless of who they are or where they live. <p>I believe further escalation benefits no one, least of all the Israeli and the Palestinian people. So we're going to continue doing everything we can to facilitate a return to the 2012 cease-fire. We are encouraged that Egypt has made a proposal to accomplish this goal, which we hope can restore the calm that we've been seeking. More broadly, however, the situation in Gaza reminds us again that the status quo is unsustainable and that the only path to true security is a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians, where differences are resolved peacefully and in ways that respect the dignity of all people. <p>Here at home, even as we're vigilant in ensuring our security, we have to continue to remain true to our highest ideals. In the United States of America, there is no place for false divisions between races and religions. We are all Americans, equal in rights and dignity, and no one should ever be targeted or disparaged because of their faith. And that too is what makes us stronger. <p>So tonight, as we gather to celebrate Ramadan, let's renew our obligations to one another. Like Kelly and Muhammed and Aala, let's help lift up our neighbors so more people share in the American Dream. Let's commit ourselves&mdash;as nations and as individuals&mdash;to pursue the peace we seek in our world. And let's remember whatever our faith, we are servants of God, summoned to care for our brothers and sisters. So God bless you all, God bless America, and may you and your families have a blessed Ramadan. <p>That went a little longer than I expected, but please get back to the soup, which I understand is quite good. [<i>Laughter</i>] Thank you.\" "
"165" "\"Hello, everybody! Everybody, have a seat, have a seat, have a seat. Good afternoon. Thank you, Secretary Foxx, for that introduction. <p>I just got a tour of a lab where automakers and Government researchers team up to create new technologies that help cars communicate with the world around them and with each other. They can tell you if an oncoming vehicle is about to run a red light or if a car is coming around a blind corner or if a detour would help you save some time and gas. And I got to test all this in a simulator. It was sort of like \\"Knight Rider.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] I have to say, though, it was a little disorienting. I haven't driven in about 6 years. And I'm going down the highway, and I think I had a little bit of a lead foot. I was starting to hit 90. [<i>Laughter</i>] And then, like, right next to me, the press pool is standing there, and they're kind of traveling with me at 90 miles an hour, and it got me a little queasy. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I've recovered. <p>Now, as the father of a daughter who just turned 16, any new technology that makes driving safer is important to me. And new technology that makes driving smarter is good for the economy. One study shows that Americans spend 5.5 billion hours stuck in traffic each year, which costs us $120 billion in wasted time and gas. That's 800 bucks per commuter. Then you've got outdated roads and bridges that mean businesses pay an extra $27 billion in freight costs, which are then passed on to consumers. So all told, transportation eats up more of the typical family's household budget than anything except the rent or a mortgage, which means that the cutting-edge research that all of you are doing here helps save lives and save money and leads to new jobs and new technologies and new industries. And that's why America has to invest more in the kind of job-creating research and development that you're doing right here at the Highway Research Center. <p>Now, I'm also here today to talk about why America has got to invest more in rebuilding the infrastructure that these cars will drive on, because it will create better jobs and better position America for the future. <p>We know that in a 21st-century economy businesses will set up shop wherever they find the best roads and bridges and the fastest rail and Internet, the smartest airports, the smartest power grids. First-class infrastructure attracts first-class jobs. And right now our investments in transportation are lagging the rest of the world. <p>If Washington were working the way it's supposed to, Congress would be fixing that. We'd be investing in the things that help America bring more good jobs to our shores. Instead, here's what's going on in Washington. There's something called the Highway Trust Fund; I suspect this crew is familiar with it. It's&mdash;it helps States support transportation projects. If Congress fails to fund it, it runs out of money. That could put nearly 700,000 jobs at risk, including more than 17,000 right here in Virginia. More than 100,000 active projects across the country&mdash;projects where workers as we speak are paving roads and rebuilding bridges and modernizing our transit systems&mdash;those projects would be slowed or stopped. And some States have already had to put some projects on hold because they don't trust Congress to get its act together. So remember that the next time you see a job site sitting idle. Now, the good news is, there are bipartisan bills in both the House and the Senate that would help with a short-term fix. And I support that. At the very least, Congress should be keeping people on the job who are already there right now. But all this does is set us up for the same crisis a few months from now. <p>So Congress shouldn't pat itself on the back for averting disaster for a few months, kicking the can down the road for a few months, careening from crisis to crisis when it comes to something as basic as our infrastructure. Instead of barely paying our bills in the present, we should be investing in the future. We should have a plan for how we're going to make sure that our roads, our bridges, our airports, our power grid, our water systems&mdash;how all those things are going to be funded, and do it in a responsible way so that people can start planning. That also means we can save more money, because we're not doing it in stopgap measures. <p>So that's why earlier this year, I put forward a plan to rebuild our transportation infrastructure in a more responsible way. It would support millions of jobs. It would give cities and States and private investors the certainty they need to plan ahead and hire more workers. It would help small businesses ship their goods faster. It would help parents get home to their kids faster. It would mean less wear and tear on your car. It would mean less money on gas. It would save people money. It would support cutting-edge research like the work that you're doing here, which could end up cutting back on the number of traffic fatalities. <p>And my plan would not add to what is already a rapidly shrinking deficit. We've cut our deficit, by the way, by more than half since I came into office. And we would&mdash;we wouldn't be adding to the deficit, because we'd pay for this transportation project in part by closing tax loopholes for companies that ship jobs overseas and avoid paying their fair share of taxes. <p>So far, House Republicans have refused to act on this idea, and they haven't presented their own idea. And I think that's wrong. We shouldn't be protecting tax loopholes for a few companies that shift massive profits overseas, we should be creating jobs rebuilding the roads and bridges that help every business right here in the United States. That is a question of priorities. And what I keep hearing from folks all across the country is that if Congress would just shift its priorities a little closer to working Americans' priorities, we could help a lot of families right now. <p>This is not an abstract issue. And it shouldn't be even a partisan issue. Republicans, Democrats, Independents, everybody uses our roads. After this last winter, you got potholes everywhere wrecking your car. I mean, how many here&mdash;how many people here have had the experience of you're driving along and suddenly your car is wrecked? And you pay for that out of pocket. When you are in traffic congestion&mdash;because of poor planning and bad infrastructure&mdash;when you could be at home reading to your kid or catching their ballgame, that's a cost to you. Everybody cares about that. It doesn't matter what your political persuasion is. <p>And after the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, our businesses have created nearly 10 million new jobs over the past 52 months. The unemployment rate is at its lowest point since September of 2008. We've made huge strides in energy independence. For the first time in more than a decade, business leaders around the world are saying the best place to invest isn't China, the best place to invest is the United States of America. But you've still got a lot of middle class families all across the country who are working harder than ever just to get ahead. They need a break. They need some help. And having better roads and less delays, that helps. <p>And meanwhile, Republicans in Congress keep blocking or voting down some of the ideas that would have the biggest impact on middle class families and working families. Not just creating more new construction jobs, they've said no to raising the minimum wage, to equal pay, to fixing our broken immigration system. <p>Now, I want to work with everybody, Republicans and Democrats, to move this country forward. But I can't just stand by while politics threatens all the hard work of millions of Americans because we've just got gridlock in Washington. So what I've tried to do is take a range of actions this year to help working Americans with my own legal authorities, from speeding up big infrastructure projects to raising wages. I'm waiting for Congress to act, but in the meantime, I've got to go ahead and do what I can do. <p>And in response, their plan so far has not been to join me and say, all right, Mr. President, you're right, we do need to rebuild our roads, we do need to spruce up our airports. Instead, their big idea has been to sue me. That's what they're spending time on, a political stunt that wastes America's time and taxpayer dollars. <p>Keep in mind, it's your money that they're going to be spending on these ridiculous pursuits instead of just getting some work done. And I'm not interested in playing political games. I'm interested in making sure the economy grows and we're creating more jobs and we're helping more middle class families get ahead. <p>We need to invest in America's infrastructure. You guys are helping to show us how to do it in a really smart way. We need to invest in American innovation and research and development. We need to invest in American manufacturing. We should be training more of our workers for new and better jobs. We should be preparing every child for a world-class education. We should be making sure that hard work pays off with higher wages and greater workplace flexibility and health care and childcare. All these things would make a difference in people's day-to-day lives. <p>And the point is, we could do so much more if we just rallied around a sense of economic patriotism that says, you know what, the parties compete, but every once in a while, we've got to actually do some work instead of worrying about elections or trying to score points on cable TV. And we can start by investing in our country. <p>Because historically&mdash;it was Eisenhower who built the Interstate Highway System, working with Democrats and Republicans&mdash;this isn't a partisan issue. And when we treat some basic investments as something that we do as Americans, when we rise or fall together as one Nation and as one people, things work, and nobody can beat us. And that's the spirit that all of you show here. That's what I'm going to keep on fighting for every single day. <p>So I'm proud of you. I want you to keep on doing what you're doing. We're going to try to make sure Congress actually does as good of a job at what they're supposed to be doing as you guys are doing on yours. If we do, then you're going to have some parents who are getting home a little earlier. You're going to have folks who aren't going to have to go to the body shop quite as often. You're going to be seeing millions of people across the country saving money at the pump. We're going to see airline delays reduced, so when you plan that Thanksgiving trip, you're not spending the whole time in the airport. All that can make a huge difference. <p>But the American people have to demand that folks in Washington do their job. Do something: That's my big motto for Congress right now. Just do something. And if they don't like the transportation plan that I put forward, at least come up with your own plan. And then we can compromise. But don't just sit there and do nothing. We don't have time. America is on the move. <p>And part of it's on the move thanks to all of you. I really appreciate it. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"166" "\"Well, I want to thank everybody who has been participating in this very important Task Force. We've got Governors, we've got mayors, local and tribal leaders. We've got Democrats and Republicans and Independents from all the across the Nation. And we are here because we know that climate change is an undeniable scientific fact. <p>And these leaders are here because States and communities that they represent are already dealing with the effects of climate change. They're seeing rising sea levels, more powerful hurricanes, more intense heat waves, severe droughts, and wildfires out West. So this is already happening, and these leaders understand that climate change is a threat to public safety, it's a threat to public health and to something that we want to emphasize today: the infrastructure upon which our economy depends. More severe storms and increased flooding threaten roads and bridges and businesses. Rising sea levels threaten coastal communities and ports. <p>So climate change poses a direct threat to the infrastructure of America that we need to stay competitive in this 21st-century economy. That means that we should see this as an opportunity to do what we should be doing anyway, and that's modernizing our infrastructure, modernizing our roads, modernizing our bridges, power grids, our transit systems, and making sure that they're more resilient. That's going to be good for commerce, and it's obviously going to be good for communities. <p>As a result of this need, I've put forward a plan to build our transportation infrastructure, and it's a key part of our climate action plan, making sure that we've got a smarter, more resilient infrastructure that can withstand the effects of climate change. <p>And today I'm announcing a series of new steps. We're going to do more, including new data and 3-D maps, to help State, local officials and communities understand which areas and which infrastructure are at risk as a consequence of climate change. We're going to help communities improve their electric grids, build stronger seawalls and natural barriers, and protect their water supplies. We're also going to invest in stronger and more resilient infrastructure. <p>Last month, I announced a new competitive fund&mdash;$1 billion&mdash;to help communities do this. Today we're taking steps to make sure that this competition will work. We're going to announce the specifics about who can compete, how we can learn from communities that are rebuilding stronger from disasters like Hurricane Sandy and flooding in Colorado. We want the best ideas to become models for the whole country. And the idea of this competition is not just the communities that win a grant are able to improve their infrastructure, but what we're also going to be doing is, hopefully, lifting everybody's game and making sure that people in their planning are thinking about these issues as they move forward. <p>So the bottom line is, investing in our infrastructure, protecting our communities, ensuring the health and safety of our citizens&mdash;none of this should be a partisan issue. This is something that Democrats, Republicans, Independents all care about, and the leaders who are sitting around this table prove that today and prove it every day. And I want you to know that you have a partner in me, you have a partner in this administration, and I'm confident that, working together, we can take some commonsense steps to make sure that America's infrastructure is safer, stronger, and more resilient for future generations, at the same time as we are also tackling the broader problem of climate change and trying to slow the impact of that not just here, but around the world. <p>So I very much appreciate the wonderful participation. I know that some great ideas have already come out of this. And I'm looking forward to continuing to work with this group in the future. So thank you very much.\" "
"167" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. I want to briefly discuss the important actions we're taking today in support of Ukraine. Before I do, I want to take a few minutes to update the American people on some pressing foreign policy challenges that I reviewed with Secretary Kerry this afternoon. <p>First of all, I thanked Secretary Kerry and our outstanding civilian and military leaders in Afghanistan for their success in helping to break the impasse over the Presidential election there. Thanks to their efforts and, of course, thanks to the Afghans and the courage of the two candidates, both of whom I spoke to last week, the candidates have agreed to abide by the results of a comprehensive and internationally supervised audit that will review all the ballots, and to form a unity Government. If they keep their commitments, Afghanistan will witness the first democratic transfer of power in the history of that nation. <p>This progress will honor both candidates, who have put the interests of a united Afghanistan first, the millions of Afghans who defied threats in order to vote, and the service of our troops and civilians who have sacrificed so much. This progress reminds us that even as our combat mission in Afghanistan ends this year, America's commitment to a sovereign, united, and democratic Afghanistan will endure, along with our determination that Americans are never again threatened by terrorists inside of Afghanistan. <p>Second, John updated me on the negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program. Over the last 6 months, Iran has met its commitments under the interim deal we reached last year: halting the progress of its nuclear program, allowing more inspections, and rolling back its most dangerous stockpile of nuclear material. Meanwhile, we are working with our P-5-plus-1 partners and Iran to reach a comprehensive agreement that assures us that Iran's program will in fact be peaceful and that they won't obtain a nuclear weapon. <p>Based on consultations with Secretary Kerry and my national security team, it's clear to me that we have made real progress in several areas and that we have a credible way forward. But as we approach a deadline of July 20 under the interim deal, there are still some significant gaps between the international community and Iran, and we have more work to do. So over the next few days, we'll continue consulting with Congress, and our team will continue discussions with Iran and our partners as we determine whether additional time is necessary to extend our negotiations. <p>Third, we continue to support diplomatic efforts to end the violence between Israel and Hamas. As I've said repeatedly, Israel has a right to defend itself from rocket attacks that terrorize the Israeli people. There is no country on Earth that can be expected to live under a daily barrage of rockets. And I'm proud that the Iron Dome system that Americans helped Israel develop and fund has saved many Israeli lives. <p>But over the past 2 weeks, we've all been heartbroken by the violence, especially the death and injury of so many innocent civilians in Gaza: men, women, and children who were caught in the crossfire. That's why we have been working with our partners in the region to pursue a cease-fire: to protect civilians on both sides. Now, yesterday Israel did agree to a cease-fire. Unfortunately, Hamas continued to fire rockets at civilians, thereby prolonging the conflict. But the Israeli people and the Palestinian people don't want to live like this. They deserve to live in peace and security, free from fear. And that's why we are going to continue to encourage diplomatic efforts to restore the cease-fire, and we support Egypt's continued efforts to bring this about. Over the next 24 hours, we'll continue to stay in close contact with our friends and parties in the region, and we will use all of our diplomatic resources and relationships to support efforts of closing a deal on a cease-fire. In the meantime, we're going to continue to stress the need to protect civilians&mdash;in Gaza and in Israel&mdash;and to avoid further escalation. <p>Finally, given its continued provocations in Ukraine, today I have approved a new set of sanctions on some of Russia's largest companies and financial institutions. Along with our allies, with whom I've been coordinating closely the last several days and weeks, I've repeatedly made it clear that Russia must halt the flow of weapons and fighters across the border into Ukraine; that Russia must urge separatists to release their hostages and support a cease-fire; that Russia needs to pursue internationally mediated talks and agree to meaningful monitors on the border. I've made this clear directly to Mr. Putin. Many of our European partners have made this clear directly to Mr. Putin. We have emphasized our preference to resolve this issue diplomatically, but that we have to see concrete actions and not just words that Russia, in fact, is committed to trying to end this conflict along the Russia-Ukraine border. So far, Russia has failed to take any of the steps that I mentioned. In fact, Russia's support for the separatists and violations of Ukraine's sovereignty has continued. <p>On top of the sanctions we have already imposed, we are therefore designating selected sectors of the Russian economy as eligible for sanctions. We are freezing the assets of several Russian defense companies. And we are blocking new financing of some of Russia's most important banks and energy companies. These sanctions are significant, but they are also targeted, designed to have the maximum impact on Russia while limiting any spillover effects on American companies or those of our allies. <p>Now, we are taking these actions in close consultation with our European allies, who are meeting in Brussels to agree on their next steps. And what we are expecting is that the Russian leadership will see, once again, that its actions in Ukraine have consequences, including a weakening Russian economy and increasing diplomatic isolation. <p>Now, meanwhile, we're going to continue to stand with the Ukrainian people as they seek to determine their own future. Even in the midst of this crisis, they have made remarkable progress these past few months. They held democratic elections, they elected a new President, they're pursuing important reforms, and they signed a new association agreement with the European Union. And the United States will continue to offer our strong support to Ukraine to help stabilize its economy and defend its territorial integrity, because like any people, Ukrainians deserve the right to forge their own destiny. <p>So in closing, I'll point out the obvious. We live in a complex world and at a challenging time. And none of these challenges lend themselves to quick or easy solutions, but all of them require American leadership. And as Commander in Chief, I'm confident that if we stay patient and determined, that we will in fact meet these challenges. <p>Thanks very much.\" "
"168" "\"Hello, everybody! Everybody, please have a seat. Please have a seat. It is wonderful to be back in Delaware. <p><i>Crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in Ukraine </i><p>Before I begin, obviously, the world is watching reports of a downed passenger jet near the Russia-Ukraine border. And it looks like it may be a terrible tragedy. Right now we're working to determine whether there were American citizens on board. That is our first priority. And I've directed my national security team to stay in close contact with the Ukrainian Government. The United States will offer any assistance we can to help determine what happened and why. And as a country, our thoughts and prayers are with all the families of the passengers, wherever they call home. <p>I want to thank Jeremie for that introduction. Give Jeremie a big round of applause. It is great to be in the State that gave us Joe Biden. We've got actually some better looking Bidens with us here today. [<i>Laughter</i>] We've got Beau and his wife Hallie are here. Give them a big round of applause. We love them. We've got Governor Jack Markell, Senator Chris Coons, Congressman John Carney, County Executive Tom Gordon, and the mayor of Wilmington, Dennis Williams. We've also got two terrific members of my Cabinet: Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx is here, and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew is here. <p>Jack Lew's signature is actually on your money. [<i>Laughter</i>] Although, it's kind of illegible. We teased him when he first became Treasury Secretary that he was going to have to fix his signature a little bit because it looked just like a caterpillar running along the bottom. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, the bridge behind me used to carry 90,000 cars every day&mdash;90,000. Since last month, it's been closed for repairs. Once workers are done repairing it, this bridge will be safer; it will be more reliable for commuters and for commerce. And thanks to a competitive grant program called TIGER&mdash;a program, by the way, that was part of the Recovery Act that we initiated when I first came into office and Joe Biden helped to manage&mdash;this port is rebuilding a wharf that will finally let Wilmington compete with other ports for the biggest cargo ships. [<i>Applause</i>] For the biggest cargo ships. So far, TIGER grants have given a boost to 270 infrastructure projects and thousands of jobs all across 50 States. <p>And that's what I'm here to talk about today, and I've been talking about this all week: creating more good jobs rebuilding America and the opportunity that we have to seize to rebuild the American middle class. <p>Now, after the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, in part because of the actions we took, primarily because of the strength and determination of the American people, our businesses have now added nearly 10 million new jobs over the past 52 months. Construction and housing are rebounding. The auto industry is booming; it was in a tailspin when we came in. Manufacturing is adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s. The unemployment rate is at its lowest point since September of 2008, which is one of the fastest 1-year drops in nearly 30 years. And the decisions we made&mdash;not only to rescue our economy, but to start rebuilding it on a firmer foundation&mdash;those decisions are starting to pay off. We are more energy independent. For the first time in nearly 20 years, we produce more oil here in the United States than we buy from abroad. First time in 20 years we're doing that. <p>At the same time, we're actually reducing our carbon pollution, and we're creating new jobs in clean and renewable energies: 3 times as much wind power, 10 times as much solar power. <p>In education, our high school graduation rate is at a record high, more young people are earning college degrees than ever before; 401(k)s are growing; fewer homes are underwater. Millions more now have the peace of mind of having quality, affordable health care if they need it. And the deficit is coming down to boot, been cut in more than half. <p>So by almost every economic measure, we're doing a whole lot better now than we were when I came into office. And as I said, most of it is thanks to you, the resilience and the resolve of the American people. Because of that, we've recovered faster and come farther than almost any other advanced country on Earth. And business leaders, for the first time in a decade, around the world are saying that China is not the best place to invest, the United States is the most promising place to invest. <p>So we've got this huge opportunity to keep this momentum going, to keep growing the economy, but also to make sure that growth is broadly shared. We've got to make sure we're creating not just more jobs, but also raising middle class wages and incomes and making it easier for folks, if they're working hard and doing the right thing, to raise a family. <p>We got to make sure that we're not just graduating more kids, we've got to also train more workers and make college more affordable. We got to make sure our economy works for every American. That's why I ran for President. That's what I'm focused on every day. And this is more than just some fleeting political story or made-up scandal, this is the challenge of our times: making sure that if you work hard and you're responsible, anybody can get ahead in this country. That's what America is about. And we can achieve that if we just see a few changes in Washington's priorities. <p>So today I'm here to talk about just one example: creating good jobs of the sort that Jeremie just talked about, good jobs rebuilding America. We know that in the 21st-century economy, businesses are going to set up shop wherever they find the best roads, the best bridges, the fastest Internet connection, the fastest rail lines, the smartest airports, the best power grid. First-class infrastructure attracts investment, and it creates first-class jobs. Unfortunately, right now our investment in transportation lags behind a lot of other countries. China is doing more. Germany is doing more. They're putting money back into building the infrastructure we need to grow over the long term. <p>And if Washington were working the way it was supposed to, Congress would be creating jobs right now, jobs just like Jeremie talked about, jobs like these guys in the hard hats are doing right now rebuilding bridges and roads and airports and ports all across the country. It helps us now, and it helps up create jobs tomorrow. That's what we should be doing. <p>But instead of creating jobs rebuilding our infrastructure in a predictable, sustainable way, the debate in Washington lately has been about something called the Highway Trust Fund. It's how America is supposed to support States on transportation projects. Congress has to keep it funded. Otherwise, States have to put projects on hold, put construction workers back on the unemployment line. The good news is, Democrats and Republicans are about to pass a short-term fix that will keep funding going for about another 9 or 10 months. And I support that. I mean, the least we can do is just support the jobs that are already there, keep Americans on the job. But if that's all Congress does, then we're going to have the same kind of funding crisis 9 months from now. And that's not how normally you fund infrastructure, because you got to plan it and you got to think about, how are we helping folks and how are we helping States and cities and municipalities create plans for the future and make sure that the funding streams are level? We don't need unhelpful and unnecessary deadlines that crunch a few months from now. And we shouldn't have been this close to the deadline in the first place. <p>As your Governor has pointed out, even smaller transportation projects can take years to design and plan and build. A few months of funding doesn't cut it. And so Jack said, \\"To call this a Band-Aid is an insult to a Band-Aid.\\" That's a pretty good line. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm going to have to try that out. <p>So Congress shouldn't be too proud. It shouldn't pat itself on the back for kicking the can down the road every few months. Instead of barely paying our bills in the present, we should be planning and investing in our future. That's how the economy grows for everybody. The American people work hard every single day, and your efforts shouldn't be threatened every few months by a manufactured crisis in Washington. Everything doesn't have to be done at the last minute every time. <p>So what I've done is, earlier this year, put forward a plan to rebuild our transportation infrastructure in a long-term responsible way, a plan that would support millions of jobs, would give cities and States and private investors the certainty they need to hire more workers faster. It would help small businesses ship their goods faster. It would help parents get home from their commute faster so they can see their kids. And it wouldn't add to what is already a rapidly shrinking deficit because we'd pay for it in part by closing loopholes for companies that are shipping profits overseas and are avoiding paying their fair share of taxes. <p>So that's what we need, a broad-based plan. We got $2 trillion worth of deferred maintenance in this country in roads and bridges and sewer systems and water mains. And we could put a lot of people back to work right now getting that done. And we're going to have to do it eventually anyway. <p>But so far, Congress has refused to act on the idea, which is strange because infrastructure should not be a partisan issue. You think about it. It was a Republican, Dwight Eisenhower, who built the Interstate Highway System. Lincoln built the transcontinental railroad. Both parties historically have understood that investing in this country for the long run pays off. When we invest in infrastructure we're making sure that the economy is growing not just for the next 5 years, but for another century. That's what right now Republicans in Congress don't seem to be focused on. But until they do get focused on it, I'm going to do whatever I can to create jobs rebuilding America on my own. <p>So today we're launching what we call the Build America Investment Initiative. And as part of it, we're creating a one-stop shop for cities and States looking to partner with the private sector to fund infrastructure projects. There are lots of investors who want to back infrastructure projects because, when it's done right, they then get a steady, long-term investment. They get a steady return. <p>And lots of States and local governments would welcome more private investment, but they need a partner in the Federal Government to help do some matchmaking and work through some of the complexities of private financing of infrastructure. So my administration is going to help States and cities apply for Federal loans, get more public-private partnerships up and running, get more investment flowing into communities like Wilmington. <p>And this builds on other actions we've taken to speed up the permitting process for big projects and attract new manufacturing jobs to America and raise more workers' wages, help women fight for fair pay, ease loan burdens for millions of students. We're taking steps on our own, still hoping that Congress at some point actually does something. <p>I keep hearing from folks all across the country who tell me if Members of Congress have the same priorities that most Americans do, if they felt the same sense of urgency that you feel in your own lives, we could help a lot of families right now. <p>Instead of playing politics, we should be creating jobs by investing in what makes our economy strong: infrastructure and manufacturing and energy and research and development, and education. All these things lead to new industries. <p>We should be training our workers to fill new jobs. We should be preparing our kids to face global competition. We should be making sure that hard work pays off with a higher minimum wage. <p>We should be seizing these opportunities. And there's a simple principle behind it: When the middle class does good and when people have ladders into the middle class if they work hard, everybody does better. You have more customers for businesses. Folks at the very top do better. America grows best from the middle out, not from the top down. That's when we succeed. <p>So I'm going to keep on looking for areas where Republicans and Democrats agree to move this country forward. But I'm not going to stand by when politics and inaction are holding us back. <p>Wherever and whenever I have a chance to help families like yours, I'm going to do it. When I have a chance to help communities like Wilmington, I'm going to do it. That's when my administration takes these executive actions: when Congress won't act. <p>And so far, the only response we've gotten from the Republicans is a lawsuit. [<i>Laughter</i>] They're suing me for doing my job, instead of going ahead and doing their job. That's disappointing. It's a political stunt. And by the way, they're using taxpayer money to do it. It's your money that they're wasting on this, which no serious lawyers thinks makes any sense. It's just a political stunt. We could be spending the time, energy, and effort and money to help your families. <p>And maybe the folks behind this think it will help them politically. I guarantee you, it's not helping you. We could do so much more if we rally around a sense of patriotism that says we can disagree on issues once in a while, but come on, let's focus on our country, let's focus on our people, a sense of common purpose, the understanding we rise or fall as one Nation and as one people. That's how we built this country together. And that's what Washington has to remember. <p>And the one thing I know for certain, if we work together, if we believe in one another, then we're going to keep on rebuilding our middle class. We're going to restore the American Dream for the next generation. We will continue to make sure that America is the place where no matter what you look like or where you come from or how you started, you can make it if you try. You've shown it here in Delaware. We can show it all across the country. We just need a little more focus in Washington. So keep the pressure on everybody. <p>Thank you. God bless you. Let's build some bridges. Let's build some roads. God bless America. Now, I'm going to sign my memorandum. I'm going to sign it. <p>[<i>At this point, the President signed the memorandum on expanding public-private collaboration on infrastructure development and financing</i>.]\" "
"169" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! I am not going to hold up the meal. Everybody, sit down. [<i>Laughter</i>] I just wanted to come by because I love the event. First of all, we have a lot of state dinners around here. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> We do. <p><i>The President.</i> They're not always as cheerful and fun as this. [<i>Laughter</i>] First of all, everybody is older and a little stodgier. But this is a much hipper crowd. More colorful outfits&mdash;so I like that. But I also just love seeing young people who are doing wonderful things. We are so proud of you. To see the kind of leadership you're taking and the way that you've really thrown yourselves into these projects is just really inspiring. <p>And sometimes, people ask me, you know, Mr. President, you have this really tough job, and there's always stuff happening all around the world, and how do you keep up with all of it and how do you keep your spirits up? And my answer is, because I meet young people every day who I know are energetic and are full of great ideas and are going to be continuing to make this country better. This is one way to do it. You guys are leaders in your schools and in your communities, and you're helping to teach folks the importance of good nutrition, the importance of putting good fuel in your bodies so that you're living healthy, active lives. <p>And by the way, one thing&mdash;maybe I shouldn't say this, but it's not like our family, including me, don't have some snacks once in a while&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that may not be on the perfect nutrition chart. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> It's true. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Each of us have our weaknesses, so I'm going to reveal some right now. <p><i>The First Lady</i>. Uh-oh. <p><i>The President</i>. Malia, ice cream. I mean, basically, it's very hard for her to turn down ice cream. But she has learned to kind of control herself when it comes to ice cream. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> It's hard. <p><i>The President.</i> It's hard, but she still has fun when she does have ice cream. In fact, the fact that she doesn't have ice cream every day means when she has it&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The First Lady.</i> It's very special. <p><i>The President.</i>&mdash;&mdash;it's like, hallelujah. She starts&mdash;she is so happy. [<i>Laughter</i>] Sasha&mdash;what would you say is Sasha's pig-out indulgence food? <p><i>The First Lady.</i> She's into&mdash;it's not a&mdash;she likes sushi. <p><i>The President.</i> Oh, no. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The First Lady.</i> It's what she's into. <i>The President.</i> She is kind of into sushi right now. She's a little&mdash;I love sushi, so maybe I had some influence there. But let's say for&mdash;her pies. She pretty much takes dessert whenever she can. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Pies. <p><i>The President.</i> Pie. She's like me. My big thing: chips and guacamole. [<i>Laughter</i>] Like, basically, if there is a bowl of good chips and guacamole&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The First Lady.</i> He loses it. <p><i>The President. </i>I lose my mind. [<i>Laughter</i>] I lose my mind. And the First Lady: french fries. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The First Lady.</i> But I'm going to say this. I'm making a vow: I'm going to take a break from french fries. <p><i>The President.</i> Really? <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Yes. <p><i>The President.</i> Wow, that's big. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The First Lady</i>. On the record. I put it out there. <p><i>The President.</i> Now, the reason I make this point is that the question is not, can you never have anything. It's, on a day-to-day basis, at lunches, at breakfast, at dinner, is your basic nutrition something that's going to make you strong and make you healthy? And if it is, then having fun food that may not be perfect for you, that's okay too. <p>But we're just all trying to develop good habits. And the one thing I know about all these young people is, they've got great work habits, because otherwise, they wouldn't have been able to do everything that they've done. They've got great habits of caring about other people, because they're out there spreading the word about what they're doing. And as a consequence, I'm really optimistic about what all these great young leaders are going to achieve in the future. <p>So good luck. Have a great Kids' State Dinner, all right? Even though it's technically a lunch. [<i>Laughter</i>] Calling it a state lunch&mdash;there was a debate about this, and we thought&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The First Lady.</i> It doesn't work. <p><i>The President.</i>&mdash;&mdash;it doesn't make sense, because we have state dinners. So it's a Kids' State Dinner, even though it's noon. All right? <p>And parents, good job, everybody. You've got great kids.\" "
"170" "\"Hi, everybody. Over the past 52 months, our businesses have created nearly 10 million new jobs. The unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest point since 2008. Across lots of areas&mdash;energy, manufacturing, technology&mdash;our businesses and workers are leading again. In fact, for the first time in over a decade, business leaders worldwide have declared that China is no longer the world's best place to invest, America is. <p>Now, none of this is an accident. It's thanks to your resilience, resolve, and hard work that America has recovered faster and come farther than almost any other advanced country on Earth. <p>Now we have the opportunity to ensure that this growth is broadly shared. Our economy grows best not from the top down, but from the middle out. We do better when the middle class does better. So we have to make sure that we're not just creating more jobs, but raising middle class wages and incomes. We have to make sure our economy works for every working American. My opportunity agenda does that. It's built on creating more jobs, training more workers, educating all our kids, and making sure your hard work pays off with higher wages and better benefits. <p>On Thursday, I traveled to Delaware to highlight how we're trying to create more good, middle class jobs rebuilding America: rebuilding roads and bridges, ports and airports, high-speed rail, and high-speed Internet. <p>This week, Vice President Biden will release a report he's been working on to reform our job training system into a job-driven training system. And I'll visit a community college in L.A. that's retraining workers for careers in the fast-growing health care sector. Because every worker deserves to know that if you lose your job, your country will help you train for an even better one. <p>In recent days, both parties in Congress have taken some good steps in these areas. But we can do so much more for the middle class and for folks working to join the middle class. We should raise the minimum wage so that no one who works full time has to live in poverty. We should fight for fair pay and paid family leave. We should pass commonsense immigration reform that strengthens our borders and our businesses and includes a chance for long-time residents to earn their citizenship. <p>I want to work with Democrats and Republicans on all these priorities. But I will do whatever I can, whenever I can, to help families like yours. Because nothing's more important to me than you: your hopes, your concerns, and making sure this country remains the place where everyone who works hard can make it if you try. <p>Thanks so much, and have a great weekend.\" "
"171" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. All right, everybody, have a seat, have a seat. Well welcome to the White House, everybody. I know I'm a little late. [<i>Laughter</i>] But that's okay because we've got some big business to do here. <p>Many of you have worked for a long time to see this day coming. You organized, you spoke up, you signed petitions, you sent letters. I know because I got a lot of them. [<i>Laughter</i>] And now, thanks to your passionate advocacy and the irrefutable rightness of your cause, our Government&mdash;Government of the people, by the people, and for the people&mdash;will become just a little bit fairer. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Amen. <p><i>The President.</i> It is&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;doesn't make much sense, but today in America, millions of our fellow citizens wake up and go to work with the awareness that they could lose their job, not because of anything they do or fail to do, but because of who they are: lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender. And that's wrong. We're here to do what we can to make it right, to bend that arc of justice just a little bit in a better direction. <p>In a few moments, I will sign an Executive order that does two things. First, the Federal Government already prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Once I sign this order, the same will be explicitly true for gender identity. <p>And second, we're going to prohibit all companies that receive a contract from the Federal Government from discriminating against their LGBT employees. America's Federal contracts should not subsidize discrimination against the American people. <p>Now, this Executive order is part of a long, bipartisan tradition. President Roosevelt signed an order prohibiting racial discrimination in the national defense industry. President Eisenhower strengthened it. President Johnson expanded it. Today I'm going to expand it again. <p>Currently, 18 States have already banned workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. And over 200 cities and localities have done the same. Governor Terry McAuliffe is here; his first act as Governor was to prohibit discrimination against LGBT employees of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Where did Terry go? Right back here. <p>I've appointed a record number of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender public servants to positions across my administration. They are Ambassadors and Federal judges, special assistants, senior advisers from the Pentagon to the Labor Department. Every day, their talent is put to work on behalf of the American people. <p>Equality in the workplace is not only the right thing to do, it turns out to be good business. That's why a majority of Fortune 500 companies already have nondiscrimination policies in place. It is not just about doing the right thing, it's also about attracting and retrain&mdash;retaining the best talent. And there are several business leaders who are here today who will attest to that. And yet, despite all that, in too many States and in too many workplaces, simply being gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender can still be a fireable offense. There are people here today who've lost their jobs for that reason. This is not speculative, this is not a matter of political correctness; people lose their jobs as a consequence of this. Their livelihoods are threatened; their families are threatened. In fact, more States now allow same-sex marriage than prohibit discrimination against LGBT workers. So I firmly believe that it's time to address this injustice for every American. <p>Now, Congress has spent 40 years&mdash;four decades&mdash;considering legislation that would help solve the problem. That's a long time. [<i>Laughter</i>] And yet they still haven't gotten it done. Senators Terry [Tammy]* Baldwin and Jeff Merkley are here. They have been champions of this issue for a long, long time. We are very proud of them. I know they will not stop fighting until fair treatment for all workers is the Federal law of the land. And we want to thank them for that. [<i>Applause</i>] <p>But I'm going to do what I can, with the authority I have, to act. The rest of you, of course, need to keep putting pressure on Congress to pass Federal legislation that resolves this problem once and for all. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Amen! <p><i>The President.</i> Amen. Amen! Got the \\"amen\\" corner here. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>At this point, the President sang.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> \\"Well\\"&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. You don't want to get me preaching, now. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>For more than two centuries, we have strived, often at great cost, to form a more perfect Union,&mdash;to make sure that we the people applies to all the people. Many of us are only here because others fought to secure rights and opportunities for us. And we've got a responsibility to do the same for future generations. We've got an obligation to make sure that the country we love remains a place where no matter who you are or what you look like or where you come from or how you started out or what your last name is or who you love&mdash;no matter what, you can make it in this country. <p>That's the story of America. That's the story of this movement. I want to thank all of you for doing your part. We've got a long way to go, but I hope as everybody looks around this room you are reminded of the extraordinary progress that we have made not just in our lifetimes, but in the last 5 years. In the last 2 years. In the last 1 year. We're on the right side of history. <p>I'm going to sign this Executive order. Thank you, everybody. <p>[<i>The President signed the Executive order.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> We made it. Thank you.\" "
"172" "\"Good morning, everybody. I wanted to make a brief statement about the tragedy in Ukraine. Before I do, though, I want to note that Secretary Kerry has departed for the Middle East. As I've said many times, Israel has a right to defend itself against rocket and tunnel attacks from Hamas. And as a result of its operations, Israel has already done significant damage to Hamas's terrorist infrastructure in Gaza. I've also said, however, that we have serious concerns about the rising number of Palestinian civilian deaths and the loss of Israeli lives. And that is why it now has to be our focus and the focus of the international community to bring about a cease-fire that ends the fighting and that can stop the deaths of innocent civilians, both in Gaza and in Israel. <p>So Secretary Kerry will meet with allies and partners. I've instructed him to push for an immediate cessation of hostilities based on a return to the November 2012 cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The work will not be easy. Obviously, there are enormous passions involved in this and some very difficult strategic issues involved. Nevertheless, I've asked John to do everything he can to help facilitate a cessation to hostilities. We don't want to see any more civilians getting killed. <p>With respect to Ukraine, it's now been 4 days since Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over territory controlled by Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine. Over the last several days, our hearts have been absolutely broken as we've learned more about the extraordinary and beautiful lives that were lost: men, women, and children and infants who were killed so suddenly and so senselessly. <p>Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with their families around the world who are going through just unimaginable grief. I've had the opportunity to speak to a number of leaders around the world whose citizens were lost on this flight, and all of them remain in a state of shock, but frankly, also in a state of outrage. <p>Our immediate focus is on recovering those who were lost, investigating exactly what happened, and putting forward the facts. We have to make sure that the truth is out and that accountability exists. <p>Now, international investigators are on the ground. They have been organized. I've sent teams; other countries have sent teams. They are prepared, they are organized, to conduct what should be the kinds of protocols and scouring and collecting of evidence that should follow any international incident like this. And what they need right now is immediate and full access to the crash site. They need to be able to conduct a prompt and full and unimpeded as well as transparent investigation. And recovery personnel have to do the solemn and sacred work of recovering the remains of those who were lost. <p>Now, Ukrainian President Poroshenko has declared a demilitarized zone around the crash site. As I said before, you have international teams already in place prepared to conduct the investigation and recover the remains of those who have been lost. But unfortunately, the Russian-backed separatists who control the area continue to block the investigation. They have repeatedly prevented international investigators from gaining full access to the wreckage. As investigators approached, they fired their weapons into the air. These separatists are removing evidence from the crash site, all of which begs the question, what exactly are they trying to hide? <p>Moreover, these Russian-backed separatists are removing bodies from the crash site, oftentimes without the care that we would normally expect from a tragedy like this. And this is an insult to those who have lost loved ones. This is the kind of behavior that has no place in the community of nations. <p>Now, Russia has extraordinary influence over these separatists. No one denies that. Russia has urged them on. Russia has trained them. We know that Russia has armed them with military equipment and weapons, including antiaircraft weapons. Key separatist leaders are Russian citizens. So given its direct influence over the separatists, Russia and President Putin, in particular, has direct responsibility to compel them to cooperate with the investigation. That is the least that they can do. <p>President Putin says that he supports a full and fair investigation. And I appreciate those words, but they have to be supported by actions. The burden now is on Russia to insist that the separatists stop tampering with the evidence, grant investigators who are already on the ground immediate, full, and unimpeded access to the crash site. The separatists and the Russian sponsors are responsible for the safety of the investigators doing their work. And along with our allies and partners, we will be working this issue at the United Nations today. <p>More broadly, as I've said throughout this crisis and the crisis in Ukraine generally&mdash;and I've said this directly to President Putin as well as publicly&mdash;my preference continues to be finding a diplomatic resolution within Ukraine. I believe that can still happen. That is my preference today, and it will continue to be my preference. <p>But if Russia continues to violate Ukraine's sovereignty and to back these separatists and these separatists become more and more dangerous and now are risks not simply to the people inside of Ukraine, but the broader international community, then Russia will only further isolate itself from the international community, and the costs for Russia's behavior will only continue to increase. <p>Now is the time for President Putin and Russia to pivot away from the strategy that they've been taking and get serious about trying to resolve hostilities within Ukraine in a way that respects Ukraine's sovereignty and respects the right of the Ukrainian people to make their own decisions about their own lives. <p>And time is of the essence. Our friends and allies need to be able to recover those who were lost. That's the least we can do. That's the least that decency demands. Families deserve to be able to lay their loved ones to rest with dignity. The world deserves to know exactly what happened. And the people of Ukraine deserve to determine their own future. <p>Thanks.\" "
"173" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to the White House. Please be seated, please be seated. <p>For our forces in Afghanistan, the battle of Wanat was one of the most fierce of this entire war. Forty-eight Americans, along with their Afghan partners, were manning their small base, deep in a valley when they were attacked by some 200 insurgents. And those insurgents seemed determined to overrun an even smaller post just outside the base, an elevated patch of boulders and sandbags defended by just nine American soldiers. <p>Soon, under the relentless fire, all nine of those men were wounded or killed. Insurgents broke through the wire. And that little post was on the verge of falling, giving the enemy a perch from which to devastate the base below. Against that onslaught, one American held the line: just 22 years old, nearly surrounded, bloodied but unbowed, the soldier we recognize today with our Nation's highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor, Staff Sergeant Ryan M. Pitts. <p>Now, I don't want to embarrass Ryan, but the character he displayed that day was clearly forged early. I'm told that in kindergarten, when asked what he wanted to be when he grew up, he drew a picture of a soldier. When he was in the fifth grade, his teacher sent home a note that described Ryan in words that would be familiar to all those who knew him today: Ryan, she wrote, is \\"a very special human being.\\" <p>In Ryan Pitts you see the humility and the loyalty that define America's men and women in uniform. Of this medal, he says: \\"It's not mine alone. It belongs to everybody who was there that day because we did it together.\\" <p>So I want to welcome those who were there that day, Ryan's brothers-in-arms, and those who welcoming&mdash;are going to be welcoming him into their ranks, the members of the Medal of Honor Society. We are very proud of them, and we are honored by the presence of the families of our fallen heroes as well. <p>We welcome Ryan's family, many from New Hampshire, including his wonderful wife Amy. I have to take a pause because they are actually celebrating&mdash;Ryan and Amy&mdash;their second anniversary today. [<i>Laughter</i>] As Ryan put it, it's going to be tough topping this one, as anniversaries go. [<i>Laughter</i>] But let me just give you a piece of advice as somebody who now has been married for over 20 years: You should try. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm just saying, don't rest on your laurels after just 2 years. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We welcome their gorgeous son, 1-year-old Lucas, who Ryan is beginning to teach a love for all things New England&mdash;of course, the Red Sox and the Bruins and the Celtics and the Pats. <p>I want you to try and imagine the extraordinary circumstances in which Ryan and his team served. This was the summer of 2008, and this was a time when our forces in Afghanistan were stretched thin and our troops were deployed to isolated outposts. They had just arrived in Wanat just days before, and they were still building their very small base, a handful of armored vehicles and fighting positions and foxholes and sandbags. Wanat, one report later concluded, had \\"significant vulnerabilities.\\" Parts of the village sat on higher ground. On every side, mountains soared 10,000 feet into the sky. Heavy equipment to help build their defenses was delayed. In the 100-degree heat the soldiers ran low on water. And the aerial surveillance they were counting on was diverted away to other missions. <p>Early that morning, in the predawn darkness, they spotted several men up the mountains. But before Ryan and his team could take action, the entire valley erupted. Machine-gun fire and mortar and rocket-propelled grenades poured down from every direction. And those 200 insurgents were firing from ridges and from the village and from trees. Down at the base, a vehicle exploded, scattering its missiles back at our soldiers. It was, said a soldier, \\"hell on Earth.\\" <p>Up at their tiny post, Ryan and his team were being pounded. Almost instantly, every one of them was wounded. Ryan was hit by shrapnel in the arm and both legs and was bleeding badly. Already, three American soldiers in that valley had fallen. And then a fourth. <p>As the insurgents moved in, Ryan picked up a grenade, pulled the pin, and held that live grenade&mdash;for a moment, then another, then another&mdash;finally hurling it so they couldn't throw it back. And he did that again. And he did it again. <p>Unable to stand, Ryan pulled himself up on his knees and manned a machine gun. Soldiers from the base below made a daring run, dodging bullets and explosions, and joined the defense. But now the enemy was inside the post, so close they were throwing rocks at the Americans, so close they came right up to the sandbags. Eight American soldiers had now fallen, and Ryan Pitts was the only living soldier at that post. <p>The enemy was so close Ryan could hear their voices. He whispered into the radio, he was the only one left and was running out of ammo. \\"I was going to die,\\" he remembers, \\"and made my peace with it.\\" And then, he prepared to make a last stand. Bleeding and barely conscious, Ryan threw his last grenades. He grabbed a grenade launcher and fired nearly straight up so the grenade came back down on the enemy just yards away. One insurgent was now right on top of the post, shooting down until another team of Americans showed up and drove him back. As one of his teammates said, had it not been for Ryan Pitts, that post \\"almost certainly would have been overrun.\\" <p>Even with reinforcements, the battle was not over. Another wave of rocket-propelled grenades slammed into the post. Nine Americans were now gone. And still the fighting raged. Ryan worked the radio, helping target the air strikes that were hitting \\"danger close,\\" just yards away. And with those strikes, the tide of the battle began to turn. Eventually, the insurgents fell back. Ryan and his fellow soldiers had held their ground. <p>This medal, Ryan says, is an opportunity to tell \\"our\\" story. \\"There was valor everywhere,\\" according to Ryan. And so today we also pay tribute to all who served with such valor that day. Shielding their wounded buddies with their own bodies. Picking up unexploded missiles with their hands and carrying them away. Running through the gunfire to reinforce that post. Fighting through their injuries and never giving up. Helicopter pilots and medevac crews who came in under heavy fire. Said one soldier, \\"Never in my career have I seen such bravery and sacrifice.\\" <p>And so I would ask all those who served at Wanat&mdash;on the ground and in the air&mdash;to please stand, those of you who are here today. Most of all, Ryan says he considers this medal \\"a memorial for the guys who didn't come home.\\" So today we honor nine American soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice for us all. <p>The son who \\"absorbed love like a sponge,\\" the expectant father whose dream would later come true, a beautiful baby girl&mdash;Specialist Sergio Abad. <p>The boy who dominated the soccer fields, fell in love with motorcycles and, there in that remote outpost, took a direct hit in the helmet and kept on fighting&mdash;Corporal Jonathan Ayers. <p>The photographer whose beautiful pictures captured the spirit of the Afghan people, and who wrote to his family, \\"Afghanistan is exactly [where] . . . I wanted to be\\"&mdash;Corporal Jason Bogar. <p>The father who loved surfing with his son, the platoon leader who led a dash through the gunfire to that post to reinforce his men&mdash;First Lieutenant Jonathan Brostrom. <p>An immigrant from Mexico who became a proud American soldier, on his third tour, whose final thoughts were of his family and his beloved wife Lesly&mdash;Sergeant Israel Garcia. <p>A young man of deep faith, who served God and country, who could always get a laugh with his impersonation of his commander&mdash;Corporal Jason Hovater. <p>The husband who couldn't wait to become an uncle, the adventurous spirit who in every photo from Afghanistan has a big smile on his face&mdash;Corporal Matthew Phillips. <p>The big guy with an even bigger heart, a prankster whose best play was cleaning up at the poker table with his buddies and his dad&mdash;Corporal Pruitt Rainey. <p>And the youngest, just 20 years old, the \\"little brother\\" of the platoon, who loved to play guitar, and who, says his dad, did everything in his life with passion&mdash;Corporal Gunnar Zwilling. <p>These American patriots lived to serve us all. They died to protect each of us. And their legacy lives on in the hearts of all who love them still, especially their families: mothers, fathers, wives, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters. <p>To you, their families, I know no words can match the depth of your loss, but please know that this Nation will honor your soldiers now and forever. And I would ask the Gold Star families from that deployment to please stand, including Ali Kahler, age 11, and Jase Brostrom, who this week turns 12. Please stand. <p>This is the story Ryan wants us to remember: soldiers who loved each other like brothers and who fought for each other and families who have made a sacrifice that our Nation must never forget. Ryan says, \\"I think we owe it to them to live lives worthy of their sacrifice.\\" And he's absolutely right. <p>As Commander in Chief, I believe one of the ways we can do that is by heeding the lessons of Wanat. When this Nation sends our troops into harm's way, they deserve a sound strategy and a well-defined mission. And they deserve the forces and support to get the job done. And that's what we owe soldiers like Ryan and all the comrades that were lost. That's how we can truly honor all those who gave their lives that day. That's how, as a nation, we can remain worthy of their sacrifice. <p>I know that's a view that's shared by our Secretary of Defense and by our Joint Chiefs of Staff and all the leadership here. They're hard lessons, but they're ones that are deeply engrained in our hearts. It is remarkable that we have young men and women serving in our military who, day in, day out, are able to perform with so much integrity, so much humility, and so much courage. Ryan represents the very best of that tradition, and we are very, very proud of him, as we are of all of you. <p>So God bless you, Ryan. God bless all who serve in our name. May God continue to bless the United States of America. <p>And with that, I would like our military aide to please complete the ceremony. <p>[<i>At this point</i>, <i>Lt. Cmdr. Timothy J. Myers, USN, Navy Aide to the President, read the citation. The President then presented the medal, assisted by Lt. Col. Michael P.

Rutherford, USA, Army Chief of Chaplains, said a prayer</i>.] <p>Well, that concludes the official part of the ceremony, but we still have a big anniversary party. [<i>Laughter</i>] The White House, I understand, has prepared some pretty good edibles and some beverages. And so I hope everybody enjoys the reception. <p>I want to once again thank all who served and the families of those who served. You make us proud every single day. And to Ryan and Amy and Lucas, we wish you all the very best because what an extraordinary family you have. And the pleasures of family were hard-earned by this young man. <p>All right. Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"174" "\"<i>Vice President Joe Biden.</i> Good afternoon, everyone. Great to be here. Please, thank you very much. Thank you, distinguished Members of Congress and members of labor and business and the community. Today, as the President signs the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, we're using this occasion also to present to the President a roadmap he asked&mdash;requested in the State of the Union message, how to keep and maintain the highest skilled workforce in the world. And this is a perfect build-on as to what the bipartisan consensus that the Congress recently reached. <p>I had the best partners in preparing this report that I could ask for: Tom Perez at Labor, Penny Pritzker at Commerce, and Arne Duncan at the Department of Education. I talked to Governors, mayors, industry leaders, presidents of community colleges and colleges, unions, and a lot of Members of Congress, many of whom are here. And I have to acknowledge at the out front&mdash;at the outset, my wife Jill has been an incredible advocate for community colleges and the role they play in training the workforce. <p>But most importantly, I spoke with an awful lot of Americans who are&mdash;as all of you have, particularly Members of Congress&mdash;who were hit exceedingly hard by the great recession, but are doing everything that they possibly can to find a job, willing to learn new skills in order to have a decent, middle class job. One thing I hope that's been put to rest&mdash;and I know we all share this view&mdash;Americans want to work. They want to work. They're willing to do anything that they need to do to get a good and decent job. <p>And they show us that our single greatest resource is not&mdash;and it's not hyperbole&mdash;remains the American people. They're the most highly skilled workers in the world and the most capable people in the world. And they're in the best position to learn the new skills of the 21st century that the workforce requires. There's that phrase, \\"All has changed, changed utterly.\\" Well, all has changed. It's a different world in which people are competing in order to get the kind of jobs they need, whether it's in advanced manufacturing or clean energy or information technology or health care, all areas that are booming, all areas where America is back. <p>So the core question that we set out to answer&mdash;and I'm sure my colleagues did as well&mdash;was how do you connect? How do you connect these workers who desperately want a job, who will do all they need to do to qualify, how do you connect them with jobs? How do Americans know what skills employers need? It sounds like a silly question, but how do they know? And how do they get these skills once they know what skills are needed for the job? And where? Where do they go to get those jobs? <p>This report is designed to help answer those extremely practical questions. It includes 50 actions that the Federal Government and our outside partners are taking now to help fill this skill gap&mdash;skills gap. There is this new strategy that we think will lead directly to more middle class jobs. These actions are going to help promote partnerships between educational institutions and workforce institutions. They're going to increase apprenticeships, and&mdash;which will allow folks to learn and earn while they learn. And it will empower job seekers and employers with better data on what jobs are available and what skills are needed to fill those jobs. [<i>Vice President Biden continued his remarks, concluding as follows.</i>] <p>But to seize this moment, we need to keep the world's most skilled workforce here in America. And I think today in this bipartisan group, we're ready. The American people are ready. And I know the man I'm about to introduce is ready. He wakes up every morning trying to figure out, how do we give ordinary Americans an opportunity? Again, this is just about opportunity, man. Simple opportunity, how do we give them&mdash;because they&mdash;an opportunity because they are so exceptional. <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I think everyone in this room shares that goal: providing for opportunity. And the man I'm about to introduce, that's all he talks about, it seems to me, when he talks to me. <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States, Barack Obama. <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. Thank you so much. Everybody, please be seated. Thank you. Well, welcome to the White House, everybody. And I want to thank Joe for the generous introduction, but more importantly, for everything he does, day in, day out, on behalf of American workers. And I want to thank the Members of Congress who are here from both parties who led the effort to reauthorize the Workforce Investment Act. <p>When President Clinton signed the original Workforce Investment Act back in 1998, he said it was \\"a big step forward in making sure that every adult can keep on learning for a lifetime.\\" And he was right. The law became a pillar of American job training programs. It's helped millions of Americans earn the skills they need to find a new job or get a better paying job. <p>But even back then, even in 1998, our economy was changing. The notion that a high school education could get you a good job and that you'd keep that job until retirement wasn't a reality for the majority of people. Advances in technologies made some jobs obsolete. Global competition sent other jobs overseas. And then, as we were coming into office, the great recession pulled the rug out from under millions of hard-working families. <p>Now, the good news is, today, nearly 6 years after the financial crisis, our businesses have added nearly 10 million new jobs over the past 52 months. Manufacturing is adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s. The unemployment rate is at its lowest point since September of 2008, by the way, the fastest 1-year drop in nearly 30 years. There are now more job openings than at any time since 2007, prerecession. For the first time in a decade, as Joe mentioned, business leaders around the world have declared that the number-one place to do business, the number-one place to invest isn't China, it's the United States of America. <p>So thanks to the hard work of the American people and some decent policies, our economy has recovered faster and it has gone farther than most other advanced nations. As Joe said, we are well positioned. We've got the best cards. So we have the opportunity right now to extend the lead we already have, to encourage more companies to join the trend and bring jobs home, to make sure that the gains aren't just for folks at the very top, but that the economy works for every single American. If you're working hard, you should be able to get a job, that job should pay well, and you should be able to move forward, look after your family. <p>Opportunity for all. And that means that even as we're creating new jobs in this new economy, we have to make sure that every American has the skills to fill those jobs. And keep in mind, not every job that's a good job out there needs a 4-year degree, but the ones that don't need a college degree generally need some sort of specialized training. Now, last month, I met just a wonderful young woman named Rebekah in Minnesota. A few years ago, she was waiting tables. Her husband lost his job; he was a carpenter doing construction work. He had to figure out how to scramble and get a new job that paid less. She chose to take out student loans, she enrolled in a community college, she retrained for a new career. Today, not only has her husband been able to get back into construction, but she loves her job as an accountant, started a whole new career. And the question then is, how do we give more workers that chance to adapt, to revamp, retool, so that they can move forward in this new economy? <p>In 2011, I called on Congress to reauthorize the Workforce Investment Act, update it for the 21st century. And I want to thank every single lawmaker who is here&mdash;lawmakers from both parties&mdash;who answered that call. It took some compromising, but you know what? It turns out, compromise sometimes is okay. Folks in Congress got past their differences, and they got a bill to my desk. So this is not a win for Democrats or Republicans. It is a win for American workers. It's a win for the middle class. And it's a win for everybody who is fighting to earn their way into the middle class. <p>So the bill I'm about to sign will give communities more certainty to invest in job training programs for the long run. It will help us bring those programs into the 21st century by building on what we know works based on evidence, based on tracking what actually delivers on behalf of folks who enroll in these programs: more partnerships with employers, more tools to measure performance, more flexibilities for States and cities to innovate and to run their workforce programs in ways that are best suited for their particular demographic and their particular industries. And as we approach the 24th anniversary of the ADA, this bill takes new steps to support Americans with disabilities who want to live and work independently. So there's a lot of good stuff in here. <p>Of course, as Joe said, there is still more that we can do. And that's why we've rallied employers to give long-term unemployed a fair shot. It's why we're using $600 million in Federal grants to encourage companies to offer apprenticeships and work directly with community colleges. It's why, in my State of Union Address this year, I asked Joe to lead an across-the-board review of America's training programs to make sure that they have one mission: train Americans with the skills employers actually need, then match them to good jobs that need to be filled right now. <p>So today I'm directing my Cabinet&mdash;even as we're signing the bill&mdash;to implement some of Joe's recommendations. First, we're going to use the funds and programs we already have in a smarter way. Federal agencies will award grants that move away from what our Secretary of Labor, Tom Perez, who has been working very hard on this, what he calls a \\"train and pray\\" approach, and I'll bet a lot of you who have dealt with folks who are unemployed know that&mdash;know what that means. They enroll, they get trained for something, they're not even sure whether the job is out there, and if the job isn't out there, all they're doing is saddling themselves with debt, oftentimes putting themselves in a worse position. What we want to do is make sure where you train your workers first based on what employers are telling you they're hiring for. Help business design the training programs so that we're creating a pipeline into jobs that are actually out there. <p>Number two, training programs that use Federal money will be required to make public how many of its graduates find jobs and how much they earn. And that means workers, as they're shopping around for what's available, they'll know in advance if they can expect a good return on their investment. Every job seeker should have all the tools they need to take their career into their own hands, and we're going to help make sure they can do that. <p>And finally, we're going to keep investing in new strategies and innovations that help keep pace with a rapidly changing economy. From testing new, faster ways of teaching skills like coding and cybersecurity and welding to giving at-risk youth the chance to learn on the job, we will keep making sure that Americans have the chance to build their careers throughout a lifetime of hard work. <p>So the bill I'm signing today and the actions I'm taking today will connect more ready-to-work Americans with ready-to-be-filled jobs. Of course, there is so much more that we can still do. And I'm looking forward to engaging all the Members of Congress and all the businesses and non-for-profits who worked on this issue. I'm really interested in engaging them, see what else we can get going. <p>I'll give you a couple of examples. Our high school graduation rate is the highest on record. More young people are earning their college degrees than ever before. But we still have work to do to make college more affordable and lift the burden of student loan debt. I acted to give nearly 5 million Americans the opportunity to cap their student loan payments at 10 percent of their income, particularly important for those who were choosing careers that aren't as lucrative. But Congress could help millions more, and I'd like to work with you on that. <p>Minimum wage. This week marks 5 years since the last increase in the minimum wage. More and more States and business owners are raising their workers' wages. I did the same thing for Federal contractors. I'd like to work with Congress to see if we can do the same for about 28 million Americans, give Americans a raise right now. <p>Fair pay. Let's make sure the next generation of women are getting a fair deal. Let's make sure the next generation of good manufacturing jobs are made in America. Let's make it easier, not harder, for companies to bring those jobs back home. Tomorrow Senators will get to vote on the \\"Bring Jobs Home Act.\\" Instead of rewarding companies for shipping jobs overseas or rewarding companies that are moving profits offshore, let's create jobs right here in America, and let's encourage those companies. <p>So let's build on what both parties have already done on many of these issues. Let's see if we can come together, and while we're at it, let's fix an immigration system that is currently broken in a way that strengthens our borders and that we know will be good for business, we know will increase our GDP, we know will drive down our deficit. <p>So I want to thank all the Democrats and Republicans here today for getting this bill done. This is a big piece of work. You can see, it's a big bill. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I'm also inviting you back. Let's do this more often. It's so much fun. [<i>Laughter</i>] Let's pass more bills to help create more good jobs, strengthen the middle class. Look at everybody. Everybody is smiling, everybody feels good. [<i>Laughter</i>] We could be doing this all the time. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Our work can make a real difference in the lives of real Americans. That's why we're here. We'll have more job satisfaction. [<i>Laughter</i>] The American people, our customers, they'll feel better about the product we produce. <p>And back in 1998, when President Clinton signed the original Workforce Investment Act into law, he was introduced by a man named Jim Antosy from Reading, Pennsylvania. And Jim spoke about how he had been laid off in 1995 at age 49, two kids, no college degree. With the help of job training programs, he earned his bachelor's degree in computer science, found a new job in his field. <p>Today, Jim and his wife Barb still live in Reading. Over the past 16 years, he's been steadily employed as a programmer, working his way up from contractor to full-time employee. In just a few months, Jim now is planning to retire after a lifetime of hard work. A job training program made a difference in his life. And one thing he's thinking about doing in his retirement is teaching computer science at the local community college so he can help a new generation of Americans earn skills that lead directly to a job, just like he had the opportunity to do. <p>Well, I ran for President because I believe even in a changing economy, even in a changing world, stories like Jim aren't just possible, they should be the norm. Joe believes the same thing. Many of you believe the same thing. I believe America is&mdash;I don't just believe&mdash;I know America is full of men and women who work very hard and live up to their responsibilities, and all they want in return is to see that hard work pay off, that responsibility rewarded. <p>They're not greedy. They're not looking for the Moon. They just want to be able to know that if they work hard, they can find a job, they can look after their families, they can retire with dignity, they're not going to go bankrupt when they get sick, maybe take a vacation once in a while, nothing fancy. That's what they're looking for, because they know that ultimately, what's important is family and community and relationships. And that's possible. That's what America is supposed to be about. That's what I'm fighting for every single day as President. <p>This bill will help move us along that path. We need to do it more. Let's get together, work together, restore opportunity for every single American. So with that, I'd like to invite up some of the outstanding folks who are sitting in the audience who helped make this happen. And I'm going to sign this bill with all those pens. All right? <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"175" "\"<i>[At this point, after the President signed the condolence book, a reporter asked a question.]</i> <p><i>Q.</i> Mr. President, Dutch television, do you have any message for the Dutch people? <p><i>The President.</i> Obviously, we're all heartbroken by what's happened. And this is an opportunity for me to extend, on behalf of all the American people, our deepest condolences over the loss of family and friends, to express our solidarity with the people of the Netherlands, with whom we've been friends and had the deepest ties for centuries, and to assure the Dutch people that we will work with them to make sure that loved ones are recovered, that a proper investigation is conducted, and that ultimately, justice is done. <p><i>Deputy Chief of Mission Peter Mollema.</i> And we thank the President for being here. There's been an outpouring of support from the American people, and I can only say that on behalf of the Dutch people, we're deeply grateful for what you are doing. Thank you very much. <p><i>The President</i>. Thank you, everybody.\" "
"176" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, L.A.! Good to see you! Hello, Los Angeles! Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you, everybody. Now, if you've got a seat, sit down. I know that there&mdash;a couple people have been getting overheated. The&mdash;a tip for you: If you've got some water, then drink. Standing in the sun is rough. Bend your knees a little bit. And I'm going to try to be fast. <p><i>Audience member.</i> God Almighty, Jesus Christ created heaven and the universe. Jesus Christ created heaven and the universe. <p><i>The President.</i> All right. That's okay. <p><i>Audience member</i>. You are antichrist! You are antichrist! You are antichrist! You will be destroyed! You will be destroyed! <p><i>Audience members.</i> Obama! Obama! Obama! <p><i>The President.</i> All right. Thank you. Now, I have to admit that I've actually met that guy before. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's true&mdash;it's a couple of years ago, and he had the same line. He needs to update his material. <p>All right, everybody, settle down for a second. First of all, I'd like everybody to say thank you to Katrice not only for the great introduction, but for the great work she's doing helping to train people to get the kinds of jobs that we want and opportunity for people that don't have it. So, Katrice, thank you so much. We're proud of you. <p>My understanding&mdash;we understand we also have&mdash;Congresswoman Karen Bass is here. Where's Karen? We love Karen. There's Karen Bass. We've got&mdash;America's Secretary of Labor, Tom Perez, is here. Give Tom a big round of applause. <p>And we want to thank L.A. Trade-Technical College for your hospitality. This is a school that does good work helping the unemployed retrain for new careers. And that's one of the things I want to talk about today. <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. <p>I always love being in California. I spent a couple good years here in college myself. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Occi Tigers! <p><i>The President.</i> Occi&mdash;that's right, Occi Tigers. Earlier today I sat down at Canter's with Katrice and a few Californians who wrote to me. I get letters from folks all across the country, and I read them every night. And folks tell me their stories&mdash;about their worries and their hopes and hardships and successes. Some say I'm doing a good job. Some say I'm an idiot, which lets me know that I'm getting a representative sample. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But in addition to Katrice, a young woman named Kati Koster was there, and she told me about her life. She grew up in a working class neighborhood in Wisconsin. Her parents taught her to value education, that that was going to be the ticket to the middle class. First in her family to go to college; moved on to get her master's degree from Pepperdine, stayed out in California. <p>And she wrote to tell me that she's always played by the rules, valued education, worked hard, but she felt \\"trapped\\" because no matter how hard she worked, it seemed like she couldn't get ahead. And she said, \\"If earning an education doesn't open doors for someone like me to rise above my socioeconomic class . . . what does that say about our country?\\" \\"What does it say about our values,\\" she asked. She said, \\"I try not to be cynical, but one shouldn't have to be rich or from a wealthy family in order to pay their bills, save some money, have fun, enjoy life.\\" She said: \\"I didn't write this letter to complain. I wrote because I don't know what else to do, and as the President of my country, I hoped you would listen to my story.\\" <p>So, L.A., I'm here because I am listening to Kati's story. I'm listening to Americans all across the country, everybody who works their tail off, is doing the right thing, who believes in the American Dream, just wants a chance to build a decent life for themselves and their family. You are why I ran for President in the first place. And I am always going to be listening to you. <p>Now, the crisis that hit near the end of that campaign back in 2008 cost millions of Americans their jobs and their homes and their sense of security. But today, our businesses have added nearly 10 million new jobs over the past 52 months. The unemployment rate is at its lowest point since September of 2008. And this past year, we saw one of the fastest drops in nearly 30 years in the unemployment rate. The decisions we made not only to rescue the economy, rescue the auto industry, but to rebuild it on a new foundation, those decisions are paying off. <p>We're more energy independent. The world's number-one oil and gas producer is not Russia, it's not Saudi Arabia, it's the United States of America. We've reduced our carbon pollution over the past 8 years more than any country on Earth. You saw an L.A. Times headline the other day said, \\"2014 off to the hottest start on record for California.\\" That's why we have to worry about climate change. <p>We've tripled the electricity we're getting from wind power, generating enough last year to power every home in California. We now generate 10 times the solar electricity, creating tens of thousands of jobs across the country. California is so far ahead of the rest of the country in solar that earlier this year, solar power met 18 percent of your total power demand one day. That's the kind of progress, kind of leadership, we need. <p>But it's not just the energy sector. In education, our high school graduation rate is at a record high. The Latino dropout rate has been cut in half since 2008. More young people are earning their college degrees than ever before. Meanwhile, 401(k)s have restored their value. Fewer homes are underwater. Millions more families have the peace of mind of affordable health care when you need it because we did pass the Affordable Care Act. <p>None of this was an accident. We made some good decisions, but we also saw the resilience and the resolve of the American people. And because of that, we've recovered faster, we've gone farther than almost any country on Earth since the economic crisis. For the first time in more than a decade, business leaders around the world have declared that the number-one place to invest is not China, it's the United States of America. And our lead is growing. <p><i>Audience members.</i> U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! <p><i>The President. </i>So&mdash;U.S.A.! <p><i>Audience members.</i> U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! <i>The President.</i> So there are reasons&mdash;we've got every reason to be optimistic about America. We hold all the best cards. We've got the best hand. But the decisions we make now are going to determine whether or not working Americans like Kati continue to feel trapped or whether they get ahead; whether the economic gains that we make just go to a few at the top or they help to grow an economy and grow incomes and grow middle class opportunities for everybody. <p>And that's what's at stake right now: making sure our economy works for every working American. That's why I ran for President. That's what I'm focused on every day. This is the challenge of our time. We can't be distracted. And if you're in public office and you don't have an answer for somebody like Kati, if you're not thinking about her and folks who are working hard, but still struggling every day, why are you in public service? <p>So today I'm here to focus on one thing that we should be doing, which is training more Americans to fill the jobs we're creating. Right now there are more job openings in America than any time since 2007. That doesn't always make headlines. It's not sexy, and so the news doesn't report it, but it's a big deal. And the job training programs can help folks who fell on hard times in the recession, help them find a solid path back to the middle class. <p>And I'm always impressed by people who have the courage to go back to school, especially later in life. Last month, in Minnesota, I met a woman named Rebekah, a wonderful young woman. A few years ago, she was waiting tables. She enrolled in a community college, retrained for a new career; today, she loves her job as an accountant. Joe Biden's wife Jill Biden teaches at a community college. A lot of her students are in their thirties. One of the women I met with this morning, Joan Waddell, wrote me to say she's ready to get back in the game at age 60, after caring for a sick husband, but older workers like her need a little support. And she wrote, \\"We are a great investment, and we want to be part of the workforce.\\" And if you'd met Joan you'd want to hire her because she is sharp. <p>So Americans are the best workers in the world, if we're given a chance. If we work together, we can help more of our fellow citizens learn the skills that growing fields require: in high-tech manufacturing, in clean energy, in information technology, and in health care. <p>Now, the good news is, earlier this week, I signed a bipartisan bill into law that would help communities update and invest in job training programs like these. And I got to say I had so much fun actually signing a bipartisan bill from Congress, I said, why don't you all do it more often? [<i>Laughter</i>] Why don't you focus on getting some stuff done for the American people? It feels good. <p>So my administration has taken some steps on our own. We've rallied employers to give the long-term unemployed a fair shot at a job. We're offering grants to community colleges that work with companies to expand apprenticeships. We're helping cities identify fields with job openings and custom-tailored programs to help workers earn the skills employers are looking for right now, whether it's melding whettles or coding computers. If your job has been stamped \\"obsolete\\" and shipped overseas, or displaced by new technology, your country should help train you to land an even better job in the future. And that's something we can do if we work together. <p>So this is just some of what we should be doing to help strengthen the middle class and help Americans who are working to join the middle class. And what I keep hearing from folks across the country is that if Congress had the same priorities most Americans did, if they felt the same urgency that you feel in your own lives, we'd be helping a lot more families right now. I mean, think about what Congress hasn't done, despite the fact that I've been pushing them to do it. Congress won't act to make sure a woman gets fair pay. Why not? I went ahead and made sure more women have the protections they need to fight for fair pay in the workplace, because I believe equal pay should mean equal work. And when women succeed, America succeeds. Why isn't Congress doing something? <p><i>Audience member.</i> It's not Congress, it's the Republicans! <p><i>The President.</i> Well, I get you, I understand that. <p>Congress won't act to help more young people like Kati manage their student loan debt. I acted to give nearly 5 million Americans the chance to cap their payments at 10 percent of their income. I don't want future leaders saddled with debt they can't pay before they've even started off in life. Why is it&mdash;why don't we see House Republicans working with Democrats who've already said, we're behind making student loans more affordable? <p>Today marks exactly 5 years since the last time the minimum wage went up in this country. That's too long between raises for a lot of Americans. Now, I've done what I can by requiring Federal contractors to pay their employees a fair wage of $10.10 an hour. And since the first time I asked Congress to raise the minimum wage, 13 States and DC have gone ahead and raised theirs. And here is something interesting: States that have increased the minimum wages this year have seen higher job growth than those who didn't raise the minimum wage. America deserves a raise. It will be good for those workers and good for business. <p>So I'm not going to stop trying to work with Democrats and Republicans to make a difference in your lives. But I've got to call things as they are. What's really going on is that Republicans in Congress are directly blocking policies that would help millions of Americans. They are promoting policies that harm millions of Americans. Just this year, on the other hand, they voted to give another massive tax cut to the wealthiest Americans. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> Just last week, they actually voted to gut the rules we put in place to make sure big banks and credit card companies couldn't hurt consumers and cause another crisis. They're going in the wrong direction. Our economy does not grow from the top down, it grows from the middle class out. We do better when middle class families and folks who are working hard to get into the middle class have a chance. <p>So just in case some Republicans are listening, let me give you an example of a place where Democrats and Republicans should be able to work together to make a difference. I want everybody to pay attention to this. Right now our businesses are creating jobs, more companies are choosing to bring jobs back to America. But there's another trend that is a threat to us. Even as corporate profits are higher than ever, there's a small, but growing group of big corporations that are fleeing the country to get out of paying taxes. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> Well, hold on a second. I want you to&mdash;I say fleeing the country, but they're not actually doing that. They're not actually going anywhere. They're keeping most of their business here. They're keeping, usually, their headquarters here in the U.S. They don't want to give up the best universities and the best military and all the advantages of operating in the United States. They just don't want to pay for it. So they're technically renouncing their U.S. citizenship. They're declaring they're based someplace else even though most of their operations are here. Some people are calling these companies \\"corporate deserters.\\" And it's only a few big corporations so far. The vast majority of American businesses play by the rules. But these companies are cherry-picking the rules. And it damages the country's finances. It adds to the deficit. It makes it harder to invest in things like job training that help keep America growing. It sticks you with the tab to make up for what they're stashing offshore through their evasive tax policies. <p>Now, here's&mdash;the problem is, this loophole they're using in our tax laws is actually legal. It's so simple and so lucrative, one corporate attorney said it's almost like \\"the Holy Grail\\" of tax avoidance schemes. My attitude is, I don't care if it's legal, it's wrong. And my attitude is, is that nobody begrudges our companies from turning a profit. We want them to be profitable. And in growing&mdash;a global economy, there's nothing wrong with companies expanding to foreign markets. But you don't get to pick the tax rate you pay. Folks, if you're a secretary or you're a construction worker, you don't say, you know what, I feel like paying a little less, so let me do that. You don't get a chance to do that. These companies shouldn't either. And the practice they're engaging in is the same kind of behavior that keeps middle class and working class families working harder and harder just to keep up. <p>So the good news is, there's a way to change this. We could end this through tax reform that lowers the corporate rate, closes wasteful loopholes, simplifies the Tax Code so people can't game it. And over the past 2 years, I've put forward plans that would have cut corporate taxes and made our tax system more competitive, but Congress hasn't done anything, as usual. Now, some Members of Congress, in both parties, have been working together on responsible corporate tax reform so we don't have to keep playing Whac-A-Mole, trying to chase folks around, we'd finally start dealing with these special interest tax loopholes. But that's going to take some time. And in the meantime, we need to stop companies from renouncing their citizenship just to get out of paying their fair share of taxes. We can't wait for that. You shouldn't get to call yourself an American company only when you want a handout from American taxpayers. <p>So that's why, in my budget earlier this year, I proposed closing this unpatriotic tax loophole for good. Democrats in Congress have advanced a proposal that would do the same thing. A couple of Republicans have said they want to address it too. Let's everybody get together, Democrats and Republicans, to deter companies from rushing to take advantage of this tax loophole. And let's make sure that we're rewarding companies that are investing and paying their fair share here in the United States. <p>And this is not a partisan issue. Just 10 years ago, a Republican-led Congress cracked down on corporations moving to offshore tax havens like the Cayman Islands. We should do it again. And I'm not interested in punishing these companies. But I am interested in economic patriotism. Instead of doubling down on top-down economics, I want an economic patriotism that says we rise or fall together, as one Nation, and as one people. <p>Economic patriotism says it's a good thing when we close wasteful tax loopholes and invest in education and invest in job training that helps the economy for everybody. Instead of tax breaks for millionaires, let's give tax breaks to families to help on childcare or college. Let's stop rewarding companies that ship jobs overseas, give tax breaks to companies that are bringing jobs back to the United States. Let's put America back to work rebuilding roads and bridges and airports. Let's make sure the next generation of good manufacturing is happening right here in Los Angeles and in Wisconsin and in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. <p>Economic patriotism says it's a good thing when our fellow citizens have access to preschool and college and, yes, health care that is affordable. It's a good thing when women earn the same as men for doing the same work. It's a good thing when nobody who's working full time has to raise a family in poverty. That's not un-American. It's how we built America: together. That's what economic patriotism is. <p>So let me just close by saying this. The hardest thing in politics is to change a stubborn status quo. It's even harder when Washington seems focused on everything but the concerns of you. There are plenty of folks out there who count on you being cynical and say you're not going to vote, you're not going to get involved. And that just gives more power to the special interests who already benefit from the status quo. <p>Cynicism is fashionable these days. But I got to tell you, cynicism didn't put a man on the moon. Cynicism did not create the opportunity for all our citizens to vote. Cynicism has never won a war or cured a disease or started a business or fed young minds. <p>I believe in optimism. I believe in hope. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes! <p><i>The President.</i> I believe in America making progress. And despite unyielding opposition, there are workers with jobs who didn't have them before because of what we've done. There are families who have health insurance because of what we've done. There are students who are going to college who weren't going before because of what we've done. There are troops who have finally come home after serving tour after tour overseas because of what we've done. <p>Don't let the cynics get you down. Cynicism is a choice, and hope is a better choice. And if we can work together, I promise you there's no holding America back. <p>Thank you, Los Angeles. I love you. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"177" "\"Hi, everybody. Our businesses have now added nearly 10 million new jobs over the past 52 months. The unemployment rate is at its lowest point since September 2008, the fastest 1-year drop in nearly 30 years; 401(k)s are growing, fewer homes are underwater, and for the first time in more than a decade, business leaders around the world have declared that the world's number-one place to invest is not China, it's the United States of America. And our lead is growing. <p>None of this is an accident. It's thanks to the resilience and resolve of the American people that our country has recovered faster and come farther than almost any other advanced nation on Earth. <p>But there's another trend that threatens to undermine the progress you've helped to make. Even as corporate profits are as high as ever, a small but growing group of big corporations are fleeing the country to get out of paying taxes. They're keeping most of their business inside the United States, but they're basically renouncing their citizenship and declaring that they're based someplace else, just to avoid paying their fair share.<p>Now, I want to be clear: This is only a few big corporations so far. The vast majority of American businesses pay their taxes right here in the United States. But when some companies cherry-pick their taxes, it damages the country's finances. It adds to the deficit. It makes it harder to invest in the things that will keep America strong, and it sticks you with the tab for what they stash offshore. Right now a loophole in our tax laws makes this totally legal, and I think that's totally wrong. You don't get to pick which rules you play by or which tax rate you pay, and neither should these companies. <p>The best way to level the playing field is through tax reform that lowers the corporate tax rate, closes wasteful loopholes, and simplifies the Tax Code for everybody. But stopping companies from renouncing their citizenship just to get out of paying their fair share of taxes is something that cannot wait.

Let's reward the hard work of ordinary Americans who play by the rules. Together, we can build up our middle class, hand down something better to our kids, and restore the American Dream for all who work for it and study for it and strive for it. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"178" "\"Thank you, everybody. Please have a seat. <p>Well, welcome to the White House. It has been 200 years since Dolley Madison saved the portrait of George Washington that hangs in this room from an advancing British Army. So I guess you could say that the White House has always supported the arts. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm glad to say that Michelle has never had to save any paintings that I know of, from Bo or otherwise. [<i>Laughter</i>] But we do believe in celebrating extraordinarily talented Americans and their achievements in the arts and in the humanities. <p>So I want to thank Jane Chu and Bro Adams, the chairs of the National Endowment of the Arts and the National Endowment of the Humanities, for their outstanding work. And I want to thank Members of Congress, including a great champion of the arts, Nancy Pelosi, for joining us this afternoon. <p>The late, great Maya Angelou once said, \\"A bird doesn't sing because it has an answer, it sings because it has a song.\\" Each of the men and women that we honor today has a song, literally, in some cases. For others, it's a talent or a drive or a passion that they just had to share with the world. <p>To our honorees: Like most creative and brainy people, you did not cultivate your song for accolades or applause. If there were no medal for your work, I expect you'd still be out there designing buildings and making movies and digging through archives and asking tough questions in interviews. <p>But we do honor you today because your accomplishments have enriched our lives and reveal something about ourselves and about our country. We can never take for granted the flash of insight that comes from watching a great documentary or reading a great memoir or novel or seeing an extraordinary piece of architecture. We can't forget the wonder we feel when we stand before an incredible work of art or the world of memories we find unlocked with a simple movement or a single note. <p>So the moments you help create&mdash;moments of understanding or awe or joy or sorrow&mdash;they add texture to our lives. They are not incidental to the American experience; they are central to it, they are essential to it. So we not only congratulate you this afternoon, we thank you for an extraordinary lifetime of achievement. <p>I'll just close by telling a tale of something that took place in this house, back in 1862. President Lincoln called together a meeting of his Cabinet to present them with the Emancipation Proclamation. But that was not the first item on his agenda. This is a little-known story. Instead, he began reading out loud from a story from the humorist Artemus Ward. It was a story called, \\"High-Handed Outrage at Utica.\\" According to one often-repeated account, after he finished a chapter, Lincoln laughed and laughed. His Cabinet did not. [<i>Laughter</i>] So Lincoln read them another chapter. [<i>Laughter</i>] And they still sat there in stony silence. Finally, he put the book down, and said: \\"Gentlemen, why don't you laugh? You need this medicine as much as I do.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] To be clear, I probably will not be trying this in my Cabinet meetings. [<i>Laughter</i>] Certainly, not if I'm presenting something like the Emancipation Proclamation. [<i>Laughter</i>] But what Lincoln understood is that the arts and the humanities aren't just there to be consumed and enjoyed whenever we have a free moment in our lives. We rely on them constantly. We need them. Like medicine, they help us live. <p>So once again, I want to thank tonight's honorees for creating work that I'm sure would have met President Lincoln's high standards. In this complicated world, and in these challenging times, you've shared a song with us and enhanced the character of our country, and for that we are extraordinarily grateful. <p>It is now my privilege to present these medals to each of the recipients after their citation is read. <p>So, our outstanding military aides, please. <p><i>[At this point, Lt. Col. Michael P. Wagner, USA, Army Aide to the President, read the citations, and the President presented the medals, assisted by Maj. Steven M. Schreiber, USMC, Marine Corps Aide to the President.] </i><p>I think now is a good time for everybody to stand up and give these outstanding winners&mdash;or recipients a big round of applause. Yay! <p>So congratulations to all of you. We could not be more appreciative of everything you've done. I was mentioning, as people were coming up, I've been personally touched by all sorts of these folks. I was mentioning to Maxine that when I was first writing my first book and trying to teach myself how to write, \\"The Women Warriors\\" was one of the books I read. After the book was done, Diane was one of the few interviews that was granted. [<i>Laughter</i>] I told Linda Ronstadt I had a little crush on her back in the day. [<i>Laughter</i>] So&mdash;and I know all of you have been touched similarly by these amazing people. <p>So we are very grateful to you. On behalf of Michelle and myself, as we're taking pictures with the recipients and the family&mdash;their families, please continue to enjoy the reception here. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"179" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Kansas City! Well, it is good to be back in Kansas City, back in the Midwest. And I have to say, I love these old theaters. I mean, they are unbelievable. This is just gorgeous. <p>The&mdash;it is good to see Governor Jay Nixon here today. Congressman Emanuel Cleaver is here. Congressman Lacy Clay is here. Mayor Sly James is here. And you're here! All of you are here. <p>Now, if you have a seat, feel free to sit down, because I don't want everybody starting to fall out. [<i>Laughter</i>] If you don't have a seat, don't sit down. But bend your knees a little bit. <p>It's always good to spend a little time in Kansas City. Last night, I had a chance to get some barbecue at Arthur Bryant's. Now, they had run out of coleslaw, which I asked&mdash;I said, did you save some coleslaw for me? They said, no, they hadn't saved any. <p>Audience member. [Inaudible] <p><i>The President.</i> The&mdash;I'm sorry, what are you hollering about? <p><i>Audience member.</i> Jesus is the God of Israel.

We love you! <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. Now, before&mdash;I just want to be on record, though, because people have been asking me this question. I deal with a lot of tough issues. I am not going to decide who makes the best barbecue in Kansas City. [<i>Laughter</i>] Bryant's barbecue was tasty. And Victor is right, I did plow through it pretty good. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I have not had enough samples to make a definitive judgment, so I'm going to have to try some other barbecue next time I come in. I have to say, by the way, Victor was not shy about eating either. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I just want to be clear. <p>But I had a chance&mdash;I went there for the barbecue, but also I went there because I wanted to have a chance to talk to Victor and three other people from the area who took the time to sit down with me and talk, because they had written letters to me. Some of you may know&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member</i>. I wrote you too! [Laughter] <p><i>The President.</i> Well, you know what, if I had known, I would have had you over for dinner too. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But what happens is, every night, I read 10 letters that we receive. We get 40,000 correspondence. And then our Correspondence Office chooses 10, sort of a sample for me to take a look at. And it gives me a chance to hear directly from the people I serve. And folks tell me their stories. They tell me their worries and their hopes and their hardships, their successes. Some say I'm doing a good job. But other people say, \\"You're an idiot.\\" <p>Audience members. No! <i>The President.</i> No, no, I mean, this is how I know that I'm getting a good sample of letters. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Last week, a young girl wrote to ask me, why aren't there any women on our currency? And then she gave me, like, a long list of possible women to put on our dollar bills and quarters and stuff, which I thought was a pretty good idea. <p>And now, Victor wrote to me to tell me about his life in Butler, and he told me that he had been unemployed for a while after he and his wife had had their first child. But he refused to quit. He earned his degree, found a full-time job. He now helps folks with disabilities live independently. And he's just a good-hearted man. And you can tell, really, he's doing great stuff. And Victor described how he got through some tough times because of his Christian faith and his determination, which are things that government programs and policies can't replace. You've got to have that sense of purpose and perseverance. That has to come from inside; you can't legislate that. <p>But he also said that he was able to afford health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act. And he also said that because of the income-based repayment plan that we had put in place, where you only have to pay 10 percent of your income maximum in repaying your loans each month, that was what allowed him and his family to keep a roof over their heads and support themselves. <p>And so I'm here because Victor is the sort of person I'm working for every single day, somebody who never quits, somebody who is doing everything right, somebody who believes in the American Dream. Somebody who just wants a chance to build a decent life for himself and his family. And that's the vast majority of Americans. That's who I'm fighting for right here in Kansas City and all across this country. That's why I ran for President in the first place, to fight for folks like that. <p>Now, we all know it hasn't always been easy. The crisis that hit near the end of my campaign back in 2008, it would end up costing millions of Americans their jobs, their homes, their sense of security. But we have fought back. We have got back off our feet, we have dusted ourselves off. Today, our businesses have added nearly 10 million new jobs over the past 52 months. Construction is up. Manufacturing is back. Our energy, our technology, our auto industries, they're all booming. <p>The unemployment rate is at its lowest point since September of 2008. It's dropped faster than any time in 30 years. This morning we found out that in the second quarter of this year, our economy grew at a strong pace, and businesses are investing, workers are building new homes, consumers are spending, America is exporting goods around the world. <p>So the decisions that we made&mdash;to rescue our economy, to rescue the auto industry, to rebuild the economy on a new foundation, to invest in research and infrastructure, education&mdash;all those things are starting to pay off. <p>The world's number-one oil and gas producer&mdash;it's not Saudi Arabia, it's not Russia, it's the United States of America. We've tripled&mdash;we've tripled&mdash;the amount of electricity we get from wind. We've increased by 10 times the amount of electricity we get from the sun. And all that is creating tens of thousands of jobs across the country. <p>Our high school graduation rate is at a record high. More young people are earning their college degrees than ever before; 401(k)s have recovered their value. Home prices are rising. And yes, millions of families now have the peace of mind, just like Victor's family does, of getting quality, affordable health care when you need it. It makes a difference in people's lives. <p>And look, Kansas City, none of this is an accident. It's thanks to the resilience and resolve of the American people. It's also thanks to some decisions that we made early on. And now America has recovered faster and come farther than just about any other advanced country on Earth. And for the first time in more than a decade, if you ask business leaders around the world what's the number-one place to invest, they don't say China anymore. They say the United States of America. And our lead is growing. <p>So sometimes, you wouldn't know it if you were watching the news, but there are a lot of good reasons to be optimistic about America. We hold the best cards. Things are getting better. The decisions we make now can make things even better than that. In fact, the decisions we make now will determine whether the economic gains that we're generating are broad based, whether they just go to a few at the top or whether we got an economy in which the middle class is growing and folks who are trying to get into the middle class have more rungs on the ladder, right? Whether ordinary folks are benefiting from growth. <p>And that's what's at stake right now, making sure our economy works for every American. See, I'm glad that GDP is growing, and I'm glad that corporate profits are high, and I'm glad that the stock market is booming. But what really I want to see is a guy working 9 to 5 and then working some overtime, I want that guy making more than the minimum wage. <p>And what I really want is somebody who has worked for 20, 30 years being able to retire with some dignity and some respect. What I really want is a family that they have the capacity to save so that when their child is ready to go to college, they know they can help and that it's affordable and that that child is not going to be burdened down with debt. That's the measure of whether the economy is working: not just how well it's doing overall, but is it doing well for ordinary folks who are working hard every single day and aren't always getting a fair shot? That's what we're fighting for. That's why I ran for President. That's what I'm focused on every day. <p>And that's what sometimes Washington forgets. Your lives and what you're going through day to day&mdash;the struggles, but also the opportunities and the hopes and the good things, but sometimes the rough things that happen&mdash;that's more important than some of the phony scandals or the fleeting stories that you see. This is the challenge of our time: How do we make sure we've got an economy that is working for everybody? <p>Now, all of you are doing your part to help bring America back. You're doing your job. Imagine how much further along we'd be, how much stronger our economy would be, if Congress was doing its job too. We'd be doing great. Every time I meet some of these folks who have written me letters, we sit down and talk, and they say, what's going on in Washington? Why&mdash;what they tell me is, if Congress had the same priorities that ordinary families did, if they felt the same sense of urgency about things like the cost of college or the need for increases in the minimum wage or how we're making childcare more affordable and improving early childhood education, if that's what they were thinking about, we could help a lot more families. A lot more people would be getting ahead. The economy would be doing better. We could help a lot more families, and we should. <p>We should be relentlessly focused on what I call an opportunity agenda, one that creates more jobs by investing in what's always made our economy strong: making sure that we're on the cutting edge when it comes to clean energy; making sure that we're rebuilding our infrastructure&mdash;our roads, our bridges, our ports, our airports, our locks, our dams; making sure that advanced manufacturing is happening right here in the United States so we can start bringing manufacturing jobs back to the Midwest and all across the country, jobs that pay a good wage; investing in research and science that leads to new American industries; training our workers&mdash;really making a job training program and using our community colleges in ways that allow people to constantly retrain for the new opportunities that are out there and to prepare our kids for the global competition that they're going to face; making sure that hard work pays off with higher wages and higher incomes. <p>If we do all these things, we're going to strengthen the middle class, we'll help more people get into the middle class. Businesses, by the way, will do better. If folks have more money in their pocket, then businesses have more customers. If businesses have more customers, they hire more workers. You hire more workers, they spend more money. You spend more money, businesses have more customers, they hire even more workers. You start moving in the right direction. But it starts not from the top down, it starts from the middle out, the bottom up. <p>Now, so far this year, Republicans in Congress keep blocking or voting down just about every idea that would have some of the biggest impact on middle class and working class families. They've said no to raising the minimum wage. They've said no to fair pay, making sure that women have the ability to make sure that they're getting paid the same as men for doing the same job. They've said no for fixing our broken immigration system. Rather than investing in education, they actually voted to give another massive tax cut to the wealthiest Americans. And they've been pushing to gut the rules that we put in place after the financial crisis to make sure big banks and credit card companies wouldn't take advantage of consumers or cause another crisis. So they haven't been that helpful. [<i>Laughter</i>] They have not been as constructive as I would have hoped. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And these actions, they come with a cost. When you block policies that would help millions of Americans right now, not only are those families hurt, but the whole economy is hurt. So that's why this year, my administration, what we've said was, we want to work with Congress, we want to work with Republicans and Democrats to get things going, but we can't wait. So if they're not going to do anything, we'll do what we can on our own. And we've taken more than 40 actions aimed at helping hard-working families like yours. That's when we act: when Congress won't. <p>So when Congress failed to pass equal pay legislation, I made sure that women got more protection in their fight for fair pay in the workplace, because I think that when women succeed, everybody succeeds. I want my daughters paid the same as your sons for doing the same job. <p>Congress had the chance to pass a law that would help lower interest rates on student loans. They didn't pass it. I acted on my own to give millions of Americans a chance to cap their payments, the program that Victor has taken advantage of. I don't want our young people just saddled with debt before they've even gotten started in life. <p>When it comes to the minimum wage, last week marked 5 years since the last time the minimum wage went up. Now, you know the cost of living went up. The minimum wage didn't go up. So I went ahead on my own. When it came to Federal contractors, I said, you want to get a Federal contract, you've got to pay your workers at least $10.10 an hour. And I've been trying to work with Governors and mayors, and in some cases with business owners, just calling them up directly. How about giving your folks a raise? And some of them have done it. And since I had first asked Congress to raise the minimum wage, businesses like the Gap, you've got 13 States and DC, they've gone ahead and raised their minimum wage. It makes a difference in people's lives. And by the way, here's something interesting: The States that have increased their minimum wage this year, they've seen higher job growth than the States that didn't increase their minimum wage. So remember, you give them a little bit more money, businesses have more customers. They got more customers, they make more profit. They make more profit, what do they do? They hire more workers. America deserves a raise, and it's good for everybody. <p>So some of the things we're doing without Congress are making a difference, but we could do so much more if Congress would just come on and help out a little bit. [<i>Applause</i>] Just come on. Come on and help out a little bit. Stop being mad all the time. Stop just hating all the time. [<i>Laughter</i>] Come on. Let's get some work done together. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We actually&mdash;they did pass this workforce training act, and it was bipartisan. There were Republicans and Democrats, and everybody was all pleased. They came, we had a bill signing, and they were all in their suits. I said, didn't&mdash;doesn't this feel good? [<i>Laughter</i>] We're doing something. It's, like, useful. We're not&mdash;nobody is shouting at each other. [<i>Laughter</i>] You know? It was really nice. I said, let's do this again. Let's do it more often. <p>I mean, I know they're not that happy that I'm President, but that's okay. [<i>Laughter</i>] Come on. I've only got a couple of years left. Come on, let's get some work done. Then you can be mad at the next President. <p>Look, we've got just today and tomorrow until Congress leaves town for a month. And we've still got some serious work to do. We've still got a chance to&mdash;we got to put people to work rebuilding roads and bridges. And then the Highway Trust Fund is running out of money; we got to get that done. We've got to get some resources to fight wildfires out West. That's a serious situation. We need more resources to deal with the situation in the southern part of the border, right, with some of those kids. We got to be able to deal with that in a proper way. <p>So there's a bunch of stuff that needs to get done. Unfortunately, I think the main vote&mdash;correct me if I'm wrong here, Congressman&mdash;the main vote that they've scheduled for today is whether or not they decide to sue me for doing my job. <p><i>Audience members</i>. Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> No, no, no. First of all, don't&mdash;first of all, here's something I always say: Do not boo, vote. Booing doesn't help. Voting helps. <p>But think about this. The&mdash;they have announced that they're going to sue me for taking executive actions to help people. So they're mad because I'm doing my job. And by the way, I've told them&mdash;I said, I'd be happy to do it with you. So the only reason I'm doing it on my own is because you don't do anything. But if you want, let's work together. <p>Now, I mean, everybody recognizes this is a political stunt, but it's worse than that, because every vote they're taking like that means a vote they're not taking to actually help you. When they had taken 50 votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, that was time that could have been spent working constructively to help you on some things. And by the way, you know who is paying for this suit they're going to file? You. <p><i>Audience member</i>. No! <i>The President.</i> No, no, you're paying for it. And it's estimated that by the time the thing was done, I would have already left office. So it's not a productive thing to do. <p>But here's what I want people to remember. Every single day, as depressing sometimes as what goes on in Washington may be, I see the inherent goodness and generosity of the American people. I see it every day. I see it in all of you. I saw it in the four people that I had dinner with last night. <p>In addition to Victor, one guy who joined us was a guy named Mark Turner. He works with high school dropouts to help get them back on track. He used to be a successful corporate executive, decided he wanted to give something back. You've got Valerie McCaw. Valerie is a single mom, engineer, owns a small business. She's doing great things. Even though sometimes it's a struggle making sure that she keeps her business afloat, she's persevered and is helping her son get his college education. Then you got Becky Forrest. She's a fireplug. She's president of the Town Fork Creek Neighborhood Association. She's got so many things going on&mdash;after-school programs and mentoring programs and basketball leagues and all kinds of things at a community center&mdash;I couldn't keep track of all of them. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And to listen to them talk, it made you optimistic. It reminded you there are good people out here. Everybody is out there trying to do their best, trying to look after their families, trying to raise their kids, trying to give something back, working with their church, working with their synagogues, working with their places of faith. Just trying to give something back and give some meaning to their lives. And they're responsible. And we all make mistakes, and we all have regrets, but generally speaking, people are decent. <p>And so the question is, how can we do a better job at capturing that spirit in Washington, in our Government? Because the American people are working harder than ever to support families, to strengthen communities. And so instead of suing me for doing my job, let's&mdash;I want Congress to do its job and make life a little better for the Americans who sent them there in the first place. Stop posturing. <p>And by the way, just&mdash;there's one place to start. I talked about this last week, but I want to talk about it a little more. Right now there's a loophole in the Tax Code that lets a small, but growing group of corporations leave the country; say&mdash;they declare themselves no longer American companies just to get out of paying their fair share of taxes, even though most of their operations are here, they've always been American companies, they took advantage of all the benefits of being an American company, but now their accountant has convinced them maybe they can get out of paying some taxes. <p>They're renouncing their citizenship even though they're keeping most of their business here. And I mean, it's just an accounting trick, but it hurts our country's finances, and it adds to the deficits and sticks you with the tab, because if they're not paying their share and stashing their money offshore, you're paying&mdash;you don't have that option. It ain't right. Not only is it not right, it ain't right. [<i>Laughter</i>] So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. It ain't right. I hope everybody is clear on the distinction. There are some things are not right. And then, there's some things that just ain't right. [<i>Laughter</i>] And this is&mdash;this ain't right. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I mean, you don't have accountants figuring all this stuff out for you, trying to game the system. These companies shouldn't either. And they shouldn't turn their back on the country that made their success possible. And by the way, this can be fixed. For the last 2 years, I've put forward plans to cut corporate taxes, make&mdash;close loopholes, make it more reliable, make it clearer. And to Republicans, I say, join with me. Let's work to close this unpatriotic tax loophole for good. Let's use the savings that we get from closing the loophole to invest in things like education that are good for everybody. <p>Don't double down on top-down economics. Let's really fight to make sure that everybody gets a chance and, by the way, that everybody plays by the same rules. We could do so much more if we got that kind of economic patriotism that says we rise or fall as one Nation and as one people. And that's what Victor believes. <p>When Victor wrote me his letter, he said, \\"I believe, regardless of political party, we can all do something to help our citizens to have a chance at a job, have food in their stomachs, have access to great education and health care.\\" That's what economic patriotism is. That's what we should all be working on. <p>Instead of tax breaks for folks who don't need them, let's give tax breaks to working families for&mdash;to help them pay for childcare and college. Don't reward companies shipping jobs overseas; let's give tax breaks to companies investing right here in Missouri, right here in the Midwest. Let's give every citizen access to preschool and college and affordable health care. And let's make sure women get a fair wage. Let's make sure anybody who is working full-time isn't living in poverty. <p>These are not un-American ideas, these are patriotic ideas. This is how we built America. <p>So just remember this: The hardest thing to do is to bring about real change. It's hard. You've got a stubborn status quo. And folks in Washington, sometimes, they're focused on everything but your concerns. And there are special interests, and there are lobbyists, and they're paid to maintain the status quo that's working for somebody. And they're counting on you getting cynical so you don't vote and you don't get involved and people just say, you know what, none of this is going to make a difference. And the more you do that, then the more power the special interests have, and the more entrenched the status quo becomes. <p>You can't afford to be cynical. Cynicism is fashionable sometimes. You see it all over our culture, all over TV; everybody likes just putting stuff down and being cynical and being negative, and that shows somehow that you're sophisticated and you're cool. You know what, cynicism didn't put a man on the Moon. Cynicism didn't win women the right to vote. Cynicism did not get a Civil Rights Act signed. Cynicism has never won a war. Cynicism has never cured a disease. Cynicism has never started a business. Cynicism has never fed a young mind. <p>I do not believe in a cynical America; I believe in an optimistic America that is making progress. And I believe despite unyielding opposition, there are workers right now who have jobs who didn't have them before because of what we've done and folks who got health care who didn't have it because of the work that we've done and students who are going to college who couldn't afford it before and troops who've come home after tour after tour of duty because of what we've done. <p>You don't have time to be cynical. Hope is a better choice. That's what I need you for. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you.\" "
"180" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you, everybody. Please have a seat. Good evening, everybody, and welcome to the White House. Everybody looks wonderful. <p>This is a truly special evening. And we are delighted to celebrate it with so many people from so many different walks of life. It is not often that you get Dikembe Mutombo, Steve Case, Stevie Wonder all in the same room. [<i>Laughter</i>] In fact, that may be the first time that they were ever in the same sentence. <p>We have just one of my favorite people performing tonight, Katy Perry. We are so grateful to her. I love Katy Perry. She is just a wonderful person. I've just met her mom, and now I know why she is such a wonderful person. But I just want everybody to know she is on tour right now, and so for her to take time out to do this is really special, and so we really want to say thank you to her for doing this. <p>The fact that so many accomplished, wonderful people are here is a testament to the impact that the Special Olympics has had on our Nation and has had on our world. This organization has touched so many lives. And tonight Michelle and I are thrilled that we get a chance to say thank you to everyone who's been a part of it. <p>When Eunice Kennedy Shriver began what would become the Special Olympics in her backyard over 50 years ago, it's not clear whether she could imagine how far and how fast it would end up going. Of course, knowing her, she probably did have a sense of where it was going to go. That's the kind of visionary that she was. I want to recognize all the members of the Shriver family who are here tonight and who continue to carry on the family's incredible tradition of service. Thanks. <p>Today, in more than 170 countries, Special Olympians are athletes of all kinds: skiers and speed skaters, sailors, cyclists, equestrians, and judo masters. They make extraordinary contributions to their communities. And I'm pride&mdash;proud to highlight a few of them here tonight. <p>Loretta Claiborne didn't just finish with the top 100 women runners in the Boston Marathon twice; she was also the first Special Olympian to speak to world leaders during the United Nations General Assembly. So we're very proud of Loretta. Where's Loretta&mdash;right here. There she is. Yay, Loretta! And by the way, during the receiving line, Loretta and Michelle compared arms. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Hers were better. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Yes, they were. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Tim Harris is a Special Olympian in basketball, poly hockey, volleyball, golf, and track and field. So he has all four seasons covered. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now he has a restaurant in Albuquerque called Tim's Place. The most popular item is the hugs Tim gives his customers, and so far, more than 42,000 have been served. Where's Tim? There he is right there. Yay, Tim! Tim is fired up. Tim is fired up, although, Tim, I didn't get a hug. [<i>Laughter</i>] Come on, man. Oh, here we go. All right, come on. Come on, man. [<i>At this point, Tim Harris came to the stage and hugged the President.</i>] <p><i>Mr. Harris.</i> I love you, Obama. <p><i>The President.</i> I love you back. <p>See, you know, Presidents need some encouragement once in a while too. [<i>Laughter</i>] That felt really good. That was nice. Thank you, Tim. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Brina Kei Maxino represented the Asia-Pacific region at the Special Olympics Global Youth Activation Summit when she was 16 years old. She was the first Filipina and the first teenager with Down Syndromes to do that, so let's give Brina a big round of applause. Yay, Brina! Yay! <p>And Deon Namiseb was a captain of Namibia's soccer team when they won silver in the 2007 World Games. Now he's a coach, he mentors orphans, he advocates for the rights of Namibians with intellectual disabilities. We are very proud of Deon. Here he is, right here&mdash;Deon. Hey! <p>Dustin Plunkett competed at the 2007 World Games too. He shared the stage with Yao Ming. He says, \\"Special Olympics saved my life.\\" And now he's recruiting coaches so that the Special Olympics can keep growing. Dustin, where are you? There he is. Thank you, Dustin. Proud of you. <p>And Ricardo Thornton, Sr., is here with his wife Donna. He is an international ambassador for Special Olympics, a long-time employee of the Martin Luther King Memorial Library here in Washington, a proud father, a proud grandfather. I recently appointed him to the President's Committee for People With Intellectual Disabilities. A wonderful man, please give Ricardo a big round of applause. <p>And Frank Stephens is a Special Olympian from Virginia. And he is proud to be a Global Messenger, once spoke before a crowd of 10,000, writes eloquently about the pain and exclusion that comes when others don't accept you or treat you with the respect every human being deserves. <p>\\"I am very lucky,\\" Frank has written. \\"Even though I was born with this intellectual disability, I do pretty well and have a good life. I live and work in the community. I count as friends the people I went to school with and the people I met in my job. Every day, I get closer to living a life like yours.\\" <p>\\"Being compared to people like me,\\" he once wrote, \\"should be considered a badge of honor. No one overcomes more than we do and still loves life so much.\\" Give Frank a big round of applause. <p>So what Frank wrote, what all these people represent, is what the Special Olympics is all about: overcoming obstacles with love and kindness and generosity and healthy competition. It's about pride, and it's about teamwork, and it's about friendship. And it's about treating everybody with dignity and giving everybody a chance. <p>So those values are values that everybody could use. Those are values that the Special Olympics can teach all of us. And so it makes a lot of sense that the Special Olympics began here in America, a nation founded on the principles of human equality, on the promise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for everybody, not just for some. A few organizations exemplify that principle and that promise better than this one, so I want to thank all of you for being a part of the Special Olympics. We are getting excited for the World Games in L.A. next year, and we hope you have a wonderful evening tonight. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Go head, eat up!\" "
"181" "\"Thank you. Now, let me start off by making two points. The first is, clearly, HUD has the rowdiest employees. I now realize that. The second point is that before I came out here, Shaun Donovan made a point of saying that this wasn't as exciting to people as Michelle coming. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, I know that. [<i>Laughter</i>] I hear that everywhere I go. [<i>Laughter</i>] There's no reason to remind me, to rub it in. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's why I married her. To improve the gene pool. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I am here today because I stole one terrific Secretary of HUD from you, but I've delivered another terrific Secretary of HUD to you. And I want to thank all of you for the great job that you're doing day in and day out. And we appreciate the Members of Congress who are here&mdash;although I have to say that Joaquin didn't really have a choice. [<i>Laughter</i>] The other two, obviously, they care. [<i>Laughter</i>] The brother, he's, like, okay, I've got to show up. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I appreciate them being here. <p>Let me just say a few words about Shaun. From his first day when he got here, Shaun knew he had his work cut out for him. You will recall that the housing market was the epicenter of the crisis that went through in 2008, 2009. There were millions of families whose homes were underwater. Hundreds of thousands of construction workers were out of a job. Too many veterans lived out on the street. <p>But we were very fortunate because Shaun is just one of those people where, he sees a problem, he's going to work to solve it. And if what he tries the first time doesn't work, he's going to try something else. And he's just kind of&mdash;he's a geek, he's a wonk. [<i>Laughter</i>] He studies the spreadsheets. He recruited top talent. He promised that if everyone here at HUD worked just a little bit harder, you could really turn things around for struggling families. And all of you accepted that challenge. <p>We've still got work to do, but think about the progress that we've made. Home prices, home sales, construction all up. Veterans' homelessness down by nearly 25 percent. Millions of families are now seeing their home values above water, which obviously is a huge relief for them. When natural disasters strike, like the Colorado floods or Hurricane Sandy, you are right in there helping families rebuild. <p>And a lot of that is thanks to Shaun; a lot of it is thanks to the fact that all of you under his leadership took up the challenge and you remembered what it is that this agency is about. <p>I love the way that your new Secretary characterized it. This is&mdash;this should be a department of opportunity. And housing, for so many people, is symbolic of the American Dream. It means that you've got something stable, something you can count on, something that you own. And to watch the transformation that has happened around the country&mdash;first and foremost because of the resiliency of the American people and their hard work&mdash;but also because that every step of the way you were in there trying to help them&mdash;that really makes a difference. <p>So I could not be prouder of the work that Shaun did. But I can tell you that nobody is more passionate about these issues than Juli&aacute;n. He knows the difference between smart policy and investments that can make a difference and just talk. And he's all about action, not just talk. <p>He's seen it firsthand in how he grew up. He's seen it firsthand as a mayor. He revitalized parts of San Antonio that had been neglected for a long time. He helped the Eastside Promise Zone take root and to grow. He championed the kind of investments that keep communities strong over the long term, like economic development and expanded early childhood education. And most of all, he knows how to lead a team. And this is a big team, and you guys have gotten some big things done. But we've got a lot more to do. Even bigger things need to get done. <p>So what&mdash;in talking to Juli&aacute;n and initially trying to persuade him to take this task, what I saw was that spirit of hard work that's reflected in how he was brought up and the values that were instilled in him. And he, every single day, wants to make sure that those values live out in the work that he does. <p>And I know everybody in this room, you've got a story to tell too about somebody who, along the way, gave you some opportunity; about somebody who&mdash;maybe you were, like me, raised by a single mom and&mdash;like that first apartment that really&mdash;had your own bedroom, and it was clean. [<i>Laughter</i>] And it was in a decent neighborhood and there was a decent school district. And how happy everybody was, and the transformation that could take place in people's lives. That's a story I want you to tap into every day that you come to work. <p>Sometimes, work in Washington can be discouraging. Sometimes, it seems as if the agenda that you're trying to pursue helping working families and middle class families, sometimes, it seems that's not the priorities up on Capitol Hill. But if you remember why you got into this work in the first place, if you remember that this is not just a job, but it should also be a passion, that it should also be part of giving back, that you shouldn't just be checking in and punching the clock, but every single day, there's somebody out there who could use your help&mdash;and I know when they get that help, and they write letters to me, and they'll tell me, you know what, you transformed my life&mdash;there's no better feeling on Earth than that feeling that you somehow played a small part in a family succeeding. <p>And that success then lasts generations, because some child or grandchild suddenly is feeling better, and they start doing better in school, and maybe they avoided getting into trouble and ending up in the criminal justice system or dropping out of school and not being able to find a job&mdash;all because of what you did. What an incredible privilege that is. What an incredible honor. <p>And that's the attitude I want you to have every single day that you're here. I tell folks, I've now been President for more than 5&frac12; years, and I've got 2&frac12; years left, and I want to squeeze every single day&mdash;I want to squeeze as much out of every single day. This is not just a job, this is a privilege that we have. And we've got to do&mdash;we've got to take advantage of it. We've got to seize it. Because that's what makes it worthwhile. <p>It's something that when I travel around the country, I try to describe, because people are so inundated with cynicism and bad news, and I want to tell them a story of good news. There are people in agencies like HUD, every single day, they care about you, and they want to help you. And big organizations are never going to be perfect, and there are always going to be some bureaucracies, there's always going to be some redtape, there's always going to be some things that don't work quite as smoothly as we want. And your job is to fix that stuff or work around that stuff. And I want everybody here to&mdash;when you're working with this new Secretary, who's got energy and drive, he's young, he's good-looking, he talks good&mdash;you can't let him down. [<i>Laughter</i>] You've got to be open to try new things and doing things in a different way and doing them better. But more importantly, you can't let those families out there down, because they're counting on you. <p>So I'm eager to work with him, but more importantly, I'm eager to work with you. And every single day when you come to work, I just want you to know that I can't do my job unless you're doing your job. Juli&aacute;n can't do his job unless you're doing your job. And whether you are managing a financing program to build low-income or affordable housing, or you are helping with some of our initiatives like Promise Zones, or you are coordinating with regional offices&mdash;whatever your task, whether you are upper management or you're the new kid on the block who's coming in, you can really have an impact that lasts for generations. <p>Don't squander that. Don't succumb to the cynicism. Don't start thinking that this is just a job. Remember the mission that you've got. And if you do that, I guarantee you, under Juli&aacute;n's leadership, years from now you're going to be able to look back and really be proud of everything that you've accomplished, because there are going to be a whole lot of people's lives who are a lot better. All right? <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.\" "
"182" "\"Hello, everybody, hello! Thank you so much. Everybody, please have a seat. Welcome to the White House. <p>The Executive order I'll sign in a few minutes is one that's good for workers, it's good for responsible employers, and it's good for the middle class. And that explains the folks who are standing up on stage with me, including Secretary of Labor Tom Perez, who's done a great job on this. <p>Yesterday we learned that the springtime was a strong time for economic growth. Companies are investing. Consumers are spending. Our energy, our technology, our auto industries are all booming, with workers making and selling goods all around the world. Our businesses have created nearly 10 million new jobs over the past 52 months, and the unemployment rate is at its lowest point since 2008; 401(k)s have recovered their value. Home prices are rising. Millions more families have the peace of mind that comes with having affordable, quality health care. <p>And because of the incredible hard work and resilience of the American people, we've recovered faster, we've come farther than any other advanced country since the onset of the Great Depression&mdash;great recession. Things are getting better. [<i>Applause</i>] Things are getting better. Steadily, things are getting better. But we all know there's more work to do. And the decisions we make now are going to have an impact on whether or not this economy works for everybody or just folks at the top, whether we've got a growing economy that fuels rising incomes and creates a thriving middle class and ladders into the middle class. <p>That's what's at stake: making sure our economy works for every hard-working American, and if you work hard and you're responsible, you can get ahead. That's what we want. We want to make sure the young dad on the factory floor has a shot to make it into the corner suite or at least see his daughter make it there some day. <p>That's why I ran for office. That's what has driven every policy that we've initiated this year and since the advent of my Presidency. Policies that create more jobs rebuilding America. Policies to ease the student loan burden. Policies to raise wages for workers and make sure that women are being paid fairly on the job; and creating opportunities for paid leave for working families and support for child care. <p>These are all policies that have two things in common. Number one, they'd all help working families. And frankly, number two, they're being blocked or ignored by Republicans in Congress. So I've said to my team, look, any time Congress wants to do work with me to help working families, I'm right there. The door is always open. More than that, I'm going to&mdash;I'll go to them. I'll wash their car&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;walk their dog. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, I'm ready to work with them any time that they want to pursue policies that help working families. But where they're doing so little or nothing at all to help working families, then we've got to find ways, as an administration, to take action that's going to help. <p>And so far this year, we've made sure that more women have the protection they need to fight for fair pay in the workplace, because I believe when women succeed, America succeeds. We've acted to give millions of Americans the chance to cap their student loan payments at 10 percent of their income. I don't want young people to be so saddled with debt that they can't get started in life. <p>We've acted on our own to make sure Federal contractors can't discriminate based on sexual orientation or gender identity, because you shouldn't be fired because of who you love. If you're doing the job, you should be treated fairly and judged on your own merits. <p>We acted to require Federal contractors to pay their workers a fair wage of $10.10 an hour. And we've gone out, and we've worked with States and cities and business owners to join us on our $10.10 campaign, and more and more are joining us, because folks agree that if you work full time in this country, you shouldn't be raising your family in poverty. That's a pretty simple principle that we all believe in. <p>So the American people are doing their job. I've been traveling around the country meeting them. They're working hard. They're meeting their responsibilities. Here at the&mdash;in the executive branch, we're doing our job, trying to find ways in which we can help working families. Think about how much further along we'd be if Congress would do its job. <p>Instead, the big event last night, it wasn't a vote on the minimum wage. [<i>Laughter</i>] It wasn't a vote on immigration reform, strengthening the borders. It wasn't a vote on family leave. What did they have a vote on? [<i>Laughter</i>] They got together in the House of Representatives, the Republicans, and voted to sue me for taking the actions that I&mdash;that we are doing to help families. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>One of the main objections that's the basis of this suit is us making a temporary modification to the health care law that they said needed to be modified. [<i>Laughter</i>] They&mdash;so they criticized a provision; we modify it to make it easier for business to transition, and that's the basis for their suit. <p>Now, you could say that, all right, this is a harmless political stunt, except it wastes America's time. You guys are all paying for it as taxpayers. It's not very productive. But it's not going to stop me from doing what I think needs to be done in order to help families all across this country. <p>So we've got too much work to do. And I said to Speaker Boehner, tell your caucus the best way to avoid me acting on my own is work with me to actually do something. Then you don't have to worry about it. We're not going to stop, and if they're not going to lift a finger to help working Americans, then I'm going to work twice as hard to help working Americans. They can join me if they want. I hope they do. But at least they should stop standing in the way of America's success. We've got too much to do. <p>So today I'm taking another action, one that protects workers and taxpayers alike. Every year, our Government signs contracts with private companies for everything from fighter jets to flapjacks, computers to pencils. And we expect our tax dollars to be spent wisely on these contracts, to get what we pay for on time, on budget. And when companies that receive Federal contracts employ about 28 million Americans&mdash;about one in five workers in America work for a company that has a Federal contract&mdash;we also expect that our tax dollars are being used to ensure that these jobs are good jobs. <p>Our tax dollars shouldn't go to companies that violate workplace laws. They shouldn't go to companies that violate worker rights. If a company is going to receive taxpayer money, it should have safe workplaces. It should pay its workers the wages they've earned. It should provide the medical leave workers are entitled to. It should not discriminate against workers. But one study found that more than one in four companies that have poor records on these areas also still get contracts from the Federal Government. And another study found that the worst violators are also the ones who end up missing performance or cost or schedule targets or even overbill the Government, ripping off the taxpayers altogether, which makes sense. I mean, if you think about it, if you got a company that isn't treating its workers with integrity, isn't taking safety measures seriously, isn't taking overtime laws seriously, then they're probably cutting corners in other areas too. <p>And I want to be clear, the vast majority of the companies that contract with our Government, they play by the rules. They live up to the right workplace standards. But some don't. And I don't want those who don't to be getting a contract and getting a competitive advantage over the folks who are doing the right thing. Right? That's not fair. <p>Because the ones that don't play by the rules, they're not just failing their workers, they're failing all of us. It's a bad deal for taxpayers when we've got to pay for poor performance or sloppy work. Responsible companies that follow the law are likelier to have workers and workplaces that provide a better return for our tax dollar. They should not have to compete on an unfair playing field with companies that undercut them by breaking the law. In a race to the bottom, nobody wins. <p>So over the past few years, my administration has taken steps to make the contracting process smarter. But many of the people who award contracts don't always have the information that they need to make sure contracts go to responsible companies. So the Executive order I'm signing today is going to do a few things. <p>Number one, it will hold corporations accountable by requiring potential contractors to disclose labor law violations from the past 3 years before they can receive a contract. It's going to crack down on the worst violators by giving agencies better tools to evaluate egregious or repeated offenses. <p>It will give workers better and clearer information on their paychecks so they can be sure they're getting paid what they've owed. It will give more workers who may have been sexually assaulted or had their civil rights violated their day in court. <p>It will ease compliance burdens for business owners around the country by streamlining all types of reporting requirements across the Federal Government. So this is a first step in a series of actions to make it easier for companies, including small businesses, to do business with the Government. So we're going to protect responsible companies that play by the rules, make it easier for them, try to reduce the paperwork, the burdens that they have. They'll basically check a box that says they don't have these violations. We want to make it easier for good corporate citizens to do business with us. <p>But&mdash;and by the way, for companies that have violations, our emphasis is not going to be on punishments. It is to give them a chance to follow good workplace practices and come into compliance with the law. If you want to do business with the United States of America, you've got to respect our workers, you've got to respect our taxpayers. <p>And we'll spend a lot of time working with and listening to business owners so we can implement this thoughtfully and make it manageable for everybody. But the goal here is to make sure this action raises standards across the economy; encourages contractors to adopt better practices for all their employees, not just those working on Federal contracts; give responsible businesses that play by the rules a fairer shot to compete for business; streamline the process; improve wages and working conditions for folks who work hard every single day to provide for their families and contribute to our country. <p>And even though it is an executive action, I want to acknowledge and thank the Members of Congress who support it and who always stand up for America's workers. And most of them are stuck at Capitol Hill, but I just want to mention their names anyway: Tom Harkin; Rosa DeLauro; Keith Ellison is here; Raul Grijalva; Eleanor Holmes Norton. They've all been working on these issues, so I want to thank those Members of Congress. <p>The Executive order I sign today, like all the other actions I've taken, are not going to fix everything immediately. If I had the power to raise the Federal minimum wage on my own or enact fair pay and paid leave for every worker on my own or make college more affordable on my own, I would have done so already. If I could do all that, I would have gotten everything done, like, in my first 2 years. [<i>Laughter</i>] Because these policies make sense. But even though I can't do all of it, that shouldn't stop us from doing what we can. That's what these policies will do. <p>And I'm going to keep on not just working with Democrats, but also reach out to Republicans to get things moving faster for the middle class. We can do a lot more. We need a Congress that's willing to get things done. We don't have that right now. In the meantime, I'm going to do whatever I can, wherever I can, whenever I can, to keep this country's promise alive for more and more of the American people. <p>So thank you all. We're going to just keep on at this thing, chipping away. And I'm confident that when we look back, we'll see that these kinds of executive actions build some of the momentum and give people the confidence and the hope that ultimately leads to broad-based changes that we need to make sure that this economy works for everybody. All right? <p>Thank you so much. I'm going to sign this Executive order. <p>[<i>At this point, the President signed the Executive order.</i>] <p>There you go.\" "
"183" "\"Hi, everybody. My top priority as President is doing everything I can to create more jobs and more opportunities for hard-working families to get ahead. <p>On Friday, we learned that our economy created over 200,000 new jobs in July. That's on top of about 300,000 new jobs in June. We're now in a 6-month streak with at least 200,000 new jobs each month. That hasn't happened since 1997. All told, our businesses have created 9.9 million jobs over the past 53 months. And that's the longest streak of private sector job creation in our history. <p>Because of you&mdash;because of your hard work and determination&mdash;America has recovered faster and come farther than almost any other advanced country on Earth. The economy is clearly getting stronger. Things are clearly getting better. And the decisions we make now can keep things moving in that direction. <p>That's what's at stake right now: making sure our economy works for every working American, making sure that people who work hard can get ahead. That's why I've been pushing for commonsense ideas like rebuilding our infrastructure in a way that supports millions of good jobs and helps our businesses compete. That's why I've been pushing to raise the minimum wage; to make it easier for working folks to pay off their student loans. That's why I've been pushing for fair pay and paid leave. <p>These policies have two things in common. All of them would help working families feel more stable and secure. And unfortunately, all of them have been blocked or ignored by Republicans in Congress. <p>And that's why my administration keeps taking what actions we can on our own to help working families, because Congress is doing so little for working families. House Republicans actually got together this week and voted to sue me for taking actions on my own. And then they left town for the month without settling a bunch of unfinished business that matters to working families across America. <p>The bottom line is this. We've come a long way these past 5&frac12; years. Our challenges are nowhere near as daunting as they were back then. But imagine how much farther along our economy would be&mdash;how much stronger our country would be&mdash;if Congress would just do its job. <p>I'll never stop trying to work with both parties to get things moving faster for the middle class and everybody who's working to get into the middle class. And I could use your help. If you see your Member of Congress around home this month, tell him or her what's on your mind. Ask them why they haven't passed bills to raise the minimum wage or help with student loans or enact fair pay for women. <p>And when they return from vacation next month, instead of trying to pass partisan bills on party lines, hopefully, we can come together with the sense of common purpose that you expect. And in the meantime, I will not stop and will never stop doing whatever I can, whenever I can, not only to make sure that our economy succeeds, but that folks like you succeed. Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"184" "\"On behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the White House. This city, this house, has welcomed foreign envoys and leaders for more than two centuries. But never before have we hosted a dinner at the White House like this, with so many Presidents, so many Prime Ministers all at once. So we are grateful for all the leaders who are in attendance. We are grateful to the spouses. I think the men will agree that the women outshine us tonight in the beautiful colors of Africa. <p>Tonight we are making history, and it's an honor to have all of you here. <p>And I stand before you as the President of the United States and a proud American. I also stand before you as the son of a man from Africa. The blood of Africa runs through our family. And so for us, the bonds between our countries, our continents, are deeply personal. <p>We're grateful for the ties of family. Of all the incredible moments of our trips to Africa, one of the most memorable was being able to bring Michelle, and later our little girls, to my father's hometown in Kenya, where we were embraced by so many relatives. <p>We've walked the steps of a painful past&mdash;in Ghana, at Cape Coast Castle; in Senegal, at Gor&eacute;e Island&mdash;standing with our daughters in those doors of no return through which so many Africans passed in chains. We'll never forget bringing our daughters to Robben Island, to the cell from which Madiba showed the unconquerable strength and dignity of an African heart. <p>We've been inspired by Africans, ordinary Africans doing extraordinary things: farmers boosting their yields, health workers saving lives from HIV/AIDS, advocates standing up for justice and the rule of law, courageous women asserting their rights, entrepreneurs creating jobs, African peacekeepers risking their lives to save the innocent. <p>And both of us stand in awe of the extraordinary young Africans that we've met, not only across Africa, but, most recently, here in Washington, just last week, when we hosted our Mandela Washington Fellows from many of your countries. And those young people show the world that Africa has the talent and the drive to forge a new future. <p>These are the tides of history, and the ties of family, that bring us together this week. These are the citizens who look to us to build a future worthy of their dreams, especially those who dream of giving their children a future without war or injustice, without poverty or disease. They are in our prayers tonight. <p>And also with us are the words of a song, \\"New Africa,\\" that have inspired so many across the continent, and that Michelle and I first heard last year in Senegal: <p>'Come together, New Africa <p>Work together <p>Keep on working, for Africa' <p>And so I propose a toast to the new Africa&mdash;the Africa that is rising and so full of promise&mdash;and to our shared task to keep on working for the peace and prosperity and justice that all our people seek and that all our people so richly deserve. <p>Cheers. [<i>At this point, the President offered a toast.</i>] <p>Enjoy your dinner, everybody.\" "
"185" "\"Good morning, everyone. Michelle and I were honored to host you and your wonderful spouses at dinner last night. I hope people didn't stay out too late. The evening was a chance to celebrate the bonds between our peoples. And this morning we continue our work, and it's my privilege to welcome you to this first-ever U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit. <p>Let me also thank our Secretary of State, John Kerry, and everybody here at the State Department who's hosting us today. John and his team are doing outstanding work deepening our partnership with so many of your nations. So, John, thank you for your outstanding work. <p>I want to begin by welcoming President Conde of Guinea and noting that two leaders were not able to join us, President Sirleaf of Liberia and President Koroma of Sierra Leone. We are grateful for the presence of their delegations, even as these countries are focused on a very difficult situation back home. And on behalf of all of us here today, our thoughts and prayers are with those who've been affected by the Ebola outbreak, especially those who've lost loved ones. <p>The United States and our international partners will continue to do whatever we can to help our African partners respond to this crisis and to stand with the people of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. In their histories, they've overcome great challenges, and they are drawing on that same spirit of strength and resilience today. <p>So we've come together this week because, even as the continent faces significant challenges, as I said last night, I believe a new Africa is emerging. With some of the world's fastest growing economies, a growing middle class, and the youngest and fastest growing population on Earth, Africa will help shape the world as never before. <p>Moreover, Africa's progress is being led by Africans, including leaders represented here today. More governments are embracing economic reforms, attracting record levels of investment. Gains in development, increasing agricultural production, declining rates of infectious diseases are being driven by African plans. African security forces and African peacekeepers are risking their lives to meet regional threats. A new generation of young Africans is making its voice heard. <p>Africa's rise means opportunity for all of us, including the opportunity to transform the relationship between the United States and Africa. As I said in Cape Town last year, it's time for a new model of partnership between America and Africa: a partnership of equals that focuses on African capacity to solve problems and on Africa's capacity to grow. And that's why we're here. <p>And to my fellow leaders, I want to thank you and your teams for helping us to shape our agenda today. Our work can build on the valuable contributions already made this week by civil society groups, the private sector, young Africans, and&mdash;at our first session of this summit&mdash;our faith communities, which do so much to sustain the U.S.-Africa relationship. Different though they may be, our faith traditions remind us of the inherent dignity of every human being and that our work as nations must be rooted in empathy and compassion for each other, as brothers and as sisters. Now, today is an opportunity to focus on three broad areas where we can make progress together. <p>Number one, we have the opportunity to expand trade that creates jobs. The new trade deals and investments I announced yesterday are an important step. And today we can focus on what we can do, as governments, to accelerate that of investment: economic and regulatory reforms, regional integration, and development so that growth is broad based, especially among women, who must be empowered for economies to truly flourish. <p>Second, we have the opportunity to strengthen the governance upon which economic growth and free societies depend. Today we can focus on the ingredients of progress: rule of law, open government, accountable and transparent institutions, strong civil societies, and respect for the universal human rights of all people. <p>And finally, we have the opportunity to deepen our security cooperation against common threats. As I said, African security forces and African peacekeepers are in the lead across the continent. As your partner, the United States is proud to support these efforts. And today we can focus on how we can continue to strengthen Africa's capacity to meet transitional threats&mdash;transnational threats and, in so doing, make all of our nations more secure. <p>So, in short, we are here not just to talk. We are here to take action: concrete steps to build on Africa's progress and forge the partnerships of equals that we seek; tangible steps to deliver more prosperity, more security, and more justice to our citizens. So to my fellow leaders, again, thank you so much for being here. I look forward to our work together today. <p>And at this point, I want to invite President Aziz of Mauritania, the current Chairman of the African Union, to say a few words. <p>President Aziz.\" "
"186" "\"Hello, Fort Belvoir! Everybody, have a seat. I think I'm going to take Sergeant Major McGruder on the road. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm just going to have him introduce me wherever I go. [<i>Laughter</i>] He got me excited, and I'm being&mdash;I get introduced all the time. So thank you, James, for your incredible service to our country. Give James a big round of applause. <p>I also want to say a big thanks to America's new Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Bob McDonald, who is here. Stand up, Bob. As some of you may know, Bob headed up one of the biggest, most successful companies in the world. But he also was a West Point grad, also a Ranger who served valiantly on behalf of his country. And this a labor of love for him, and he has hit the ground running. He's heading out to VA hospitals and clinics around the country, starting with Phoenix tomorrow. So thank you, Bob, for accepting this charge and this challenge and making sure that we're doing right by our veterans. I know you're going to do a great job. [<i>Applause</i>] Really proud of him. <p>I want to thank all the Members of Congress who are here today, and I especially want to thank those who led the fight to give Bob and the VA more of the resources and flexibility that they need to make sure every veteran has access to the care and benefits that they have earned: Senator Bernie Sanders, Senators Richard Burr, Representative Mike Michaud, Representative Jeff Miller. Give them a big round of applause. Thank you. Thanks for the good work. <p>And we are all grateful to our outstanding veterans service organizations for all the work that they do on behalf of our veterans and their families. So thank you very much to all the veterans service organizations. Most of all, I want to thank General Buchanan and Sergeant Major Turnbull and all of you who serve here at Fort Belvoir. <p>For nearly a century, this base has helped keep America strong and secure. Seventy years ago, troops from here&mdash;the 29th Infantry Division, the Blue and Gray&mdash;were some of the first to storm Omaha Beach. And in recent years, many of you have deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. And you've risked your lives on multiple tours to defend our Nation. And as a country, we have a sacred obligation to serve you as well as you've served us, an obligation that doesn't end with your tour of duty. <p>Every day, hundreds of thousands of dedicated public servants at the VA help us honor that commitment. At VA hospitals across America, you've got doctors and nurses who are delivering world-class care to America's veterans. You've got millions of veterans and their families who are profoundly grateful for the good work that is done at the VA. And as Commander in Chief, I'm grateful too. <p>But over the last few months, we've discovered some inexcusable misconduct at some VA health care facilities: stories of our veterans denied the care they needed, long wait times being covered up, cooking the books. This is wrong. It was outrageous. And working together, we set out to fix it and do right by our veterans across the board, no matter how long it took. <p>And we've already taken the first steps to change the way the VA does business. We've held people accountable for misconduct. Some have already been relieved of their duties, and investigations are ongoing. We've reached out to more than 215,000 veterans so far to make sure that we're getting them off wait lists and into clinics both inside and outside the VA system. <p>We're moving ahead with urgent reforms, including stronger management and leadership and oversight. And we're instituting a critical culture of accountability, rebuilding our leadership team, starting at the top with Secretary McDonald. And one of his first acts is that he's directed all VA health care facilities to hold town halls to hear directly from the veterans that they serve to make sure that we're hearing honest assessments about what's going on. <p>Now, in a few minutes, we'll take another step forward when I sign into law the VA reform bill that was passed overwhelmingly, with bipartisan majorities, and that doesn't happen often in Congress. It's a good deal. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>This bill covers a lot of ground, from expanding survivor benefits and educational opportunities to improving care for veterans struggling with traumatic brain injury and for victims of sexual assault. But today I want to focus on the ways this bill will help us ensure that veterans have access to the care that they've earned. <p>First of all, this will give the VA more of the resources that it needs. It will help the VA hire more doctors and more nurses and staff more clinics. As a new generation of veterans returns home from war and transitions into civilian life, we have to make sure the VA system can keep pace with that new demand. Keep in mind that I have increased funding for the VA since I came into office by extraordinary amounts. But we also have extraordinary numbers of veterans coming home. And so the demand, even though we've increased the VA budget, is still higher than the resources that we've got. This bill helps to address that. <p>Second, for veterans who can't get timely care through the VA, this bill will help them get the care they need someplace else. And this is particularly important for veterans who are in more remote areas, in rural areas. If you live more than 40 miles from a VA facility or if VA doctors can't see you within a reasonable amount of time, you'll have the chance to see a doctor outside the VA system. <p>Now finally, we're giving the VA Secretary more authority to hold people accountable. We've got to give Bob the authority so that he can move quickly to remove senior executives who fail to meet the standards of conduct and competence that the American people demand. If you engage in an unethical practice, if you cover up a serious problem, you should be fired. Period. It shouldn't be that difficult. And if you blow the whistle on an unethical practice or bring a problem to the attention of higher-ups, you should be thanked. You should be protected for doing the right thing. You shouldn't be ignored&mdash;you shouldn't be ignored&mdash;and you certainly shouldn't be punished. <p>\\"To care for him [or her] who shall have borne the battle.\\" That's the heart of the VA's motto. That's what the bill I'm about to sign will help us achieve. But I want to be clear about something: This will not and cannot be the end of our effort. Implementing this law will take time. It's going to require focus on the part of all of us. And even as we focus on the urgent reforms we need at the VA right now, particularly around wait lists and the health care system, we can't lose sight of our long-term goals for our servicemembers and our veterans. <p>The good news is, we've cut the disability claims backlog by more than half. But let's now eliminate the backlog. Let's get rid of it. The good news is, we've poured major resources into improving mental health care. But now let's make sure our veterans actually get the care they need when they need it. The good news is, we've helped to get thousands of homeless veterans off the street, made an unprecedented effort to end veterans homelessness. We should have zero tolerance for that. But we've got to&mdash;still more work to do in cities and towns across America to get more veterans into the homes they deserve. <p>We've helped more than a million veterans and their spouses and children go to college through the post-9/11 GI bill. But now we've got to help even more of them earn their educations and make sure that they're getting a good bargain in the schools they enroll in. <p>We've rallied companies to hire hundreds of thousands of veterans and their spouses. That's the good news. With the help of Jill Biden and Michelle Obama, two pretty capable women&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;they know what they're doing, and nobody says no to them, including me. [<i>Laughter</i>] But now we've got to help more of our highly skilled veterans find careers in this new economy. <p>So America has to do right by all who serve under our proud flag. And Congress needs to do more also. I urge the Senate, once again, to finally confirm my nominee for Assistant Secretary for Policy at the VA, Linda Schwartz; my nominee to lead the Board of Veterans' Appeals, Constance Tobias; my nominee for CFO, Helen Tierney. Each of them have been waiting for months for a yes-or-no vote, in Constance's case for more than a year. <p>They're ready to serve. They're ready to get to work. It's not that hard. [<i>Laughter</i>] Didn't used to be this hard to just go ahead and get somebody confirmed who is well qualified. Nobody says they're not. It's just, the Senate doesn't seem to move very fast. As soon as the Senate gets back in September, they should act to put these outstanding public servants in place. Our veterans don't have time for politics. They need these public servants on the job right now. <p>So let me wrap up by saying 2 months ago, I had the chance to spend some time with some of America's oldest veterans at Omaha Beach. Some of you may have seen on television the celebration, the commemoration of those incredible days, of the 70th anniversary of D-day. And this is my second visit to democracy's beachhead. It's the second time I had gone as President. And it's a place where it's impossible not to be moved by the courage and the sacrifice of free men and women who volunteer to lay down their lives for people they've never met, ideals that they can't live without. That's why they're willing to do these things. <p>And some of these folks that you met, they were 18 at the time. Some of them were lying about their age. They were 16, landing either at the beach or sometimes behind the lines. The casualty rates were unbelievable. Being there brought back memories of my own grandfather, who marched in Patton's army, and then came home. And like so many veterans of his generation, they went to school and got married and raised families. And he eventually helped to raise me. <p>And on that visit to Normandy, I brought some of today's servicemembers with me because I wanted to introduce them to the veterans of D-day and to show the veterans of D-day that their legacy is in good hands, that there's a direct line between the sacrifices then and the sacrifices that folks have made in remote places today. Because in more than a decade of war, today's men and women in uniform&mdash;all of you&mdash;you've met every mission we've asked of you. <p>Today, our troops continue to serve and risk their lives in Afghanistan. It continues to be a difficult and dangerous mission, as we were tragically reminded again this week in the attack that injured a number of our coalition troops and took the life of a dedicated American soldier, Major General Harold Greene. Our prayers are with the Greene family, as they are with all the Gold Star families and those who have sacrificed so much for our Nation. But 4 months from now, our combat mission in Afghanistan will be complete. Our longest war will come to an honorable end. In the years to come, many from this generation will step out of uniform, and their legacy will be secure. But whether or not this country properly repays their heroism, properly repays their patriotism, their service, and their sacrifice, that's in our hands. <p>I'm committed to seeing that we fulfill that commitment. Because the men and women of this generation, this 9/11 generation of servicemembers, are the leaders we need for our time, as community leaders and business leaders, I hope maybe some leaders in our politics as well. <p>From the greatest generation to the 9/11 generation, America's heroes have answered the call to serve. I have no greater honor than serving as your President and Commander in Chief. And I have no greater privilege than the chance to help make sure that our country keeps the promises that we've made to everybody who signs up to serve. And as long as I hold this office, we're going to spend each and every day working to do right by you and your families. I'm grateful to you. <p>God bless you. God bless America. With that, I am going to sign this bill. Thank you very much, everybody. <p>All right. Squeeze in, everybody. This is good work. <p>[<i>At this point, the President signed the bill</i>.] <p>Really appreciate it. It's a good piece of legislation, and it will help. Thank you.\" "
"187" "\"Good evening. Today I authorized two operations in Iraq: targeted airstrikes to protect our American personnel and a humanitarian effort to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians who are trapped on a mountain without food and water and facing almost certain death. Let me explain the actions we're taking and why. <p>First, I said in June, as the terrorist group ISIL began an advance across Iraq, that the United States would be prepared to take targeted military action in Iraq if and when we determined that the situation required it. In recent days, these terrorists have continued to move across Iraq and have neared the city of Erbil, where American diplomats and civilians serve at our consulate and American military personnel advise Iraqi forces. <p>To stop the advance on Erbil, I've directed our military to take targeted strikes against ISIL terrorist convoys should they move toward the city. We intend to stay vigilant and take action if these terrorist forces threaten our personnel or facilities anywhere in Iraq, including our consulate in Erbil and our Embassy in Baghdad. We're also providing urgent assistance to Iraqi Government and Kurdish forces so they can more effectively wage the fight against ISIL. <p>Second, at the request of the Iraqi Government, we've begun operations to help save Iraqi civilians stranded on the mountain. As ISIL has marched across Iraq, it has waged a ruthless campaign against innocent Iraqis. And these terrorists have been especially barbaric towards religious minorities, including Christian and Yazidis, a small and ancient religious sect. Countless Iraqis have been displaced, and chilling reports describe ISIL militants rounding up families, conducting mass executions, and enslaving Yazidi women. <p>In recent days, Yazidi women, men, and children from the area of Sinjar have fled for their lives. And thousands&mdash;perhaps tens of thousands&mdash;are now hiding high up on the mountain, with little but the clothes on their backs. They're without food; they're without water. People are starving, and children are dying of thirst. Meanwhile, ISIL forces below have called for the systematic destruction of the entire Yazidi people, which would constitute genocide. So these innocent families are faced with a horrible choice: descend the mountain and be slaughtered or stay and slowly die of thirst and hunger. <p>Now, I've said before, the United States cannot and should not intervene every time there's a crisis in the world. So let me be clear about why we must act and act now. When we face a situation like we do on that mountain, with innocent people facing the prospect of violence on a horrific scale; when we have a mandate to help, in this case, a request from the Iraqi Government; and when we have the unique capabilities to help avert a massacre, then I believe the United States of America cannot turn a blind eye. We can act carefully and responsibly to prevent a potential act of genocide. That's what we're doing on that mountain. <p>I've therefore authorized targeted airstrikes, if necessary, to help forces in Iraq as they fight to break the siege of Mount Sinjar and protect the civilians trapped there. Already, American aircraft have begun conducting humanitarian airdrops of food and water to help these desperate men, women, and children survive. Earlier this week, one Iraqi in the area cried to the world, \\"There is no one coming to help.\\" Well, today America is coming to help. We're also consulting with other countries&mdash;and the United Nations&mdash;who have called for action to address this humanitarian crisis. <p>I know that many of you are rightly concerned about any American military action in Iraq, even limited strikes like these. I understand that. I ran for this office in part to end our war in Iraq and welcome our troops home, and that's what we've done. As Commander in Chief, I will not allow the United States to be dragged into fighting another war in Iraq. And so even as we support Iraqis as they take the fight to these terrorists, American combat troops will not be returning to fight in Iraq, because there is no American military solution to the larger crisis in Iraq. The only lasting solution is reconciliation among Iraqi communities and stronger Iraqi security forces. <p>However, we can and should support moderate forces who can bring stability to Iraq. So even as we carry out these two missions, we will continue to pursue a broader strategy that empowers Iraqis to confront this crisis. Iraqi leaders need to come together and forge a new Government that represents the legitimate interests of all Iraqis and that can fight back against the threats like ISIL. Iraqis have named a new President, a new Speaker of Parliament, and are seeking consensus on a new Prime Minister. This is the progress that needs to continue in order to reverse the momentum of the terrorists who prey on Iraq's divisions. <p>Once Iraq has a new Government, the United States will work with it and other countries in the region to provide increased support to deal with this humanitarian crisis and counterterrorism challenge. None of Iraq's neighbors have an interest in this terrible suffering or instability. <p>And so we'll continue to work with our friends and allies to help refugees get the shelter and food and water they so desperately need and to help Iraqis push back against ISIL. The several hundred American advisers that I ordered to Iraq will continue to assess what more we can do to help train, advise, and support Iraqi forces going forward. And just as I consulted Congress on the decisions I made today, we will continue to do so going forward. <p>My fellow Americans, the world is confronted by many challenges. And while America has never been able to right every wrong, America has made the world a more secure and prosperous place. And our leadership is necessary to underwrite the global security and prosperity that our children and our grandchildren will depend upon. We do so by adhering to a set of core principles: We do whatever is necessary to protect our people, we support our allies when they're in danger, we lead coalitions of countries to uphold international norms, and we strive to stay true to the fundamental values&mdash;the desire to live with basic freedom and dignity&mdash;that is common to human beings wherever they are. That's why people all over the world look to the United States of America to lead. And that's why we do. <p>So let me close by assuring you that there is no decision that I take more seriously than the use of military force. Over the last several years, we have brought the vast majority of our troops home from Iraq and Afghanistan. And I've been careful to resist calls to turn, time and again, to our military, because America has other tools in our arsenal than our military. We can also lead with the power of our diplomacy, our economy, and our ideals. <p>But when the lives of American citizens are at risk, we will take action. That's my responsibility as Commander in Chief. And when many thousands of innocent civilians are faced with the danger of being wiped out, and we have the capacity to do something about it, we will take action. That is our responsibility as Americans. That's a hallmark of American leadership. That's who we are. So tonight we give thanks to our men and women in uniform, especially our brave pilots and crews over Iraq who are protecting our fellow Americans and saving the lives of so many men, women, and children that they will never meet. They represent American leadership at its best. As a nation, we should be proud of them and of our country's enduring commitment to uphold our own security and the dignity of our fellow human beings. <p>God bless our Armed Forces, and God bless the United States of America.\" "
"188" "\"This week, I authorized two operations in Iraq. First, I directed our military to take action to protect our American diplomats and military advisers serving in the city of Erbil. In recent days, terrorist forces neared the city. Thursday night I made it clear that if they attempt to advance further, our military would respond with targeted strikes. That's what we've done. And if necessary, that's what we will continue to do. We have Americans serving across Iraq, including our Embassy in Baghdad, and we'll do whatever is needed to protect our people. <p>Second, we've begun a humanitarian effort to help those Iraqi civilians trapped on that mountain. The terrorists that have taken over parts of Iraq have been especially brutal to religious minorities: rounding up families, executing men, enslaving women, and threatening the systematic destruction of an entire religious community, which would be genocide. <p>The thousands&mdash;perhaps tens of thousands&mdash;of Iraqi men, women, and children who fled to that mountain were starving and dying of thirst. The food and water we airdropped will help them survive. I've also approved targeted American airstrikes to help Iraqi forces break the siege and rescue these families. Earlier this week, one anguished Iraqi in this area cried to the world, \\"There is no one coming to help.\\" Today, America is helping. <p>The United States cannot and should not intervene every time there's a crisis in the world. But when there's a situation like the one on this mountain&mdash;when countless innocent people are facing a massacre and when we have the ability to prevent it&mdash;the United States can't just look away. That's not who we are. We're Americans. We act. We lead. And that's what we're going to do on that mountain. As one American who wrote to me yesterday said, \\"It's the right thing to do.\\" <p>As Commander in Chief, I will not allow the United States to be dragged into fighting another war in Iraq. American combat troops will not be returning to fight in Iraq, because there's no American military solution to the larger crisis there. <p>What we will do is continue our broader strategy in Iraq. We will protect our citizens. We will work with the international community to address this humanitarian crisis. We'll help prevent these terrorists from having a permanent safe haven from which to attack America. And we'll continue to urge Iraqi communities to reconcile, come together, and fight back against these terrorists so the people of Iraq have the opportunity for a better future, the opportunity for which so many Americans gave their lives in Iraq in a long, hard war. <p>Today we salute our brave men and women in uniform, especially our courageous pilots and crews over Iraq. They're protecting our fellow Americans. They're helping save the lives of innocent people on a mountain, people who today know that there's a country called America that cares for them too and that is willing to stand up, not just for our own security, but for the dignity and freedom that belongs to all people.\" "
"189" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. I wanted to provide an update on recent developments in Iraq, including some important steps forward as Iraqis form a new Government. <p>Over the past few days, American forces have successfully conducted targeted airstrikes to prevent terrorist forces from advancing on the city of Erbil and to protect American civilians there. Kurdish forces on the ground continue to defend their city, and we've stepped up military advice and assistance to Iraqi and Kurdish forces as they wage the fight against ISIL. <p>At the same time, we've continued our daily humanitarian efforts to provide lifesaving assistance to the men, women, and children stranded on Mount Sinjar and deployed a USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team to help. Some have begun to escape their perch on that mountain, and we're working with international partners to develop options to bring them to safety. I want to thank in particular the United Kingdom, France, and other countries working with us to provide much needed assistance to the Iraqi people. And meanwhile, our aircraft remain positioned to strike any terrorist forces around the mountain who threaten the safety of these families. <p>This advances the limited military objectives we've outlined in Iraq: protecting American citizens, providing advice and assistance to Iraqi forces as they battle these terrorists, and joining with international partners to provide humanitarian aid. But as I said when I authorized these operations, there is no American military solution to the larger crisis in Iraq. The only lasting solution is for Iraqis to come together and form an inclusive Government, one that represents the legitimate interests of all Iraqis and one that can unify the country's fight against ISIL. <p>Today Iraq took a promising step forward in this critical effort. Last month, the Iraqi people named a new President. Today President Masum named a new Prime Minister-designate, Dr. Haider al-Abadi. Under the Iraqi Constitution, this is an important step towards forming a new Government that can unite Iraq's different communities. <p>Earlier today Vice President Biden and I called Dr. Abadi to congratulate him and to urge him to form a new Cabinet as quickly as possible, one that's inclusive of all Iraqis and one that represents all Iraqis. I pledged our support to him, as well as to President Masum and Speaker Jabouri, as they work together to form this Government. Meanwhile, I urge all Iraqi political leaders to work peacefully through the political process in the days ahead. <p>Now, this new Iraqi leadership has a difficult task. It has to regain the confidence of its citizens by governing inclusively and by taking steps to demonstrate its resolve. The United States stands ready to support a Government that addresses the needs and grievances of all Iraqi people. We are also ready to work with other countries in the region to deal with the humanitarian crises and counterterrorism challenge in Iraq. Mobilizing that support will be easier once this new Government is in place. <p>Now, these have been difficult days in Iraq, a country that's faced so many challenges in its recent history. And I'm sure that will&mdash;there will be difficult days ahead. But just as the United States will remain vigilant against the threat posed to our people by ISIL, we stand ready to partner with Iraq in its fight against these terrorist forces. Without question, that effort will be advanced if Iraqis continue to build on today's progress and come together to support a new and inclusive Government. <p>Thanks, everybody.\" "
"190" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. This sound system's really powerful. Today I'd like to update the American people on two issues that I've been monitoring closely these last several days. <p>First of all, we continue to make progress in carrying out our targeted military operations in Iraq. Last week, I authorized two limited missions: protecting our people and facilities inside of Iraq and a humanitarian operation to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians stranded on a mountain. <p>A week ago, we assessed that many thousands of Yazidi men, women, and children had abandoned their positions to take refuge on Mount Sinjar in a desperate attempt to avoid slaughter. We also knew that ISIL terrorists were killing and enslaving Yazidi civilians in their custody and laying siege to the mountain. Without food or water, they faced a terrible choice: starve on the mountain or be slaughtered on the ground. That's when America came to help. <p>Over the last week, the U.S. military conducted humanitarian air drops every night, delivering more than 114,000 meals and 35,000 gallons of fresh water. We were joined in that effort by the United Kingdom, and other allies pledged their support. Our military was able to successfully strike ISIL targets around the mountain, which improved conditions for civilians to evacuate the mountain safely. <p>Yesterday a small team of Americans&mdash;military and civilian&mdash;completed their review of the conditions on the mountain. They found that food and water have been reaching those in need and that thousands of people have been evacuating safely each and every night. The civilians who remain continue to leave, aided by Kurdish forces and Yazidis who are helping to facilitate the safe passage of their families. So the bottom line is, is that the situation on the mountain has greatly improved, and Americans should be very proud of our efforts. <p>Because of the skill and professionalism of our military&mdash;and the generosity of our people&mdash;we broke the ISIL siege of Mount Sinjar, we helped vulnerable people reach safety, and we helped save many innocent lives. Because of these efforts, we do not expect there to be an additional operation to evacuate people off the mountain, and it's unlikely that we're going to need to continue humanitarian air drops on the mountain. The majority of the military personnel who conducted the assessment will be leaving Iraq in the coming days. And I just want to say that as Commander in Chief, I could not be prouder of the men and women of our military who carried out this humanitarian operation almost flawlessly. I'm very grateful to them, and I know that those who were trapped on that mountain are extraordinarily grateful as well. <p>Now, the situation remains dire for Iraqis subjected to ISIL's terror throughout the country, and this includes minorities like Yazidis and Iraqi Christians; it also includes many Sunnis, Shia, and Kurds. We're going to be working with our international partners to provide humanitarian assistance to those who are suffering in northern Iraq wherever we have capabilities and we can carry out effective missions like the one we carried out on Mount Sinjar without committing combat troops on the ground. <p>We obviously feel a great urge to provide some humanitarian relief to the situation, and I've been very encouraged by the interest of our international partners in helping on these kinds of efforts as well. We will continue air strikes to protect our people and facilities in Iraq. We have increased the delivery of military assistance to Iraqi and Kurdish forces fighting ISIL on the front lines. <p>And, perhaps most importantly, we are urging Iraqis to come together to turn the tide against ISIL&mdash;above all, by seizing the enormous opportunity of forming a new, inclusive Government under the leadership of Prime Minister-designate Abadi. I had a chance to speak to Prime Minister-designate Abadi a few days ago, and he spoke about the need for the kind of inclusive Government, a Government that speaks to all the people of Iraq, that is needed right now. He still has a challenging task in putting a Government together, but we are modestly hopeful that the Iraqi Government situation is moving in the right direction. <p>Now, second, I want to address something that's been in the news over the last couple of days, and that's the situation in Ferguson, Missouri. I know that many Americans have been deeply disturbed by the images we've seen in the heartland of our country, as police have clashed with people protesting. Today I'd like us all to take a step back and think about how we're going to be moving forward. <p>This morning I received a thorough update on the situation from Attorney General Eric Holder, who has been following it and been in communication with his team. I've already tasked the Department of Justice and the FBI to independently investigate the death of Michael Brown, along with local officials on the ground. <p>The Department of Justice is also consulting with local authorities about ways that they can maintain public safety without restricting the right of peaceful protest and while avoiding unnecessary escalation. I made clear to the Attorney General that we should do what is necessary to help determine exactly what happened and to see that justice is done. <p>I also just spoke with Governor Jay Nixon of Missouri. I expressed my concern over the violent turn that events have taken on the ground and underscored that now is the time for all of us to reflect on what's happened and to find a way to come together going forward. He is going to be traveling to Ferguson. He is a good man and a fine Governor, and I'm confident that, working together, he is going to be able to communicate his desire to make sure that justice is done and his desire to make sure that public safety is maintained in an appropriate way. <p>Of course, it's important to remember how this started. We lost a young man, Michael Brown, in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances. He was 18 years old. His family will never hold Michael in their arms again. And when something like this happens, the local authorities, including the police, have a responsibility to be open and transparent about how they are investigating that death and how they are protecting the people in their communities. <p>There is never an excuse for violence against police or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting. There's also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests or to throw protestors in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights. And here, in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground. Put simply, we all need to hold ourselves to a high standard, particularly those of us in positions of authority. <p>I know that emotions are raw right now in Ferguson, and there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened. There are going to be different accounts of how this tragedy occurred. There are going to be differences in terms of what needs to happen going forward. That's part of our democracy. But let's remember that we're all part of one American family. We are united in common values, and that includes belief in equality under the law; a basic respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protest; a reverence for the dignity of every single man, woman, and child among us; and the need for accountability when it comes to our government. <p>So now is the time for healing. Now is the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson. Now is the time for an open and transparent process to see that justice is done. And I've asked that the Attorney General and the U.S. attorney on the scene continue to work with local officials to move that process forward. They will be reporting to me in the coming days about what's being done to make sure that happens. <p>Thanks very much, everybody.\" "
"191" "\"Hi, everybody. Over the next couple weeks, schools all across the country will be opening their doors. Students will suit up for fall sports and marching band and the school play; moms and dads will snap those first-day-of-school pictures, and that includes me and Michelle. <p>And so today I want to talk directly with students and parents about one of the most important things any of you can do this year, and that's to begin preparing yourself for an education beyond high school. <p>We know that in today's economy, whether you go to a 4-year college, a community college, or a professional training program, some higher education is the surest ticket to the middle class. A typical American with a bachelor's degree or higher earns over $28,000 more per year than someone with just a high school diploma. And they're also much more likely to have a job in the first place. The unemployment rate for those with a bachelor's degree is less than one-third of the rate for those without a high school diploma. <p>But for too many families across the country, paying for higher education is a constant struggle. Earlier this year, a young woman named Elizabeth Cooper wrote to tell me how hard it is for middle class families like hers to afford college. As she said, she feels \\"not significant enough to be addressed, not poor enough for people to worry [about], and not rich enough to be cared about.\\" <p>Michelle and I know the feeling. We only finished paying off our student loans 10 years ago. And so as President, I'm working to make sure young people like Elizabeth can go to college without racking up mountains of debt. We reformed a student loan system so that more money goes to students instead of big banks. We expanded grants and college tax credits for students and families. We took action to offer millions of students a chance to cap their student loan payments at 10 percent of their income. And Congress should pass a bill to let students refinance their loans at today's lower interest rates, just like their parents can refinance their mortgage. <p>But as long as college costs keep rising, we can't just keep throwing money at the problem. Colleges have to do their part to bring down costs as well. That's why we proposed a plan to tie Federal financial aid to a college's performance and create a new college scorecard so that students and parents can see which schools provide the biggest bang for your buck. We launched a new $75 million challenge to inspire colleges to reduce costs and raise graduation rates. And in January, more than a hundred college presidents and nonprofit leaders came to the White House and made commitments to increase opportunities for underserved students. <p>Since then, we've met with even more leaders who want to create new community-based partnerships and support school counselors. And this week, my Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, announced a series of commitments to support students who need a little extra academic help getting through college. <p>This is a challenge I take personally. And to all you young people, now that you're heading back to school, your education is something you have to take personally also. It's up to you to push yourself, to take hard classes and read challenging books. Science shows that when you struggle to solve a problem or make a new argument, you're actually forming new connections in your brain. So when you're thinking hard, you're getting smarter, which means this year, challenge yourself to reach higher. And set your sights on college in the years ahead. Your country is counting on you. <p>And don't forget to have some fun along the way too. <p>Thanks everybody. Good luck on the year ahead.\" "
"192" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. Today the entire world is appalled by the brutal murder of Jim Foley by the terrorist group ISIL. <p>Jim was a journalist, a son, a brother, and a friend. He reported from difficult and dangerous places, bearing witness to the lives of people a world away. He was taken hostage nearly 2 years ago in Syria, and he was courageously reporting at the time on the conflict there. <p>Jim was taken from us in an act of violence that shocks the conscience of the entire world. He was 40 years old, one of five siblings, the son of a mom and dad who worked tirelessly for his release. Earlier today I spoke to the Foleys and told them that we are all heartbroken at their loss and join them in honoring Jim and all that he did. <p>Now, Jim Foley's life stands in stark contrast to his killers'. Let's be clear about ISIL. They have rampaged across cities and villages, killing innocent, unarmed civilians in cowardly acts of violence. They abduct women and children and subject them to torture and rape and slavery. They have murdered Muslims&mdash;both Sunni and Shia&mdash;by the thousands. They target Christians and religious minorities, driving them from their homes, murdering them when they can, for no other reason than they practice a different religion. They declared their ambition to commit genocide against an ancient people. <p>So ISIL speaks for no religion. Their victims are overwhelmingly Muslim, and no faith teaches people to massacre innocents. No just God would stand for what they did yesterday and for what they do every single day. ISIL has no ideology of any value to human beings. Their ideology is bankrupt. They may claim out of expediency that they are at war with the United States or the West, but the fact is, they terrorize their neighbors and offer them nothing but an endless slavery to their empty vision and the collapse of any definition of civilized behavior. <p>And people like this ultimately fail. They fail because the future is won by those who build and not destroy and the world is shaped by people like Jim Foley and the overwhelming majority of humanity who are appalled by those who killed him. <p>The United States of America will continue to do what we must do to protect our people. We will be vigilant, and we will be relentless. When people harm Americans anywhere, we do what's necessary to see that justice is done. And we act against ISIL, standing alongside others. <p>The people of Iraq, who with our support are taking the fight to ISIL, must continue coming together to expel these terrorists from their communities. The people of Syria, whose story Jim Foley told, do not deserve to live under the shadow of a tyrant or terrorists. They have our support in their pursuit of a future rooted in dignity. <p>From governments and peoples across the Middle East, there has to be a common effort to extract this cancer so that it does not spread. There has to be a clear rejection of these kind of nihilistic ideologies. One thing we can all agree on is that a group like ISIL has no place in the 21st century. Friends and allies around the world, we share a common security and a common set of values that are rooted in the opposite of what we saw yesterday. And we will continue to confront this hateful terrorism and replace it with a sense of hope and civility. That's what Jim Foley stood for, a man who lived his work, who courageously told the stories of his fellow human beings, who was liked and loved by friends and family. <p>Today the American people will all say a prayer for those who loved Jim. All of us feel the ache of his absence. All of us mourn his loss. We keep in our prayers those other Americans who are separated from their families. We will do everything that we can to protect our people and the timeless values that we stand for. <p>May God bless and keep Jim's memory, and may God bless the United States of America.\" "
"193" "\"Hi, everybody. Nearly 6 years after the worst financial crisis of our lifetimes, our businesses have added nearly 10 million new jobs over the past 53 months. That's the longest streak of private sector job creation in our history. And we're in a 6-month streak with our economy creating at least 200,000 new jobs each month, the first time that's happened since 1997. <p>Thanks to the decisions we made to rescue and rebuild our economy, and your hard work and resilience, America is leading again. Areas like manufacturing, energy, technology, and autos are all booming. And here's the thing: We're selling more goods made in America to the rest of the world than ever before. American exports are at an alltime high. <p>Over the past 5 years, we've worked hard to open new markets for our businesses and to help them compete on a level playing field in those markets. And we've broken records for exports 4 years running. Last year, our exports supported more than 11 million American jobs, about 1.6 million more than when I took office. They're good jobs that typically pay about 15 percent more than the national average. And more small businesses are selling their goods abroad than ever before, nearly 300,000 last year alone. <p>We should be doing everything we can to accelerate this progress, not stall it. <p>One place to start is by supporting something called the U.S. Export-Import Bank. Its sole mission is to create American jobs: That's it. It helps many American entrepreneurs take that next step and take their small business global. But next month, its charter will expire, unless Members of Congress do their job and reauthorize it. <p>Now, past Congresses have done this 16 times, always with support from both parties. Republican and Democratic Presidents have supported the bank too. This time around shouldn't be any different, because the bank works. It's independent; it pays for itself. But if Congress fails to act, thousands of businesses, large and small, that sell their products abroad will take a completely unnecessary hit. <p>Small-business owners have had to overcome a lot these past several years. We all saw local businesses close their doors during the crisis. And in the past few years, we've seen more and more open their doors and do their part to help lead America's comeback. At the very least, they deserve a Congress that doesn't stand in the way of their success. <p>Your Members of Congress are home this month. If you're a small-business owner or an employee at a large business that depends on financing to tackle new markets and create new jobs, tell them to quit treating your business like it's expendable and start treating it for what it is: vital to America's success. Tell them to do their jobs, keep America's exports growing, and keep America's recovery going. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"194" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you so much. Please, everybody, have a seat. Hello, Legionnaires! <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hello! <p><i>The President.</i> I want to thank Commander Dellinger for the introduction, but more importantly, for your service in the Army. And as you conclude your tenure as commander, thank you for your tireless commitment to America's veterans. <p>I want to thank the entire leadership team for welcoming me here today, including your national adjutant, Dan Wheeler; your executive director in Washington, Peter Gaytan; Nancy Brown-Park, all the spouses, daughters&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;hey!&mdash;sisters of the Auxiliary; and the Sons of the American Legion. And let me say that I join you in honoring the memory of a friend to many of you, an Army veteran and a great Legionnaire from North Carolina, Jerry Hedrick. <p>To Senators Richard Burr and Kay Hagan, Mayor Dan Clodfelter: Thank you for welcoming us to the great State of North Carolina and to Charlotte and for your great support of our troops and our veterans. <p>And I do have to mention the presence of Boys Nation, Matthew Ellow, from Lacey's Spring, Alabama. I welcomed Matthew and all the incredible young people of Boys and Girls Nation to the White House last month. I was running a little bit late, so they just started singing, filling the White House with patriotic songs. And then they sang Happy Birthday to me, so I was pretty moved. And they're a tribute to the Legion and to our country. <p>Now, I brought with me today our new Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Bob McDonald. And for those of you who are not aware, Bob is one of America's most accomplished business leaders. He comes from a military family. He excelled at West Point, served as an Army Airborne Ranger, so he's got a reputation for jumping into tough situations. [<i>Laughter</i>] And he's hit the ground running, visiting hospitals and clinics across the country, hearing directly from veterans and helping us change the way VA does business. And by the way, Washington doesn't agree on much these days, but he got confirmed 97 to 0. People understand he's the right man for the job. He has my full support. And, Bob, I want to thank you for once again serving your country. <p>It's an honor to be back with the American Legion. In the story of your service, we see the spirit of America. When your country needed you most, you stepped forward. You raised your right hand; you swore a solemn oath. You put on that uniform and earned the title you carry to this day, whether soldier, sailor, airman, marine, coastguardsman. <p>Among you are proud veterans of World War II, of Korea, of Vietnam, of Desert Storm and the Balkans, and our newest veterans, from Iraq and Afghanistan. Across the generations, you served with honor. You made us proud. And you carry the memory of friends who never came home: our fallen, our prisoners of war, those missing in action, heroes that our Nation can never forget. When you took off that uniform, you earned another title, the title of veteran. And you never stopped serving. As Legionnaires, you put on that cap, wore that emblem&mdash;\\"for God and country\\"&mdash;and took care of one another, making sure our veterans receive the care and the benefits that you've earned and deserve. <p>And just as you defended America over there, you helped build America here at home, as leaders and role models in your communities, as entrepreneurs and business owners, as champions for a strong national defense. You helped the United States of America become what we are today: the greatest democratic, economic, and military force for freedom and human dignity that the world has ever known. <p>Now, these are challenging times. I don't have to tell you that. Around the world as well as here at home. You turn on the TV, and we're saturated with heartbreaking images of war and senseless violence and terrorism and tragedy. And it can be easy to grow cynical or give in to the sense that the future we seek is somehow beyond our reach. But as men and women who have been tested like few others, you should know better. You know that cynicism is not the character of a great nation. And so even as we face, yes, the hard tasks of our time, we should never lose sight of our progress as a people or the strength of our leadership in the world. <p>Think about it. Six years after the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression&mdash;in some ways, the crisis had the potential of being worse than the Great Depression&mdash;thanks to the decisions we made to rescue our economy, thanks to the determination of the American people, we are stronger at home. Over the past 53 months, our businesses have added nearly 10 million new jobs, the longest streak of private sector job creation in American history. Construction and housing are rebounding. Our auto industry and manufacturing are booming. Our high school graduation rate is at a record high. More young people are earning their college degrees than ever before. Millions more Americans now have quality, affordable health care. We've cut the deficit by more than half. And now we have to sustain this momentum so more people share in this progress, so our economy works for every working American. <p>And just as we're stronger at home, the United States is better positioned to lead in the 21st century than any nation on Earth. It's not even close. We have the most powerful military in history. That's certainly not close. From Europe to Asia, our alliances are unrivaled. Our economy is the most dynamic. We've got the best workers. We've got the best businesses. We have the best universities and the best scientists. With our domestic energy revolution, including more renewable energy, we're more energy independent. Our technologies connect the world. Our freedoms and opportunities attract immigrants who \\"yearn to breathe free.\\" Our founding ideals inspire the oppressed across the globe to reach for their own liberty. That's who we are. That's what America is. <p>And moreover, nobody else can do what we do. No other nation does more to underwrite the security and prosperity on which the world depends. In times of crisis, no other nation can rally such broad coalitions to stand up for international norms and peace. In times of disaster, no other nation has the capabilities to deliver so much so quickly. No nation does more to help citizens claim their rights and build their democracies. No nation does more to help people in the far corners of the Earth escape poverty and hunger and disease and realize their dignity. Even countries that criticize us, when the chips are down and they need help, they know who to call. They call us. That's what American leadership looks like. That's why the United States is and will remain the one indispensable nation in the world. <p>Now, sustaining our leadership, keeping America strong and secure, means we have to use our power wisely. History teaches us of the dangers of overreaching and spreading ourselves too thin and trying to go it alone without international support or rushing into military adventures without thinking through the consequences. And nobody knows this better than our veterans and our families&mdash;our veteran families, because you're the ones who bear the wages of war. You're the ones who carry the scars. You know that we should never send America's sons and daughters into harm's way unless it is absolutely necessary and we have a plan and we are resourcing it and prepared to see it through. You know the United States has to lead with strength and confidence and wisdom. <p>And that's why, after incredible sacrifice by so many of our men and women in uniform, we removed more than 140,000 troops from Iraq and welcomed those troops home. It was the right thing to do. It's why we refocused our efforts in Afghanistan and went after Al Qaida's leadership in the tribal regions in Afghanistan and Pakistan, driving the Taliban out of its strongholds and training Afghan forces, which are now in the lead for their own security. In just four months, we will complete our combat mission in Afghanistan and America's longest war will come to a responsible end. And we honor every American who served to make this progress possible&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;every single one, especially the more than 2,200 American patriots who made the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan to keep us safe. <p>And now, as Afghans continue to work towards the first democratic transfer of power in their history, Afghan leaders need to make the hard compromises that are necessary to give the Afghan people a future of security and progress. And as we go forward, we'll continue to partner with Afghans so their country can never again be used to launch attacks against the United States. <p>Now, as I've always made clear, the blows we've struck against Al Qaida's leadership don't mean the end to the terrorist threat. Al Qaida affiliates still target our homeland; we've seen that in Yemen. Other extremists threaten our citizens abroad, as we've seen most recently in Iraq and Syria. As Commander in Chief, the security of the American people is my highest priority, and that's why, with the brutal terrorist group ISIL advancing in Iraq, I have authorized targeted strikes to protect our diplomats and military advisers who are there. <p>And let me say it again: American combat troops will not be returning to fight in Iraq. We'll not allow the United States to be dragged back into another ground war in Iraq. Because ultimately, it is up to the Iraqis to bridge their differences and secure themselves. The limited strikes we're conducting have been necessary to protect our people and have helped Iraqi forces begin to push back these terrorists. We've also been able to rescue thousands of men and women and children who were trapped on a mountain. And our airdrops of food and water and medicine show American leadership at our best. And we salute the brave pilots and crews who are making us proud in the skies of Iraq every single day. <p>And more broadly, the crisis in Iraq underscores how we have to meet today's evolving terrorist threat. The answer is not to send in large-scale military deployments that overstretch our military and lead for us occupying countries for a long period of time and end up feeding extremism. Rather, our military action in Iraq has to be part of a broader strategy to protect our people and support our partners to take the fight to ISIL. <p>So we're strengthening our partners: more military assistance to Government and Kurdish forces in Iraq and moderate opposition in Syria. And we're urging Iraqis to forge the kind of inclusive Government that can deliver on national unity and strong security forces and good governance that are ultimately going to be the antidote against terrorists. And we're urging countries in the region and building an international coalition, including our closest allies, to support Iraqis as they take the fight to these barbaric terrorists. And today our prayers are with the Foley family in New Hampshire as they continue to grieve the brutal murder of their son and brother Jim. But our message to anyone who harms our people is simple: America does not forget. Our reach is long. We are patient. Justice will be done. We have proved time and time again we will do what's necessary to capture those who harm Americans, to go after those who harm Americans. <p>And we'll continue to take direct action where needed to protect our people and to defend our homeland. And rooting out a cancer like ISIL won't be easy, and it won't be quick. But tyrants and murderers before them should recognize that kind of hateful vision ultimately is no match for the strength and hopes of people who stand together for the security and dignity and freedom that is the birthright of every human being. <p>So even as our war in Afghanistan comes to an end, we will stay vigilant. We will continue to make sure that our military has what it needs. And as today's generation of servicemembers keeps us safe, and as they come home, we also have to meet our responsibilities to them, just as they meet their responsibilities to America. <p>When I was here at the Legion 3 years ago, I said that the bond between our forces and our citizens has to be a sacred trust and that for me, for my administration, upholding our trust with our veterans is not just a matter of policy, it is a moral obligation. <p>And working together, we have made real progress. Think about it. Working with the Legion and other veterans service organizations, we've been able to accomplish historic increases to veterans funding. We've protected veterans health care from Washington politics with advanced appropriations. We've been able to make VA benefits available to more than 2 million veterans who didn't have them before, including more Vietnam vets who were exposed to agent orange. We've dedicated major new resources for mental health care. We've helped more than 1 million veterans and their families pursue their education under the post-9/11 GI bill. <p>And moreover, as the Legion and other veterans groups have said, once veterans get in the door, the care you receive from the VA is often very good. The specialized care is among the best in the world. And many of the hard-working folks at the VA are veterans themselves, veterans serving veterans. And we can never thank them enough for their good work. <p>But what we've come to learn is that the misconduct we've seen at too many facilities&mdash;with long wait times and veterans denied care and folks cooking the books&mdash;is outrageous and inexcusable. <p>As soon as it was disclosed, I got before the American people, and I said we would not tolerate it. And we will not. And I know the Legion's been on the frontlines, fanning out across the country, helping veterans who've been affected. And I know Bob is going to give you an update on the actions that we're taking. But what I want you to know, directly from me, is that we're focused on this at the highest levels. We are going to get to the bottom of these problems. We're going to fix what is wrong. We're going to do right by you, and we are going to do right by your families. And that is a solemn pledge and commitment that I'm making to you here. <p>Already, we're making sure that those responsible for manipulating or falsifying records are held accountable. We're reaching out to veterans&mdash;more than a quarter million so far&mdash;to get them off wait lists and into clinics. We're moving ahead with reforms at the Veterans Health Administration. And to help get that done, you supported and Congress passed and I signed into law the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act, which means more resources to help the VA hire more doctors and nurses and staff. It means if you live more than 40 miles from a VA facility or your VA doctors can't see you fast enough, we'll help you go to a doctor outside the VA. <p>And we're instituting a new culture of accountability. Bob doesn't play. Bob likes to recall a cadet prayer from West Point, which should be the ethos of all of us: \\"Choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong.\\" And with the new legislation that I signed into law, Bob and the VA now have the authority to more quickly remove senior executives who don't meet our high standards. If you engage in unethical practices or cover up a serious problem, you should be and will be fired. <p>And by the way, if you blow the whistle on higher-ups because you've identified a legitimate problem, you shouldn't be punished, you should be protected. <p>So my bottom line is this: Despite all the good work that the VA does every day, despite all the progress that we've made over the last several years, we are very clear eyed about the problems that are still there. And those problems require us to regain the trust of our veterans and live up to our vision of a VA that is more effective and more efficient and that truly puts veterans first. And I will not be satisfied until that happens. <p>And we're in the midst of a new wave of veterans, more than a million servicemembers returning to civilian life. So we have to do more to uphold that sacred trust not just this year or next year, but for decades to come. We're going to have to stay focused on the five priorities that I outlined last year. And I just want to reiterate them for you just so you know what it is that we're committing to. <p>Number one, we need to make sure our veterans have the resources you deserve. And the new funding we just helped&mdash;we just passed with the help of Senators Burr and Kay, that helps. But as you know, it's not enough. Even in these tough fiscal times, I've therefore proposed another increase in veterans funding for next year. And I'll continue to resist any effort to exploit the recent problems at the VA to turn veterans health care into a voucher system. We don't need vouchers. You need VA health care that you have earned and that you can depend on. We need to make the system work. <p>Second, we need to make sure veterans are actually getting the health care you need when you need it. Reforming the VHA and more doctors and staff is a good step. But with this new wave of veterans, we've got to deliver the care our newest veterans need most. And that includes tailored care that treats our women veterans with respect and dignity. It means doing even more to help veterans from all wars who are struggling with traumatic brain injury and posttraumatic stress. And we have to end this tragedy of suicide among our troops and veterans. As a country, we can't stand idly by on such tragedy. <p>So we're doing even more&mdash;more than ever&mdash;more awareness, more outreach, more access to mental health care. So long as any servicemember or veteran is suffering or feels like they have nowhere to turn or doesn't get the support that they need, that means we haven't done enough. When we all know we need to do more. Veterans called for it. We heard you, which is why today I'm announcing 19 new executive actions to help improve mental health care for those American heroes and their families. <p>So just one example: We're expanding suicide prevention training across the military and the VA so colleagues and clinicians can spot the warning signs and encourage our troops and veterans to seek help. We'll improve access to care, with more peer support&mdash;veterans counseling veterans&mdash;at VA hospitals and clinics. We're calling on Congress to help us ensure that our troops get coverage for mental health care that's on par with the coverage for other mental&mdash;medical conditions. And we're going to make it easier for servicemembers being treated for mental health conditions to continue their care as they transition to the VA, so automatically connecting them with the support they need, making sure they don't lose access to any medications they may be taking. <p>And maybe most of all, we're going to keep saying loud and clear to anyone out there who's hurting, it is not a sign of weakness to ask for help, it is a sign of strength. Talk to a friend. Pick up the phone. You are not alone. We are here for you. And every American needs to know, if you see someone in uniform or a veteran who is struggling, reach out and help them to get help. They were there for America. We now need to be there for them. <p>Our third priority: We have to keep attacking the disability claims backlog. Now, the good news is, since its peak last year, we've worked with you to slash the backlog by more than 50 percent. There had been a surge in the backlog in part because of an influx of new veterans, in part because we opened it up for folks who had PTSD, folks with agent orange symptoms. And then we had to work that backlog back down. The trend lines are good. But we don't just want those claims processed fast; we need to make sure they get processed right. <p>So we're going to keep at this until we end this backlog once and for all. And as we do, we're going to keep working to liberate you from those mountains of paper. We've got to move towards a paperless system, electronic health records that our troops and veterans can keep for life and then could cut down on some of the bureaucratic redtape so that you're getting the benefits that you've earned a little bit faster. <p>Number four, we need to uphold the dignity and rights of every veteran, and that includes ending the tragedy of homelessness among veterans. Again, we've got good news to report. Today I can announce that, working together over the last few years, we have been able to reduce the number of homeless veterans by one-third. And that means on any given night, there are 25,000 fewer veterans on the streets or in shelters. But we're not going to stop until every veteran who has defended America has a home in America. That's a basic commitment that we have to uphold. <p>And finally, we need to make sure our troops and veterans have every opportunity to pursue the American Dream. And that includes a home of their own. You know, under the law, our servicemembers are entitled to reduced mortgage rates, but the burden is on them to ask for it and prove they're eligible, which means a lot of folks don't get the low rates they deserve. <p>So today we're turning that around. We're announcing a new partnership in which some of America's biggest banks and financial institutions will simplify the process, proactively notify servicemembers who qualify for lower rates, and make it easier to enroll. In other words, we're going to help more of our troops and military families own their own home without a crushing debt. <p>We're also going to keep helping our troops transition to civilian life. Because of the work we've done together, if you already have a military truck driver's license, every State now waives the skills test so it's easier for you to get a commercial driver's license. And we're going to keep pushing more States to recognize the incredible skills and training of our veterans. If you could do a job in a war zone, if you're a medic in a war zone, you shouldn't have to go take nursing 101 to work in a hospital here in the United States. If you can handle million-dollar pieces of equipment in a war zone, that should count for something in getting certified back here at home. If you can do the kinds of jobs so many of you have done in the most extreme circumstances, I'm pretty confident you can do that job right here at home. <p>To help our troops and veterans pursue their education, we worked with loan servicers to automatically cap interest rates on student loans to our servicemembers at 6 percent. For veterans going back to school under the post-9/11 GI bill, we'll keep standing up against dishonest recruiting and predatory practices that target and prey on you and your families. So far, about 6,000 colleges and universities have pledged to adhere to our principles of excellence, promising to do right by our veterans. And more than a thousand colleges and universities have adopted our \\"8 Keys\\" to make sure that they're truly welcoming veterans and helping them succeed on campus. And by the way, every school in America should join them. You should be proud if you're educating a veteran, and you should be doing right by them. <p>And we're going to keep helping our veterans find those private sector jobs worthy of your incredible talents. Our new online Veterans Employment Center is a single, one-stop shop connecting veterans and their spouses to more than 1.5 million jobs that are open right now. And we're joining with States and local leaders to identify nearly two dozen cities and regions with the most opportunities for veterans. And with Michelle and Dr. Jill Biden leading the call, America's businesses are joining forces to hire or train veterans and spouses, more than half a million so far and growing. <p>So veterans' unemployment is going down, and it's now actually lower than the national average. It was higher to begin with, and we have been driving it down. But we've got more to go, especially for our post-9/11 veterans. So we're going to keep saying to every business in America, if you want somebody who knows how to get the job done, no matter what the mission, hire a veteran. Hire a vet. <p>So fixing what's broken at the VA, ensuring the resources you deserve, delivering the health care that you've earned, eliminating the backlog, standing up for your rights and dignity, helping you realize the American Dream that you so honorably defended&mdash;these are our commitments to you. This is what we're focused on. This is what we can do together, especially as our war in Afghanistan comes to an end and we welcome home our newest veterans. <p>There are a lot of them here tonight. We salute Captain Scott Miller of Indiana, a proud Hoosier and a proud marine. In Afghanistan, he went out on dangerous patrols, traveling to remote villages, meeting with tribal elders, building trust, forging partnerships to push back insurgents. And here at the Legion, he continues to serve by encouraging businesses across America to give back to the veterans who defended our way of life and make our prosperity possible. So thank you, Scott. Where is Scott here today? We are proud of him. There here is. <p>We salute Master Sergeant Carol Barker of Greensboro, North Carolina. As a first sergeant of her medevac unit, she was responsible for more than a hundred troops, helped save the lives of our wounded warriors in those critical first hours when life so often hung in the balance. And here at the Legion, she continues to serve, helping homeless veterans come in off the streets and begin their lives anew with a roof over their heads. Thank you, Carol. Where's Carol? <p>We salute Sergeant Joe Grassi, who grew up just outside New York City. After his hometown was attacked on 9/11, he left his civilian job, he joined the Army. A squad leader in Afghanistan, he spent most of his time on the flight line, in the 120-degree heat, supplying our helicopter crews. And here at the Legion, he continues to serve, helping veterans complete their disability claims and raising his voice in Washington for a strong national defense, because, he says, \\"some things are worth fighting for. America is worth fighting for.\\" Thank you, Joe. We're proud of you. Thank you, sir. <p>So Scott, Carol, Joe&mdash;they're among the patriots here today who served in Afghanistan and Iraq. And I would ask all our post-9/11 generation veterans to stand if you are able and accept the thanks of a grateful nation. I ask these men and women to stand because the American people have to know that even as our war in Afghanistan comes to an end, our obligation to this generation of veterans has only just begun. And this cannot just be the work of Government and veterans groups alone. I want every American to take this commitment seriously. Please stand, post-9/11 generation, all of you who have served in Afghanistan and Iraq. We're grateful for you. <p>This is not just a job of Government. It's not just a job of the veterans organizations. Every American needs to join us in taking care of those who've taken care of us. Because only 1 percent of Americans may be fighting our wars, but 100 percent of Americans benefit from that 1 percent. A hundred percent need to be supporting our troops. A hundred percent need to be supporting our veterans. A hundred percent need to be supporting our military families. <p>And everybody can do something. Every American. Every business. Every profession. Every school. Every community. Every State. All of us, as one American team. That's how we will truly honor our veterans. That's how we will truly say thank you. That's how we will uphold the sacred trust with all who've served in our name. <p>God bless you. God bless our veterans. God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much.\" "
"195" "\"Hi, everybody. Whether you're firing up the grill, fired up for some college football, or filling up the car for one last summer road trip, happy Labor Day weekend. <p>We set aside Labor Day to honor the working men and women of America. And this Labor Day, we've got more to celebrate. Over the past 53 months, our businesses have added nearly 10 million new jobs. Last month, for the first time since 1997, we created more than 200,000 jobs for 6 straight months. And for the first time in over a decade, business leaders worldwide have declared, 2 years running, that the number-one place to invest isn't China, it's America. <p>So there are reasons to be optimistic about where we're headed. And the decisions we make now will determine whether or not we accelerate this progress: whether economic gains flow to a few at the top or whether a growing economy fuels rising incomes and a thriving middle class. <p>Think about it this Labor Day. The things we often take for granted&mdash;like Social Security and Medicare, workplace safety laws and the right to organize for better pay and benefits, even weekends&mdash;we didn't always have these things. Workers and the unions who get their back had to fight for them. And those fights built a stronger middle class. <p>To build a stronger middle class in today's changing economy, we've got to keep fighting. We've got to fight for the right to affordable health insurance for everybody; the right to fair pay, family leave, and workplace flexibility; the right to a fair living wage. <p>And let me focus on that last one for a minute. In America, no one who works full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty. A hard day's work deserves a fair day's pay. And raising the minimum wage would be one of the best ways to give a boost to working families. It would help around 28 million Americans from all walks of life pay the bills, provide for their kids, and spend that money at local businesses. And that grows the economy for everybody. <p>The bottom line is, America deserves a raise. But until we've got a Congress that cares about raising working folks' wages, it's up to the rest of us to make it happen. And in the year and a half since I first asked Congress to raise the minimum wage, Americans of all walks of life are doing just that. <p>Thirteen States and DC have done their part by raising their minimum wages. Four more States have minimum wage initiatives on the ballot of this November. And the States where the minimum wage has gone up this year have experienced higher job growth than the States that haven't. <p>Business leaders at companies like the Gap are doing their part. They're raising base wages for tens of thousands of workers because they know it's good for business. <p>Mayors across the country are doing their part. Mayor Emanuel in Chicago and Mayor Garcetti in L.A. are working to lift their cities' wages over time to at least $13 an hour. <p>I've tried to do my part by requiring companies that get contracts with the Federal Government to pay their workers a fair wage of $10.10 an hour. And earlier this month, the president of Kentucky State University set a great example by giving himself a $90,000 pay cut so that he could give raises to his lowest paid employees. His sacrifice will give more of his workers and their families a little extra money to help make ends meet. <p>That's how America built the greatest middle class the world has ever known: not by making sure a fortunate few at the top are doing well, but by making sure that everyone who's willing to work hard and play by the rules can get ahead. That's the bedrock this country is built on: hard work, responsibility, sacrifice, and looking out for one another as one united American family. <p>So let's keep that in mind this Labor Day and every day. Have a great weekend, everybody.\" "
"196" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Milwaukee! Thank you! Oh, it's good to be back in Milwaukee. Give Chris a big round of applause for that great introduction. <p>Happy Labor Day, everybody! Happy Labor Day. Today is a day that belongs to you, the working men and women who make America the greatest country on Earth. So thank you to the working folks who are here today and the unions who have always had your back. Thank you to the Milwaukee Area Labor Council, to the Wisconsin AFL-CIO. <p>It's good to be back at Laborfest. I hope you don't mind, I brought a friend with me, somebody who is fighting for American workers every day: America's Secretary of Labor, Tom Perez, is in the house. And I just found out Tom's wife is from Milwaukee, so his father-in-law is here. So I just told his father-in-law he's doing a really good job, because you always want to make a guy look good in front of his father-in-law. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We've got some other friends I want to acknowledge. First of all, your Congresswoman, Gwen Moore, is here. Your mayor, Tom Barrett, is in the house. We've got one of my favorites, Mary Kay Henry from SEIU. Newly elected Lily Garcia from NEA. My pal&mdash;not a Packers fan, he's a Steelers fan, but he's a good guy anyway&mdash;Leo Gerard from USW, Steelworkers. Billy Hite from UA; Joe Hansen from UFCW. <p>To all the other labor leaders who are here, we are so glad to have you. And we're here because of the things all too often we take for granted. Anybody who's got a seat, feel free to sit down. Yes, I don't want anybody fainting; it's all hot out here. I might get you back up on your feet at some point. <p>But we're here to celebrate something that sometimes the American people take for granted: the 40-hour workweek, overtime pay, a minimum wage, weekends like this one. All that didn't happen by accident. It happened because America's workers organized for it, fought for it. History shows that working families can get a fair shot in this country, but only if we're willing to fight for it. <p>Now, the first time I came to Laborfest was&mdash;I was still a candidate back in 2008. And during that campaign, I promised, if you send me to the White House, I'd stand with you in that fight. Now, 2 weeks later, our financial system collapsed. A recession almost became a depression. And in the years since, our country has faced a choice. There are some folks who wanted to place an even bigger bet on top-down economics, the kind of economics that helped cause the crisis in the first place: more tax cuts for those at the top, fewer rules for big banks and corporations, this blind faith that maybe prosperity would finally trickle down on the rest of us if folks up at the top just kept on doing better and better. <p>But, you know what, Milwaukee, I didn't run for President to double down on top-down economics. I ran for President because I believed in bottom-up economics. I believed in middle-out economics. I placed a bet on you. I placed a bet on America's workers. I put my money on American workers and the belief that our economy grows best when everybody has got a shot, when folks who are willing to work hard can get into the middle class and stay into the middle class. And I've come back to Laborfest to say that because of your hard work, because of what we've been through together, that bet is starting to pay off. America is stronger because of the decisions we made to rescue our economy and rebuild it on a new foundation asking the simple question: Is this good for ordinary Americans, is this good for working people, not just a few, for&mdash;but for everybody? And over the past 53 months, our businesses have created nearly 10 million new jobs. We're on a streak where, the last 6 months, we've created more than 200,000 jobs each month. That's the first time that's happened since 1997. <p>Construction is rebounding. Energy and technology are booming. American manufacturing is steadily creating jobs for the first time since the 1990s. Our businesses export more goods made right here in America to the rest of the world than ever before. <p>America is stronger because we saved the American auto industry and more than 1 million jobs that depend on the auto industry. Today, our workers are building more cars than any time since 2002. And by the way, they're really good cars. The auto industry is adding jobs at the strongest rate since the 1990s. <p>America is stronger because we invested in homegrown energy. The world's number-one oil and gas producer&mdash;it's not Russia, it's not Saudi Arabia, it's the U.S. of A. We are the largest producer. And for the first time in nearly 20 years, America now produces more oil than we buy from other countries. But we're also producing more clean energy, putting folks back to work. We've tripled the amount of wind power that creates energy. We've increased by 10 times the amount of solar power we create. And all of that is creating tens of thousands of good jobs all across the country. <p>America is stronger because we set our schools on a race to the top. We helped more middle class families afford college. Today, thanks to outstanding teachers, our high school graduation rate is at a record high. More young people are earning their college degrees than ever before. <p>America is stronger because we helped millions of responsible homeowners stay in their homes, and we got some of the biggest banks who sold deceptive mortgages to help make things right. They're ponying up billions of dollars to do right by folks who got cheated. We changed a Tax Code that was skewed too much to the wealthy at the expense of working families. We made sure, you know what, you guys have got to pay a little more. And as a consequence, we cut our deficits by more than half. <p>And yes, Milwaukee, America is stronger because millions more Americans have the peace of mind of quality, affordable health insurance that they can count on. [<i>Applause</i>] Yes, we did that. <p>So I just want everybody to understand, because you wouldn't always know it from watching the news&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;by almost every measure, the American economy and American workers are better off than when I took office. We're better off by almost every measure. But look, none of this progress has come easy. Every inch of it we have had to fight for. Every inch of it we've had to work against a lockstep opposition that is opposed to everything we do. <p>But it was worth it. Every gray hair is worth it. [<i>Applause</i>] Every gray hair is worth it, and at least I've still got some hair. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member.</i> And you look good! <p><i>The President.</i> Oh, I look good&mdash;see, I like that. Thank you. Yes, whenever folks say&mdash;whenever they see me they say, you know what, you look okay, like they're surprised. [<i>Laughter</i>] And then, sometimes, they say I look taller than I do on TV. [<i>Laughter</i>] I say, yes, I look&mdash;that's because the TV is small. It makes me look smaller. I'm&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>Look, it is thanks to the grit, to the resilience of working Americans that this country we love, it's recovered faster, it's come farther than almost any other advanced economy. For the first time in more than a decade, business leaders around the world, when you ask them, where do you want to invest, what's the number-one place to invest, they don't say China, they don't say Germany. They say the United States of America. And our lead is growing. U.S.A.! <p><i>Audience members.</i> U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! <p><i>The President.</i> So look, I'm saying all this just because sometimes, if you're watching TV or something, I mean, it's just kind of a whole downer. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, we've got struggles. We've got work to do. But there are a lot of reasons to be optimistic about America. <p>More folks are working. The economy's growing stronger. The engines are revving a little louder. And the question now is, are we going to make the right decisions to accelerate this progress? Are we going to continue to focus on working families? Are we going to continue to make sure that a growing economy gives everybody rising incomes and wages? Are we going to make sure that we're helping the middle class and everybody who is trying to get into the middle class? <p>It's a good thing that corporate profits are high; I want American businesses to succeed. It's a good thing that the stock market is booming. A lot of folks have 401(k)s in there; I want them to feel good. But I also want to see the guy who's breaking his back on two 8-hour shifts so he's got enough money to send his kids to college, I want to make sure that guy is getting a break. I want to make sure he's getting some help. I want to see that woman who's worked for 40 years be able to retire with some dignity and some respect. That's how I measure progress, not just by how well the economy is doing overall, but how it's doing for folks who are working so hard, doing everything right, just want a fair shot, and didn't have anything handed to them in their lives, weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouths. <p>And the reason that's who I'm thinking about is because that's the family I grew up in. That's the family Michelle's family grew up in. This country gave me a chance. It gave Michelle a chance. I believe in the American Dream because I have lived it. And I ran for this office to restore it for everybody so no matter what you look like and no matter where you came from, no matter how you started, you can make it in America if you try. <p>So that's what's at stake right now. That's what's at stake: making sure the economy works for everybody. I've got a vision of an economy where opportunity is open to everybody who's willing to work hard. I want an economy where new, long-term investments in American energy and American infrastructure and American manufacturing and American innovation are unleashing new jobs in new industries right here in Wisconsin, right here in Milwaukee; an economy where our workers have the chance to earn new skills that lead to that good job, where our children graduate from school fully prepared for the global competition they're going to face. <p>I want an economy where your hard work pays off with higher wages and higher incomes and fairer pay for women and workplace flexibility for parents and affordable health insurance and decent retirement benefits. I'm not asking for the Moon, I just want a good deal for American workers. Sometimes, when I talk about this stuff to some of my folks on the other side of the aisle, they're all, like, well, why are you stirring up class resentments? I'm not stirring up class resentment. <p>Let me tell you something, working families, they are fine that folks are rich. The average person, they're not looking for a yacht. They're not looking for their own plane. They're not looking for a mansion. They don't need to be vacationing in St. Bart's. All they're looking for is that if they work hard, they can pay the bills; that they can send their kids to school; they can retire with some dignity, maybe take a vacation once in a while, go to Wisconsin Dells or something. They ain't looking for nothing fancy. That's where Michelle and I used to take Malia and Sasha. We'd be in that water so long, fingers all pruned up. And there were a lot of little kids in there, which made you a little suspicious about the water. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm just saying. [<i>Laughter</i>] That was not in the prepared remarks. Let me&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>Now, most of the policies I'm talking about have two things in common: They're going to help more working families get ahead, and the Republicans who run our Congress oppose almost all of them. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> Don't boo, vote! [<i>Applause</i>] Don't boo, vote! It's easy to boo. I want you to vote. Yes, don't boo, vote. They oppose almost everything. And I'm not making that up; I'm just telling the truth. It's just the facts. <p>In fact, they oppose stuff they used to be for. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> No, it's true. I mean, they used to be for building roads and bridges and all that. Now, suddenly, no, we can't build roads. Well, why not? Because you oppose&mdash;because you proposed it. I am just telling the truth. The sky is blue today. Milwaukee brats are delicious. The Brewers are tied for first place. And Republicans in Congress love to say no. Those are just facts; they're facts of life. They say no to everything. <p>If we had a Congress that cared about policies that actually helped working people, I promise you we could get everything done that we've talked about doing. But until we have that Congress, it's up to us to fight for these policies. <p>So wherever I can, I've acted on my own. I acted on my own to make sure more women had the protections they needed to fight for fair pay on the workplace, because I think when women succeed, America succeeds. I was raised by a single mom, so I know how hard it is for a lot of women out there. And by the way, men, you should want your wife to get paid fair. She's bringing that money home. That's not a women's issue, that's your issue. That's money out of your family's pocket. <p>That's why I took action on my own to give millions of Americans the chance to cap their student loan payments at 10 percent of their incomes. I don't want young people saddled with debt when they're just starting out in life. That's why I acted on my own to make sure companies that receive Federal contracts, that they pay their workers a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour. If you work full time in America, you shouldn't be living in poverty, you shouldn't be trying to support a family on poverty. <p>And in the year and a half since I first asked Congress to raise the minimum wage, of course, the Republicans in Congress have blocked it, but more and more Americans are doing their part to make it happen. This is why I stay optimistic, even with some of the nonsense that goes on in Washington. You've seen business leaders at companies like the Gap that raised base wages for tens of thousands of workers because they knew it was good for business. You've seen mayors across the country doing their part, and today, on Labor Day, the mayor of Los Angeles is announcing a plan to raise his city's minimum wage. <p>You've seen&mdash;here's a good story. Last month, the president of Kentucky State University, he gave himself a $90,000 pay cut so that he could raise wages for his lowest paid employees. Thirteen States, District of Columbia&mdash;they've raised their minimum wages. Four more States are putting minimum wage initiatives on the ballot in November. <p>And you know what, here's the best part. You'll hear opponents, they'll say, well, minimum wage, they're going to kill jobs. Except it turns out, the States where the minimum wage has gone up this year had higher job growth than the States that didn't raise the minimum wage. That's the facts. <p>All across the country right now, there's a national movement going on made up of fast food workers organizing to lift wages so they can provide for their families with pride and dignity. There is no denying a simple truth: America deserves a raise. Folks are doing very well on Wall Street; they're doing very well in the corporate board rooms. Give America a raise. <p>And I think, eventually, Congress is going to hear them. We'll break those folks down. We'll just stay on them. We'll just keep at it. That's how I got Michelle to marry me. I just wore her down. [<i>Laughter</i>] Persistence, you just stay at it. Because the only thing more powerful than an idea whose time has come is when millions of people are organizing around an idea whose time has come. Millions of people are voting for an idea whose time has come. <p>I know it gets frustrating, though, when it feels like your voices aren't heard in Washington. I promise you I share that frustration. After all that unions have done to build and protect working Americans, I know it's frustrating when people have the gall to blame you for the problems facing working Americans. I know you've got some experience with that around here. <p>But you know what, if I were looking for a good job that lets me build some security for my family, I'd join a union. If I were busting my butt in the service industry and wanted an honest day's pay for an honest day's work, I'd join a union. If I were a firefighter or police officer risking my life and helping to keep my community safe and wanted to make sure I came home safely to my family, I'd join a union. I'd want a union looking out for me. <p>And if I cared about these things, I'd also want more Democrats looking out for me. I'm just saying. Because when the rest of the country is working to raise wages, but Republicans in Congress won't, it ain't right. Not only is it not right, it ain't right. [<i>Laughter</i>] When the rest of the country is working to open up more businesses, but Republicans in Congress block investments that would help more businesses grow, it ain't right. When unions and CEOs, when law enforcement and the evangelical community, when folks who usually don't agree on anything agree that we should be fixing our broken immigration system, but the Republicans in the House of Representatives have been sitting on a bill for more than a year, it ain't right. <p>So that's why we have to keep fighting. At the beginning of the last century, people fought against the idea of a 40-hour workweek, they fought against weekends, they fought against workplace safety laws. Eighty years ago, people fought against the idea of Social Security. Fifty years ago, people fought against the idea of Medicare. But guess what? We won those fights. And just like in the past, today, you've still got people fighting against the right for health care for everybody or the right to fair wages, or they even fight against equal pay for equal work. But we will win those fights too. I promise. And I know that because America is the story of progress. It can be slow, yes. It can be frustrating. Sometimes, you get half a loaf where you wanted the whole loaf. Sometimes, you might just get a quarter of a loaf. <p>But if you look at our history, the story is progress. And that's because there have always been Americans who have had the courage to march and to organize and to fight for themselves, but then also to fight for each other. And I'm asking you to do the same thing. I asked you the same thing back in 2008. <p>I'm asking you to believe not just in my ability to bring about the change we need, I'm asking you to believe in yours. I'm asking you to believe in you. Because even when our politics just ain't right, there's a whole lot that is right with America. <p>America is that dad who punches in every morning to put food on the table. America is the mom who's working the graveyard shift to provide for her kids. America is the child who dreams of being the first in his family to go to college. America is the teacher who stays after work and dips into her own pocket for supplies to help that child get there. America is the autoworker who thought she'd never make another car again, and now she can't make them fast enough. America is the construction worker who's helping build more homes and businesses to get solar panels on the top. America is on the move. [<i>Applause</i>] America is on the move. <p>America is not the party we belong to, but the values we share. America is hard work. America is responsibility. America is sacrifice. America is looking out for one another. Let's embrace some economic patriotism that says we rise or fall together as one Nation, as one people. <p>Don't reward companies that ship jobs and profits overseas; reward companies that are investing right here in Milwaukee. Let's make sure our fellow citizens have access to good childcare and preschool and college and health care. Let's make sure women get fair pay. Let's make sure working moms and dads can get a day off if their child is sick or their parents are having a tough time. Let's make sure nobody who is working full time is raising their family in poverty. These ideas are not un-American, they're how we built America&mdash;together. <p>I'll tell you, Milwaukee, the hardest thing in life is changing a stubborn status quo. And it's even harder when it seems like some of the folks in power, all they care about is keeping power. But there are plenty of folks who count on you to get cynical and not vote because you don't think you can make a difference. That's how they're going to stay in power. They believe you won't get involved. They believe you won't organize. They believe you won't vote. And that way, the special interests stay in power. And they will try to divide us, and they'll try to distract you, and they'll try to run the okey-doke on you and bamboozle you and hoodwink you. Don't buy it. Don't buy it. <p>Because despite the cynics, America is on the move. It's making progress. Despite all the opposition, there are workers who have jobs now who didn't have them before. There are families with health insurance who didn't have them before. There are students going to college who couldn't afford it before. There are troops who were in Afghanistan who are coming home. Cynicism is fashionable these days, but cynicism didn't put anybody on the Moon. Cynicism never won a war, it never cured a disease, it never started a business, it never fed a young mind, it never built a road or a bridge. <p>Cynicism is a bad choice. Hope is the better choice. Hope is what gives us courage. Hope is what gave soldiers courage to storm a beach. Hope is what gives young people the strength to march for women's rights and worker's rights and civil rights and voting rights and gay rights and immigration rights. <p>Hope, the belief that there are better days ahead, the belief that together, we can build up our middle class and hand down something better to our kids, that's what built America. And America's best days are still ahead. I believe it. You need to believe it too. Let's get to work. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"197" "\"Thank you. Thank you so much. Hello, Estonia! <i>Tere, Eesti!</i> Thank you, Oskar, for your wonderful introduction and for representing the talent and the energy and the optimism of today's Estonia, especially its young people. And Oskar is sitting next to his father, and his father and I agree that we're getting gray, so we have to make sure that somebody is coming up behind us. Please give Oskar a big round of applause for the great job that he did. <p>To President Ilves and distinguished guests, to the people of Estonia: It is a great pleasure to be with you in this historic city, in this beautiful land. I thank you for the incredible hospitality that you've shown me today. I understand the weather is always like this. [<i>Laughter</i>] My only regret is that I missed this summer's Laulupidu. And I'll try to come back next time and catch it. I bring with me the friendship of the American people, and I am honored to be the first President of the United States to deliver an address like this to the people of Estonia. <p>I just had the opportunity to meet once again with the Presidents of all the Baltic States, and I thank the President of Latvia and Lithuania for being here. We're joined by friends from throughout the region. And I want to say a special welcome to everyone watching this out in Freedom Square. And I'm especially pleased to see so many young people here today. Because, like Oskar, you are fulfilling the dream that your parents and grandparents struggled for, but could only imagine, and that is, living your lives in free and independent and democratic Baltic nations. <p>That dream of freedom endured through centuries of occupation and oppression. It blossomed into independence, only to have it stolen by foreign pacts and secret protocols. It survived the mass deportations that ripped parents from their children. It was defended by Forest Brothers in their resistance and sustained by poets and authors who kept alive your languages and cultures. And here in Estonia, it was a dream that found its most eloquent expression in your voices, on a grassy field not far from here, when Estonians found the courage to stand up against an empire and sing \\"Land of My Fathers, Land That I Love.\\" And Heinz Valk, who is here today, spoke for the entire Singing Revolution when he said, \\"One day, no matter what, we will win!\\" <p>And then, exactly 25 years ago, people across the Baltics came together in one of the greatest displays of freedom and nonviolent resistance that the world has ever seen. On that August evening, perhaps 2 million people stepped out of their homes and joined hands: a human chain of freedom, the Baltic Way. And they stretched down highways and across farmlands, from Tallinn to Riga, to Vilnius. They lit candles, and they sang anthems. Old men and women brought out their flags of independence. And young parents brought their children to teach them that when ordinary people stand together, great change is possible. Here in Estonia, when people joined the line, the password was \\"freedom.\\" As one man said that day: \\"The Berlin Wall is made of brick and concrete. Our wall is stronger.\\" And it was. <p>Within months, that wall in Berlin was pushed open. The next year, the Baltic peoples finally voted in elections. And when the forces of the past made their last grab for power, you stood up. Lithuanians faced down tanks. Latvians manned barricades. Here in Tallinn, citizens rushed to the TV Tower to defend the airwaves of democracy. You won; you reclaimed your countries. And in your new Constitution you declared: \\"The independence and sovereignty of Estonia are timeless and inalienable.\\" <p>But the people of the Baltic nations also knew that freedom needs a foundation of security. So you reached out to join the NATO alliance. And we were proud to welcome you as new allies so that those words of your Constitution, your timeless independence, will always be guaranteed by the strongest military alliance the world has ever known. <p>Today, people working to build their own democracies, from Kiev to Tunis, look to you for inspiration. Your experience cautions that progress is neither easy nor quick. Here in the Baltics, after decades of authoritarian rule, the habits of democracy had to be learned, the institutions of good governance had to be built, economies had to be reformed, foreign forces had to be removed from your territory. <p>And transitions of this magnitude are daunting for any nation. But the Baltics show the world what's possible when free peoples come together for the change that they seek. And in that great contest of ideas&mdash;between freedom and authoritarianism, between liberty and oppression&mdash;your success proves, like that human chain 25 years ago, that our way will always be stronger. <p>We're stronger because we're democracies. We're not afraid of free and fair elections, because true legitimacy can only come from one source, and that is the people. We're not afraid of an independent judiciary, because no one is above the law. We're not afraid of a free press or vibrant debate or a strong civil society, because leaders must be held accountable. We're not afraid to let our young people go online to learn and discover and organize, because we know that countries are more successful when citizens are free to think for themselves. <p>We're stronger because we embrace open economies. Look at the evidence: Here in Estonia, we see the success of free markets, integration with Europe, taking on tough reforms. You've become one of the most wired countries on Earth, a global leader in e-government and high-tech startups. The entrepreneurial spirit of the Estonian people has been unleashed, and your innovations, like Skype, are transforming the world. <p>And we're stronger because we stand together. This year, we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Baltics in NATO. A decade ago, skeptics wondered whether your countries were up to the task. And today, they need only look at our training exercises, where our troops grow even stronger together, shoulder to shoulder. They can look at Afghanistan, where our forces have sacrificed together to keep us safe and where, in just 3 months, the largest operation in NATO history will come to an end, as planned. There's no doubt, the Baltics have made our alliance stronger. <p>And your progress reflects a larger truth. Because of the work of generations, because we've stood together in a great alliance, because people across this continent have forged a European Union dedicated to cooperation and peace, we have made historic progress toward the vision we share: a Europe that is whole and free and at peace. <p>And yet, as we gather here today, we know that this vision is threatened by Russia's aggression against Ukraine. It is a brazen assault on the territorial integrity of Ukraine, a sovereign and independent European nation. It challenges that most basic of principles of our international system: that borders cannot be redrawn at the barrel of a gun; that nations have the right to determine their own future. It undermines an international order where the rights of peoples and nations are upheld and can't simply be taken away by brute force. This is what's at stake in Ukraine. This is why we stand with the people of Ukraine today. Now, let's put to rest, once and for all, the distortions or outdated thinking that has caused this crisis. Our NATO alliance is not aimed \\"against\\" any other nation. We're an alliance of democracies dedicated to our own collective defense. Countries like Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania are not \\"post-Soviet territory.\\" You are sovereign and independent nations with the right to make your own decisions. No other nation gets to veto your security decisions. <p>The protests in Ukraine, on the Maidan, were not led by neo-Nazis or Fascists. They were led by ordinary Ukrainians&mdash;men and women, young and old&mdash;who were fed up with a corrupt regime and who wanted to share in the progress and prosperity that they see in the rest of Europe. And they did not engage in an \\"armed seizure of power.\\" After an agreement was brokered for constitutional reform, the former President then abandoned his office, and Parliament endorsed new elections so that today Ukrainians have a new democratically elected President. And I look forward to welcoming President Poroshenko to the Oval Office this month. He was chosen by the people of Ukraine. <p>It was not the Government in Kiev that destabilized eastern Ukraine, it's been the pro-Russian separatists who are encouraged by Russia, financed by Russia, trained by Russia, supplied by Russia, and armed by Russia. And the Russian forces that have now moved into Ukraine are not on a humanitarian or peacekeeping mission. They are Russian combat forces with Russian weapons in Russian tanks. Now, these are the facts. They are provable; they're not subject to dispute. <p>As a result of state-run propaganda, many Russians have become convinced that the actions taken by their Government is strengthening Russia. But reaching back to the days of the czars, trying to reclaim lands \\"lost\\" in the 19th century, is surely not the way to secure Russia's greatness in the 21st century. It only shows that unrestrained nationalism is the last refuge of those who cannot or will not deliver real progress and opportunity for their own people at home. <p>Let's also be clear where we stand. Just as we refused to accept smaller European nations being dominated by bigger neighbors in the last century, we reject any talk of spheres of influence today. And just as we never accepted the occupation and illegal annexation of the Baltic nations, we will not accept Russia's occupation and illegal annexation of Crimea or any part of Ukraine. <p>As free peoples, as an alliance, we will stand firm and united to meet the test of this moment, and here's how. <p>First, we will defend our NATO allies, and that means every ally. In this alliance, there are no old members or new members, no junior partners or senior partners. There are just allies, pure and simple. And we will defend the territorial integrity of every single ally. Today, more NATO aircraft patrol the skies of the Baltics. More American forces are on the ground training and rotating through each of the Baltic States. More NATO ships patrol the Black Sea. Tonight I depart for the NATO summit in Wales. And I believe our alliance should extend these defensive measures for as long as necessary, because the defense of Tallinn and Riga and Vilnius is just as important as the defense of Berlin and Paris and London. <p>During the long Soviet occupation, the great Estonian poet Marie Under wrote a poem in which she cried to the world: \\"Who'll come to help? Right here, at present, now!\\" And I say to the people of Estonia and the people of the Baltics: Today, we are bound by our treaty alliance; we have a solemn duty to each other. Article 5 is crystal clear: An attack on one is an attack on all. So if, in such a moment, you ever ask again, \\"Who will come to help?,\\" you'll know the answer: the NATO alliance, including the Armed Forces of the United States of America, \\"right here, [at; White House correction.] present, now!\\" We'll be here for Estonia. We will be here for Latvia. We will be here for Lithuania. You lost your independence once before. With NATO, you will never lose it again.<p>Second&mdash;and in addition to the measures we've already taken&mdash;the United States is working to bolster the security of our NATO allies and further increase America's military presence in Europe. The new initiative I proposed in Warsaw this spring includes several elements, and we're working with Congress to get it done. Here in the Baltics, it would mean positioning more American equipment so it's ready if needed. It would mean more training and exercises between our militaries. And it would mean more U.S. forces, including American boots on the ground, continuously rotating through Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania. <p>Third, NATO forces need the ability to deploy even faster in times of crisis. Now, this week our alliance must unite around a new plan to enhance our readiness. And that means we need to step up our defense planning so we're fully prepared for any threat to any ally. It also means we need to have the infrastructure and facilities that can receive rapid reinforcements, including here in the Baltics. We need to enhance NATO's Rapid Response Force so it can deploy even more quickly and not just react to threats, but also deter them. <p>And even as we meet conventional threats, we need to face other challenges. And that includes propaganda campaigns that try to whip up fears and divide people from one another. We reject the idea that people cannot live and thrive together just because they have different backgrounds or speak a different language. And the best antidotes to such distorted thinking are the values that define us. Not just in the Baltics, but throughout Europe, we must acknowledge the inherent dignity and human rights of every person, because our democracies cannot truly succeed until we root out bias and prejudice, both from our institutions and from our hearts. We have to uphold a free press and freedom of speech, because in the end, lies and misinformation are no match for the truth. We have to embrace open and inclusive societies, because our countries are more successful and more prosperous when we welcome the talents of all our people, including minorities. That's part of the work that we must do. That's the example we must set. <p>Fourth, even as we keep our countries strong at home, we need to keep our alliance strong for the future. And that means investing in the capabilities like intelligence and surveillance and reconnaissance and missile defense. And here in Europe, nations need to do more to spur the growth and prosperity that sustains our alliance. To its great credit, Estonia stands out as an ally that contributes its full share&mdash;its full 2 percent of GDP&mdash;to the defense of our alliance. And Latvia and Lithuania have pledged to do the same. So this week&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;that's worth applause. So this week's summit is the moment for every NATO nation to step up and commit to meeting its responsibilities to our alliance. Estonia does it; every ally must do it. <p>Fifth, we must continue to stand united against Russia's aggression in Ukraine. Keep in mind that, repeatedly, President Putin has ignored the opportunity to resolve the crisis in Ukraine diplomatically. The United States, the European Union, our partners around the world have all said we prefer a diplomatic solution. But in light of Russia's unwillingness to seize that opportunity, we have come together to impose major sanctions on Russia for its actions. And make no mistake: Russia is paying a price. Capital is fleeing, foreign investment is plummeting, because investors know that today's Russia is a bad bet, given its behavior. The Russian economy has slipped into recession. Its energy production, which is the engine of the Russian economy, is expected to drop. Its credit rating is near junk status. The ruble just fell to an alltime low. In short, Russia's actions in Ukraine are weakening Russia. Russia's actions are hurting the Russian people. <p>And it doesn't have to be this way. We have no interest in weakening Russia. It's a nation with a rich history and a remarkable people. We do not seek out confrontation with Russia. Over the past two decades, the United States has gone to great lengths to welcome Russia into the community of nations and to encourage its economic success. We welcome a Russia that is strong and growing and contributes to international security and peace and that resolves disputes peacefully, with diplomacy. <p>And in contrast to Russia's isolation and economic woes today, that path, which would include a stable and prosperous Ukraine whose sovereignty is respected, would also ultimately result in greater success and opportunity and respect for Russia. That path remains available to Russia; that path that will deliver truer progress for the Russian people. But it's a path that starts by Russia changing course and leaving Ukraine so that Ukrainians can make their own decisions. And I have no doubt that one of their decisions would be to have strong relations with not just Europe, but also with Russia. But it has to be freely chosen. <p>And this brings me to the final area where our nations have to come together, in our steadfast support for those who reach for their freedom. And yes, that includes the people of Ukraine. And few understand this better than the Baltic peoples. You know from bitter experience that we can never take our security and liberties for granted. We want Ukrainians to be independent and strong and able to make their own choices free from fear and intimidation, because the more countries are free and strong and free from intimidation, the more secure our own liberties are. <p>So the United States will continue to help Ukraine reform, to escape a legacy of corruption and build democratic institutions, to grow its economy, and, like other European nations, diversify its energy sources, because no country should ever be held hostage to another nation that wields energy like a weapon. We'll continue to offer training and assistance to help the Ukrainian military grow stronger as they defend their country. And since ultimately, there is no military solution to this crisis, we will continue to support President Poroshenko's efforts to achieve peace. Because, like all independent nations, Ukraine must be free to decide its own destiny. <p>And this week, NATO must send an unmistakable message in support of Ukraine as well. Our alliance has had a partnership with Ukraine for more than 20 years. Ukrainian forces have served with distinction in NATO operations in the Balkans and Afghanistan. So in Wales, we'll meet as an alliance with President Poroshenko to show that our 28 nations are united in support of Ukraine's sovereignty and right to defend its territory. <p>Now, Ukraine needs more than words. NATO needs to make concrete commitments to help Ukraine modernize and strengthen its security forces. And by the way, we have to do more to help other NATO partners, including Georgia and Moldova, strengthen their defenses as well. And we must reaffirm the principle that has always guided our alliance: For countries that meet our standards and that can make meaningful contributions to allied security, the door to NATO membership will remain open. <p>So this is a moment of testing. The actions of the separatists in Ukraine and Russia evoke dark tactics from Europe's past that ought to be consigned to a distant history: masked men storming buildings, soldiers without flags slipping across the border, violence sending families fleeing and killing thousands, including nearly 300 innocent men, women, and children from all across Europe and around the world when that airliner was shot out of the sky. In the face of violence that seems intractable and suffering that is so senseless, it is easy to grow cynical and, I think, tempting to give in to the notion that peace and security may be beyond our grasp. <p>But I say to all of you here today, especially the young people: Do not give in to that cynicism; do not lose the idealism and optimism that is the root of all great change. Don't ever lose the faith that says, if we want it, if we are willing to work for it, if we stand together, the future can be different, tomorrow can be better. After all, the only reason we're here today in a free and democratic Estonia is because the Estonian people never gave up. <p>You never gave up when the Red Army came in from the east or when the Nazis came in from the west. You never gave up when the Soviets came back or when they sent your best and brightest to the Gulag, never to return. You never gave up through a long occupation that tried to break your spirit and crush your culture. Their tanks were no equal to the moral power of your voices, united in song. Their walls were no match for the strength of your people, united in that unbreakable chain. And like the Poles and Hungarians, the Czechs and the Slovaks, and the East Germans on top of that wall, you were stronger, and you always believed, \\"One day, no matter what, we will win.\\" <p>Today, your example, your victory, gives hope to people all over the world. Yes, there will be setbacks, and there will be frustrations, and there will be moments of doubt and moments of despair. The currents of history ebb and flow, but over time, they flow toward freedom&mdash;more people, in every corner of the Earth, standing up and reaching to claim those rights that are universal. And that's why, in the end, our ideals are stronger. And that's why, in the end, our ideals will win. <p>Dignity will win, because every human being is born equal, with free will and inalienable rights. And any regime or system of government that tries to deny these rights will ultimately fail, and countries that uphold them will only grow stronger. <p>Justice will win, because might does not make right, and the only path to lasting peace is when people know that their dignity will be respected and that their rights will be upheld. And citizens, like nations, will never settle for a world where the big are allowed to bully the small. Sooner or later, they fight back. <p>Democracy will win, because a government's legitimacy can only come from citizens; because in this age of information and empowerment, people want more control over their lives, not less; and because, more than any other form of government ever devised, only democracy, rooted in the sanctity of the individual, can deliver real progress. <p>And freedom will win, not because it's inevitable, not because it is ordained, but because these basic human yearnings for dignity and justice and democracy do not go away. They can be suppressed. At times, they can be silenced, but they burn in every human heart in a place where no regime could ever reach, a light that no army can ever extinguish. And so long as free peoples summon the confidence and the courage and the will to defend the values that we cherish, then freedom will always be stronger, and our ideas will always prevail no matter what. <p>Thank you, and long live our great alliance. Thank you very much. Thank you.\" "
"198" "\"My fellow Americans, tonight I want to speak to you about what the United States will do with our friends and allies to degrade and ultimately destroy the terrorist group known as ISIL. <p>As Commander in Chief, my highest priority is the security of the American people. Over the last several years, we have consistently taken the fight to terrorists who threaten our country. We took out Usama bin Laden and much of Al Qaida's leadership in Afghanistan and Pakistan. We've targeted Al Qaida's affiliate in Yemen and recently eliminated the top commander of its affiliate in Somalia. We've done so while bringing more than 140,000 American troops home from Iraq and drawing down our forces in Afghanistan, where our combat mission will end later this year. Thanks to our military and counterterrorism professionals, America is safer. <p>Still, we continue to face a terrorist threat. We can't erase every trace of evil from the world, and small groups of killers have the capacity to do great harm. That was the case before 9/11, and that remains true today. And that's why we must remain vigilant as threats emerge. At this moment, the greatest threats come from the Middle East and North Africa, where radical groups exploit grievances for their own gain. And one of those groups is ISIL, which calls itself the \\"Islamic State.\\" <p>Now, let's make two things clear: ISIL is not Islamic. No religion condones the killing of innocents. And the vast majority of ISIL's victims have been Muslim. And ISIL is certainly not a state. It was formerly Al Qaida's affiliate in Iraq and has taken advantage of sectarian strife and Syria's civil war to gain territory on both sides of the Iraq-Syrian border. It is recognized by no government, nor by the people it subjugates. ISIL is a terrorist organization, pure and simple. And it has no vision other than the slaughter of all who stand in its way. <p>In a region that has known so much bloodshed, these terrorists are unique in their brutality. They execute captured prisoners. They kill children. They enslave, rape, and force women into marriage. They threatened a religious minority with genocide. And in acts of barbarism, they took the lives of two American journalists, Jim Foley and Steven Sotloff. <p>So ISIL poses a threat to the people of Iraq and Syria and the broader Middle East, including American citizens, personnel, and facilities. If left unchecked, these terrorists could pose a growing threat beyond that region, including to the United States. While we have not yet detected specific plotting against our homeland, ISIL leaders have threatened America and our allies. Our intelligence community believes that thousands of foreigners, including Europeans and some Americans, have joined them in Syria and Iraq. Trained and battle-hardened, these fighters could try to return to their home countries and carry out deadly attacks. <p>I know many Americans are concerned about these threats. Tonight I want you to know that the United States of America is meeting them with strength and resolve. Last month, I ordered our military to take targeted action against ISIL to stop its advances. Since then, we've conducted more than 150 successful airstrikes in Iraq. These strikes have protected American personnel and facilities, killed ISIL fighters, destroyed weapons, and given space for Iraqi and Kurdish forces to reclaim key territory. These strikes have also helped save the lives of thousands of innocent men, women, and children. <p>But this is not our fight alone. American power can make a decisive difference, but we cannot do for Iraqis what they must do for themselves, nor can we take the place of Arab partners in securing their region. And that's why I've insisted that additional U.S. action depended upon Iraqis forming an inclusive Government, which they have now done in recent days. So tonight, with a new Iraqi Government in place, and following consultations with allies abroad and Congress at home, I can announce that America will lead a broad coalition to roll back this terrorist threat. <p>Our objective is clear: We will degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL through a comprehensive and sustained counterterrorism strategy. <p>First, we will conduct a systematic campaign of airstrikes against these terrorists. Working with the Iraqi Government, we will expand our efforts beyond protecting our own people and humanitarian missions so that we're hitting ISIL targets as Iraqi forces go on offense. Moreover, I have made it clear that we will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are. That means I will not hesitate to take action against ISIL in Syria, as well as Iraq. This is a core principle of my Presidency: If you threaten America, you will find no safe haven. <p>Second, we will increase our support to forces fighting these terrorists on the ground. In June, I deployed several hundred American servicemembers to Iraq to assess how we can best support Iraqi security forces. Now that those teams have completed their work and Iraq has formed a Government, we will send an additional 475 servicemembers to Iraq. As I have said before, these American forces will not have a combat mission. We will not get dragged into another ground war in Iraq. But they are needed to support Iraqi and Kurdish forces with training, intelligence, and equipment. We'll also support Iraq's efforts to stand up national guard units to help Sunni communities secure their own freedom from ISIL's control. <p>Across the border, in Syria, we have ramped up our military assistance to the Syrian opposition. Tonight I call on Congress again to give us additional authorities and resources to train and equip these fighters. In the fight against ISIL, we cannot rely on an Asad regime that terrorizes its own people, a regime that will never regain the legitimacy it has lost. Instead, we must strengthen the opposition as the best counterweight to extremists like ISIL, while pursuing the political solution necessary to solve Syria's crisis once and for all. <p>Third, we will continue to draw on our substantial counterterrorism capabilities to prevent ISIL attacks. Working with our partners, we will redouble our efforts to cut off its funding, improve our intelligence, strengthen our defenses, counter its warped ideology, and stem the flow of foreign fighters into and out of the Middle East. And in 2 weeks, I will chair a meeting of the U.N. Security Council to further mobilize the international community around this effort. <p>Fourth, we will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to innocent civilians who have been displaced by this terrorist organization. This includes Sunni and Shia Muslims who are at grave risk, as well as tens of thousands of Christians and other religious minorities. We cannot allow these communities to be driven from their ancient homelands. <p>So this is our strategy. And in each of these four parts of our strategy, America will be joined by a broad coalition of partners. Already, allies are flying planes with us over Iraq, sending arms and assistance to Iraqi security forces and the Syrian opposition, sharing intelligence, and providing billions of dollars in humanitarian aid. Secretary Kerry was in Iraq today meeting with the new Government and supporting their efforts to promote unity. And in the coming days, he will travel across the Middle East and Europe to enlist more partners in this fight, especially Arab nations who can help mobilize Sunni communities in Iraq and Syria to drive these terrorists from their lands. This is American leadership at its best: We stand with people who fight for their own freedom, and we rally other nations on behalf of our common security and common humanity. <p>My administration has also secured bipartisan support for this approach here at home. I have the authority to address the threat from ISIL, but I believe we are strongest as a nation when the President and Congress work together. So I welcome congressional support for this effort in order to show the world that Americans are united in confronting this danger. <p>Now, it will take time to eradicate a cancer like ISIL. And any time we take military action, there are risks involved, especially to the service men and women who carry out these missions. But I want the American people to understand how this effort will be different from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil. This counterterrorism campaign will be waged through a steady, relentless effort to take out ISIL wherever they exist, using our air power and our support for partners' forces on the ground. This strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us while supporting partners on the front lines is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years. And it is consistent with the approach I outlined earlier this year: to use force against anyone who threatens America's core interests, but to mobilize partners wherever possible to address broader challenges to international order. <p>My fellow Americans, we live in a time of great change. Tomorrow marks 13 years since our country was attacked. Next week marks 6 years since our economy suffered its worst setback since the Great Depression. Yet, despite these shocks, through the pain we've felt and the grueling work required to bounce back, America is better positioned today to seize the future than any other nation on Earth. <p>Our technology companies and universities are unmatched. Our manufacturing and auto industries are thriving. Energy independence is closer than it's been in decades. For all the work that remains, our businesses are in the longest uninterrupted stretch of job creation in our history. Despite all the divisions and discord within our democracy, I see the grit and determination and common goodness of the American people every single day, and that makes me more confident than ever about our country's future. <p>Abroad, American leadership is the one constant in an uncertain world. It is America that has the capacity and the will to mobilize the world against terrorists. It is America that has rallied the world against Russian aggression and in support of the Ukrainian peoples' right to determine their own destiny. It is America&mdash;our scientists, our doctors, our know-how&mdash;that can help contain and cure the outbreak of Ebola. It is America that helped remove and destroy Syria's declared chemical weapons so that they can't pose a threat to the Syrian people or the world again. And it is America that is helping Muslim communities around the world not just in the fight against terrorism, but in the fight for opportunity and tolerance and a more hopeful future. <p>America, our endless blessings bestow an enduring burden. But as Americans, we welcome our responsibility to lead. From Europe to Asia, from the far reaches of Africa to war-torn capitals of the Middle East, we stand for freedom, for justice, for dignity. These are values that have guided our Nation since its founding. Tonight I ask for your support in carrying that leadership forward. I do so as a Commander in Chief who could not be prouder of our men and women in uniform: pilots who bravely fly in the face of danger above the Middle East and servicemembers who support our partners on the ground. <p>When we helped to prevent the massacre of civilians trapped on a distant mountain, here's what one of them said: \\"We owe our American friends our lives. Our children will always remember that there was someone who felt our struggle and made a long journey to protect innocent people.\\" <p>That is the difference we make in the world. And our own safety, our own security, depends upon our willingness to do what it takes to defend this Nation and uphold the values that we stand for, timeless ideals that will endure long after those who offer only hate and destruction have been vanquished from the Earth. <p>May God bless our troops, and may God bless the United States of America.\" "
"199" "\"Good morning. Scripture tells us, \\"We count as blessed those who have persevered.\\" <p>Secretary Hagel, General Dempsey, members of our Armed Forces, and most of all, the survivors of that September day and the families of those we lost: Michelle and I are humbled to be with you once again. <p>It has now been 13 years. Thirteen years since the peace of an American morning was broken. Thirteen years since nearly 3,000 beautiful lives were taken from us, including 125 men and women serving here at the Pentagon. Thirteen years of moments they would have shared with us. Thirteen years of memories they would have made. <p>Here, once more, we pray for the souls of those we remember, for you, their families, who love them forever, and for a nation that has been inspired by your example: your determination to carry on, your resolve to live lives worthy of their memories. <p>As Americans, we draw strength from you. For your love is the ultimate rebuke to the hatred of those who attacked us that bright, blue morning. They sought to do more than bring down buildings or murder our people. They sought to break our spirit and to prove to the world that their power to destroy was greater than our power to persevere and to build. But you, and America, proved them wrong. <p>America endures in the strength of your families who, through your anguish, kept living. You have kept alive a love that no act of terror can ever extinguish. You, their sons and daughters, are growing into extraordinary young men and women they knew you could be. By your shining example, your families have turned this day into something that those who attacked us could never abide, and that is a tribute of hope over fear and love over hate. <p>America endures in the tenacity of our survivors. After grievous wounds, you learned to walk again and stand again. After terrible burns, you smiled once more. For you, for our Nation, these have been difficult years. But by your presence here today, in the lives of service that you have led, you embody the truth that no matter what comes our way, America will always come out stronger. <p>America endures in the dedication of those who keep us safe. The firefighter, the officer, the EMT who carries the memory of a fallen partner as they report to work each and every day, prepared to make the same sacrifice for us all. Because of these men and women, Americans now work in a gleaming Freedom Tower. We visit our great cities, we fill our stadiums and cheer for our teams. We carry on, because, as Americans, we do not give in to fear&mdash;ever. <p>America endures in the courage of the men and women who serve under our flag. Over more than a decade of war, this 9/11 generation has answered our country's call, and 3 months from now, our combat mission in Afghanistan will come to an end. Today, we honor all who have made the ultimate sacrifice these 13 years, more than 6,800 American patriots. And we give thanks to those who serve in harm's way to keep our country safe and meet the threats of our time. America endures in that perennial optimism that defines us as a people. Beginning tomorrow, there will be teenagers&mdash;young adults&mdash;who were born after 9/11. It's remarkable. And while these young Americans did not know the horrors of that day, their lives have been shaped by all the days since, a time that has brought us pain, but also taught us endurance and strength; a time of rebuilding, of resilience, and of renewal. What gives us hope&mdash;what gives me hope&mdash;is that it is these young Americans who will shape all the days to come. <p>Thirteen years after small and hateful minds conspired to break us, America stands tall and America stands proud. And guided by the values that sustain us, we will only grow stronger. Generations from now, Americans will still fill our parks, our stadiums, our cities. Generations from now, Americans will still build towers that reach toward the heavens, still serve in Embassies that stand for freedom around the world, still wear the uniform and give meaning to those words written two centuries ago: land of the free, home of the brave. Generations from now, no matter the trial, no matter the challenge, America will always be America. <p>\\"We count as blessed those who have persevered.\\" <p>May God bless your families, who continue to inspire us all. May God bless our Armed Forces and all who serve to keep us safe. And may God continue to bless the United States of America.\" "
"200" "\"Thank you so much. Thank you. Everybody, have a seat. Have a seat. Well, welcome to the White House. Give Ivan a big round of applause for the introduction. Dayna, thank you for sharing your story. And I want to thank all of you for joining President Clinton and me in celebrating this 20th anniversary of AmeriCorps. <p>I want to thank some strong supporters of national service who are here today. We've got Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, who as a young aide to President Clinton&mdash;I mean, they both still look good&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but 20 years ago, helped to write the legislation creating AmeriCorps' 20 years&mdash;20-year legacy. So thank you, Jack, for the great job. <p>You already heard from Wendy Spencer, who is&mdash;she never runs out of energy and is reflective of the spirit of AmeriCorps&mdash;the CEO of the Corporation for National and Community Service. Great job, Wendy. <p>My dear friend, former Senator Harris Wofford, who not only used to run CNCS, but also helped to create VISTA and the Peace Corps. I don't know anybody who's got a greater legacy of creating community and helping people to channel their civic virtues than Harris Wofford. We're so proud of him. <p>Carrie Hessler-Radelet, the new Director of the Peace Corps. Where's Carrie? There she is right there. We've got Congressman John Lewis, who didn't have an AmeriCorps program; just went out and got a whole lot done, which is why I'm standing here. David Price. Senator Martin Heinrich, the first AmeriCorps alum to be elected to the Senate. And everybody who's here who played a part in creating and sustaining AmeriCorps, both in the Clinton administration and the Bush administration and in Congress, and all the service leaders who mobilized and rallied over the years to keep AmeriCorps going. I thank all of you for living a life of active and energetic and engaged citizenship, because it has made America stronger. You have made America stronger because of what you've done. <p>Now, as President Clinton mentioned, not everybody who played an enormous role in this could be here today. Two people in particular who aren't, but who are in our hearts: Eli Segal, who did so much to get the Corporation for National and Community Service up and running two decades ago; and a man whose extraordinary achievements live on because he never stopped asking what he could do for his country, our dear friend Senator Ted Kennedy. His name is on the law that I signed 5 years ago expanding AmeriCorps&mdash;it was one of the last big public events that Teddy did&mdash;a law that's going to give a new generation of Americans more opportunities to give back to their communities and their country. And Teddy's wife Vicki as well as Eli's wife Phyllis are here today as well. We thank you so much for everything that you've done and for your support. <p>Now, as Wendy mentioned, all of you who are here are part of a national event. Since yesterday, 9/11 Day of Service, hundreds of thousands of Americans have taken part in service projects in all 50 States. Michelle and I spent a few hours helping out a school here in DC. Joe Biden volunteered down the street at George Washington University. Today thousands of Americans are taking the pledge as new AmeriCorps members. President George H.W. Bush is swearing in volunteers in Maine. President George W. Bush and Laura Bush have filmed a video that's being shown across the country. <p>So it echoes back to that day in 1994, when President Clinton swore in that first class of AmeriCorps members right here at the White House. And some of the people who are here were in that class, and if you were, you might remember him saying that you were starting a journey that would change your lives forever, that AmeriCorps would change the life of the Nation, that it would give new life to the values that bind us together as Americans. <p>And that was a bold claim. But Bill Clinton is an optimist. [<i>Laughter</i>] And he knew from his own life, as I know from mine, what service can do: the sense of common purpose that it cultivates; the opportunity to join our fellow Americans to work together for something other than just ourselves, for something bigger, for the common good. And so he had high hopes on that bright September day. And he was not the only one. <p>William Consuegra took the AmeriCorps pledge that day. Then he went to work for Youth Harvest in Texas, helping high school students improve their literacy skills. Twenty years later, he's still a public servant, helping communities in New Mexico with community development. <p>Matthew Little took the pledge that day. He went to work for City Year in Boston. There, he says, he discovered a new source of inspiration: \\"Students who came to me with F's and left my homework club with A's.\\" And he's been an educator ever since. <p>Sondra Samuels took that pledge that day. She headed to Philadelphia to join the Weed and Seed Initiative, helping communities reduce violent crime and gang activity. And she says that AmeriCorps taught her \\"that I can look at my country and [I can] actually make it different, not just wish it were different.\\" <p>In Chicago, a bright, eager young woman shared in the hope of that day too. She had recently left her job at a law firm, became the founding executive director of Public Allies in Chicago, a nonprofit that trains young people for careers in public service. And soon after, Public Allies received one of the very first grants that AmeriCorps ever awarded. And that young woman happens to live with me. [<i>Laughter</i>] Her name is Michelle Obama. So the Obama household was on board with AmeriCorps from the start. <p>And for those of you who know my story starting off as a community organizer, I would not be standing here if it were not for service to others and the purpose that service gave my own life. Now, I moved to Chicago to become a community organizer in part&mdash;in parts of that town where steel plants had closed down and hope had dried up. And I wasn't sure what I was doing. I wasn't sure that I'd be successful. I was working with a group of churches out there, and we didn't have a lot of funding. And I think my starting salary was $13,000 a year and gas expenses. <p>But what I found was that with patience and dedicated effort, I could make a difference. It wasn't always 100 percent of what I wanted; sometimes, it was just 20 percent, sometimes, it was just 50 percent. But it turned out that you could nudge history forward. You could shape it. You could see the lives of people that you cared about improving because of this blood and sweat and tears you were putting into it. <p>And then I found a community for myself, and I began to understand what citizenship meant: not just some abstraction, not just words on a page, not just rights and privileges, but duties and responsibilities. And it gave me a sense of direction about how I wanted to live my life. So as it turned out, the idea of making a difference in other people's lives made a difference in mine. It made me whole. It gave me center. It gave me a compass. And that, when I look out on all these young people, Bill, is what's going to happen to them. Most of them are probably already a lot more sophisticated than I was at that time. [<i>Laughter</i>] And probably more gifted and more talented. But that's why when I look out, I can't describe how inspired I am, because in each of you I see unfurling all the incredible, wonderful things that you're going to be doing in your lives. <p>Twenty years after President Clinton signed and swore in that first AmeriCorps class, more than 900,000 Americans have learned the same lesson that I learned by serving through AmeriCorps. And they come from all walks of life: small towns, big cities, all backgrounds, all age groups. They've done everything from deliver emergency relief in the aftermath of disasters to staffing health clinics to&mdash;in underserved communities, to helping veterans find jobs. They've touched millions of lives. They've helped America become stronger and more resilient and more united. <p>So, Bill, you were right. AmeriCorps has changed the life of our Nation. And now it's up to us to make sure it continues. Because we're not just here to celebrate what's already been achieved, we're here to rededicate ourselves to the work that lies ahead. And the world&mdash;we're here to get things done. [<i>Applause</i>] We are here to get things done. <p>My administration has been determined to build on the foundation that President Bush and both&mdash;President Clinton and both Presidents Bush laid. We are determined to help AmeriCorps succeed. We've seen the outcomes that AmeriCorps members produce: improved literacy in the schools where they work. So if we're smart, Congress will fund this calling that's meant so much to so many and keep AmeriCorps strong. <p>And we'll keep doing our part. That's why I created a task force on national service last year: to find new ways to expand and improve national service. We've tested innovations. We're creating new models of partnership. We've reached out to the public&mdash;to the private sector. So AmeriCorps is as effective today as it's ever been. <p>We've created new AmeriCorps programs to address specific needs. For example, FEMA Corps trains and deploys national service members to help communities recover from disasters like hurricanes and tornadoes. School Turnaround AmeriCorps sends talented individuals into underachieving schools. The new Justice AmeriCorps will pair AmeriCorps members who are lawyers and paralegals with unaccompanied immigrant children to get them legal help. STEM AmeriCorps is mobilizing scientists and engineers to inspire young people to discover and tinker and innovate and make things. <p>And we've brought businesses and nonprofits on board. So we've seen again and again how national service helps people&mdash;young people gain valuable skills and training, and employers have noticed. So we want to do more to help talented national service members find good jobs after they wrap up their service. And that's the idea behind an initiative we're announcing today called Employers of National Service. If you are an employer&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;if you're an employer who wants to hire talented, dedicated, patriotic, skilled, tireless, energetic workers, look to AmeriCorps, look to the Peace Corps. <p>And organizations like the Disney Company and American Red Cross and City of Nashville, United Way, others are already signing up. They know what we know: Citizens who perform national service are special. You want them on your team. As of a few minutes ago, that includes our newest members, AmeriCorps class of 2014. So you've got Catherine Stodola who just took the pledge. She's helping homeless veterans find housing through Habitat for Humanity here in Washington. You've got Jay Savoy who took the pledge. And through City Year, she's going to be&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;she's leading a team of tutors for kids like herself in her old neighborhood in Southeast DC. Ivan, who you just heard from, took the pledge and is mentoring young people through Public Allies in Maryland. <p>Seventy-five thousand members of this year's AmeriCorps class will spread out across the country, and they are doing their part to help make America safer and healthier and more fair and more just. Because like all those who serve their country through AmeriCorps, they don't just believe in, but live out a fundamental truth, and that is that people who love their country can change it. <p>That is the genius of America. That is the promise of AmeriCorps. It's one of the reasons I am so committed to this program and why I'm so hopeful about the future. We are proud of you. That goes for all the AmeriCorps members over the years. And I'll always be proud to serve a country where there are such striving, dreaming citizens like all of you. Congratulations. <p>God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you, President Clinton.\" "
"201" "\"As Commander in Chief, my highest priority is the security of the American people. And I've made it clear that those who threaten the United States will find no safe haven. Thanks to our military and counterterrorism professionals, we took out Usama bin Laden, much of Al Qaida's leadership in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and leaders of Al Qaida affiliates in Yemen and Somalia. We've prevented terrorist attacks, saved American lives, and made our homeland more secure. <p>Today, the terrorist threat is more diffuse, from Al Qaida affiliates and other extremists, like ISIL in Syria and Iraq. As I said this week, our intelligence community has not yet detected specific ISIL plots against our homeland. But its leaders have repeatedly threatened the United States. And if left unchecked, these terrorists could pose a growing threat beyond the Middle East, including to the United States. So we're staying vigilant. And we're moving ahead with our strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist organization. <p>To meet a threat like this, we have to be smart. We have to use our power wisely. And we have to avoid the mistakes of the past. American military power is unmatched, but this can't be America's fight alone. And the best way to defeat a group like ISIL isn't by sending a large number of American combat forces to wage a ground war in the heart of the Middle East. That wouldn't serve our interests. In fact, it would only risk fueling extremism even more. <p>What's needed now is a targeted, relentless counterterrorism campaign against ISIL that combines American air power, contributions from allies and partners, and more support to forces that are fighting these terrorists on the ground. And that's exactly what we're doing. <p>We're moving ahead with our campaign of airstrikes against these terrorists, and we're prepared to take action against ISIL in Syria as well. The additional American forces I've ordered to Iraq will help Iraqi and Kurdish forces with the training, intelligence, and equipment they need to take the fight to these terrorists on the ground. We're working with Congress to expand our efforts to train and equip the Syrian opposition. We'll continue to strengthen our defenses here at home. And we'll keep providing the humanitarian relief to help Iraqi civilians who have been driven from their homes and who remain in extreme danger. <p>Because we're leading the right way, more nations are joining our coalition. This week, Arab nations agreed to strengthen their support for the new Iraqi Government and to do their part in the fight against ISIL, including aspects of the military campaign. Saudi Arabia will join the effort to help train and equip moderate Syrian opposition forces. And retired Marine General John Allen, who during the Iraq war worked with Sunnis in Iraq as they fought to reclaim their communities from terrorists, will serve as our Special Envoy to help build and coordinate our growing coalition. <p>Today, every American can be proud of our men and women in uniform who are serving in this effort. When our airstrikes helped break the siege of the Iraq town of Amerli, one Kurdish fighter on the ground said, \\"It would have been absolutely impossible without the American planes.\\" One resident of that city said, \\"Thank you, America.\\" <p>Today, we're showing the world the best of American leadership. We will protect our people. We will stand with partners who defend their countries and rally other nations to meet a common threat. And here at home, 13 years after our country was attacked, we continue to stand tall and proud, because we are Americans and we don't give in to fear. We carry on. And we will never waver in the defense of the country that we love.\" "
"202" "\"Please be seated. Good afternoon, and welcome to the White House. More than four decades ago, in early 1970, an American squad in Vietnam set out on patrol. They marched down a trail, past a rice paddy. Shots rang out and splintered the bamboo above their heads. The lead soldier tripped a wire: a booby trap. A grenade rolled toward the feet of a 20-year-old machine gunner. The pin was pulled, and that grenade would explode at any moment. <p>A few years earlier, on the other side of the country, deep in the jungle, a small group of Americans were crouched on top of a small hill. And it was dark, and they were exhausted; the enemy had been pursuing them for days. And now they were surrounded, and the enemy was closing in on all sides. <p>Two discrete moments, but today we honor two American soldiers for gallantry above and beyond the call of duty at each of those moments: Specialist Donald Sloat, who stood above that grenade, and Command Sergeant Major Bennie Adkins, who fought through a ferocious battle and found himself on that jungle hill. <p>Nearly half a century after their acts of valor, a grateful nation bestows upon these men the highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor. <p>Now, normally, this medal must be awarded within a few years of the action. But sometimes, even the most extraordinary stories can get lost in the fog of war or the passage of time. Yet when new evidence comes to light, certain actions can be reconsidered for this honor, and it is entirely right and proper that we have done so. And that is why we are here today. <p>So before I go any further, I want to thank everyone present here today whose research and testimonies and persistence over so many years finally resulted in these two men deserving the recognition they so richly deserve. I especially want to welcome members of the Medal of Honor Society, as well as two American families whose love and pride has never wavered. <p>Don Sloat grew up in the heart of Oklahoma in a town called Coweta<i>. </i>And he grew big, to over 6'4\\". He loved football and played for a year at a junior college. And then, he decided to join the Army. But when he went to enlist, he didn't pass his physical because of high blood pressure. So he tried again and again and again. In all, he took the physical maybe seven times until he passed, because Don Sloat was determined to serve his country. <p>In Vietnam, Don became known as one of the most liked and reliable guys in his company. Twice in his first months, his patrol was ambushed; both times, Don responded with punishing fire from his machine gun, leaving himself completely vulnerable to the enemy. And both times, he was recognized for his bravery. Or as Don put it in a letter home, \\"I guess they think [that] I'm really gung-ho or something.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And then one morning, Don and his squad set out on patrol, past that rice paddy, down that trail, when those shots rang out. When the lead soldier's foot tripped that wire and set off the booby trap, the grenade rolled right to Don's feet. And at that moment, he could have run. At that moment, he could have ducked for cover. But Don did something truly extraordinary. He reached down, and he picked that grenade up. And he turned to throw it, but there were Americans in front of him and behind him, inside the kill zone. So Don held on to that grenade, and he pulled it close to his body. And he bent over it. And then, as one of the men said, \\"all of a sudden there was a boom.\\" <p>The blast threw the lead soldier up against a boulder. Men were riddled with shrapnel. Four were medevaced out, but everyone else survived. Don had absorbed the brunt of the explosion with his body. He saved the lives of those next to him. And today, we're joined by two men who were with him on that patrol: Sergeant William Hacker and Specialist Michael Mulheim. <p>For decades, Don's family only knew that he was killed in action. They'd heard that he had stepped on a landmine. All those years, this Gold Star family honored the memory of their son and brother, whose name is etched forever on that granite wall not far from here. Late in her life, Don's mother, Evelyn, finally learned the full story of her son's sacrifice. And she made it her mission to have Don's actions properly recognized. <p>Now, sadly, nearly 3 years ago, Evelyn passed away. But she always believed&mdash;she knew&mdash;that this day would come. She even bought a special dress to wear to this ceremony. We are honored that Don&mdash;and his mom&mdash;are represented here today by Don's brother and sisters and their families. On behalf of this American family, I'd ask Don's brother, Dr. Bill Sloat, to come forward for the reading of the citation and accept the gratitude of our Nation. <p>[<i>At this point, Lt. Cmdr. Jillian C. Malzone, USCG, Coast Guard</i> <i>Aide to the President, read the citation. The President then presented the medal, assisted by Lt. Col. Michael P. Wagner, USA, Army Aide to the President.</i>] <p>At this point, I'd like to ask Bennie Adkins to come join me on stage. <p>Now, let me just say, the first thing you need to know is, when Bennie and I met in the Oval Office, he asked if he could sign back up. [<i>Laughter</i>] His lovely wife was not amused. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Most days, you can find Bennie at home down in Opelika, Alabama, tending his garden or his pontoon boat out on the lake. He's been married to Mary for 58 years. He's a proud father of five, grandfather of six; at 80, still going strong. A couple years ago, he came here to the White House with his fellow veterans for a breakfast we had on Veterans Day. He tells folk he was the only person he knows who has spilled his dessert in the White House. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I just have to correct you, that makes two of us. [<i>Laughter</i>] I've messed up my tie. I've messed up my pants. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But in the spring of 1966, Bennie was just 32 years old, on his second tour in Vietnam. He and his fellow Green Berets were at an isolated camp along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. A huge North Vietnamese force attacked, bombarding Bennie and his comrades with mortars and white phosphorus. At a time, it was nearly impossible to move without being wounded or killed. But Bennie ran into enemy fire again and again: to retrieve supplies and ammo; to carry the wounded to safety; to man the mortar pit, holding off wave after wave of enemy assaults. Three times, explosions blasted him out of that mortar pit, and three times, he returned. <p>I have to be honest, in a battle and daring escape that lasted 4 days, Bennie performed so many acts of bravery, we actually don't have time to talk about all of them. Let me just mention three. <p>On the first day, Bennie was helping load a wounded American onto a helicopter. A Vietnamese soldier jumped onto the helo trying to escape the battle and aimed his weapon directly at the wounded soldier, ready to shoot. Bennie stepped in, shielded his comrade, placing himself directly in the line of fire, helping to save his wounded comrade. <p>At another point in the battle, Bennie and a few other soldiers were trapped in the mortar pit, covered in shrapnel and smoking debris. Their only exit was blocked by enemy machine gun fire. So Bennie thought fast. He dug a hole out of the pit and snuck out the other side. As another American escaped through that hole, he was shot in the leg. An enemy soldier charged him, hoping to capture a live POW, and Bennie fired, taking out that enemy and pulling his fellow American to safety. <p>By the third day of battle, Bennie and a few others had managed to escape into the jungle. He had cuts and wounds all over his body, but he refused to be evacuated. When a rescue helicopter arrived, Bennie insisted that others go instead. And so on the third night, Bennie, wounded and bleeding, found himself with his men up on that jungle hill, exhausted and surrounded, with the enemy closing in. And after all they had been through, as if it weren't enough, there was something more&mdash;you can't make this up&mdash;there in the jungle, they heard the growls of a tiger. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>It turns out that tiger might have been the best thing that happened to Bennie in those&mdash;during those days because, he says, \\"the North Vietnamese were more scared of that tiger than they were of us.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] So the enemy fled. Bennie and his squad made their escape. And they were rescued, finally, the next morning. <p>In Bennie's life, we see the enduring service of our men and women in uniform. He went on to serve a third tour in Vietnam, a total of more than two decades in uniform. After he retired, he earned his master's degree&mdash;actually not one, but two. Opened up an accounting firm. Taught adult education classes. Became national commander of the Legion of Valor, a veterans organization. So he has earned his retirement, despite what he says. [<i>Laughter</i>] He's living outside Auburn. And yes, he is a fan of the Auburn Tigers, although I did a poll of the family, and there are some Crimson Tide fans here. [<i>Laughter</i>] So there's obviously some divisions. <p>But Bennie will tell you that he owes everything to the men he served with in Vietnam, especially the five who gave their lives in that battle. Every member of his unit was killed or wounded. Every single one was recognized for their service. Today we're joined by some of the men who served with Bennie, including Major John Bradford, the soldier that Bennie shielded in that helicopter, and Major Wayne Murray, the soldier Bennie saved from being captured. And I'd ask them and all our Vietnam veterans who are here today to please stand or raise your hand and to be recognized. <p>And now I'd ask that the citation be read. <p>[<i>Lt. Cmdr. Malzone read the citation. The President then presented the medal, assisted by Lt. Col. Wagner.</i>] <p>Over the decades, our Vietnam veterans didn't always receive the thanks and respect they deserved. That's a fact. But as we have been reminded again today, our Vietnam vets were patriots and are patriots. You served with valor. You made us proud. And your service is with us for eternity. So no matter how long it takes, no matter how many years go by, we will continue to express our gratitude for your extraordinary service. May God watch over Don Sloat and all those who have sacrificed for our country. May God keep safe those who wear our country's uniform and veterans like Bennie Adkins. May God continue to bless the United States of America. <p>At this point, I'd ask our chaplain to return to the stage for the benediction. <p>[<i>Maj. Gen. Donald L. Rutherford, USA, Army Chief of Chaplains, said a prayer.</i>] <p>And at this point, I would welcome everybody to join the Sloat family and the Adkins family for a reception. I hear the food is pretty good. [<i>Laughter</i>] And once again, to all of you who serve and your families who serve along with them, the Nation is grateful. And your Commander in Chief could not be prouder. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"203" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. Please be seated. I want to thank Dr. Frieden and everybody here at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention for welcoming me here today. Tom and his team just gave me an update on the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, our efforts to help mobilize the international community to fight it, and the steps that we're taking to keep people here at home safe. <p>Tom and his team are doing outstanding work. And between the specialists they have on the ground in West Africa and here at headquarters, they've got hundreds of professionals who are working tirelessly on this issue. This is the largest international response in the history of the CDC. After this, I'll be meeting with some of these men and women, including some who recently returned from the frontlines of the outbreak. And they represent public service at its very best. And so I just want them to know how much the American people appreciate them. Many of them are serving far away from home, away from their families. They are doing heroic work and serving in some unbelievably challenging conditions, working through exhaustion, day and night, and many have volunteered to go back. So we are very, very proud of them. <p>Their work and our efforts across the Government is an example of what happens when America leads in confronting some major global challenges. Faced with this outbreak, the world is looking to us, the United States, and it's a responsibility that we embrace. We're prepared to take leadership on this to provide the kinds of capabilities that only America has and to mobilize the world in ways that only America can do. That's what we're doing as we speak. <p>First and foremost, I want the American people to know that our experts, here at the CDC and across our Government, agree that the chances of an Ebola outbreak here in the United States are extremely low. We've been taking the necessary precautions, including working with countries in West Africa to increase screening at airports so that someone with the virus doesn't get on a plane for the United States. In the unlikely event that someone with Ebola does reach our shores, we've taken new measures so that we're prepared here at home. We're working to help flight crews identify people who are sick, and more labs across our country now have the capacity to quickly test for the virus. We're working with hospitals to make sure that they are prepared and to ensure that our doctors, our nurses, and our medical staff are trained, are ready, and are able to deal with a possible case safely. <p>And here, I've got to commend everybody at Emory University Hospital. I just had the opportunity to meet with Doctors Gartland and Ribner and members of their team and the nurses who&mdash;sorry, doctors, but having been in hospitals, I know&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;they're the ones really doing the work. And I had a chance to thank them for their extraordinary efforts in helping to provide care for the first Americans who recently contracted the disease in Africa. The first two of those patients were released last month and continue to improve. And it's a reminder for the American people that, should any cases appear in the United States, we have world-class facilities and professionals ready to respond. And we have effective surveillance mechanisms in place. I should mention, by the way, that I had a chance to see Dr. Brantly in the Oval Office this morning. And although he is still having to gain back some weight, he looks great. He looks strong, and we are incredibly grateful to him and his family for the service that he has rendered to people who are a lot less lucky than all of us. <p>As we all know, however, West Africa is facing a very different situation, especially in the hardest hit countries: Liberia, Sierra Leone, and in Guinea. Tom and others recently returned from the region, and the scenes that they describe are just horrific. More than 2,400 men, women, and children are known to have died, and we strongly suspect that the actual death toll is higher than that. Hospitals, clinics, and the few treatment centers that do exist have been completely overwhelmed. An already very weak public health system is near collapse in these countries. Patients are being turned away, and people are literally dying in the streets. <p>Now, here's the hard truth: In West Africa, Ebola is now an epidemic of the likes that we have not seen before. It's spiraling out of control. It is getting worse. It's spreading faster and exponentially. Today, thousands of people in West Africa are infected. That number could rapidly grow to tens of thousands. And if the outbreak is not stopped now, we could be looking at hundreds of thousands of people infected, with profound political and economic and security implications for all of us. So this is an epidemic that is not just a threat to regional security, it's a potential threat to global security if these countries break down, if their economies break down, if people panic. That has profound effects on all of us, even if we are not directly contracting the disease. <p>And that's why, 2 months ago, I directed my team to make this a national security priority. We're working this across our entire Government, which is why today I'm joined by leaders throughout my administration, including from my national security team. <p>And we've devoted significant resources in support of our strategy with four goals in mind. Number one, to control the outbreak. Number two, to address the ripple effects of local economies and communities to prevent a truly massive humanitarian disaster. Number three, to coordinate a broader global response. And number four, to urgently build up a public health system in these countries for the future, not just in West Africa, but in countries that don't have a lot of resources generally. <p>Now, this is a daunting task. But here's what gives us hope. The world knows how to fight this disease. It's not a mystery. We know the science. We know how to prevent it from spreading. We know how to care for those who contract it. We know that if we take the proper steps, we can save lives. But we have to act fast. We can't dawdle on this one. We have to move with force and make sure that we are catching this as best we can, given that it has already broken out in ways that we had not seen before. <p>So today I'm announcing a major increase in our response. At the request of the Liberian Government, we're going to establish a military command center in Liberia to support civilian efforts across the region, similar to our response after the Haiti earthquake. It's going to be commanded by Major General Darryl Williams, a commander of our armed&mdash;Army forces in Africa. He just arrived today and is now on the ground in Liberia. And our forces are going to bring their expertise in command and control, in logistics, in engineering. And our Department of Defense is better at that, our Armed Services are better at that, than any organization on Earth. <p>We're going to create an airbridge to get health workers and medical supplies into West Africa faster. We're going to establish a staging area in Senegal to help distribute personnel and aid on the ground more quickly. We are going to create a new training site to train thousands of health workers so they can effectively and safely care for more patients. Personnel from the U.S. Public Health Service will deploy to the new field hospitals that we're setting up in Liberia. And USAID will join with international partners and local communities in a Community Care Campaign to distribute supplies and information kits to hundreds of thousands of families so they can better protect themselves. <p>We're also going to build additional treatment units, including new isolation spaces and more than a thousand beds. And in all our efforts, the safety of our personnel will remain a top priority. Meanwhile, our scientists continue their urgent research in the hope of finding new treatments and perhaps vaccines. And today I'm calling on Congress to approve the funding that we've requested so that we can carry on with all these critical efforts. <p>Today, the United States is doing even more. But this is a global threat, and it demands a truly global response. International organizations just have to move faster than they have up until this point. More nations need to contribute experienced personnel, supplies, and funding that's needed, and they need to deliver on what they pledge quickly. Charities and individual philanthropists have given generously, and they can make a big difference. And so we're not restricting these efforts to governmental organizations, we also need NGOs and private philanthropies to work with us in a coordinated fashion in order to maximize the impact of our response. <p>This week, the United States will chair an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council. Next week, I'll join U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to continue mobilizing the international community around this effort. And then, at the White House, we're going to bring more nations together to strengthen our global health security so that we can better prevent, detect, and respond to future outbreaks before they become epidemics. <p>This is actually something that we had announced several months ago at the G-7 meeting. We determined that this has to be a top priority; this was before the Ebola outbreak. We anticipated the fact that in many of these countries with a weak public health system, if we don't have more effective surveillance, more effective facilities on the ground, and are not helping poor countries in developing their ability to catch these things quickly, that there was at least the potential of seeing these kinds of outbreaks. And sadly, we now see that our predictions were correct. It gives more urgency to this effort&mdash;a global health initiative&mdash;that we have been pushing internationally. <p>Let me just close by saying this: The scenes that we're witnessing in West Africa today are absolutely gut wrenching. In one account over the weekend, we read about a family in Liberia. The disease had already killed the father. The mother was cradling a sick and listless 5-year-old son. Her other son, 10-years-old, was dying too. They finally reached a treatment center, but they couldn't get in. And said a relative, \\"We are just sitting.\\" <p>And these men and women and children are just sitting, waiting to die, right now. And it doesn't have to be this way. <p>The reality is that this epidemic is going to get worse before it gets better. But right now the world still has an opportunity to save countless lives. Right now the world has the responsibility to act, to step up, and to do more. The United States of America intends to do more. We are going to keep leading in this effort. We're going to do our part, and we're going to continue to make sure that the world understands the need for them to step alongside us as well in order for us to not just save the lives of families like the one I just discussed, but ultimately, to make sure that this doesn't have the kinds of spillover effects that become even more difficult to control. <p>So thank you very much to the entire team that's already doing this work. And please know that you've got your President and Commander in Chief behind you. All right? <p>Thank you.\" "
"204" "\"Hello, everybody! It is a perfect night for a picnic. I'm thrilled that everybody is here. I took off my tie; I noticed some of you didn't get the memo. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I know that a lot of you are coming straight from work. I'm not going to make a long speech. I want to shake as many hands as possible. I hope you guys are having a wonderful time. <p>I want to start off by saying thank you to House Members&mdash;Republican and Democrat&mdash;who came together today to pass an important component on our strategy for dealing with this terrible terrorist organization known as ISIL. And I want to in particular thank Speaker Boehner and Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi for showing us that when it comes to America's national security, America is united. So I very much appreciate all of you in the efforts that you made there. <p>And that brings up this more general point. Look, we've gone through, just in the last decade and a half, the worst attack on our homeland in our history, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. We continue to face significant challenges. But I came from Tampa, where we have the Central Command and talked to our troops this morning. And in talking to them and seeing the dedication and the effort and professionalism that they make, I was reminded once again, as I'm reminded every time I travel around the country, that the American people are good and they are strong and they are resilient. And because of them, we bounce back from anything. <p>And America is now positioned better than we could have ever imagined if we continue to act in the interests of all of us and if every once in a while we're willing to set aside politics and try to get something done. There's no doubt that we can make sure our schools work better. There's no doubt that we can make sure that our roads and our bridges and our infrastructure works the way it should. There's no doubt that, since we still have the most innovative companies in the world, that we can succeed and that we can continue to put money into research and development and cure diseases and continue to lead the world when it comes to not just security, but also dealing with issues like Ebola and making sure that more people are safe and well housed and well fed and children and girls are getting the kind of education they deserve. <p>All these things we can do. And so, hopefully, a picnic like this just reminds us of the fact that there are a lot of people all across the country counting on us to be able to work together. That doesn't mean we don't have strong passions and strong arguments, but it also means that every once in a while we've got to set those aside, embrace compromise, and try to get some stuff done. That's what people are looking for, and today, I think, on national security at least, we showed that we could. <p>The only other thing I want to say is thank you to the families. It is&mdash;Michelle was traveling to St. Jude's today to be with the amazing kids there and the doctors and staff who help families going through really tough diseases, but she would be the first one to testify that being married to a politician is not easy. [<i>Laughter</i>] And being the partner of a politician, being the child of a politician, it's hard. And sometimes, you see your loved one attacked, and sometimes, you see them not appreciated, and they're away too much, and you're having to shoulder some of the burdens of family. And so to all the spouses, all the children, everybody who helps support our public servants and our Members of Congress, I just want to say thank you to you as well for the great job that you do. We really, really appreciate it. <p>And finally, please try to eat more, because we always have leftovers after this thing. [<i>Laughter</i>] All right? I am going to swing down the rope line. I want to shake as many hands as I can. I will tell you in advance that selfies are a little tough just because if I'm doing 2,000 selfies, then we won't be done until, like, 10 in the evening. I will make exceptions for little people, but you have to actually be little. [<i>Laughter</i>] And I mean young, I don't mean short. [<i>Laughter</i>] All right? <p>So thank you very much, everybody. Have a great time. God bless you. God bless America. Thank you.\" "
"205" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, MacDill! I want to thank General Austin for his introduction&mdash;Lloyd, for your exceptional leadership. Were you about to sneak off the stage? <p><i>General Lloyd J. Austin III, USA, commander, U.S. Central Command.</i> Yes, sir. Yes, sir, I was. <p><i>The President.</i> Go ahead. [<i>Laughter</i>] The&mdash;it's better when Lloyd is not standing next to me because I don't look small. [<i>Laughter</i>] General Austin has done such extraordinary work, both commanding our forces in Iraq, today as the commander of CENTCOM. I want to thank somebody else for his own lifetime of service to America, first as a soldier who fought in Vietnam, now as our Secretary of Defense: Chuck Hagel. Give it up for Chuck. <p>Chuck was here a few weeks ago to welcome the new head of Special Operations Command, General Joe Votel. Give Joe a big round of applause. For those of you who don't know, 13 years ago, Joe led his team of Army Rangers as they jumped into Afghanistan to establish our first base there by jumping out of the plane alongside them. So Joe is a tough guy, and he knows what he is doing, and I can't think of somebody who is more qualified to head up our Special Forces. And so we want to thank Joe for accepting this assignment. <p>Your Member of Congress, Kathy Castor, is here. Give Kathy a big round of applause. There she is right there. Your wing commander, Colonel Dan Tulley. Your senior enlisted leaders: Command Sergeant Major Chris Greca; Command Sergeant Major Chris Faris; Chief Master Sergeant Matt Lusson. And most of all, I want to salute all the spouses and military families on base, because let's be honest, they're the force behind the force. I spent time with some of them last night, and it's clear why our military is the finest fighting force in the history of the world, and it's because our military families are serving right alongside you. <p>I know we've got some Air Force in the house. It's great to be at the home of the Sixth Air Mobility Wing. The 927th Air Refueling Wing. CENTCOM. SOCOM. We've got some Army here. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> Navy. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> Marines. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> Coast Guard. [<i>Laughter</i>] We love our Coast Guard. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, I'm not here to give a long speech. But what I really wanted to do is come down and just shake some hands. I just received a briefing from General Austin and met with your commanders. I met with representatives from more than 40 nations. It is a true team effort here at MacDill. And I came here to say the same thing that I've been saying to troops on bases across this country, around the world, and a few months ago in Bagram, and that is, thank you. On behalf of the American people, I want to thank all of you for your service; I want to thank all of you for your sacrifice; I want to thank you for your commitment to each other and your commitment to our country. As your Commander in Chief, I could not be more proud of each and every one of you. <p>For nearly 75 years, the men and women of MacDill have lived a commitment to \\"Airmen, Mission, and Community.\\" You've supported our troops through each generation of challenges. And as home to both Central Command and Special Operations Command, you have shouldered some of the heaviest responsibilities in dealing with the challenges of this new century. <p>For more than a decade&mdash;ever since that awful September morning 13 years ago, ever since Joe and his Rangers took that jump a month later&mdash;you and all our men and women in uniform have borne the burden of war. Some of you&mdash;our quiet professionals, our Special Forces&mdash;were among the first to go. When the decision was made to go into Iraq, you were there. When we refocused the fight back to Afghanistan, you were there. You have served with skill and honor and commitment and professionalism. <p>And some of you carry the wounds of these wars. I know some of you lost friends. Today we remember all who have given their lives in these wars. And we stand with their families, who've given more than most Americans can ever imagine. And we honor those sacrifices forever. <p>But here is what I want every single one of you to know: Because of you&mdash;this 9/11 generation of heroes has done everything asked of you and met every mission tasked to you&mdash;we are doing what we set out to do. Because of you, Usama bin Laden is no more. Because of you, the core Al Qaida leadership in Afghanistan and Pakistan has been decimated. Because of you, Afghans are reclaiming their communities; Afghan forces have taken the lead for their country's security. In 3 months, because of you, our combat mission will be over in Afghanistan and our war in Afghanistan will come to a responsible end. That's because of you. <p>You and our counterterrorism professionals have prevented terrorist attacks. You've saved American lives. You've made our homeland more secure. But we've always known that the end of the war in Afghanistan didn't mean the end of threats or challenges to America. <p>Here at MacDill, you knew this and have known this as well as anybody. You played a central role in our combat and counterterrorism operations. You make sure our troops and pilots get what they need in order to get the job done. You train forces around the world so countries can take responsibility for their own security. The Sixth Air Mobility Wing is continuously deployed, supporting our humanitarian and combat operations around the world, \\"Ready to Defend.\\" And your work is as vital as ever. <p>Because in an uncertain world full of breathtaking change, the one constant is American leadership. In a world where technology provides a small group of killers with the ability to do terrible harm, it is America that has the capacity and the will to mobilize the world against terrorists, including the group in Syria and Iraq known as ISIL. Our intelligence community, as I said last week, has not yet detected specific plots from these terrorists against America. But its leaders have repeatedly threatened America and our allies. And right now these terrorists pose a threat to the people of Iraq, the people of Syria, the broader Middle East, including our personnel, our Embassies, our consulates, our facilities there. And if left unchecked, they could pose a growing threat to the United States. <p>So last month, I gave the order for our military to begin taking targeted action against ISIL. And since then, our brave pilot and crews, with your help, have conducted more than 160 airstrikes against these terrorists. Because of your efforts, we've been able to protect our personnel and our facilities and kill ISIL fighters and given space for Iraqi and Kurdish forces to reclaim key territory. They've helped our partners on the ground break ISIL sieges, helped rescue civilians cornered on a mountain, helped save the lives of thousands of innocent men, women, and children. That's what you've done. <p>Now going forward, as I announced last week, we're going to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL through a comprehensive and sustained counterterrorism strategy. And whether in Iraq or in Syria, these terrorists will learn the same thing that the leaders of Al Qaida already know: We mean what we say; our reach is long; if you threaten America, you will find no safe haven. We will find you eventually. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> But&mdash;and this is something I want to emphasize&mdash;this is not and will not be America's fight alone. One of the things we've learned over this last decade is, America can make a decisive difference. But I want to be clear: The American forces that have been deployed to Iraq do not and will not have a combat mission. They will support Iraqi forces on the ground as they fight for their own country against these terrorists. <p>As your Commander in Chief, I will not commit you and the rest of our Armed Forces to fighting another ground war in Iraq. After a decade of massive ground deployments, it is more effective to use our unique capabilities in support of partners on the ground so they can secure their own countries' futures. And that's the only solution that will succeed over the long term. <p>We'll use our air power. We will train and equip our partners. We will advise them, and we will assist them. We will lead a broad coalition of countries who have a stake in this fight. Because this is not simply America versus ISIL; this is the people of the region fighting against ISIL. It is the world rejecting the brutality of ISIL in favor of a better future for our children and our children's children, all of them. <p>But we're not going to do this alone. And the one thing we have learned is, is that when we do things alone and the countries&mdash;the people of those countries&mdash;aren't doing it for themselves, as soon as we leave we start getting into the same problems. So we've got to do things differently. <p>This is why we've spent the past several weeks building a coalition to aid in these efforts. And because we're leading in the right way, more nations are joining us. Overall, more than 40 countries so far have offered assistance to the broad campaign against ISIL. Some nations will assist from the air, and already, France and the United Kingdom are flying with us over Iraq, with others committed to join this effort. <p>Some nations will help us support the forces fighting these terrorists on the ground. And already Saudi Arabia has agreed to host our efforts to train and equip Syrian opposition forces. Australia and Canada will send military advisers to Iraq. German paratroopers will offer training. Other nations have helped resupply arms and equipment to forces in Iraq, including the Kurdish Peshmerga. <p>Arab nations have agreed to strengthen their support for Iraq's new Government and to do their part in all the aspects of the fight against ISIL. And our partners will help to cut off ISIL funding and gather intelligence and stem the flow of foreign fighters into and out of the Middle East. And meanwhile, nearly 30 nations have helped us with humanitarian relief to help innocent civilians who've been driven from their homes, whether they are Sunni or Shia or Christian or Yazidi or any other religious minority. <p>And yesterday at the White House, I met with an outstanding American leader, retired Marine General John Allen. He worked with Iraqi tribal leaders as they fought to reclaim their own communities from terrorists, and he's going to serve as America's Special Envoy to build and coordinate this incredible coalition. And I've called on Congress to make sure you've got all the authorities and resources you need to get the job done. <p>But the point is, we cannot do for the Iraqis what they must do for themselves. We can't take the place of Arab partners in securing their own region and a better future for their own people. We can't do it for them, but this is an effort that calls on America's unique abilities&mdash;and responsibilities&mdash;to lead. <p>In a world that's more crowded and more connected, it is America that has the unique capability to mobilize against an organization like ISIL. In a world full of broader social challenges, it is America that has the unique capability and know-how to help contain and combat a threat like Ebola, the epidemic in Africa. And yesterday, on top of all that we're already doing to help, I announced a major boost to our response. We're establishing a military command center in Liberia, at the request of their Government, to support civilian efforts across the region. And Major General Darryl Williams, commander of our Army forces in Africa, arrived yesterday. He's already on the ground. And our Armed Forces will bring their unique, unrivaled expertise in command and control and logistics and engineering, including creating an airbridge to get health workers and medical supplies into West Africa faster. And obviously, in all our efforts, the safety of our personnel will remain a top priority. <p>In the nation of Liberia, one person who heard this news yesterday was reported to say: \\"We have been praying to get the disease wiped out of our country. So if the coming of U.S. troops will help us get that done, we [will] be happy.\\" And that's the story across the board. If there is a hurricane, if there is a typhoon, if there is some sort of crisis, if there is an earthquake, if there's a need for a rescue mission, when the world is threatened, when the world needs help, it calls on America. Even the countries that complain about America&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;when they need help, who do they call? <p><i>Audience members.</i> America. <p><i>The President.</i> They call us. And then America calls on you. <p>To all the service men and women here and around the world: We ask a lot of you. And any mission involves risk. And any mission separates you from your families. And sending our servicemembers into harm's way is not a decision I ever take lightly; it is the hardest decision I make as President. Nothing else comes close. I do it only when I know the mission is vital to the security of this country that we love. I do it only because I know that you're the best there is at what you do. And frankly, there just aren't a lot of other folks who can perform in the same ways. In fact, there are none. And there are some things only we can do. There are some capabilities only we have. <p>That's because of you: your dedication, your skill, your work, your families supporting you, your training, your command structure. Our Armed Forces are unparalleled and unique. And so when we've got a big problem somewhere around the world, it falls on our shoulders. And sometimes, that's tough. But that's what sets us apart. That's why we're America. That's what the stars and stripes are all about. And between war and recession, this has been a challenging start to this new century. We've been busy. This has not been an easy 14 years. And many of you came of age in these years. But I want you to know, as I stand here with you today, I am as confident as I have ever been that this century, just like the last century, will be led by America. It will be and is an American century. <p>At home, we're bouncing back, better positioning ourselves to win the future than any nation on Earth. Overseas, we're moving forward, answering the call to lead. And even when it seems like our politics is just dividing us, I want you to remember that when it comes to supporting you and your families, the American people stand united. We support you. We are proud of you. We are in awe of your skill and your service. Only 1 percent of Americans may wear the uniform and shoulder the weight of special responsibilities that you do, but 100 percent of Americans need to support you and your families&mdash;100 percent. <p>This is a moment of American leadership, and thanks to you, it is a moment that we are going to meet. And I will keep standing up for your interests and for our security and for the human rights and dignity of people wherever they live. And we're going to keep on working with our allies and partners to take out the terrorists who threaten us wherever they hide. Because in stark contrast to those who only know how to kill and maim and tear down, we keep on building up and offering a future of progress and hope. And like the generations before us, we're willing to defend this country we love. We're willing to help others on this planet that we share. We're protected by patriots like you. And for all those reasons, the United States of America will remain the greatest force for freedom that the world has ever known. <p>Thank you very much, everybody. I'm proud of you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"206" "\"Good evening. Today the United States continues to build a broad international coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy the terrorist group known as ISIL. As part of the air campaign, France will join in strikes against ISIL targets in Iraq. And as one of our oldest and closest allies, France is a strong partner in our efforts against terrorism, and we're pleased that French and American servicemembers will once again work together on behalf of our shared security and our shared values. <p>More broadly, more than 40 countries&mdash;including Arab nations&mdash;have now offered assistance as part of this coalition. This includes support for Iraqi forces, strengthening the Iraqi Government, providing humanitarian aid to Iraqi civilians, and doing their part in the fight against ISIL. <p>Here at home, I'm pleased that Congress&mdash;a majority of Democrats and a majority of Republicans, in both the House and the Senate&mdash;have now voted to support a key element of our strategy: our plan to train and equip the opposition in Syria so they can help push back these terrorists. As I said last week, I believe that we're strongest as a nation when the President and Congress work together. And I want to thank leaders in Congress for the speed and seriousness with which they approached this urgent issue, in keeping with the bipartisanship that is the hallmark of American foreign policy at its best. <p>These Syrian opposition forces are fighting both the brutality of ISIL terrorists and the tyranny of the Asad regime. We had already ramped up our assistance, including military assistance, to the Syrian opposition. With this new effort, we'll provide training and equipment to help them grow stronger and take on ISIL terrorists inside Syria. This program will be hosted outside of Syria, in partnership with Arab countries, and it will be matched by our increasing support for Iraqi Government and Kurdish forces in Iraq. <p>This is in keeping with a key principle of our strategy: The American forces that have been deployed to Iraq do not and will not have a combat mission; their mission is to advise and assist our partners on the ground. As I told our troops yesterday, we can join with allies and partners to destroy ISIL without American troops fighting another ground war in the Middle East. <p>The strong bipartisan support in Congress for this new training effort shows the world that Americans are united in confronting the threat from ISIL, which has slaughtered so many innocent civilians. With their barbaric murder of two Americans, these terrorists thought they could frighten us, or intimidate us, or cause us to shrink from the world, but today they're learning the same hard lesson of petty tyrants and terrorists who have gone before. <p>As Americans, we do not give in to fear. And when you harm our citizens, when you threaten the United States, when you threaten our allies, it doesn't divide us, it unites us. We pull together, we stand together, to defend this country that we love and to make sure justice is done, as well as to join with those who seek a better future of dignity and opportunity for all people. And today, our strikes against these terrorists continue. We're taking out their terrorists. We're destroying their vehicles and equipment and stockpiles. And we salute our dedicated pilots and crews who are carrying out these missions with great courage and skill. <p>As Commander in Chief, I could not be more proud of their service. As I told some of our troops yesterday, the American people are united in our support for them and for their families. And as we go forward, as one Nation, I'd ask all Americans to keep our forces and their families in their thoughts and prayers. Thanks very much.\" "
"207" "\"Thank you so much, everybody. Please have a seat. Well, welcome to the White House, everybody. And thank you to Joe Biden not just for the introduction, not just for being a great Vice President, but for decades, since long before he was in his current office, Joe has brought unmatched passion to this cause. And&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. He has. <p>And at a time when domestic violence was all too often seen as a private matter, Joe was out there saying that this was unacceptable. Thanks to him and so many others, last week, we were able to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the law Joe wrote, a law that transformed the way we handle domestic abuse in this country: the Violence Against Women Act. <p>And we're here to talk today about an issue that is a priority for me, and that's ending campus sexual assault. I want to thank all of you who are participating. I particularly want to thank Lilly for her wonderful presentation and grace. I want to thank her parents for being here. As a father of two daughters, I on the one hand am enraged about what has happened; on the other hand, am empowered to see such an incredible young woman be so strong and do so well. And we're going to be thrilled watching all of the great things she is going to be doing in her life. So the&mdash;we're really proud of her. <p>I want to thank the White House Council on Women and Girls. Good Job. Valerie, thank you. I want to thank our White House Adviser on Violence Against Women, the work that you do every day partnering with others to prevent the outrage, the crime of sexual violence. <p>We've got some outstanding lawmakers with us. Senator Claire McCaskill is right here from the great State of Missouri, who I love. And we've got Dick Blumenthal from the great State of Connecticut, as well as Congresswoman Susan Davis. So thank you so much, I'm thrilled to have you guys here. <p>I also want to thank other Members of Congress who are here and have worked on this issue so hard for so long. A lot of the people in this room have been on the front lines in fighting sexual assault for a long time. And along with Lilly, I want to thank all the survivors who are here today and so many others around the country. Lilly, I'm sure, took strength from a community of people&mdash;some who came before, some who were peers&mdash;who were able to summon the courage to speak out about the darkest moment of their lives. They endure pain and the fear that too often isolates victims of sexual assault. So when they give voice to their own experiences, they're giving voice to countless others&mdash;women and men, girls and boys&mdash;who still suffer in silence. <p>So to the survivors who are leading the fight against sexual assault on campuses, your efforts have helped to start a movement. I know that, as Lilly described, there are times where the fight feels lonely, and it feels as if you're dredging up stuff that you'd rather put behind you. But we're here to say today, it's not on you. This is not your fight alone. This is on all of us, every one of us, to fight campus sexual assault. You are not alone, and we have your back, and we are going to organize campus by campus, city by city, State by State. This entire country is going to make sure that we understand what this is about and that we're going to put a stop to it. And this is a new school year. We've been working on campus sexual assault for several years, but the issue of violence against women is now in the news every day. We've started to, I think, get a better picture about what domestic violence is all about. People are talking about it. Victims are realizing they're not alone. Brave people have come forward; they're opening up about their own experiences. <p>And so we think today's event is all that more relevant, all that more important for us to say that campus sexual assault is no longer something we as a nation can turn away from and say that's not our problem. This is a problem that matters to all of us. <p>An estimated one in five women has been sexually assaulted during her college years&mdash;one in five. Of those assaults, only 12 percent are reported, and of those reported assaults, only a fraction of the offenders are punished. And while these assaults overwhelmingly happen to women, we know that men are assaulted too. Men get raped. They're even less likely to talk about it. We know that sexual assault can happen to anyone, no matter their race, their economic status, sexual orientation, gender identity. And LGBT victims can feel even more isolated, feel even more alone. <p>For anybody whose once normal, everyday life was suddenly shattered by an act of sexual violence, the trauma, the terror can shadow you long after one horrible attack. It lingers when you don't know where to go or who to turn to. It's there when you're forced to sit in the same class or stay in the same dorm with the person who raped you; when people are more suspicious of what you were wearing or what you were drinking, as if it's your fault, not the fault of the person who assaulted you. It's a haunting presence when the very people entrusted with your welfare fail to protect you. <p>Now, students work hard to get into college. I know. I'm watching Malia right now. She's a junior. [<i>Laughter</i>] She's got a lot of homework. [<i>Laughter</i>] And parents can do everything they can to support their kids' dreams of getting a good education. When they finally make it onto campus, only to be assaulted, that's not just a nightmare for them and their families; it's not just an affront to everything they've worked so hard to achieve. It is an affront to our basic humanity. It insults our most basic values as individuals and families and as a nation. We are a nation that values liberty and equality and justice. And we're a people who believe every child deserves an education that allows them to fulfill their God-given potential, free from fear of intimidation or violence. And we owe it to our children to live up to those values. So my administration is trying to do our part. <p>First of all, 3 years ago, we sent guidance to every school district, every college, every university that receives Federal funding, and we clarified their legal obligations to prevent and respond to sexual assault. And we reminded them that sexual violence isn't just a crime, it is a civil rights violation. And I want to acknowledge Secretary of Education Arne Duncan for his department's work in holding schools accountable and making sure that they stand up for students. <p>Number two, in January, I created a White House task force to prevent&mdash;a Task Force To Protect Students From Sexual Assault. Their job is to work with colleges and universities on better ways to prevent and respond to assaults, to lift up best practices. And we held conversations with thousands of people: survivors, parents, student groups, faculty, law enforcement, advocates, academics. In April, the Task Force released the first report, recommending a number of best practices for colleges and universities to keep our kids safe. And these are tested, and they are commonsense measures, like campus surveys to figure out the scope of the problem, giving survivors a safe place to go and a trusted person to talk to, training school officials in how to handle trauma. Because when you read some of the accounts, you think, what were they thinking? I mean, you just get a sense of too many people in charge dropping the ball, fumbling something that should be taken with the most&mdash;the utmost seriousness and the utmost care. <p>Number three, we're stepping up enforcement efforts and increasing the transparency of our efforts. So we're reviewing existing laws to make sure they're adequate. And we're going to keep on working with educational institutions across the country to help them appropriately respond to these crimes. <p>So that's what we have been doing, but there's always more that we can do. And today we're taking a step and joining with people across the country to change our culture and help prevent sexual assault from happening. Because that's where prevention&mdash;that's what prevention is going to require. We've got to have a fundamental shift in our culture. <p>As far as we've come, the fact is that from sports leagues to pop culture to politics, our society still does not sufficiently value women. We still don't condemn sexual assault as loudly as we should. We make excuses. We look the other way. The message that sends can have a chilling effect on our young women. <p>And I've said before, when women succeed, America succeeds. Let me be clear, that's not just true in America. If you look internationally, countries that oppress their women are countries that do badly. Countries that empower their women are countries that thrive. <p>And so this is something that requires us to shift how we think about these issues. One letter from a young woman really brought this point home. Katherine Morrison, a young student from Youngstown, Ohio, she wrote: \\"How are we supposed to succeed when so many of our voices are being stifled? How can we succeed when our society says that as a woman, it's your fault if you are at a party or walked home alone. How can we succeed when people look at women and say, 'You should have known better,' or, 'Boys will be boys'?\\" <p>And Katherine is absolutely right. Women make up half this country, half its workforce, more than half of our college students. They are not going to succeed the way they should unless they are treated as true equals and are supported and respected. And unless women are allowed to fulfill their full potential, America will not reach its full potential. So we've got to change. <p>And this is not just the work of survivors, it's not just the work of activists. It's not just the work of college administrators. It's a responsibility of the soccer coach and the captain of the basketball team and the football players. And it's on fraternities and sororities, and it's on the editor of the school paper and the drum major in the band. And it's on the English department and the engineering department, and it's on the high schools and the elementary schools, and it's on teachers, and it's on counselors, and it's on mentors, and it's on ministers. <p>It's on celebrities and sports leagues and the media to set a better example. And it's on parents and grandparents and older brothers and sisters to sit down young people and talk about this issue. <p>And it's not just on the parents of young women to caution them. It is on the parents of young men to teach them respect for women. And it's on grown men to set an example and be clear about what it means to be a man. <p>It is on all of us to reject the quiet tolerance of sexual assault and to refuse to accept what's unacceptable. And we especially need our young men to show women the respect they deserve and to recognize sexual assault and to do their part to stop it. Because most young men on college campuses are not perpetrators. But the rest&mdash;we can't generalize across the board. But the rest of us can help stop those who think in these terms and shut stuff down. And that's not always easy to do with all the social pressures to stay quiet or go along; you don't want to be the guy who's stopping another friend from taking a woman home even if it looks like she doesn't or can't consent. Maybe you hear something in the locker room that makes you feel uncomfortable or see something at a party that you know isn't right, but you're not sure whether you should stand up, not sure it's okay to intervene. <p>Here&mdash;and I think Joe said it well. The truth is, it's not just okay to intervene, it is your responsibility. It is your responsibility to speak your mind. It is your responsibility to tell your buddy when he's messing up. It is your responsibility to set the right tone when you're talking about women, even when women aren't around, maybe especially when they're not around. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And it's not just men who should intervene, women should also speak up when something doesn't look right, even if the men don't like it. It's all of us taking responsibility. Everybody has a role to play. <p>And in fact, we're here with Generation Progress to launch, appropriately enough, a campaign called \\"It's On Us.\\" I mean, the idea is to fundamentally shift the way we think about sexual assault. So we're inviting colleges and universities to join us in saying, we are not tolerating this anymore: not on our campuses, not in our community, not in this country. And the campaign is building on the momentum that's already being generated by college campuses by the incredible young people around the country who have stepped up and are leading the way. I couldn't be prouder of them. <p>And we're also joined by some great partners in this effort, including the Office of Women's Health, the college sports community, media platforms. We've got universities who have signed up, including, by the way, our military academies, who are represented here today. So the goal is to hold ourselves and each other accountable and to look out for those who don't consent and can't consent. And anybody can be a part of this campaign. <p>So the first step on this is to go to ItsOnUs.org&mdash;that's ItsOnUs.org. Take a pledge to help keep women and men safe from sexual assault. It's a promise not to be a bystander to the problem, but to be part of the solution. I took the pledge. Joe took the pledge. You can take the pledge. You can share it on social media; you can encourage others to join us. <p>And this campaign is just part of a broader effort, but it's a critical part, because even as we continue to enforce our laws and work with colleges to improve their responses and to make sure that survivors are taken care of, it won't be enough unless we change the culture that allows assault to happen in the first place. <p>And I'm confident we can. I'm confident because of incredible young people like Lilly who speak out for change and empower other survivors. They inspire me to keep fighting. I'm assuming they inspire you as well. And this is a personal priority not just as a President, obviously, not just as a husband and a father of two extraordinary girls, but as an American who believes that our Nation's success depends on how we value and defend the rights of women and girls. <p>So I'm asking all of you, join us in this campaign. Commit to being part of the solution. Help make sure our schools are safe havens where everybody, men and women, can pursue their dreams and fulfill their potential. Thank you so much for all the great work.\" "
"208" "\"Hello, everybody. Thank you! Thank you so much! All right, everybody, have a seat. Have a seat. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. I am Barack, also known as Michelle's husband. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's good to see all of you. I see so many friends in the room and just incredible leaders from all across the country. <p>Speaking of leaders, I want to thank Debbie for the great work she is doing to keep our party strong. Nobody anywhere works harder than Debbie Wasserman Schultz. I want to thank her for her incredible efforts. <p>I also want to thank the CEO of the DNC, Amy Dacey. Give Amy a big round of applause. And to the cofounders of the Women's Leadership Forum, Cynthia Friedman and Carol Pensky. Where did they go? There they are. <p>Now, in addition to Debbie, you've heard some extraordinary leaders over the last few days. I already mentioned one, Michelle. [<i>Laughter</i>] Kirsten Gillibrand and Jill Biden and Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi. And apparently, only me and Joe are the guys that are speaking. That's okay; we're leaning in. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>November 4 is 46 days away&mdash;46 days. And every day reminds us how much we have to fight for. Every day reminds us how much we have to protect. But over the last few months, world events have reminded us&mdash;all of us that some things in this world are bigger than politics. <p>We've seen that for all the challenges we've been through at home, America remains the one indispensable nation in the world. When the world is threatened, when the world needs help, the world looks to us, to America. Even the folks who badmouth us look to us. America is leading the effort to rally the world against Russian aggression. America is leading the fight to contain and combat an Ebola epidemic in Africa. America is leading the coalition that will degrade and ultimately destroy the terrorist group known as ISIL. And as Americans, we welcome these responsibilities, we don't shy away from them. <p>Our doctors, our volunteers, our diplomats, our servicemembers, they put themselves in harm's way. They don't represent Democrats or Republicans first, they represent America first. And for all the divisions and all the discord that's inherent in a democracy like ours&mdash;although, sometimes in this town, we get a little carried away with it&mdash;I continue to see the determination and resilience and fundamental goodness of the ordinary American every single day. <p>And that's why I'm more confident than ever about our country's future. Yes, we live in a time of enormous challenges. Thirteen years ago last week, this country was attacked. Six years ago this week sparked the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. And yet, despite all these shocks, through all the pain, all the difficulty, all the challenges, for all the gritty, grueling work that was required for America to bounce back, America is positioned better today than at any time to seize the future. We're better positioned than any nation on Earth to help shape a better world for our kids and our grandkids. And it's not just that we have, by far, the world's strongest and most capable military. It's that we've worked tirelessly to not only recover from crisis, but to rebuild a more durable economy. There are times when I'm watching the news and I'm wondering whether they've been paying attention. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Our businesses have created more than 10 million new jobs over the last 30&mdash;54 months. This is the longest uninterrupted stretch of private sector job growth in American history. Last year, the number of children living in poverty fell by 1.4 million. We've cut the deficit by more than half. We're producing clean energy at a rate we've never seen before. Our auto industry is selling more cars than any time since 2006. Our high school graduation rate, it is at a record high. More young people are earning college degrees than ever before. Millions more Americans have quality, affordable health insurance they can count on. Manufacturing is bouncing back. <p>By almost every economic measure, we are better off today than we were when I took office. And that's not an exaggeration, those are facts. And thanks to the resilience of working Americans and the leaders you helped elect and the policies that we put in place, this country we love has recovered faster and come farther than almost any other advanced nation on Earth. And for the first time in more than a decade: you ask business leaders worldwide where should you be investing your money, the world's number-one place to invest is not China, it is the United States of America. And our lead is growing. <p>So there are enormous reasons to be optimistic about America. We've got the best cards. [<i>Laughter</i>] We've got the best hand. We've come so far. But the question on our minds today, 46 days before an election, is, where do we go from here? What does our future look like? <p>And in the coming weeks, the American people will see two very different visions of this country. One vision says that our economy grows best from the top down. If we tilt the Tax Code in favor of those at the very top, if we let the big banks and the polluters and the credit card companies do whatever they want, if we shrink investments in things like education and technology, if we make it harder for striving young immigrants to come here, then somehow, all that is going to add up to prosperity for everybody. It will all trickle down. <p>Another vision says that our economy grows best from the middle out; that if we give people a fair shot by investing in things like education; that if we ask people to pay their fair share so we can afford investments in basic science and research and infrastructure; if we ask big banks and credit card companies to play by the same rules to protect consumers and prevent another financial crisis; if we welcome striving, dreaming, young talent to our shores, then our businesses will grow and our middle class will thrive, and that will be good for everybody. That's a different vision. <p>And in case you didn't figure it out, the second vision is better. [<i>Laughter</i>] If you look at our history, that's the right vision. Whenever that's the direction that we move this country, everybody succeeds, everybody thrives. We don't succeed when we chase a top-down economic theory that says you're on your own. We do better when we embrace an economic patriotism that says we're all in this together. <p>And look, as Democrats, we don't agree on everything. But we share a vision of an America where opportunity is open to all who are willing to work for it. An America where we think beyond just the short term and we think about long-term investments in American energy and American infrastructure, American manufacturing, American innovation that unleashes new jobs and new industries. We think about an America where workers have the chance to earn new skills that lead directly to a good job. We dream of an America where our children have the chance to graduate from school fully prepared for the global competition that they're going to face. An America where hard work pays off with higher incomes for the middle class, for&mdash;with a minimum wage that actually is a wage you can live on, and yes, with affordable health insurance for everybody. That's the vision that we embrace, and it speaks to something my mother taught me, which is you can measure how well a country does by how well it treats its women. <p>It is remarkable that at a time when women are about half of our workforce, the primary breadwinners in more families than ever before, that some folks still talk about women's issues as if they're something separate over there, and economics is over here. That's nonsense. We do better when we field a full team. When women succeed, America succeeds. It's pretty straightforward. And just to continue the sports analogy&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;it wouldn't make much sense if you gave half the team really good equipment&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and the other half was saddled with bad equipment. You wouldn't succeed if half your team operated by one set of rules and the other half operated with another set of rules. <p>Earlier today Joe Biden and I launched a new initiative called \\"It's On Us,\\" to help confront the crisis of sexual assault on college campuses. And in addition to all the work that we're doing to enforce the law and lift up best practices, we want to also change the culture. And so corporations and citizens and colleges and universities and men as well as women have a responsibility to create a culture where women's basic human rights are protected and her talent and potential is given the value it deserves. That's part of our vision for how America succeeds. <p>And government has a responsibility there. Part of expanding opportunity for all is getting rid of policies that belong in the \\"Mad Men\\" era. [<i>Laughter</i>] We need to update. It's 2014. A mom or a dad deserves a day off to care for a sick child or an aging parent without running into hardship. Women deserve equal pay for equal work. That should be pretty straightforward. All of us deserve workplaces where childcare and flexibility and decent wages aren't seen as a bonus, as a fringe benefit, but rather part of the basic social compact that we're in. <p>I talked about some of these issues at our first-ever Working Families Summit a few months ago. And before the summit started, some reporters asked me, isn't this sort of political? [<i>Laughter</i>] Family leave, childcare, fair pay, higher wages&mdash;isn't this sort of political? [<i>Laughter</i>] Well, I'm&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and I said, well, it's not political in the sense that it's not relevant. It's not political in the sense that it's just spin. It's not political in the sense that it's just catering to a quote, unquote, \\"special interest.\\" <p>We're talking about half the population. [<i>Laughter</i>] We're talking about families that depend on that half of the population. This is about getting the most out of our Nation's talent. It's about preparing our kids for the global economic competition that they'll face and rebuilding a middle class that hasn't seen a real raise in 15 years. It's about fulfilling the basic idea: here in America, you can make it if you try. <p>So it's not politics in the narrow, cramped sense, but yes, it's politics in the big sense of us organizing ourselves to try to move our country forward. The work we do is bigger than partisan politics. And I believe that for all that is wrong with our politics right now, there's so much that's right with America that if we could just create a government and a politics that spoke to common sense and what was important for ordinary Americans, we'd do great. And I see it in individual Americans everywhere I go. And when I think about America, I think about the doctor who returns from the front lines of a deadly outbreak and then volunteers to go right back. Or the pilot flying over a distant land, risking everything in order to keep us safe and free. Or the military spouse who doesn't wear the uniform, never asks for credit, but who serves our country every day. America isn't the party we belong to. We're not born Democrats or Republicans. America is the values we share: hard work and responsibility and sacrifice and looking out for one another. <p>And so there is one brand of politics that we've gotten accustomed to, which is mean and nasty and polarizing, but there's another sense of politics in terms of civic participation and us having a common vision for the future and being willing to work for it and recognizing that there are things that are bigger than each of us. <p>Don't let anybody tell you that working and organizing and voting for the values that built this country isn't worth it. It is worth it. Because despite the cynics&mdash;and boy, we sure have a lot of them; sometimes, I think Washington is the capital of cynicism&mdash;but despite those cynics, America is making progress. Despite unyielding opposition, there are workers with jobs who didn't have them before. There are families with health insurance who didn't have it before. There are students in college who couldn't afford it before. There are troops who served tour after tour who are home now with their families. <p>And I know cynicism is fashionable these days. But cynicism did not put an astronaut on the Moon, did not win a war, has never cured a disease, didn't start a business, did not feed a young mind, was not responsible for making sure that workers had rights and women had rights and civil rights were enforced in this country. That wasn't produced by cynicism. Cynicism is a choice. Hope is a better choice. <p>And so today I'm asking the same thing I asked in 2008. I'm asking you to choose hope. Hope is what gave soldiers courage to storm a beach. Hope is what gave young people the strength to march for women's rights and worker's rights and civil rights and voting rights and gay rights and immigrant rights. Hope is the better choice, the belief that there are better days. And if we work together and organize together and vote together, then we can build up our middle class and hand down something better to our kids. <p>Hope is what built America. I've never been more confident that America's best days are still ahead, but we've got to work for it, and we've got to have faith in it. And you know what gives me faith is, we've got a whole bunch of strong women who are ready to work for it and have faith. <p>Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. Thank you.\" "
"209" "\"Over the past week, the United States has continued to lead our friends and allies in the strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy the terrorist group known as ISIL. As I've said before, our intelligence community has not yet detected specific plots from these terrorists against America. Right now they pose a threat to the people of Iraq, Syria, and the broader Middle East. But its leaders have threatened America and our allies. And if left unchecked, they could pose a growing threat to the United States. <p>So, last month, I gave the order for our military to begin taking targeted action against ISIL. Since then, American pilots have flown more than 170 airstrikes against these terrorists in Iraq. And France has now joined us in these airstrikes. <p>And going forward, we won't hesitate to take action against these terrorists in Iraq or in Syria. But this is not America's fight alone. I won't commit our troops to fighting another ground war in Iraq or in Syria. It's more effective to use our capabilities to help partners on the ground secure their own countries' futures. We will use our air power. We will train and equip our partners. We will advise, and we will assist. And we'll lead a broad coalition of nations who have a stake in this fight. This isn't America versus ISIL, this is the people of that region versus ISIL. It's the world versus ISIL. <p>We've been working to secure bipartisan support for this strategy here at home, because I believe that we are strongest as a nation when the President and Congress work together. We've been consulting closely with Congress. And last week, Secretary of State Kerry, Secretary of Defense Hagel, and military leaders worked to gain their support for our strategy. <p>A majority of Democrats and a majority of Republicans in both the House and the Senate have now approved a first, key part of our strategy by wide margins. They've given our troops the authority they need to train Syrian opposition fighters so that they can fight ISIL in Syria. Those votes sent a powerful signal to the world: Americans are united in confronting this danger. And I hope Congress continues to make sure our troops get what they need to get the job done. <p>Meanwhile, because we're leading the right way, more nations are joining our coalition. Over 40 countries have offered to help the broad campaign against ISIL so far, from training and equipment to humanitarian relief, to flying combat missions. And this week, at the United Nations, I'll continue to rally the world against this threat. <p>This is an effort that America has the unique ability to lead. When the world is threatened, when the world needs help, it calls on America. And we call on our troops. Whether it's to degrade and ultimately destroy a group of terrorists or to contain and combat a threat like the Ebola epidemic in Africa, we ask a lot of our troops. But while our politics may be divided at times, the American people stand united around supporting our troops and their families. This is a moment of American leadership. And thanks to them, it is a moment that we will meet. <p>Thanks.\" "
"210" "\"Good morning, everybody. Last night, on my orders, America's Armed Forces began strikes against ISIL targets in Syria. Today the American people give thanks for the extraordinary service of our men and women in uniform, including the pilots who flew these missions with the courage and professionalism that we've come to expect from the finest military that the world's ever known. <p>Earlier this month, I outlined for the American people our strategy to confront the threat posed by the terrorist group known as ISIL. I made clear that as part of this campaign, the United States would take action against targets in both Iraq and Syria so that these terrorists can't find safe haven anywhere. I also made clear that America would act as part of a broad coalition. And that's exactly what we've done. <p>We were joined in this action by our friends and partners: Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Bahrain, and Qatar. America is proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with these nations on behalf of our common security. <p>The strength of this coalition makes it clear to the world that this is not America's fight alone. Above all, the people and governments in the Middle East are rejecting ISIL and standing up for the peace and security that the people of the region and the world deserve. <p>Meanwhile, we will move forward with our plan supported by bipartisan majorities in Congress, to ramp up our effort to train and equip the Syrian opposition, who are the best counterweight to ISIL and the Asad regime. And more broadly, over 40 nations have offered to help in this comprehensive effort to confront this terrorist threat: to take out terrorist targets, to train and equip Iraqi and Syrian opposition fighters who are going up against ISIL on the ground, to cut off ISIL's financing, to counter its hateful ideology, and to stop the flow of fighters into and out of the region. <p>Last night we also took strikes to disrupt plotting against the United States and our allies by seasoned Al Qaida operatives in Syria who are known as the Khorosan Group. And once again, it must be clear to anyone who would plot against America and try to do Americans harm that we will not tolerate safe havens for terrorists who threaten our people. <p>I've spoken to leaders in Congress, and I'm pleased that there is bipartisan support for the actions that we are taking. America is always stronger when we stand united, and that unity sends a powerful message to the world that we will do what's necessary to defend our country. <p>Over the next several days, I will have the opportunity to meet with Prime Minister Abadi of Iraq and with friends and allies at the United Nations to continue to building support for the coalition that is confronting this serious threat to our peace and security. The overall effort will take time. There will be challenges ahead. But we're going to do what's necessary to take the fight to this terrorist group, for the security of the country and the region and for the entire world. <p>Thanks. God bless our troops. God bless America.\" "
"211" "\"Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, fellow leaders: For all the immediate challenges that we gather to address this week&mdash;terrorism, instability, inequality, disease&mdash;there's one issue that will define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other, and that is the urgent and growing threat of a changing climate. <p>Five years have passed since many of us met in Copenhagen. And since then, our understanding of climate change has advanced, both in the deepening science that says this once-distant threat has moved \\"firmly into the present\\" and into the sting of more frequent extreme weather events that show us exactly what these changes may mean for future generations. <p>No nation is immune. In America, the past decade has been our hottest on record. Along our eastern coast, the city of Miami now floods at high tide. In our West, wildfire season now stretches most of the year. In our heartland, farms have been parched by the worst drought in generations and drenched by the wettest spring in our history. A hurricane left parts of this great city dark and underwater. And some nations already live with far worse. Worldwide, this summer was the hottest ever recorded, with global carbon emissions still on the rise. <p>So the climate is changing faster than our efforts to address it. The alarm bells keep ringing. Our citizens keep marching. We cannot pretend we do not hear them. We have to answer the call. We know what we have to do to avoid irreparable harm. We have to cut carbon pollution in our own countries to prevent the worst effects of climate change. We have to adapt to the impacts that, unfortunately, we can no longer avoid. And we have to work together as a global community to tackle this global threat before it is too late. <p>We cannot condemn our children, and their children, to a future that is beyond their capacity to repair. Not when we have the means&mdash;the technological innovation and the scientific imagination&mdash;to begin the work of repairing it right now. <p>As one of America's Governors has said, \\"We are the first generation to feel the impact of climate change and the last generation that can do something about it.\\" So today I am here personally, as the leader of the world's largest economy and its second largest emitter, to say that we have begun to do something about it. <p>The United States has made ambitious investments in clean energy and ambitious reductions in our carbon emissions. We now harness 3 times as much electricity from the wind and 10 times as much from the sun as we did when I came into office. Within a decade, our cars will go twice as far on a gallon of gas, and already, every major automaker offers electric vehicles. We've made unprecedented investments to cut energy waste in our homes and our buildings and our appliances, all of which will save consumers billions of dollars. And we are committed to helping communities build climate-resilient infrastructure. <p>So, all told, these advances have helped create jobs, grow our economy, and drive our carbon pollution to its lowest levels in nearly two decades, proving that there does not have to be a conflict between a sound environment and strong economic growth. Over the past 8 years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution by more than any other nation on Earth. But we have to do more. Last year, I issued America's first climate action plan to double down on our efforts. Under that plan, my administration is working with states and utilities to set first-ever standards to cut the amount of carbon pollution our power plants can dump into the air. And when completed, this will mark the single most important and significant step the United States has ever taken to reduce our carbon emissions. <p>Last week alone, we announced an array of new actions in renewable energy and energy efficiency that will save consumers more than $10 billion on their energy bills and cut carbon pollution by nearly 300 million metric tons through 2030. That's the equivalent of taking more than 60 million cars off the road for one year. <p>I also convened a group of private sector leaders who have agreed to do their part to slash consumption of dangerous greenhouse gases known as HFCs: slash them 80 percent by 2050. And already, more than a hundred nations have agreed to launch talks to phase down HFCs under the Montreal Protocol, the same agreement the world used successfully to phase out ozone-depleting chemicals. <p>And this is something that President Xi of China and I have worked on together. Just a few minutes ago, I met with Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli and reiterated my belief that as the two largest economies and emitters in the world, we have a special responsibility to lead. That's what big nations have to do. <p>And today I call on all countries to join us, not next year or the year after that, but right now, because no nation can meet this global threat alone. The United States has engaged more allies and partners to cut carbon pollution and prepare for the impacts we cannot avoid. All told, American climate assistance now reaches more than 120 nations around the world. We're helping more nations skip past the dirty phase of development, using current technologies, not duplicating the same mistakes and environmental degradation that took place previously. <p>We're partnering with African entrepreneurs to launch clean energy projects. We're helping farmers practice climate-smart agriculture and plant more durable crops. We're building international coalitions to drive action, from reducing methane emissions from pipelines to launching a free trade agreement for environmental goods. And we have been working shoulder to shoulder with many of you to make the Green Climate Fund a reality. <p>But let me be honest. None of this is without controversy. In each of our countries, there are interests that will be resistant to action. And in each country, there is a suspicion that if we act and other countries don't, that we will be at an economic disadvantage. But we have to lead. That is what the United Nations and this General Assembly is about. <p>Now, the truth is, is that no matter what we do, some populations will still be at risk. The nations that contribute the least to climate change often stand to lose the most. And that's why, since I took office, the United States has expanded our direct adaptation assistance eightfold, and we're going to do more. <p>Today I'm directing our Federal agencies to begin factoring climate resilience into our international development programs and investments. And I'm announcing a new effort to deploy the unique scientific and technological capabilities of the United States, from climate data to early-warning systems. So this effort includes a new partnership that will draw on the resources and expertise of our leading private sector companies and philanthropies to help vulnerable nations better prepare for weather-related disasters and better plan for long-term threats like steadily rising seas. <p>Yes, this is hard. But there should be no question that the United States of America is stepping up to the plate. We recognize our role in creating this problem; we embrace our responsibility to combat it. We will do our part, and we will help developing nations do theirs. But we can only succeed in combating climate change if we are joined in this effort by every nation, developed and developing alike. Nobody gets a pass. <p>The emerging economies that have experienced some of the most dynamic growth in recent years have also emitted rising levels of carbon pollution. It is those emerging economies that are likely to produce more and more carbon emissions in the years to come. So nobody can stand on the sidelines on this issue. We have to set aside the old divides. We have to raise our collective ambition, each of us doing what we can to confront this global challenge. <p>This time, we need an agreement that reflects economic realities in the next decade and beyond. It must be ambitious, because that's what the scale of this challenge demands. It must be inclusive, because every country must play its part. And yes, it must be flexible, because different nations have different circumstances. <p>Five years ago, I pledged America would reduce our carbon emissions in the range of 17 percent below 2005 levels by the year 2020. America will meet that target. And by early next year, we will put forward our next emission target, reflecting our confidence in the ability of our technological entrepreneurs and scientific innovators to lead the way. <p>So today I call on all major economies to do the same. For I believe, in the words of Dr. King, that there is such a thing as being too late. And for the sake of future generations, our generation must move toward a global compact to confront a changing climate while we still can. <p>This challenge demands our ambition. Our children deserve such ambition. And if we act now, if we can look beyond the swarm of current events and some of the economic challenges and political challenges involved, if we place the air that our children will breathe and the food that they will eat and the hopes and dreams of all posterity above our own short-term interests, we may not be too late for them. <p>While you and I may not live to see all the fruits of our labor, we can act to see that the century ahead is marked not by conflict, but by cooperation; not by human suffering, but by human progress; and that the world we leave to our children, and our children's children, will be cleaner and healthier, and more prosperous and secure. <p>Thank you very much. Thank you.\" "
"212" "\"Good afternoon, all of you. I was just discussing with President Clinton that if Chelsea begins delivery while I'm speaking, she has my motorcade and will be able to navigate traffic. [<i>Laughter</i>] Because actually, it's pretty smooth for me during the week. I don't know what the problem is. Everybody hypes the traffic, but I haven't noticed. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Always wonderful to follow Matt Damon. [<i>Laughter</i>] I saw people trickling out after he was done. [<i>Laughter</i>] These are the hardcore policy people who decided to stay for me. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to thank President Clinton for your friendship and your leadership and bringing us together as only he can. Bill first asked me come to CGI when I was a Senator, and as President, I've been proud to come back every year. As President, Bill asked Americans to serve their country, and we recently celebrated the 20th anniversary of AmeriCorps on the South Lawn. And Bill asked all of you to make commitments to better our world. And together, you've touched the lives of hundreds of millions of people. And it's a testimony, I think, to any leader, not just for what they themselves do, but the degree to which they're able to inspire action from others. And by that measure, obviously, Bill Clinton has continued to exert extraordinary global leadership for decades and I suspect for decades more to come. So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>Now, in agreeing to come, I had an ask as well. I think one of the best decisions I ever made as President was to ask Hillary Clinton to serve as our Nation's Secretary of State. She just welcomed me backstage. I'll always be grateful for her extraordinary leadership representing our Nation around the world. And I still have a lot of debt to pay, though, because the two of them were separated far too often. Hillary put in a lot of miles during her tenure as Secretary of State. She looks&mdash;she has the postadministration glow right now. [<i>Laughter</i>] She looks much more rested. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So it's wonderful to be back at GCI. I cannot imagine a more fitting audience with whom to discuss the work that brings me here today, and that is our obligation as free peoples, as free nations, to stand with the courageous citizens and brave civil society groups who are working for equality and opportunity and justice and human dignity all over the world. <p>And I'm especially pleased that we're joined today by our many partners in this work: governments, civil society groups, including faith leaders, and men and women from around the world who devote their lives and, at times, risk their lives to lifting up their communities and strengthening their nations and claiming universal rights on behalf of their fellow citizens. And we're honored by the presence of these individuals.<B> <p></B>As we do every time this year, Presidents and Prime Ministers converge on this great city to advance important work. But as leaders, we are not the most important people here today. It is the civil society leaders who, in many ways, are going to have the more lasting impact, because as the saying goes, the most important title is not President or Prime Minister; the most important title is citizen. <p>It is citizens&mdash;ordinary men and women, determined to forge their own future&mdash;who throughout history have sparked all the great change and progress. It was citizens here in America who worked to abolish slavery, who marched for women's rights and workers' rights and civil rights. They are the reason I can stand here today as President of the United States. It's citizens who right now are standing up for the freedom that is their God-given right. <p>And I've seen it myself, in the advocates and activists that I've met all over the world. I've seen it in the courage of Berta Soler, the leader of Cuba's Ladies in White who endure harassment and arrest in order to win freedom for their loved ones and for the Cuban people. I've seen it in the determination of Russians in Moscow and St. Petersburg who speak up for rule of law and human rights. I've seen it the passion of advocates in Senegal who nurture their democracy and young Africans across the continent who are helping to marshal in Africa's rise. I've seen it the hope of young Palestinians in Ramallah who dream of building their future in a free and independent state. I see it in the perseverance of men and women in Burma who are striving to build a democracy against the odds. <p>These citizens remind us why civil society is so essential. When people are free to speak their minds and hold their leaders accountable, governments are more responsive and more effective. When entrepreneurs are free to create and develop new ideas, then economies are more innovative and attract more trade and investment and ultimately become more prosperous. <p>When communities, including minorities, are free to live and pray and love as they choose; when nations uphold the rights of all their people, including, perhaps especially, women and girls, then those countries are more likely to thrive. If you want strong, successful countries, you need strong, vibrant civil societies. When citizens are free to organize and work together across borders to make our communities healthier, our environment cleaner, and our world safer, that's when real change comes. <p>And we see this in&mdash;this spirit in the new commitments you're making here at CGI to help the people of West Africa in their fight against Ebola. <p>We've also seen this spirit in another cause, the global campaign against antipersonnel landmines. Tireless advocates like Jody Williams fought for the Ottawa Convention; leaders like Patrick Leahy have led the charge in Washington. Twenty years ago, President Clinton stood at the United Nations and pledged that the United States would work toward the elimination of these landmines, and earlier today we announced that we will take another important step. Outside of the unique circumstances of the Korean Peninsula, where we have a longstanding commitment to the defense of our ally South Korea, the United States will not use antipersonnel landmines. <p>So we will begin destroying our stockpiles not required for the defense of South Korea. And we're going to continue to work to find ways that would allow us to ultimately comply fully and accede to the Ottawa Convention. And the United States will continue to lead as the world's largest donor of global demining efforts, freeing communities and countries from these weapons. <p>But the point is, this started in civil society. That's what prompted action by President Clinton and by myself. And promoting civil society that can surface issues and push leadership is not just in keeping with our values, it's not charity. It's in our national interests. Countries that respect human rights, including freedom of association, happen to be our closest partners. That is not an accident. Conversely, when these rights are suppressed, it fuels grievances and a sense of injustice that over time can fuel instability or extremism. So I believe America's support for civil society is a matter of national security. It is precisely because citizens and civil society can be so powerful, their ability to harness technology and connect and mobilize at this moment so unprecedented, that more and more governments are doing everything in their power to silence them. <p>From Russia to China, to Venezuela, you are seeing relentless crackdowns, vilifying legitimate dissent as subversive. In places like Azerbaijan, laws make it incredibly difficult for NGOs even to operate. From Hungary to Egypt, endless regulations and overt intimidation increasingly target civil society. And around the world, brave men and women who dare raise their voices are harassed and attacked and even killed. <p>So today we honor those who have given their lives. Among them, in Cameroon, Eric Lembembe; in Libya, Salwa Bugaighis; in Cambodia, Chut Wutty; in Russia, Natalia Estemirova. We stand in solidarity with those who are detained at this very moment: in Venezuela, Leopoldo Lopez; in Burundi, Pierre Claver Mbonimpa; in Egypt, Ahmed Maher; in China, Liu Xiaobo and now Ilham Tohti; in Vietnam, Father Ly; and so many others. They deserve to be free. They ought to be released. <p>This growing crackdown on civil society is a campaign to undermine the very idea of democracy. And what's needed is an even stronger campaign to defend democracy. <p>Since I took office, the United States has continued to lead the way, and as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton helped champion our efforts. Across the globe, no country does more to strengthen civil society than America. And 1 year ago, here in New York, I pledged that the United States would do even more, and I challenged the world to join us in this cause. Working with many of you, that's what we've done. And today I'm proud to announce a series of new steps. <p>First, partnering and protecting civil society groups around the world is now a mission across the U.S. Government. So under a new Presidential memorandum that I'm issuing today, Federal departments and agencies will consult and partner more regularly with civil society groups. They will oppose attempts by foreign governments to dictate the nature of our assistance to civil society. And they will oppose efforts by foreign governments to restrict freedoms of peaceful assembly and association and expression. So this is not just a matter of the State Department or USAID, it's across the Government. This is part of American leadership. <p>Second, we're creating new innovation centers to empower civil society groups around the world. I want to thank our partners in this effort, including the Government of Sweden and the Aga Khan Development Network. Starting next year, civil society groups will be able to use these centers to network and access knowledge and technology and funding that they need to put their ideas into action. And we'll start with six centers in Latin America, in sub-Saharan Africa, in the Middle East, and in Asia. Oppressive governments are sharing \\"worst practices\\" to weaken civil society. We're going to help you share the \\"best practices\\" to stay strong and vibrant. <p>Number three, we're expanding our support and funding for the Community of Democracies to better coordinate the diplomacy and pressure that we bring to bear. And this means more support for those who are fighting against the laws that restrict civil society. In recent years, we've worked together to prevent new limits on civil society from Kenya to Cambodia. And we've helped expand the space for civil society in countries from Honduras to Tunisia to Burma. And standing together, we can do even more. <p>And finally, we're increasing our support to society groups across the board. We're going to increase our emergency assistance to embattled NGOs. We'll do more to match groups with the donors and funding that they need. And in the coming months, our Treasury Department will finalize regulations so it's even easier and less costly for your foundations to make grants overseas. <p>We'll increase our legal assistance and technical support to those pushing back against onerous laws and regulations. And through our Open Government Partnership, we'll help more governments truly partner with civil society. We'll continue to stand up for a free and open Internet so individuals can access information and make up their own minds about the issues that their countries confront. <p>And through our programs to engage young leaders around the world, we're helping to build the next generation of civil society leaders. And our message to those young people is simple: America stands with you. <p>We stand with educators like Walid Ali of Kenya. Where's Walid? <i>Habari?</i> I just had a chance to meet him. There he is. In his village near the border of Somalia, young people without jobs are tempted by drugs. They're recruited by terrorists. So Walid offers them counseling and business classes and small plots of farmland, helping them rebuild their own lives and their communities and giving them options for the future. He strives, he says, not just for the idea of democracy, but to \\"cement the practice of democracy.\\" So we thank you, Walid, for your extraordinary efforts, and we stand with you. <p>We stand with humanitarians like Miriam Canales. Where is Miriam? There she is right there. In communities that are wracked at times by horrific violence, children are so terrified to walk the streets that many begin that dangerous and often deadly march north. And Miriam's outreach centers give them a safe place to play and grow and learn. And she says her dream is \\"that people in Honduras can walk free\\" and that young people will have \\"opportunities in their own country.\\" And we couldn't be prouder of you, Miriam, and we stand with you. <p>We stand with activists like Sopheap Chak of Cambodia. Where's&mdash;there she is, Sopheap. Sopheap saw a fellow human rights advocate hauled off by the police, and she could have fled too, but she says she's never thought of leaving Cambodia even for minute. So she keeps organizing and marching and mobilizing youth to demand justice. And she says, \\"I dream that Cambodian citizens can enjoy the freedoms that they are entitled to.\\" We could not be prouder of you, and we stand with you. <p>And we stand with advocates like John Gad of Egypt. Where's John? Like all Egyptians, John has lived through the turmoil of recent years. As an artist, he uses his poetry and performances to help people \\"discover the power inside them,\\" which is as good a description of being an organizer as anything&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and being a leader. And he's been working to help women and girls recover from violence and sexual assault. He's focused, he says, on \\"how to teach Egyptians to accept each other.\\" And he has said that \\"we have rights that we can achieve in a peaceful way.\\" John is the future. That's why we stand with him. <p>Now, these individuals are just a small sample, they're just an example of the extraordinary drive and courage and commitment of people that oftentimes are outside of the headlines. People don't do stories on them. When they're endangered or harassed, it usually doesn't surface in the news. But they are those who are pushing the boulder up the hill to make sure that the world is a little bit of a better place. <p>And we live in a complicated world. We've got imperfect choices. The reality is sometimes, for instance, for the sake of our national security, the United States works with governments that do not fully respect the universal rights of their citizens. These are choices that I, as President, constantly have to make. And I will never apologize for doing everything in my power to protect the safety and security of the American people. That is my first and primary job. But that does not mean that human rights can be simply sacrificed for the sake of expediency. <p>So although it is uncomfortable, although it sometimes causes friction, the United States will not stop speaking out for the human rights of all people and pushing governments to uphold those rights and freedoms. We will not stop doing that, because that's part of who we are, and that's part of what we stand for. <p>And when governments engage in tactics against citizens and civil society, hoping nobody will notice, it is our job to shine a spotlight on that abuse. And when individuals like the ones I introduced are being held down, it's our job to help lift them back up. When they try to wall you off from the world, we want to connect you with each other. When your governments may try to pass oppressive laws, we'll try to oppose them. When they try to cut off your funding, we're going to try to give you a lifeline. And when they try to silence you, we want to amplify your voice. <p>And if, amid all the restrictions and all the pressure and all the harassment and all the fear, if they try to tell you that the world does not care and that your friends have forsaken you, do not ever believe it. Because you are not alone. You are never alone. Your fellow advocates stand with you, and your communities stand with you. Your friends around the world stand with you. The United States of America stands with you, and its President stands with you. <p>No matter how dark the hour, we remember those words of Dr. King: \\"The time is always ripe to do the right thing.\\" And Dr. King also said, \\"The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.\\" The reason we support civil society is because we have seen in this country of ours that it does, in fact, bend towards justice. But it does not do so on its own. It does so because there are hands of ordinary people doing extraordinary things every single day, and they pull that arc in the direction of justice. <p>That's why we have freedom in this country. That's why I'm able to stand before you here today. And that's why we will stand with them tomorrow. <p>God bless you all. God bless all those who are working under tough conditions in every corner of the world. Thank you, CGI. Thank you, President Clinton. Thank you.\" "
"213" "\"Well, it is a wonderful opportunity for me to welcome these leaders&mdash;friends, partners from the region&mdash;and to say thank you to all of them for their participation and commitment to rolling back the violent extremism that has so disrupted Iraq and Syria and threatens the region as a whole. <p>And in addition to His Majesty King Abdullah, I want to give a special welcome to Prime Minister Abadi and say congratulations to him for his leadership. To our friends from Saudi Arabia, from Bahrain and Qatar, we want to thank you very much for everything that you have done, and the United Emirate&mdash;Arab Emirates as well. <p>This represents partners and friends in which we have worked for very many years to make sure that security and prosperity exists in this region. And what we've all seen is that, with the emergence of ISIL, so much progress is threatened and so many people's lives are threatened. And because of the almost unprecedented effort of this coalition, I think we now have an opportunity to send a very clear message that the world is united, that all of us are committed to making sure that we degrade and ultimately destroy not only ISIL, but also the kinds of extremist ideologies that would lead to so much bloodshed. <p>This is not going to be something that is quick, and it is not something that is going to be easy. It will take time. And it's not only a military effort. I think what we all understand here is that young people have to have opportunity. We have to make sure that we're providing the education that's necessary for young people to succeed in a modern economy, that we all have to promote religious tolerance. And it is going to be also important to provide opportunities for entrepreneurship and economic growth in these communities. <p>These are all issues in which the United States has worked and will continue to work with these countries. And&mdash;but we also recognize that right now we have a very severe and significant threat. What we've seen from the world community is a recognition of that threat. And we are very appreciative of our partnership with all the countries here. <p>We are committed to a sovereign Iraq that is able to maintain its territorial integrity and provide for its own security. We are committed to a Syria that is at peace and is not having the sorts of spillover effects that are burdening its neighbors. We're committed to making sure that millions of people can return to their homes and that they can live in peace and security. And we are committed to making sure that we put an end to the kind of sectarian strife that has been so prevalent for these last several years and has harmed so many people. <p>So again, I just want to say thank you to all of you. This is obviously not the end of an effort, but is rather a beginning. But I'm confident with the kind of partnership that is represented here, that we'll be able to be successful. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"214" "\"Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, fellow delegates, ladies and gentlemen: We come together at a crossroad between war and peace, between disorder and integration, between fear and hope. <p>Around the globe, there are signposts of progress. The shadow of world war that existed at the founding of this institution has been lifted, and the prospect of war between major powers reduced. The ranks of member states has more than tripled, and more people live under governments they elected. Hundreds of millions of human beings have been freed from the prison of poverty, with the proportion of those living in extreme poverty cut in half. And the world economy continues to strengthen after the worst financial crisis of our lives. <p>Today, whether you live in downtown Manhattan or in my grandmother's village more than 200 miles from Nairobi, you can hold in your hand more information than the world's greatest libraries. Together, we've learned how to cure disease and harness the power of the wind and the sun. The very existence of this institution is a unique achievement: the people of the world committing to resolve their differences peacefully and to solve their problems together. I often tell young people in the United States that despite the headlines, this is the best time in human history to be born, for you are more likely than ever before to be literate, to be healthy, to be free to pursue your dreams. <p>And yet there is a pervasive unease in our world, a sense that the very forces that have brought us together have created new dangers and made it difficult for any single nation to insulate itself from global forces. As we gather here, an outbreak of Ebola overwhelms public health systems in West Africa and threatens to move rapidly across borders. Russian aggression in Europe recalls the days when large nations trampled small ones in pursuit of territorial ambition. The brutality of terrorists in Syria and Iraq forces us to look into the heart of darkness. <p>Each of these problems demands urgent attention. But they also are symptoms of a broader problem: the failure of our international system to keep pace with an interconnected world. We, collectively, have not invested adequately in the public health capacity of developing countries. Too often, we have failed to enforce international norms when it's inconvenient to do so. And we have not confronted forcefully enough the intolerance, sectarianism, and hopelessness that feeds violent extremism in too many parts of the globe. <p>Fellow delegates, we come together as united nations with a choice to make. We can renew the international system that has enabled so much progress, or we can allow ourselves to be pulled back by an undertow of instability. We can reaffirm our collective responsibility to confront global problems or be swamped by more and more outbreaks of instability. And for America, the choice is clear: We choose hope over fear. We see the future not as something out of our control, but as something we can shape for the better through concerted and collective effort. We reject fatalism or cynicism when it comes to human affairs. We choose to work for the world as it should be, as our children deserve it to be. <p>There is much that must be done to meet the test of this moment. But today I'd like to focus on two defining questions at the root of so many of our challenges: whether the nations here today will be able to renew the purpose of the U.N.'s founding and whether we will come together to reject the cancer of violent extremism. <p>First, all of us&mdash;big nations and small&mdash;must meet our responsibility to observe and enforce international norms. We are here because others realized that we gain more from cooperation than conquest. One hundred years ago, a world war claimed the lives of many millions, proving that with the terrible power of modern weaponry, the cause of empire ultimately leads to the graveyard. It would take another world war to roll back the forces of fascism, the notions of racial supremacy, and form this United Nations to ensure that no nation can subjugate its neighbors and claim their territory. <p>Recently, Russia's actions in Ukraine challenge this postwar order. Here are the facts. After the people of Ukraine mobilized popular protests and calls for reform, their corrupt President fled. Against the will of the Government in Kiev, Crimea was annexed. Russia poured arms into eastern Ukraine, fueling violent separatists and a conflict that has killed thousands. When a civilian airliner was shot down from areas that these proxies controlled, they refused to allow access to the crash for days. When Ukraine started to reassert control over its territory, Russia gave up the pretense of merely supporting the separatists and moved troops across the border. <p>This is a vision of the world in which might makes right, a world in which one nation's borders can be redrawn by another and civilized people are not allowed to recover the remains of their loved ones because of the truth that might be revealed. America stands for something different. We believe that \\"right makes might,\\" that bigger nations should not be able to bully smaller ones, and that people should be able to choose their own future. <p>And these are simple truths, but they must be defended. America and our allies will support the people of Ukraine as they develop their democracy and economy. We will reinforce our NATO allies and uphold our commitment to collective self-defense. We will impose a cost on Russia for aggression, and we will counter falsehoods with the truth. And we call upon others to join us on the right side of history. For while small gains can be won at the barrel of a gun, they will ultimately be turned back if enough voices support the freedom of nations and peoples to make their own decisions. <p>Moreover, a different path is available: the path of diplomacy and peace and the ideals this institution is designed to uphold. The recent cease-fire agreement in Ukraine offers an opening to achieve those objectives. If Russia takes that path, a path that for stretches of the post-cold war period resulted in prosperity for the Russian people, then we will lift our sanctions and welcome Russia's role in addressing common challenges. After all, that's what the United States and Russia have been able to do in past years, from reducing our nuclear stockpiles to meeting our obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, to cooperating to remove and destroy Syria's declared chemical weapons. And that's the kind of cooperation we are prepared to pursue again if Russia changes course. <p>This speaks to a central question of our global age: whether we will solve our problems together, in a spirit of mutual interest and mutual respect, or whether we descend into the destructive rivalries of the past. When nations find common ground, not simply based on power, but on principle, then we can make enormous progress. And I stand before you today committed to investing American strength to working with all nations to address the problems we face in the 21st century. As we speak, America is deploying our doctors and scientists&mdash;supported by our military&mdash;to help contain the outbreak of Ebola and pursue new treatments. But we need a broader effort to stop a disease that could kill hundreds of thousands, inflict horrific suffering, destabilize economies, and move rapidly across borders. It's easy to see this as a distant problem until it is not. And that is why we will continue to mobilize other countries to join us in making concrete commitments, significant commitments to fight this outbreak and enhance our system of global health security for the long term. <p>America is pursuing a diplomatic resolution to the Iranian nuclear issue, as part of our commitment to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and pursue the peace and security of a world without them. And this can only take place if Iran seizes this historic opportunity. And my message to Iran's leaders and people has been simple and consistent: Do not let this opportunity pass. We can reach a solution that meets your energy needs while assuring the world that your program is peaceful. <p>America is and will continue to be a Pacific power, promoting peace, stability, and the free flow of commerce among nations. But we will insist that all nations abide by the rules of the road and resolve their territorial disputes peacefully, consistent with international law. That's how the Asia-Pacific has grown. And that's the only way to protect this progress going forward. <p>America is committed to a development agenda that eradicates extreme poverty by 2030. We will do our part to help people feed themselves, power their economies, and care for their sick. And if the world acts together, we can make sure that all of our children enjoy lives of opportunity and dignity. <p>America is pursuing ambitious reductions in our carbon emissions, and we've increased our investments in clean energy. We will do our part and help developing nations do theirs. But the science tells us we can only succeed in combating climate change if we are joined in this effort by every other nation, by every major power. That's how we can protect this planet for our children and our grandchildren. <p>In other words, on issue after issue, we cannot rely on a rulebook written for a different century. If we lift our eyes beyond our borders&mdash;if we think globally and if we act cooperatively&mdash;we can shape the course of this century, as our predecessors shaped the post-World War II age. But as we look to the future, one issue risks a cycle of conflict that could derail so much progress, and that is the cancer of violent extremism that has ravaged so many parts of the Muslim world. <p>Of course, terrorism is not new. Speaking before this Assembly, President Kennedy put it well: \\"Terror is not a new weapon,\\" he said. \\"Throughout history it has been used by those who could not prevail, either by persuasion or example.\\" In the 20th century, terror was used by all manner of groups who failed to come to power through public support. But in this century, we have faced a more lethal and ideological brand of terrorists who have perverted one of the world's great religions. With access to technology that allows small groups to do great harm, they have embraced a nightmarish vision that would divide the world into adherents and infidels, killing as many innocent civilians as possible, employing the most brutal methods to intimidate people within their communities. <p>I have made it clear that America will not base our entire foreign policy on reacting to terrorism. Instead, we've waged a focused campaign against Al Qaida and its associated forces: taking out their leaders, denying them the safe havens they rely on. At the same time, we have reaffirmed again and again that the United States is not and never will be at war with Islam. Islam teaches peace. Muslims the world over aspire to live with dignity and a sense of justice. And when it comes to America and Islam, there is no us and them, there is only us, because millions of Muslim Americans are part of the fabric of our country. <p>So we reject any suggestion of a clash of civilizations. Belief in permanent religious war is the misguided refuge of extremists who cannot build or create anything and therefore peddle only fanaticism and hate. And it is no exaggeration to say that humanity's future depends on us uniting against those who would divide us along the fault lines of tribe or sect, race or religion. <p>But this is not simply a matter of words. Collectively, we must take concrete steps to address the danger posed by religiously motivated fanatics and the trends that fuel their recruitment. Moreover, this campaign against extremism goes beyond a narrow security challenge. For while we've degraded methodically core Al Qaida and supported a transition to a sovereign Afghan Government, extremist ideology has shifted to other places, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, where a quarter of young people have no job, where food and water could grow scarce, where corruption is rampant, and sectarian conflicts have become increasingly hard to contain. <p>As an international community, we must meet this challenge with a focus on four areas. First, the terrorist group known as ISIL must be degraded and ultimately destroyed. <p>This group has terrorized all who they come across in Iraq and Syria. Mothers, sisters, daughters have been subjected to rape as a weapon of war. Innocent children have been gunned down. Bodies have been dumped in mass graves. Religious minorities have been starved to death. In the most horrific crimes imaginable, innocent human beings have been beheaded, with videos of the atrocity distributed to shock the conscience of the world. <p>No God condones this terror. No grievance justifies these actions. There can be no reasoning&mdash;no negotiation&mdash;with this brand of evil. The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force. So the United States of America will work with a broad coalition to dismantle this network of death. <p>In this effort, we do not act alone, nor do we intend to send U.S. troops to occupy foreign lands. Instead, we will support Iraqis and Syrians fighting to reclaim their communities. We will use our military might in a campaign of airstrikes to roll back ISIL. We will train and equip forces fighting against these terrorists on the ground. We will work to cut off their financing and to stop the flow of fighters into and out of the region. And already, over 40 nations have offered to join this coalition. <p>Today I ask the world to join in this effort. Those who have joined ISIL should leave the battlefield while they can. Those who continue to fight for a hateful cause will find they are increasingly alone. For we will not succumb to threats, and we will demonstrate that the future belongs to those who build, not those who destroy. So that's an immediate challenge, the first challenge that we must meet. <p>The second: It is time for the world&mdash;especially Muslim communities&mdash;to explicitly, forcefully, and consistently reject the ideology of organizations like Al Qaida and ISIL. <p>It is one of the tasks of all great religions to accommodate devout faith with a modern, multicultural world. No children are born hating, and no children anywhere should be educated to hate other people. There should be no more tolerance of so-called clerics who call upon people to harm innocents because they're Jewish or because they're Christian or because they're Muslim. It is time for a new compact among the civilized peoples of this world to eradicate war at its most fundamental source, and that is the corruption of young minds by violent ideology. <p>That means cutting off the funding that fuels this hate. It's time to end the hypocrisy of those who accumulate wealth through the global economy and then siphon funds to those who teach children to tear it down. <p>That means contesting the space that terrorists occupy, including the Internet and social media. Their propaganda has coerced young people to travel abroad to fight their wars and turned students&mdash;young people full of potential&mdash;into suicide bombers. We must offer an alternative vision. <p>It means bringing people of different faiths together. All religions have been attacked by extremists from within at some point, and all people of faith have a responsibility to lift up the value at the heart of all great religions: Do unto thy neighbor as you would do&mdash;you would have done unto yourself. <p>The ideology of ISIL or Al Qaida or Boko Haram will wilt and die if it is consistently exposed and confronted and refuted in the light of day. Look at the new Forum for Promoting Peace in Muslim Societies. Shaykh bin Bayyah described its purpose: \\"We must declare war on war so the outcome will be peace upon peace.\\" Look at the young British Muslims who responded to terrorist propaganda by starting the \\"NotInMyName\\" campaign, declaring, \\"ISIS is hiding behind a false Islam.\\" Look at the Christian and Muslim leaders who came together in the Central African Republic to reject violence; listen to the Imam who said, \\"Politics try to divide the religious in our country, but religion shouldn't be a cause of hate, war, or strife.\\" <p>Later today the Security Council will adopt a resolution that underscores the responsibility of states to counter violent extremism. But resolutions must be followed by tangible commitments so we're accountable when we fall short. Next year, we should all be prepared to announce the concrete steps that we have taken to counter extremist ideologies in our own countries, by getting intolerance out of schools, stopping radicalization before it spreads, and promoting institutions and programs that build new bridges of understanding. <p>Third, we must address the cycle of conflict&mdash;especially sectarian conflict&mdash;that creates the conditions that terrorists prey upon. <p>There is nothing new about wars within religions. Christianity endured centuries of vicious sectarian conflict. Today, it is violence within Muslim communities that has become the source of so much human misery. It is time to acknowledge the destruction wrought by proxy wars and terror campaigns between Sunni and Shia across the Middle East. And it is time that political, civic, and religious leaders reject sectarian strife. For let's be clear: This is a fight that no one is winning. A brutal civil war in Syria has already killed nearly 200,000 people, displaced millions. Iraq has come perilously close to plunging back into the abyss. The conflict has created a fertile recruiting ground for terrorists who inevitably export this violence. <p>The good news is, we also see signs that this tide could be reversed. We have a new, inclusive Government in Baghdad, a new Iraqi Prime Minister welcomed by his neighbors, Lebanese factions rejecting those who try to provoke war. And these steps must be followed by a broader truce. Nowhere is this more necessary than Syria. <p>Together with our partners, America is training and equipping the Syrian opposition to be a counterweight to the terrorists of ISIL and the brutality of the Asad regime. But the only lasting solution to Syria's civil war is political: an inclusive political transition that responds to the legitimate aspirations of all Syrian citizens, regardless of ethnicity, regardless of creed. <p>Now, cynics may argue that such an outcome can never come to pass. But there is no other way for this madness to end, whether 1 year from now or 10. And it points to the fact that it's time for a broader negotiation in the region in which major powers address their differences directly, honestly, and peacefully across the table from one another, rather than through gun-wielding proxies. I can promise you, America will remain engaged in the region, and we are prepared to engage in that effort. <p>And my fourth and final point is a simple one: The countries of the Arab and Muslim world must focus on the extraordinary potential of their people, especially the youth. <p>And here, I'd like to speak directly to young people across the Muslim world. You come from a great tradition that stands for education, not ignorance; innovation, not destruction; the dignity of life, not murder. Those who call you away from this path are betraying this tradition, not defending it. <p>You have demonstrated that when young people have the tools to succeed&mdash;good schools, education in math and science, an economy that nurtures creativity and entrepreneurship&mdash;then societies will flourish. So America will partner with those that promote that vision. <p>Where women are full participants in a country's politics or economy, societies are more likely to succeed. And that's why we support the participation of women in parliaments and peace processes, schools and the economy. <p>If young people live in places where the only option is between the dictates of a state or the lure of an extremist underground, then no counterterrorism strategy can succeed. But where a genuine civil society is allowed to flourish&mdash;where people can express their views and organize peacefully for a better life&mdash;then you dramatically expand the alternatives to terror. <p>And such positive change need not come at the expense of tradition and faith. We see this in Iraq, where a young man started a library for his peers. \\"We link Iraq's heritage to their hearts,\\" he said, and \\"give them a reason to stay.\\" We see it in Tunisia, where secular and Islamist parties worked together through a political process to produce a new Constitution. We see it in Senegal, where civil society thrives alongside a strong democratic government. We see it in Malaysia, where vibrant entrepreneurship is propelling a former colony into the ranks of advanced economies. And we see it in Indonesia, where what began as a violent transition has evolved into a genuine democracy. <p>Now, ultimately, the task of rejecting sectarianism and rejecting extremism is a generational task and a task for the people of the Middle East themselves. No external power can bring about a transformation of hearts and minds. But America will be a respectful and constructive partner. We will neither tolerate terrorist safe havens, nor act as an occupying power. We will take action against threats to our security and our allies, while building an architecture of counterterrorism cooperation. We will increase efforts to lift up those who counter extremist ideologies and who seek to resolve sectarian conflict. And we will expand our programs to support entrepreneurship and civil society, education and youth, because ultimately, these investments are the best antidote to violence. <p>We recognize as well that leadership will be necessary to address the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis. As bleak as the landscape appears, America will not give up on the pursuit of peace. Understand, the situation in Iraq and Syria and Libya should cure anybody of the illusion that the Arab-Israeli conflict is the main source of problems in the region. For far too long, that's been used as an excuse to distract people from problems at home. The violence engulfing the region today has made too many Israelis ready to abandon the hard work of peace. And that's something worthy of reflection within Israel. <p>Because let's be clear: The status quo in the West Bank and Gaza is not sustainable. We cannot afford to turn away from this effort, not when rockets are fired at innocent Israelis or the lives of so many Palestinian children are taken from us in Gaza. And so long as I am President, we will stand up for the principle that Israelis, Palestinians, the region, and the world will be more just and more safe with two states living side by side in peace and security. <p>So this is what America is prepared to do: taking action against immediate threats, while pursuing a world in which the need for such action is diminished. The United States will never shy away from defending our interests, but we will also not shy away from the promise of this institution and its Universal Declaration of Human Rights: the notion that peace is not merely the absence of war, but the presence of a better life. <p>I realize that America's critics will be quick to point out that at times we too have failed to live up to our ideals, that America has plenty of problems within its own borders. This is true. In a summer marked by instability in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, I know the world also took notice of the small American city of Ferguson, Missouri, where a young man was killed and a community was divided. So yes, we have our own racial and ethnic tensions. And like every country, we continually wrestle with how to reconcile the vast changes wrought by globalization and greater diversity with the traditions that we hold dear. <p>But we welcome the scrutiny of the world, because what you see in America is a country that has steadily worked to address our problems, to make our Union more perfect, to bridge the divides that existed at the founding of this Nation. America is not the same as it was 100 years ago or 50 years ago or even a decade ago: because we fight for our ideals and we are willing to criticize ourselves when we fall short; because we hold our leaders accountable and insist on a free press and independent judiciary; because we address our differences in the open space of democracy, with respect for the rule of law, with a place for people of every race and every religion, and with an unyielding belief in the ability of individual men and women to change their communities and their circumstances and their countries for the better. <p>After nearly 6 years as President, I believe that this promise can help light the world. Because I have seen a longing for positive change&mdash;for peace and for freedom and for opportunity and for the end to bigotry&mdash;in the eyes of young people who I've met around the globe. <p>They remind me that no matter who you are or where you come from or what you look like or what God you pray to or who you love, there is something fundamental that we all share. Eleanor Roosevelt, a champion of the U.N. and America's role in it, once asked: \\"Where, after all, do universal human rights begin? In small places,\\" she said, \\"close to home&mdash;so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the world. Yet they are the world of the individual person; the neighborhood he lives in; the school or college he attends; the factory, farm or office where he works.\\" <p>Around the world, young people are moving forward hungry for a better world. Around the world, in small places, they're overcoming hatred and bigotry and sectarianism. And they're learning to respect each other, despite differences. The people of the world now look to us, here, to be as decent and as dignified and as courageous as they are trying to be in their daily lives. And at this crossroads, I can promise you that the United States of America will not be distracted or deterred from what must be done. We are heirs to a proud legacy of freedom, and we're prepared to do what is necessary to secure that legacy for generations to come. I ask that you join us in this common mission, for today's children and tomorrow's. <p>Thank you very much.\" "
"215" "\"Well, good afternoon. First of all, you should know that the Secretary-General was late because of me. I take the blame. <p>Second of all, I do think it's appropriate to thank the incredible hospitality of the people of New York City. Some of you know I lived in New York, went to school in New York, love New York, love the people. But as somebody who has lived here as a civilian during UNGA, it is no fun. [<i>Laughter</i>] In fact, in 2008, I had already won the nomination, was a month away from my election as President, and had full Secret Service, and I still couldn't get through the traffic and had to walk three blocks in order to get into the building. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's how bad it was. So it is tough. <p>But the people of New York, we want to thank you for doing what you do, because you are such an incredible, incredible city. <p>I've already given a long speech today. I'm going to be very brief. As host nation, I want to thank all of you for your commitment to our work. Nobody works harder and truer to the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations than our Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon. And so I want to publicly thank him for his tireless work on every issue, from Ebola to climate change, to violations of human rights, to armed conflict, he is on the job and been doing outstanding work. <p>I also want to recognize the thousands of men and women at the United Nations who give meaning and action to all the words that we politicians produce during the course of General Assembly meetings and Security Council meetings. Oftentimes, they operate outside of the limelight. But if it were not for their dedication, hard work, and sacrifice, then this would just be a debating club. And so we want to thank very much the&mdash;all the employees and staff of the United Nations not just for helping to facilitate this meeting, but for what they do all year around. Thank you very much. <p>Along those same lines, we want to salute the thousands of Blue Helmets who stand sentinel around the world, particularly across Africa and the Middle East. The tragic loss of five peacekeepers in Mali last week reminds us that there are real risks that these peacekeepers take on so that others can lead a better life. We salute the United Nations aid workers who are on the front lines of humanitarian efforts in Syria, delivering comfort and support to civilians battered by civil war. And we thank the heroic U.N. health workers in West Africa who are combating Ebola and caring for the sick at some risk to themselves. <p>These men and women, from so many of our nations, reflect the common pursuit of peace and prosperity. We could not be prouder of their work. They represent what I think the United Nations should be all about. And when I think of them, I'm reminded that although all of us have the extraordinary privilege of representing our countries in very high offices, the truth is, change happens on the ground, and none of us can do this alone. <p>So I propose a toast to the human spirit that these workers and personnel and peacekeepers around the world represent: the best of who we are and what we all share in common as children of God and as people who hope to pass on peace and prosperity to our children and our grandchildren for generations to come. <p>Cheers.\" "
"216" "\"Thank you, His Excellency, the Secretary-General, for his statement. I'll now make a statement in my capacity as President of the United States. <p>Mr. Secretary-General, heads of state and government, distinguished representatives, thank you for being here today. <p>In the nearly 70 years of the United Nations, this is only the sixth time that the Security Council has met at a level like this. We convene such sessions to address the most urgent threats to peace and security. And I called this meeting because we must come together&mdash;as nations and an international community&mdash;to confront the real and growing threat of foreign terrorist fighters. <p>As I said earlier today, the tactic of terrorism is not new. So many nations represented here today, including my own, have seen our citizens killed by terrorists who target innocents. And today the people of the world have been horrified by another brutal murder, of Herv&eacute; Gourdel, by terrorists in Algeria. President Hollande, we stand with you and the French people not only as you grieve this terrible loss, but as you show resolve against terror and in defense of liberty. <p>What brings us together today, what is new, is the unprecedented flow of fighters in recent years to and from conflict zones, including Afghanistan and the Horn of Africa, Yemen, Libya, and most recently, Syria and Iraq. <p>Our intelligence agencies estimate that more than 15,000 foreign fighters from more than 80 nations have traveled to Syria in recent years. Many have joined terrorist organizations such as Al Qaida's affiliate, the Nusra Front, and ISIL, which now threatens people across Syria and Iraq. And I want to acknowledge and thank Prime Minister Abadi of Iraq for being here today. <p>In the Middle East and elsewhere, these terrorists exacerbate conflicts, they pose an immediate threat to people in these regions; and as we've already seen in several cases, they may try to return to their home countries to carry out deadly attacks. In the face of this threat, many of our nations, working together and through the United Nations, have increased our cooperation. Around the world, foreign terrorist fighters have been arrested, plots have been disrupted, and lives have been saved. <p>Earlier this year, at West Point, I called for a new Partnership to help nations build their capacity to meet the evolving threat of terrorism, including foreign terrorist fighters. And preventing these individuals from reaching Syria and then slipping back across our borders is a critical element of our strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. <p>The historic resolution that we just adopted enshrines our commitment to meet this challenge. It is legally binding. It establishes new obligations that nations must meet. Specifically, nations are required to \\"prevent and suppress the recruiting, organizing, transporting or equipping\\" of foreign terrorist fighters, as well as the financing of their travel or activities. Nations must \\"prevent the movement of terrorists or terrorist groups\\" through their territory and ensure that their domestic laws allow for the prosecution of those who attempt to do so. <p>The resolution we passed today calls on nations to help build the capacity of states on the front lines of this fight, including with the best practices that many of our nations have approved yesterday, and which the United States will work to advance through our Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund. This resolution will strengthen cooperation between nations, including sharing more information about the travel and activities of foreign terrorist fighters. And it makes clear that respecting human rights, fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law is not optional, it is an essential part of successful counterterrorism efforts. Indeed, history teaches us that the failure to uphold these rights and freedoms can actually fuel violent extremism. <p>Finally, this resolution recognizes that there is no military solution to the problem of misguided individuals seeking to join terrorist organizations, and it therefore calls on nations to work together to counter the violent extremism that can radicalize, recruit, and mobilize individuals to engage in terrorism. Potential recruits must hear the words of former terrorist fighters who have seen the truth: that groups like ISIL betray Islam by killing innocent men, women, and children, the majority of whom are Muslim. <p>Often it is local communities&mdash;family, friends, neighbors, and faith leaders&mdash;that are best able to identify and help disillusioned individuals before they succumb to extremist ideologies and engage in violence. And that's why the United States Government is committed to working with communities in America and around the world to build partnerships of trust, respect, and cooperation. <p>Likewise, even as we are unrelenting against terrorists who threaten our people, we must redouble our work to address the conditions&mdash;the repression, the lack of opportunity, too often the hopelessness&mdash;that can make some individuals more susceptible to appeals to extremism and violence. And this includes continuing to pursue a political solution in Syria that allows all Syrians to live in security, dignity, and peace. <p>This is the work that we must do together as nations. These are the partnerships we must forge as an international community. And these are the standards that we now must meet. Yet even as we're guided by the commitments that we make here today, let me close by stating the obvious. Resolutions alone will not be enough. Promises on paper cannot keep us safe. Lofty rhetoric and good intentions will not stop a single terrorist attack. <p>The words spoken here today must be matched and translated into action, into deeds, concrete action, within nations and between them, not just in the days ahead, but for years to come. For if there was ever a challenge in our interconnected world that cannot be met by one nation alone, it is this: terrorists crossing borders and threatening to unleash unspeakable violence. These terrorists believe our countries will be unable to stop them. The safety of our citizens demand that we do. And I'm here today to say that all of you who are committed to this urgent work will find a strong and steady partner in the United States of America. <p>I now would like to resume my function as President of the Council. And I will now give the floor to the other members of the Security Council.\" "
"217" "\"Well, thank you very much. And thank you, Rakesh, for your introduction. It is wonderful to see all of you here today. And I still remember your eloquent words when we launched this effort 3 years ago, and I'm very grateful for the role you've played and NGOs have played and all the leadership that is represented here has played in making this a reality, which is making a real difference in the lives of so many countries that are participating. <p>I want to thank my good friend, President Yudhoyono, for your leadership and the example that Indonesia has tried to set as a country that has transitioned from a difficult past to a full-blown democracy. And I also want to thank Minister Kuntoro for hosting us here today. Both of them have shown extraordinary leadership in this partnership over the past several years. <p>President Yudhoyono will be&mdash;this will be the last time, I think, that we see each other in his official capacity, but not in terms of our friendship. And I think that it's fitting that he's participating here today and leading it, because it reflects the legacy of his work. And I also want to acknowledge my dear friend President Pe&ntilde;a Nieto of Mexico, as well as President Zuma of South Africa, who have agreed to lead the partnership in the coming year. <p>I'm thrilled to see so many leaders from civil society, men and women who stand up for equality and opportunity and justice and freedom every single day. And it's not always easy to do. Yesterday I had a chance to speak about the importance of supporting civil society across the globe, because throughout history, progress has always been driven by citizens who have the courage to raise their voices and imagine not just what is, but what might be, and that are willing to work to bring about the change that they seek. <p>Three years ago, the United States and seven other nations launched this Open Government Partnership to represent the other side of that equation, because when citizens demand progress, governments need to be able to respond. And in a new millennium flush with technology that allows us to connect with a tweet or a text, citizens rightly demand more responsiveness, more openness, more transparency, more accountability from their governments. <p>In just 3 short years, this partnership has grown from 8 nations to 64. It's helped to transform the way governments serve their citizens. Together, we have made more than 2,000 commitments, improving how governments serve more than 2 billion people worldwide. More citizens are petitioning their governments online, and more citizens are participating directly in policymaking. More entrepreneurs are using open data to innovate and start new businesses. More sunlight is shining on how tax dollars are spent. And more governments are partnering with civil society to find new ways to expose corruption and improve good governance. <p>Here in the United States, we've been trying to lead by example. We're working to open up and share more data with entrepreneurs so they can pursue the new innovations and businesses that create jobs. We're working to modernize our Freedom of Information Act process so that it's easier for Americans to use, so that they can see the workings of their Government. And today I'm proud to announce a series of new commitments to expand and broaden our open government efforts. We're going to work more closely with the health care sector and State and local law enforcement, not just to improve public health and safety, but to better protect the privacy and personal information of the American people. We're going to improve transparency with our upgraded website, usaspending.gov, to make it easier for Americans to access and understand how the Federal Government spends their tax dollars. <p>We're going to collaborate more closely with the private sector and the best minds in our country so that when we design websites or technologies to better serve the public, we're benefiting from the best of American ingenuity and the latest technologies. And because we know that education is a cornerstone for progress&mdash;if we want good governance, we need a educated and informed citizenry&mdash;we're going to do more to help people in other countries, especially students, access the incredible online educational tools and resources that we have here in the States. <p>In addition, as part of our leadership in the global fight against corruption, we intend to partner with American businesses to develop a national plan to promote responsible and transparent business conduct overseas. We already have laws in place; they're significantly stronger than the laws of many other countries. But we think we can do better. And we think that ultimately, it will be good for everybody, including business. Because when they know there's a rule of law, when they don't have to pay a bribe to ship their goods or to finalize a contract, that means they're more likely to invest, and that means more jobs and prosperity for everybody. <p>As we look ahead, I believe that continuing this global fight against corruption has to remain a central focus in this partnership. It's an area where we can expand our efforts. Corruption is not simply immoral. From a practical perspective, it siphons off billions of dollars from the public and private sectors that could be used to feed children or build schools or build infrastructure that promotes development. It also promotes economic inequality. It facilitates human rights abuses. It fuels organized crime and terrorism and ultimately instability. <p>Passing anticorruption laws is necessary, and then those laws have to be enforced so that those who steal from their people are held accountable and so citizens have faith that the system is not rigged and that justice will be done. We need to do more to track down the proceeds of corruption and prevent our legal and financial systems from becoming safe havens for money gained through bribes or fraud. And we need to do more to ensure transparency and accountability in industries that can be especially vulnerable to corruption, such as the extraction of natural resources. That's not just good for businesses, it helps support development in countries that depend on these industries for growth and for jobs. <p>In all of these efforts as governments, we're going to have to deepen our partnerships with civil society. As I announced yesterday, I've directed the U.S. Government to elevate its engagement with civil society groups around the world. After all, the Open Government Partnership is not simply a partnership between governments; it's between governments and their citizens. At times, this can be frustrating. At times, it can be contentious. I think it's fair to say that all governments think they're doing what's right and don't like criticism. And it's shocking to say that not all criticism from civil society is always fair. [<i>Laughter</i>] But, as leaders, making our governments more open does mean that as a consequence of that criticism, there's self-reflection. And it means that questions are asked that might not have otherwise been asked and that groupthink doesn't develop inside of a government and that people don't start as easily rationalizing behavior that, if shown in the light of day, people would object to. And what&mdash;as we've seen through the leadership of Rakesh and so many others who are here today, open and honest collaboration with citizens and civil society over the long term, no matter how uncomfortable it is, makes countries stronger, and it makes countries more successful, and it creates more prosperous economies and more just societies and more opportunity for citizens. <p>So the achievement of these first 3 years are an example of the kind of steady, step-by-step progress that is possible for people and countries around the world. No country has all the answers. No country has perfect practices. So we have to continue to find new ways to learn from each other, to share best practices, and most importantly, to turn the commitments that we've made into real and meaningful action that improves the daily lives of our citizens. I'm confident that if we do that, we can ensure that we're living up to the basic truth that governments exist to serve the people and not the other way around. <p>Let me just close by saying this: When we started this, we didn't know if it was going to work. And I could not be more proud to see the enormous changes that are taking place all around the globe, in small increments sometimes. It's not flashy. It doesn't generate a lot of headlines. But the work you're doing here is a steady wave of better government and a steady wave of stronger civil societies. And over time, that means that not only will individual countries be stronger and not only will the citizens of those countries have greater opportunity and less&mdash;and are less prone to experience injustice, but that translates into a world that is more just and more fair. And that's the kind of world that I want to leave my children. <p>So congratulations on the good work. But don't let up&mdash;as I'm sure you won't, because I know some of you. [<i>Laughter</i>] Thank you very much.\" "
"218" "\"Mr. Secretary-General, thank you for bringing us together today to address an urgent threat to the people of West Africa, but also a potential threat to the world. Dr. Chan, heads of state and government, especially our African partners, ladies and gentlemen: As we gather here today, the people of Liberia and Sierra Leone and Guinea are in crisis. As Secretary-General Ban and Dr. Chan have already indicated, the Ebola virus is spreading at alarming speed. Thousands of men, women, and children have died. Thousands more are infected. If unchecked, this epidemic could kill hundreds of thousands of people in the coming months. Hundreds of thousands. <p>Ebola is a horrific disease. It's wiping out entire families. It's turned simple acts of love and comfort and kindness, like holding a sick friend's hand or embracing a dying child, into potentially fatal acts. If ever there were a public health emergency deserving an urgent, strong, and coordinated international response, this is it. <p>But this is also more than a health crisis. This is a growing threat to regional and global security. In Liberia, in Guinea, in Sierra Leone, public health systems have collapsed. Economic growth is slowing dramatically. If this epidemic is not stopped, this disease could cause a humanitarian catastrophe across the region. And in an era where regional crises can quickly become global threats, stopping Ebola is in the interest of all of us. <p>Now, the courageous men and women fighting on the front lines of this disease have told us what they need. They need more beds, they need more supplies, they need more health workers, and they need all of this as fast as possible. Right now patients are being left to die in the streets because there's nowhere to put them and there's nobody to help them. One health worker in Sierra Leone compared fighting this outbreak to \\"fighting a forest fire with spray bottles.\\" But with our help, they can put out the blaze. <p>Last week, I visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is mounting the largest international response in its history. I said that the world could count on America to lead and that we will provide the capabilities that only we have and mobilize the world the way we have done in the past in crises of similar magnitude. And I announced that, in addition to the civilian response, the United States would establish a military command in Liberia to support civilian efforts across the region. <p>Today, that command is up, and it is running. Our commander is on the ground in Monrovia, and our teams are working as fast as they can to move in personnel, equipment, and supplies. We're working with Senegal to stand up an airbridge to get health workers and medical supplies into West Africa faster. We're setting up a field hospital, which will be staffed by personnel from the U.S. Public Health Service, and a training facility, where we're getting ready to train thousands of health workers from around the world. We're distributing supplies and information kits to hundreds of thousands of families so they can better protect themselves. And together with our partners, we'll quickly build new treatment units across Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone, where thousands will be able to receive care. Meanwhile, in just the past week, more countries and organizations have stepped up their efforts, and so has the United Nations. Mr. Secretary-General, the new U.N. Mission for Ebola Emergency Response that you announced last week will bring all of the U.N.'s resources to bear in fighting the epidemic. We thank you for your leadership. <p>So this is all progress, and it is encouraging. But I want us to be clear: We are not moving fast enough. We are not doing enough. Right now everybody has the best of intentions, but people are not putting in the kinds of resources that are necessary to put a stop to this epidemic. There is still a significant gap between where we are and where we need to be. We know from experience that the response to an outbreak of this magnitude has to be fast and it has to be sustained. It's a marathon, but you have to run it like a sprint. And that's only possible if everybody chips in, if every nation and every organization takes this seriously. Everybody here has to do more. <p>International organizations have to move faster and cut through redtape and mobilize partners on the ground as only they can. More nations need to contribute critical assets and capabilities, whether it is air transport or medical evacuation or health care workers or equipment or treatment. More foundations can tap into the networks of support that they have to raise funds and awareness. More businesses, especially those who already have a presence in the region, can quickly provide their own expertise and resources, from access to critical supply chains to telecommunications. And more citizens&mdash;of all nations&mdash;can educate themselves on this crisis, contribute to relief efforts, and call on their leaders to act. So everybody can do something. That's why we're here today. <p>And even as we meet the urgent threat of Ebola, it's clear that our nations have to do more to prevent, detect, and respond to future biological threats&mdash;before they erupt into full-blown crises. So tomorrow, in Washington, I'll host 44 nations to advance our global health security agenda, and we are interested in working with any country that shares this commitment. <p>Just to emphasize this issue of speed again: When I was down at the CDC&mdash;and perhaps this has already been discussed, but I want to emphasize this&mdash;the outbreak is such where at this point, more people will die. But the slope of the curve, how fast we can arrest the spread of this disease, how quickly we can contain it is within our control. And if we move fast, even if imperfectly, then that could mean the difference between 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 deaths versus hundreds of thousands or even a million deaths. So this is not one where there should be a lot of wrangling and people waiting to see who else is doing what. Everybody has got to move fast in order for us to make a difference. And if we do, we'll save hundreds of thousands of lives. <p>Stopping Ebola is a priority for the United States. I've said that this is as important a national security priority for my team as anything else that's out there. We'll do our part. We will continue to lead, but this has to be a priority for everybody else. We cannot do this alone. We don't have the capacity to do all of this by ourselves. We don't have enough health workers by ourselves. We can build the infrastructure and the architecture to get help in, but we're going to need others to contribute. <p>To my fellow leaders from Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, to the people of West Africa, to the heroic health workers who are on the ground as we speak, in some cases, putting themselves at risk: I want you to know that you are not alone. We're working urgently to get you the help you need. And we will not stop&mdash;we will not relent&mdash;until we halt this epidemic once and for all. So I want to thank all of you for the efforts that are made. But I hope that I'm properly communicating a sense of urgency here. Do not stand by, thinking that somehow, because of what we've done, that it's taken care of. It's not. And if we don't take care of this now, we are going to see a fallout effects and secondary effects from this that will have ramifications for a long time, above and beyond the lives that will have been lost. <p>I urge all of you, particularly those who have direct access to your heads of state, to make sure that they are making this a top priority in the next several weeks and months. <p>Thank you very much.\" "
"219" "\"Well, I want to welcome President Elsisi to New York and to the United States. And I'm very much looking forward to this opportunity to share ideas. <p>Obviously, the U.S.-Egyptian relationship has been an important cornerstone of our security policy and our policy in the Middle East for a very long time. This is our first opportunity, face to face, to discuss a wide range of issues, everything from the Palestinian-Israeli situation in Gaza to Libya, to the issues of ISIL, Iraq, and Syria. <p>And so I want to welcome the President here and his delegation, and I look forward to a constructive, productive conversation. <p>Okay. Thank you, everybody.\" "
"220" "\"Good morning, everybody. Welcome to the White House. Thank you for being here. I want to welcome Members of Congress, leaders from across my administration, and our friends and partners, leaders in public health not just from the United States, but from around the world. Thank you for joining us to advance a cause that touches us all: the health of our people and the security of our nations and of the world. <p>Today, of course, our thoughts and prayers are with the people of West Africa. And I know that some of you have been there, doing heroic work in the fight against Ebola. You've seen firsthand the tragedy that's taking place. In Liberia, in Sierra Leone, in Guinea, people are terrified. Hospitals, clinics, treatment centers are overwhelmed, leaving people dying on the streets. Public health systems are near collapse. And then, there are the secondary effects: economic growth is slowing dramatically, governments are being strained. And if left unchecked, experts predict that hundreds of thousands of people could be killed in a matter of months. <p>And that's why I've told my team that fighting this epidemic is a national security priority for the United States. It's why I recently announced a major increase in our efforts. Our military command in Liberia is now up and running. We're standing up an airbridge to move health workers and supplies into West Africa more quickly. We're setting up a field hospital, new treatment units, a facility to train thousands of health workers. So this is an area where the United States has an opportunity to lead, and we've been making a major contribution. <p>But yesterday, at the United Nations, I joined with Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and Dr. Chan and said this has to be a global priority. Over the last week, culminating yesterday in New York, more countries and organizations have announced significant commitments, including health care workers and treatment facilities and financial support. And today I want to thank, in particular, the Government of Japan, which has pledged to provide some 500,000 pieces of ventilated protective gear&mdash;head gear, gloves, and boots&mdash;to help keep health workers safe as they treat patients in the region. <p>So we've got to now keep up this momentum. This epidemic underscores&mdash;vividly and tragically&mdash;what we already knew, which is, in a world as interconnected as ours, outbreaks anywhere, even in the most remote villages and the remote corners of the world, have the potential to impact everybody, every nation. <p>And though this Ebola epidemic is particularly dangerous, we've seen deadly diseases cross borders before: H1N1, SARS, MERS. And each time, the world scrambles to coordinate a response. Each time, it's been harder than it should be to share information and to contain the outbreak. As a result, diseases have spread faster and farther than they should have, which means, lives are lost that could have been saved. With all the knowledge, all the medical talent, all the advanced technologies at our disposable&mdash;at our disposal, it is unacceptable if, because of lack of preparedness and planning and global coordination, people are dying when they don't have to. So we have to do better, especially when we know that outbreaks are going to keep happening. That's inevitable. At the same time, other biological threats have also grown, from infections that are resistant to antibiotics to terrorists that seek to develop and use biological weapons. And no nation can meet these challenges on its own. Nobody is that isolated anymore. Oceans don't protect you. Walls don't protect you. And that means all of us, as nations and as an international community, need to do more to keep our people safe. And that's why we're here. <p>We have to change our mindsets and start thinking about biological threats as the security threats that they are, in addition to being humanitarian threats and economic threats. We have to bring the same level of commitment and focus to these challenges as we do when meeting around more traditional security issues. <p>And what I've said about the Ebola epidemic is true here as well: As the nation that has underwritten much of global security for decades, the United States has some capabilities that other nations don't have. We can mobilize the world in ways that other nations may not be able to. And that's what we're trying to do on Ebola. And that's what we'll do on the broader challenge of ensuring our global health security. We will do our part. We will lead. We will put resources. But we cannot do it alone. <p>And that's why, back in February, before the current Ebola outbreak, we launched this global heath security agenda, and I pushed this agenda at the G-7 meeting, because we could see something like this coming. And we issued a challenge to ourselves and to all nations of the world to make concrete pledges towards three key goals: prevent, detect, and respond. We have to prevent outbreaks by reducing risks. We need to detect threats immediately wherever they arise. And we need to respond rapidly and effectively when we see something happening so that we can save lives and avert even larger outbreaks. <p>Now, the good news is, today, our nations have begun to answer the call. Together, our countries have made over 100 commitments both to strengthen our own security and to work with each other to strengthen the security of all countries' public health systems. And now we've got to turn those commitments into concrete action, starting in West Africa. We've got to make sure we never see a tragedy on this scale again, and we have to make sure we're not caught flat footed. Because you know better than I do that not only can we anticipate additional outbreaks, but we also know that viruses in large populations have the opportunity to mutate in ways that could make them even more deadly and spread more rapidly. <p>So first, we'll do more to prevent threats and outbreaks. We're going to partner with countries to help boost immunization rates to stop the spread of preventable diseases. We'll work together to improve biological security so nations can store, transport, and work with dangerous pathogens safely. Here in the United States, we're working with our partners to find new ways to stop animal diseases from crossing over into people, which, of course, is how Ebola started. And with the Executive order I signed last week, we now have a national strategy to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria, to better protect our children and grandchildren from the reemergence of diseases and infections that the world conquered decades ago. <p>Second, we'll do more to detect incidents and outbreaks. We'll help hospitals and health workers find ways to share information more quickly as outbreaks occur. We want to help countries improve their monitoring systems so they can track progress in real time. And we'll intensify our efforts to diagnose diseases faster. And technologies now exist, today, that diagnose many illnesses in minutes. And one of the things that we need to do is work together to find ways to get those new technologies to market as quickly as possible and distributed as quickly as possible. In too many places around the world, patients still have to wait sometimes for days to find out if they're sick, which means that in the meantime, they're infecting friends, and they're infecting family. We can do better on that. So we're going to keep working to get new technologies to hospitals and health workers who need it so they can diagnose patients quickly and do more to save lives at the earliest stages of disease. <p>And finally, we'll do more to respond faster when incidents and outbreaks happen. The United States will continue to help countries create their own emergency operations centers, with rapid response teams ready to deploy at a moment's notice. Just like our military conducts exercises to be ready, we'll lead more training exercises as well, helping countries stress-test their system and personnel so that in the event of an outbreak or biological attack, they know how to find the source, they know how to mitigate the impact, they know how to save lives. They can institute best practices that in many advanced countries we take for granted. I mean, the CDC, this is their job. If they find something out, they know how to isolate it rapidly, they know how to conduct the epidemiological studies, and they know what protocols to follow. Every country has the capacity to do that. Because a lot of times, it's not high tech, doesn't require huge resources; it does require planning and preparation. <p>As we're often seeing in West Africa, often the greatest need in a crisis is personnel who are trained and ready to deploy. So we're going to keep working to strengthen the global networks of experts. When a crisis occurs, there are enough specialists standing by, ready to work. <p>And today I'm pleased to announce a new effort to help health workers respond to diseases like Ebola. As many of you know firsthand, the protective gear that health workers wear can get incredibly hot, especially in humid environments. So today we're issuing a challenge to inventors and entrepreneurs and businesses of the world to design better protective solutions for our health workers. If you design them, we will make them. We will pay for them. And our goal is to get them to the field in a matter of months to help the people working in West Africa right now. I'm confident we can do this. <p>So here's the bottom line: No one should ever have to die for lack of an isolation tent or a treatment bed, as is happening in West Africa. No community should be left at the mercy of a horrific disease. No country should be caught by surprise if an outbreak starts to become an epidemic. We've got to act quickly. And we've got to meet the commitments that we're making here today and track our progress and hold each other accountable. <p>So you can anticipate that I will be bringing this up with the heads of state and government that you report to. I especially want to thank the governments of Finland and Indonesia, who've agreed to lead this effort going forward. I want to thank South Korea, which will host this conference next year. I want to keep the momentum going. <p>And as we go forward, let's remember what we're working toward: more families, more communities, more nations that are better able to provide for their own health security. And one thing I want to point out, because all of you have been working in the field for many years and understand these issues far better than I ever will. Even as we are working on preparedness, understand that the U.S. commitment&mdash;and hopefully, the world's commitment&mdash;to just building a better public health infrastructure generally remains. It's one thing for us to make sure that we can anticipate diseases&mdash;identify diseases early and respond to them rapidly and&mdash;but as everybody here knows, if the body is strong, if communities are strong, if nations are strong, then their immune systems are a little bit stronger. And so part of what we will also continue to have to do is make sure that children are well fed and that they're getting their immunizations and that people have opportunity to get out of extreme poverty. That's also part of the long-term agenda. <p>So we have a very narrow, specific issue in terms of how we respond to the potential outbreaks of epidemics like we're seeing in West Africa. I don't want people to think that somehow that distracts us from some of our broader public health goals. But right now what we're focused on today is to make sure that we have the opportunity to succeed in a situation in which success will never actually be seen. It will be the attacks that we prevented and the infections that we stopped before they started and the outbreaks that don't explode into epidemics. <p>The scenes we're seeing in West Africa are heartbreaking, and they tear at our conscience. But even now, in the face of unimaginable suffering, there's still hope. There's hope in people like Dr. Melvin Korkor from Liberia. I know he shared his story with you earlier here today. I think it's important for the world to hear it, for those of you who are just tuning in. <p>When the Ebola outbreak first began, in a different part of Liberia from where Dr. Korkor lives, he and his colleagues didn't think they were at risk. So they kept seeing patients, including some with fevers. And as many of you know, one of the tricky things about Ebola is, sometimes, it presents itself early with symptoms that could be malaria or typhoid. So Dr. Korkor and his colleagues didn't have enough latex gloves to use on those illnesses; they saved gloves for things like surgeries. One of those patients turned out to have Ebola. A few nurses got sick. After caring for them, Melvin tested positive as well. <p>He lay in bed surrounded by other patients, forcing himself to eat and drink even though he had no appetite, watching others die. He fought off despair by reading his Bible and tried to stay calm. And he says, as he describes it, \\"I said to myself I was going to make it.\\" \\"I said to myself I was going to make it.\\" And the days passed. Doctors and nurses gave him the best comfort and care that they could, and Melvin pulled through. He survived. And he says, \\"It was like being reborn.\\" And now, nearly 2 months after being declared disease free, he's counting down the days until his hospital reopens and he can get back to work in just a few weeks. <p>So, Melvin, your story reminds us that this virus can be beaten, because there are strong people, determined people in these countries who are prepared to do what it takes to save their friends and countrymen and families. But they need a little help. <p>At this very moment, there are thousands of health workers like Dr. Korkor in West Africa&mdash;on the ground, in cities, neighborhoods, and remote villages&mdash;doing everything they can to stop this virus, whatever it takes. And we have the tools to help them, to save lives. We have the knowledge and resources, not just to stop this outbreak, but to prevent something like this from happening again. <p>It is our moral obligation, and it is in our national self-interests to see this work through, to help them, to help ourselves; the commitment to make sure our Nation and our world is more secure; and the determination to work together to protect the lives of people. We have to be as strong and as determined and as driven as Melvin. <p>Thank you all for being part of this critical work. The United States is proud to be your partner. I'm looking forward to making sure that all these experts here get the support that they need from their leadership. And hopefully, as a consequence of meetings like this translated into action, we'll be savings lives for many years to come. <p>All right. Thank you.\" "
"221" "\"Hi, everybody. American leadership is the one constant in an uncertain world. That was true this week, as we mobilized the world to confront some of our most urgent challenges. <p>America is leading the world in the fight to degrade and ultimately destroy the terrorist group known as ISIL. On Monday, our brave men and women in uniform began air strikes against ISIL targets in Syria. And they weren't alone. I made it clear that America would act as part of a broad coalition, and we were joined in this action by friends and partners, including Arab nations. At the United Nations in New York, I worked to build more support for this coalition, to cut off terrorist financing, and to stop the flow of foreign fighters into and out of that region. And in my address to the U.N., I challenged the world&mdash;especially Muslim communities&mdash;to reject the ideology of violent extremism and to do more to tap the extraordinary potential of their young people. <p>America is leading the effort to rally the world against Russian aggression in Ukraine. Along with our allies, we will support the people of Ukraine as they develop their democracy and economy. And this week, I called upon even more nations to join us on the right side of history. <p>America is leading the fight to contain and combat the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. We're deploying our doctors and scientists, supported by our military, to help corral the outbreak and pursue new treatments. From the United Kingdom and Germany to France and Senegal, other nations are stepping up their efforts too, sending money, supplies, and personnel. And we will continue to rally other countries to join us in making concrete commitments to fight this disease and enhance global health security for the long term. <p>America is engaging more partners and allies to confront the growing threat of climate change before it's too late. We're doing our part and helping developing nations do theirs. At home, we've invested in clean energy, cut carbon pollution, and created new jobs in the process. Abroad, our climate assistance now reaches more than 120 nations. And on Tuesday, I called on every nation&mdash;developed and developing alike&mdash;to join us in this effort for the sake of future generations. <p>The people of the world look to us to lead. And we welcome that responsibility. We are heirs to a proud legacy of freedom. And as we showed the world this week, we are prepared to do what is necessary to secure that legacy for generations to come. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"222" "\"Hello, CBC! Thank you so much. Everybody, have a seat. It is good to be with you here tonight. If it wasn't black tie, I would have worn my tan suit. [<i>Laughter</i>] I thought it looked good. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Thank you, Chaka, for that introduction. Thanks to all of you for having me here this evening. I want to acknowledge the members of the Congressional Black Caucus and Chairwoman Marcia Fudge for their outstanding work. Thank you, Shuanise Washington, and the CBC Foundation for doing so much to help our young people aim high and reach their potential. <p>Tonight I want to begin by paying special tribute to a man with whom all of you have worked closely with; someone who served his country for nearly 40 years as a prosecutor, as a judge, and as Attorney General of the United States: Mr. Eric Holder. Throughout his long career in public service, Eric has built a powerful legacy of making sure that equal justice under the law actually means something, that it applies to everybody, regardless of race or gender or religion or color, creed, disability, sexual orientation. He has been a great friend of mine. He has been a faithful servant of the American people. We will miss him badly. <p>This year, we've been marking the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act. We honor giants like John Lewis, unsung heroines like Evelyn Lowery. We honor the countless Americans, some who are in this room&mdash;Black, White, students, scholars, preachers, housekeepers&mdash;patriots all, who, with their bare hands, reached into the well of our Nation's founding ideals and helped to nurture a more perfect Union. We've reminded ourselves that progress is not just absorbing what has been done, it's advancing what's left undone. <p>Even before President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act into law, even as the debate dragged on in the Senate, he was already challenging America to do more and march further, to build a Great Society, one, Johnson said: \\"where no child will go unfed, and no youngster will go unschooled. Where no man who wants work will fail to find it. Where no citizen will be barred from any door because of his birthplace or his color or his church. Where peace and security is common among neighbors and possible among nations.\\" \\"This is the world that waits for you,\\" he said. \\"Reach out for it now. Join the fight to finish the unfinished work.\\" To finish the unfinished work. <p>America has made stunning progress since that time, over the past 50 years, even over the past 5 years. But it is the unfinished work that drives us forward. <p>Some of our unfinished work lies beyond our borders. America is leading the effort to rally the world against Russian aggression in Ukraine. America is leading the fight to contain and combat Ebola in Africa. America is building and leading the coalition that will degrade and ultimately destroy the terrorist group known as ISIL. As Americans, we are leading, and we don't shy away from these responsibilities, we welcome them. That's what America does. And we are grateful to the men and women in uniform who put themselves in harm's way in service of the country that we all love. So we've got unfinished work overseas, but we've got some unfinished work right here at home. After the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, our businesses have now created 10 million new jobs over the last 54 months. This is the longest uninterrupted stretch of job growth in our history. [<i>Applause</i>] In our history. But we understand our work is not done until we get the kind of job creation that means everybody who wants work can a find job. <p>We've done some work on health care too. I don't know if you've noticed. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, we've seen a 26 percent decline in the uninsured rate in America. African Americans have seen a 30 percent decline. And by the way, the cost of health care isn't going up as fast anymore either. Everybody was predicting this was all going to be so expensive. We've saved $800 billion in Medicare because of the work that we've done, slowing the cost, improving quality and improving access. Despite unyielding opposition, this change has happened just in the last couple of years. <p>But we know our work is not yet done until we get into more communities, help more uninsured folks get covered, especially in those States where the Governors aren't being quite as cooperative as we'd like them to be. You know who you are. It always puzzles me where you decide to take a stand to make sure poor folks in your State can't get health insurance even though it doesn't cost you a dime. That doesn't make much sense to me, but I won't go on on that topic. We've got more work to do. <p>It's easy to take a stand when you've got health insurance. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm going off script now, but&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that's what happens at the CBC. <p>Our high school graduation rate is at a record high, the dropout rate is falling, more young people are earning college degrees than ever before. Last year, the number of children living in poverty fell by 1.4 million, the largest decline since 1966. Since I took office, the overall crime rate and the overall incarceration rate has gone down by about 10 percent. That's the first time they've declined at the same time in more than 40 years. Fewer folks in jail. Crime still going down. <p>But our work is not done when too many children live in crumbling neighborhoods, cycling through substandard schools, traumatized by daily violence. Our work is not done when working Americans of all races have seen their wages and incomes stagnate, even as corporate profits soar; when African American unemployment is still twice as high as White unemployment; when income inequality, on the rise for decades, continues to hold back hard-working communities, especially communities of color. We've got unfinished work. And we know what to do. That's the worst part, we know what to do. <p>We know we've got to invest in infrastructure and manufacturing and research and development that creates new jobs. We've got to keep rebuilding a middle class economy with ladders of opportunity so that hard work pays off and you see higher wages and higher incomes and fair pay for women doing the same work as men and workplace flexibility for parents in case a child gets sick or a parent needs some help. We've got to build more Promise Zones partnerships to support local revitalization of hard-hit communities. We've got to keep investing in early childhood education. We want to bring preschool to every 4-year-old in this country. And we want every child to have an excellent teacher. And we want to invest in our community colleges and expand Pell grants for more students. And I'm going to keep working with you to make college more affordable. Because every child in America, no matter who she is, no matter where she's born, no matter how much money her parents have, ought to be able to fulfill her God-given potential. That's what we believe. So I just want everybody to understand, we have made enormous progress. There's almost no economic measure by which we are not better off than when I took office. Unemployment down. Deficits down. Uninsured down. Poverty down. Energy production up. Manufacturing back. Auto industry back. But&mdash;and I just list these things just so if you have a discussion with one of your friends&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and they're confused. Stock market up. Corporate balance sheet strong. Hey, in fact, the folks who are doing the best, they're the ones who complain the most. [<i>Laughter</i>] So you can just point these things out. <p>But we still have to close these opportunity gaps. And we have to close the justice gap: how justice is applied, but also how it is perceived, how it is experienced. Eric Holder understands this. That's what we saw in Ferguson this summer, when Michael Brown was killed and a community was divided. We know that the unrest continues. And Eric spent some time with the residents and police of Ferguson, and the Department of Justice has indicated that its civil rights investigation is ongoing. <p>Now, I won't comment on the investigation. I know that Michael's family is here tonight. I know that nothing any of us can say can ease the grief of losing a child so soon. But the anger and the emotion that followed his death awakened our Nation once again to the reality that people in this room have long understood, which is, in too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement. <p>Too many young men of color feel targeted by law enforcement, guilty of walking while Black or driving while Black, judged by stereotypes that fuel fear and resentment and hopelessness. We know that, statistically, in everything from enforcing drug policy to applying the death penalty, to pulling people over, there are significant racial disparities. That's just the statistics. One recent poll showed that the majority of Americans think the criminal justice system doesn't treat people of all races equally. Think about that. That's not just Blacks, not just Latinos or Asians or Native Americans saying things may not be fair. That's most Americans. <p>And that has a corrosive effect, not just on the Black community; it has a corrosive effect on America. It harms the communities that need law enforcement the most. It makes folks who are victimized by crime and need strong policing reluctant to go to the police because they may not trust them. And the worst part of it is, it scars the hearts of our children. It scars the hearts of White children who grow unnecessarily fearful of somebody who doesn't look like them. It stains the heart of Black children who feel as if no matter what he does, he'll always be under suspicion. That is not the society we want. It's not the society that our children deserve. Whether you're Black or White, you don't want that for America. <p>It was interesting, Ferguson was used by some of America's enemies and critics to deflect attention from their own shortcomings overseas, to undermine our efforts to promote justice around the world. They said, well, look at what's happened to you back home. <p>But as I said this week at the United Nations, America is special not because we're perfect; America is special because we work to address our problems, to make our Union more perfect. We fight for more justice. We fight to cure what ails us. We fight for our ideals, and we're willing to criticize ourselves when we fall short. And we address our differences in the open space of democracy, with respect for the rule of law, with a place for people of every race and religion, and with an unyielding belief that people who love their country can change it. That's what makes us special, not because we don't have problems, but because we work to fix them. And we will continue to work to fix this. And to that end, we need to help communities and law enforcement build trust, build understanding, so that our neighborhoods stay safe and our young people stay on track. And under the leadership of Attorney General Eric Holder, the Justice Department has launched a national effort to do just that. He's also been working to make the criminal justice system smarter and more effective by addressing unfair sentencing disparities, changing Department policies on charging mandatory minimums, promoting stronger reentry programs for those who have paid their debt to society. <p>And we need to address the unique challenges that make it hard for some of our young people to thrive. For all the success stories that exist in a room like this one, we all know relatives, classmates, neighbors who were just as smart as we were, just as capable as we were, born with the same light behind their eyes, the same joy, the same curiosity about the world, but somehow, they didn't get the support they needed or the encouragement they needed, or they made a mistake, or they missed an opportunity; they weren't able to overcome the obstacles that they faced. <p>And so, in February, we launched \\"My Brother's Keeper.\\" And I was the first one to acknowledge, government can't play the only, or even the primary, role in the lives of our children. But what we can do is bring folks together, and that's what we're doing&mdash;philanthropies, business leaders, entrepreneurs, faith leaders, mayors, educators, athletes, and the youth themselves&mdash;to examine how can we ensure that our young men have the tools they need to achieve their full potential. <p>And next week, I'm launching \\"My Brother's Keeper\\" Community Challenge, asking every community in the country&mdash;big cities and small towns, rural counties, tribal nations&mdash;publicly commit to implementing strategies that will ensure all young people can succeed, starting from cradle, all the way to college and a career. It's a challenge to local leaders to follow the evidence and use the resources on what works for our kids. And we've already got a hundred mayors, county officials, tribal leaders, Democrats, Republicans signed on. And we're going to keep on signing them up in the coming weeks and months. But they're going to need you&mdash;elected leaders, business leaders, community leaders&mdash;to make this effort successful. We need all of us to come together to help all of our young people address the variety of challenges they face. <p>And we're not forgetting about the girls, by the way. I've got two daughters, I don't know if you noticed. [<i>Laughter</i>] African American girls are more likely than their White peers also to be suspended, incarcerated, physically harassed. Black women struggle every day with biases that perpetuate oppressive standards for how they're supposed to look and how they're supposed to act. Too often, they're either left under the hard light of scrutiny or cloaked in a kind of invisibility. <p>So in addition to the new efforts on \\"My Brother's Keeper,\\" the White House Council for Women and Girls has for years been working on issues affecting women and girls of color, from violence against women to pay equity, to access to health care. And you know Michelle has been working on that, because she doesn't think our daughters should be treated differently than anybody else's sons. I've got a vested interest in making sure that our daughters have the same opportunities as boys do. <p>So that's the world we've got to reach for&mdash;the world where every single one of our children has the opportunity to pursue their measure of happiness. That's our unfinished work. And we're going to have to fight for it. We've got to stand up for it. And we have to vote for it. [<i>Applause</i>] We have to vote for it. All around the country, wherever I see folks, they always say: \\"Oh, Barack, we're praying for you. Boy, you're so gray. Look, you've got all gray haired; you're looking tired.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"We're praying for you.\\" Which I appreciate. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I tell them, after President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, he immediately moved on to what he called \\"the meat in the coconut,\\" a voting rights act bill. And some of his administration argued that's too much, it's too soon. Movement know&mdash;but the movement knew that if we rested after the Civil Rights Act, then all we could do was pray that somebody would enforce those rights. <p>So whenever I hear somebody say they're praying for me, I say thank you. Thank you. I believe in the power of prayer. But we need more than prayer. We need to vote. [<i>Applause</i>] We need to vote. That will be helpful. It will not relieve me of my gray hair, but it will help me pass some bills. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Because people refused to give in when it was hard, we get to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act next year. Until then, we've got to protect it. We can't just celebrate it, we've got to protect it. Because there are people still trying to pass voter ID laws to make it harder for folks to vote. And we've got to get back to our schools and our offices and our churches, our beauty shops, barber shops, and make sure folks know there's an election coming up, they need to know how to register, and they need to know how and when to vote. <p>We've got to tell them to push back against the cynics, prove everybody wrong who says that change isn't possible. Cynicism does not fix anything. Cynicism is very popular in America sometimes. It's propagated in the media. But cynicism didn't put anybody on the Moon. Cynicism didn't pass the Voting Rights Act. Hope is what packed buses full of freedom riders. Hope is what led thousands of Black folks and White folks to march from Selma to Montgomery. Hope is what got John Lewis off his back after being beaten within an inch of his life and chose to keep on going. <p>Cynicism is a choice, but hope is a better choice. And our job right now is to convince the people we're privileged to represent to join us in finishing that fight that folks like John started. Get those souls to the polls. Exercise their right to vote. And if we do, then I guarantee you we've got a brighter future ahead. <p>Thank you, God bless you. Keep praying. But go out there and vote. God bless America.\" "
"223" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! Hello, Kansas City. Everybody, have a seat. Have a seat. Welcome to the White House. Give it up to the MLS champ, Sporting Kansas City. [<i>Applause</i>] Yay! <p>Now, my Press Secretary, Josh Earnest, is from Kansas City. He has made the observation that the Royals are advancing, that the Chiefs made the Patriots look kind of bad on Monday night. [<i>Laughter</i>] And so, clearly, something is going on in Kansas City, but apparently, these guys are the ones who got it all started, got the ball rolling. It's a pretty good day to be from Kansas City. You guys are feeling kind of cocky right now. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We've got some Members of Congress who are here today from Kansas City, who obviously love sports. It's a great sports town. We've got the Sporting KC's owners and family. I want to congratulate your manager, Peter Vermes, for becoming the first person in MLS history to win titles both as a player and a coach in the same organization. [<i>Applause</i>] Pretty good. <p>That is not the only history that Sporting KC made this season. After beating New England and Houston in the playoffs to win the Eastern Conference, they were rewarded with the coldest title game ever played in Major League Soccer. [<i>Laughter</i>] When the game started, the temperature was just 20 degrees. By the end, it was less than 10 degrees. I'm sure that felt good. [<i>Laughter</i>] That was after 120 minutes of soccer and the longest penalty shootout&mdash;10 rounds&mdash;in MLS Cup history. But finally, Aur&eacute;lien Collin kicked the winning penalty shot, and KC raised their second Cup. <p>And the thing about Kansas City fans is that even in below-freezing temperatures, the seats were filled. Sporting Park was packed. It is a city that loves soccer. They've sold out 51 straight games. In a section of seats called the Cauldron, thousands of fans came out to stand and chant all game long. <p>And this past summer, when Americans passed restaurants&mdash;packed restaurants and stadiums and city parks during the World Cup, the fans in Kansas City led the way. It seemed like 10 minutes couldn't pass without seeing live shots of thousands of fans crowding the Power and Light District and cheering on Team U.S.A. I know they cheered extra hard for Matt Besler and Graham Zusi, who represented Sporting KC and their country in Brazil. So as soccer continues to grow here in the United States, it does so in large part because of the great example of dedicated fans in Kansas City. So congratulations to all of you. <p>In the same way that Kansas City has embraced its soccer team, the soccer team has embraced the city. Aur&eacute;lien has a fashion line and men's clothing shop in Kansas City. [<i>Laughter</i>] Is he&mdash;where are you? You want to model some of your stuff? [<i>Laughter</i>] He's got the pocket square, the earrings. I'm going to look like him after I get out of office. [<i>Laughter</i>] He looks pretty sharp. You've got Seth Sinovic, the assistant&mdash;and Assistant Coach Kerry Zavagnin and goalkeeper Jimmy Nielsen, who all made their debuts in the Kansas City Ballet last year. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's impressive. They got to bring that trophy with them on stage to distract the audience from their limited ballet skills. [<i>Laughter</i>] And through the Victory Project, Sporting KC works to raise money for kids in the region with cancer and special needs and life-threatening medical conditioning&mdash;conditions through the Make-A-Wish Foundation. They've opened new practice fields, they're hosting soccer clinics all over Missouri and Kansas. So this is an organization that knows that being a champion isn't just about what you do on the field, it's also what you do off the field. <p>I know that the entire city is very, very proud of you. We want to congratulate you. And I want to congratulate all the fans of Kansas City for the great job you do as well. So give them all a big round of applause. <p><i>Manager Peter J. Vermes.</i> So a little background. Fourteen years ago, as you stated earlier, I won the MLS Cup with the team as a player. And unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to come to the White House, so I figured I had to go back and become a coach to win it so that I could get here. So here I am. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I'm pretty excited about that aspect. <p>What I'd like to say is, from the entire organization, thank you very much for hosting us. We greatly appreciate it. Obviously, this is an incredible honor for all of us. And more importantly, hopefully, we can do it again, and we can show up here again and see you in a year from now. <p>So I'd like to first present you with this medal. We also have a&mdash;I'm not sure which side it's on&mdash;there is a&mdash;it's on this side? We have a shirt; you might want to go take a look at that. I think it's pretty good. <p><i>The President.</i> It's a beautiful shirt, but I'm going to have to break the glass to wear it. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Thank you so much. Congratulations. <p><i>Manager Vermes.</i> Thank you, I really appreciate it. <p><i>The President.</i> Good, appreciate you.\" "
"224" "\"Hello, Evanston! Hello, Northwestern! Oh, thank you so much. Everybody, have a seat. Have a seat. It is so good to be here. Go 'Cats! I want to thank your president, Morty Schapiro, and the dean of the Kellogg business school, Sally Blount, for having me. I brought along some guests. Your Governor, Pat Quinn, is here. Your Senator, Dick Durbin, is here. Your Congresswoman, Jan Schakowsky, is here. We've got some folks who represent the Chicagoland area in Congress and do a great job every day: Danny Davis, Robin Kelly, Mike Quigley, Brad Schneider. We've got your mayor, Elizabeth Tisdahl. Where's Elizabeth? There she is. One of my great friends, former Chief of Staff, the mild-mannered mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, is here. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>It is great to be back home. It's great to be back at Northwestern. Back when I was a Senator, I had the honor of delivering the commencement address for the class of 2006. And as it turns out, I've got a bunch of staff who graduated from here, and so they're constantly lobbying me about stuff. And so earlier this year, I popped in via video to help kick off the dance marathon. [<i>Laughter</i>] I figured this time I'd come in person&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;not only because it's nice to be so close to home, but it's also just nice to see old friends, people who helped to form how I think about public service, people who helped me along the way. Toni Preckwinkle was my alderwoman before&mdash;and was a great supporter. Lisa Madigan, your attorney general, was my seatmate. State Senator Terry Link was my golf buddy. So you've got people here who I've just known for years and really not only helped me be where I am today, but helped develop how I think about public service. <p>And I'm also happy to be here because this is a university that is brimming with the possibilities of a new economy: your research and technology, the ideas and the innovation, the training of doctors and educators and scientists and entrepreneurs. But you can't help but visit a campus like this and feel the promise of the future. <p>And that's why I'm here, because it's going to be young people like you, and universities like this, that will shape the American economy and set the conditions for middle class growth well into the 21st century. <p>And obviously, recent months have seen their fair share of turmoil around the globe. But one thing should be crystal clear: American leadership is the one constant in an uncertain world. It's America&mdash;our troops, our diplomats&mdash;that lead the fight to degrade and ultimately destroy the terrorist group known as ISIL. It's America&mdash;our doctors, our scientists, our know-how&mdash;that leads the fight to contain and combat the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. It's America&mdash;our colleges, our graduate schools, our unrivaled private sector&mdash;that attracts so many people to our shores to study and start businesses and tackle some of the most challenging problems in the world. <p>When alarms go off somewhere in the world, whether it's a disaster that is natural or man made; when there's an idea or an invention that can make a difference, this is where things start. This is who the world calls: America. They don't call Moscow, they don't call Beijing, they call us. And we welcome that responsibility of leadership, because that's who we are. That's what we expect of ourselves. But what supports our leadership role in the world is ultimately the strength of our economy here at home. And today I want to step back from the rush of global events to take a clear-eyed look at our economy, its successes and its shortcomings, and determine what we still need to build for your generation, what you can help us build. <p>Now, as Americans, we can and should be proud of the progress that our country has made over these past 6 years. And here are the facts, because sometimes, the noise clutters and, I think, confuses the nature of the reality out there. Here are the facts: When I took office, businesses were laying off 800,000 Americans a month. Today, our businesses are hiring 200,000 Americans a month. The unemployment rate has come down from a high of 10 percent in 2009 to 6.1 percent today. Over the past 4&frac12; years, our businesses have created 10 million new jobs; this is the longest uninterrupted stretch of private sector job creation in our history. Think about that. And you don't have to applaud at&mdash;because I'm going to be giving you a lot of good statistics. [<i>Laughter</i>] Right now there are more job openings than at any time since 2001. All told, the United States has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and every other advanced economy combined. I want you to think about that. We have put more people back to work, here in America, than Europe, Japan, and every other advanced economy combined. <p>Now, this progress has been hard, but it has been steady and it has been real. And it's the direct result of the American people's drive and their determination and their resilience, but it's also the result of sound decisions made by my administration. <p>So it is indisputable that our economy is stronger today than when I took office. By every economic measure, we are better off now than we were when I took office. At the same time, it's also indisputable that millions of Americans don't yet feel enough of the benefits of a growing economy where it matters most, and that's in their own lives. <p>And these truths aren't incompatible. Our broader economy in the aggregate has come a long way, but the gains of recovery are not yet broadly shared or at least not broadly shared enough. We can see that homes in our communities are selling for more money and that the stock market's doubled and maybe the neighbors have new health care or a car fresh off an American assembly line. And these are all good things. But the stress that families feel, that's real too. It's still harder than it should be to pay the bills and to put away some money. Even when you're working your tail off, it's harder than it should be to get ahead. <p>And this isn't just a hangover from the great recession. I've always said that recovering from the crisis of 2008 was our first order of business, but I also said that our economy wouldn't be truly healthy until we reverse the much longer and profound erosion of middle class jobs and incomes. <p>So here's our challenge. We're creating more jobs at a steady pace. We've got a recovering housing market, a revitalized manufacturing sector, two things that are critical to middle class success. We've also begun to see some modest wage growth in recent months. All of that has gotten the economy rolling again, despite the fact that the economies of many other countries around the world are softening. But as Americans, we measure our success by something more than our GDP or a jobs report. We measure it by whether our jobs provide meaningful work that give people a sense of purpose and whether it allows folks to take care of their families. And too many families still work too many hours with too little to show for it. Job growth could be so much faster and wages could be going up faster if we made some better decisions going forward with the help of Congress. So our task now is to harness the momentum that is real, <p>that does exist, and make sure that we accelerate that momentum, that the economy grows and jobs grow and wages grow. That's our challenge. <p>When the typical family isn't bringing home any more than it did in 1997, then that means it's harder for middle class Americans to climb the ladder of success. It means that it's harder for poor Americans to grab hold of the ladder into the middle class. That's not what America is supposed to be about. It offends the very essence of who we are. Because if being an American means anything, it means we believe that even if we're born with nothing&mdash;regardless of our circumstances, our last name, whether we were wealthy, whether our parents were advantaged&mdash;no matter what our circumstances, with hard work, we can change our lives, and then, our kids can too. <p>And that's about more than just fairness. It's more than just the idea of what America is about. When middle class families can't afford to buy the goods or services our businesses sell, it actually makes it harder for our economy to grow. Our economy cannot truly succeed if we're stuck in a winner-take-all system where a shrinking few do very well while a growing many are struggling to get by. Historically, our economic greatness rests on a simple principle: When the middle class thrives and when people can work hard to get into the middle class, then America thrives. And when it doesn't, America doesn't. <p>This is going to be a central challenge of our times. We have to make our economy work for every working American. And every policy I pursue as President is aimed at answering that challenge. <p>Over the last decade, we learned the hard way that it wasn't sustainable to have an economy where too much of the growth was based on inflated home prices and bubbles that burst and a casino mentality on Wall Street; where the recklessness of a few could threaten all of us; where incomes at the top skyrocketed, while working families saw theirs decline. That was not a formula for sustained growth. We need an economy that's built on a rock, and that&mdash;a rock that is durable and competitive, and that's a steady source of good, middle class jobs. When that's happening, everybody does well. <p>So that's why on day one, when I took office, with Rahm and Dick Durbin and others who were working with us, I said we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation for growth and prosperity. And with dedicated, persistent effort, we've actually been laying the cornerstones of this foundation every single day since. <p>So I mentioned earlier that there is not an economic measure by which we're not better off than when we took office. But let me break down what we've also been doing structurally to make sure that we have a strong foundation for growth going forward. <p>The first cornerstone is new investments in the energy and technologies that make America a magnet for good, middle class jobs. So right off the bat, as soon as I came into office, we upped our investments in American energy to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and strengthen our own energy security. And today, the number-one oil and gas producer in the world is no longer Russia or Saudi Arabia. It's America. <p>For the first time in nearly two decades, we now produce more oil than we buy from other countries. We're advancing so fast in this area that 2 years ago, I set a goal to cut our oil imports by half by&mdash;in half by 2020, and we've actually&mdash;we will meet that goal this year, 6 years ahead of schedule. So that's in the traditional fossil fuel area. But at the same time, we've helped put tens of thousands of people to work manufacturing wind turbines and installing solar panels on homes and businesses. We have tripled the electricity that we harness from the wind. We have increased tenfold what we generate from the sun. We have brought enough clean energy on line to power every home and business in Illinois and Wisconsin, 24/7. And that's the kind of progress that we can be proud of and in part accounts for the progress we have also made in reducing carbon emissions that cause climate change. And I know that here at Northwestern, your researchers are working to convert sunlight into liquid fuel, which sounds impossible or at least really hard. [<i>Laughter</i>] But the good news is, if you need to get the hard or the impossible done, America and American universities are a pretty good place to start. <p>Meanwhile, our 100-year supply of natural gas is a big factor in drawing jobs back to our shores. Many are in manufacturing, which produce the quintessential middle class job. During the last decade, it was widely accepted that American manufacturing was in irreversible decline. And just 6 years ago, its crown jewel, the American auto industry, could not survive on its own. With the help of folks like Jan and Dick and Mike Quigley and others, we helped our automakers restructure and retool. Today, they're building and selling new cars at the fastest rate in 8 years. We invested in new plants, new technologies, new high-tech hubs like the Digital Manufacturing and Design Institute that Northwestern has partnered with in Chicago. <p>Today, American manufacturing has added more than 700,000 new jobs. It's growing almost twice as fast as the rest of the economy. And more than half of all manufacturing executives have said they are actively looking at bringing jobs back from China. To many in the middle class, the last decade was defined by outsourcing good jobs overseas. If we keep up these investments, we can define this decade by what's known as \\"insourcing,\\" with new factories now opening their doors here in America at the fastest pace in decades. And in the process, we've also worked to grow American exports and open new markets, knock down barriers to trade, because businesses that export tend to have better paying jobs. So today, our businesses sell more goods and services made in America to the rest of the world than ever before&mdash;ever. <p>And that's progress we can be proud of. Now, we also know that many of these manufacturing jobs have changed. You're not just punching in and pounding rivets anymore; you're coding computers, and you're guiding robots. You're mastering 3-D printing. And these jobs require some higher education or technical training. And that's why the second cornerstone of the new foundation we've been building is making sure our children are prepared and our workers are prepared to fill the jobs of the future. <p>America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free. We sent a generation to college. We cultivated the most educated workforce in the world. But it didn't take long for other countries to look at our policies and caught on to the secret of our success. So they set out to educate their kids too so they could outcompete our kids. We have to lead the world in education once again. <p>That's why we launched a Race to the Top in our schools, trained thousands of math and science teachers, supported States that raised standards for learning. Today, teachers in 48 States and DC are teaching our kids the knowledge and skills they need to compete and win in the global economy. Working with parents and educators, we've turned around some of the country's lowest performing schools. We're on our way to connecting 99 percent of students to high-speed Internet and making sure every child, at every seat, has the best technology for learning. And so look, let's face it: Some of these changes are hard. Sometimes, they cause controversy. And we have a long way to go. But public education in America is actually improving. Last year, our elementary and middle school students had the highest math and reading scores on record. The dropout rates for Latinos and African Americans are down. The high school graduation rate&mdash;the high school graduation rate is up. It's now above 80 percent for the first time in history. We've invested in more than 700 community colleges, which are so often gateways to the middle class, and we're connecting them with employers to train high school graduates for good jobs in fast-growing fields like high-tech manufacturing and energy and IT and cybersecurity. <p>Here in Chicago, Rahm just announced that the city will pay community college tuition for more striving high school graduates. We've helped more students afford college with grants and tax credits and loans. And today, more young people are graduating than ever before. We've sent more veterans to college on the post-9/11 GI bill&mdash;including several veterans here at Northwestern&mdash;and a few of us&mdash;a few of them are in this hall today, and we thank them for their service. <p>So we've made progress on manufacturing and creating good jobs. We've made progress on education. Of course, even if you have the right education, for decades, one of the things that made it harder for families to make ends meet and businesses to grow was the high cost of health care. And so the third cornerstone had to be health care reform. <p>In the decade before the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a., Obamacare&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;in the decade before the Affordable Care Act, double-digit premium increases were common. CEOs called them one of the biggest challenges to their competitiveness. And if your employer didn't drop your coverage to avoid these costs, they might pass them on to you and take them out of your wages. <p>Today, we have seen a dramatic slowdown in the rising cost of health care. When we passed the Affordable Care Act, the critics were saying, what are you doing about cost? Well, let me tell you what we've done about costs. If your family gets your health care through your employer, premiums are rising at a rate tied for the lowest on record. And what this means for the economy is staggering. If we hadn't taken this on and premiums had kept growing at the rate they did in the last decade, the average premium for family coverage today would be $1,800 higher than they are. Now, most people don't notice it, but that's $1,800 you don't have to pay out of your pocket or see vanish from your paycheck. That's like a $1,800 tax cut. That's not for folks who signed up for Obamacare. That's the consequences of some of the reforms that we've made. <p>And because the insurance marketplaces we created encourage insurers to compete for your business, in many of cities they've announced that next year's premiums&mdash;well, something important is happening here&mdash;next year's premiums are actually falling in some of these markets. One expert said this is \\"defying the law of physics.\\" But we're getting it done. And it is progress we can be proud of. <p>So we're slowing the cost of health care, and we're covering more people at the same time. In just the last year, we reduced the share of uninsured Americans by 26 percent. That means one in four uninsured Americans&mdash;about 10 million people&mdash;have gained the financial security of health insurance in less than 1 year. And for young entrepreneurs, like many of you here today, the fact that you can compare and buy affordable plans in the marketplace frees you up to strike out on your own, chase that new idea, something I hope will unleash new and&mdash;new services and products and enterprises all across the country. So the job lock that used to exist because you needed health insurance, you're free from that now. You can go out and do something on your own and get affordable health care. <p>And meanwhile, partly because health care prices have been growing at the slowest rates in nearly 50 years, the growth in what health care costs the Government is down also. I want everybody to listen carefully here, because when we were debating the Affordable Care Act, there was a lot of complaining about how we couldn't afford this. The independent, nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office recently reported that in 2020, Medicare and Medicaid will cost us $188 billion less than projected just 4 years ago. And here's what that means in layman's terms: Health care has long been the single biggest driver of America's future deficits. It's been the single biggest driver of our debt. Health care is now the single biggest factor driving down those deficits. <p>And this is a game-changer for the fourth cornerstone of this new foundation: getting our fiscal house in order for the long run so we can afford to make investments that grow the middle class. Between a growing economy, some prudent spending cuts, health care reform, and asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little bit more on their taxes, over the past 5 years, we've cut our deficits by more than half. When I took office, the deficit was nearly 10 percent of our economy. Today, it's approaching 3 percent. In other words, we can shore up America's long-term finances without falling back into the mindless austerity or manufactured crises or trying to find excuses to slash benefits to seniors that dominated Washington budget debates for so long. <p>And finally, we've put in place financial reform to protect consumers and prevent a crisis on Wall Street from hammering Main Street ever again. We have new tools to prevent \\"too big to fail,\\" to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts. We made it illegal for big banks to gamble with your money. We established the first-ever consumer watchdog to protect consumers from irresponsible lending or credit card practices. We secured billions of dollars in relief for consumers who get taken advantage of. And working with States' attorneys general like Lisa Madigan, we've seen industry practices changing. <p>Now an argument you'll hear oftentimes from critics is that the way to grow the economy is to just get rid of regulations, free folks up from the oppressive hand of the government. And you know, it turns out, truth be told, there are still some kind of dopey regulations on the books. [<i>Laughter</i>] There are regulations that are outdated or are no longer serving a useful purpose. And we have scrubbed the laws out there and identified hundreds that are outdated, that don't help our economy, that don't make sense, and we're saving businesses billions of dollars by gradually eliminating those unnecessary regulations. But you have to contrast that with rules that discourage a casino-style mentality on Wall Street or rules that protect the basic safety of workers on the job or rules that safeguard the air our children breathe and keep mercury or arsenic out of our water supply. These don't just have economic benefits, these are rules that save lives and protect families. And I'll always stand up for those, and they're good for our economy. <p>So here's the bottom line: For all the work that remains, for all the citizens that we still need to reach, what I want people to know is that there are some really good things happening in America. Unemployment down. Jobs up. Manufacturing growing. Deficits cut by more than half. High school graduation is up. College enrollment up. Energy production up. Clean energy production up. Financial system more stable. Health care costs rising at a slower rate. Across the board, the trend lines have moved in the right direction. That's because this new foundation is now in place. New investments in energy and technologies that create new jobs and new industries. New investments in education that will make our workforce more skilled and competitive. New reforms to health care that cut costs for families and businesses. New reforms to our Federal budget that will promote smart investments and stronger&mdash;a stronger economy for future generations. New rules for our financial system to protect consumers and prevent the kinds of crises that we endured from happening again. <p>You add it all up, and it's no surprise that for the first time in more than a decade, business leaders from around the world&mdash;these are business surveys&mdash;Kellogg, you're familiar with these. [<i>Laughter</i>] Business leaders from around the world have said the world's most attractive place to invest is not India or China, it's the United States of America. And that's because the financial sector is healthier, because manufacturing is healthier, because the housing market is healthier, because health care inflation is at a 50-year low, because our energy boom is at new highs. Because of all these things, our economy isn't just primed for steadier, more sustained growth; America is better poised to lead and succeed in the 21st century than any other nation on Earth. We've got the best cards. <p>And I will not allow anyone to dismantle this foundation. Because for the first time, we can see real, tangible evidence of what the contours of the new economy will look like. It's an economy teeming with new industry and commerce and humming with new energy and new technologies and bustling with highly skilled, higher-wage workers. <p>It's an America where a student graduating from college has the chance to advance through a vibrant job market and where an entrepreneur can start a new business and succeed and where an older worker can retool for that new job. And to fully realize this vision requires steady, relentless investment in these areas. We cannot let up, and we cannot be complacent. We have to be hungry as a nation. We have to compete. When we do&mdash;if we take the necessary steps to build on the foundation that, through some really hard work, we have laid over the last several years&mdash;I promise you, over the next 10 years, we'll build an economy where wage growth is stronger than it was in the past three decades. It is achievable. <p>So let me just talk a little more specifically about what we should be doing right now. First of all, we've got to realize that the trends that have battered the middle class for so long aren't ones that we're going to reverse overnight. The facts that I just laid out don't mean that there aren't a lot of folks out there who are underpaid, they're underemployed, they're working long hours, they're having trouble making ends meet. I hear from them every day. I meet with them. And it's heartbreaking, because they're struggling hard. And there are no silver bullets for job creation or faster wage growth. Anybody who tells you otherwise is not telling the truth. But there are policies that would grow jobs and wages faster than we're doing right now. <p>If we rebuild roads and bridges&mdash;because we've got $2 trillion of deferred maintenance on our infrastructure&mdash;we won't just put construction workers and engineers on the job; we will revitalize entire communities and connect people to jobs and make it easier for businesses to ship goods around the world. And we can pay for it with tax reform that actually cuts rates on businesses, but closes wasteful loopholes, making it even more attractive for companies to invest and create jobs here in the United States. Let's do this and make our economy stronger. <p>If we make it easier for first-time homebuyers to get a loan, we won't just create even more construction jobs and speed up recovery in the housing market, we'll speed up your efforts to grow a nest egg and start a new company and send your own kids to college and graduate school someday. So let's help more young families buy that first home, make our economy stronger. <p>If we keep investing in clean energy technology, we won't just put people to work on the assembly lines, pounding into place the zero-carbon components of a clean energy age, we'll reduce our carbon emissions and prevent the worst costs of climate change down the road. Let's do this: invest in new American energy and make our economy stronger. <p>If we make high-quality preschool available to every child, not only will we give our kids a safe place to learn and grow while their parents go to work, we'll give them the start that they need to succeed in school and earn higher wages and form more stable families of their own. In fact, today I'm setting a new goal: By the end of this decade, let's enroll 6 million children in high-quality preschool. That is an achievable goal that we know will make our workforce stronger. <p>If we redesign our high schools, we'll graduate more kids with the real-world skills that lead directly to a good job in the new economy. If we invest more in job training and apprenticeships, we'll help more workers fill more good jobs that are coming back to this country. If we make it easier for students to pay off their college loans, we'll help a whole lot of young people breathe easier and feel freer to take the jobs they really want. So look, let's do this. Let's keep reforming our education system to make sure young people at every level have a shot at success, just like folks at Northwestern do. <p>If we fix our broken immigration system, we won't just prevent some of the challenges like the ones that we saw at the border this summer, we'll encourage the best and the brightest from around the world to study here and stay here and create jobs here. Independent economists say that a big bipartisan reform bill that the House has now blocked for over a year would grow our economy, shrink our deficits, secure our borders. Let's pass that bill. Let's make America stronger. <p>If we want to make and sell the best products, we have to invest in the best ideas, like you do here at Northwestern. Your nanotechnology institute doesn't just conduct groundbreaking research, that research has spun off 20 startups and more than 1,800 products. That means jobs. <p>Here's another example. Over a decade ago, America led the international effort to sequence the human genome. One study found that every dollar we invested returned $140 to our economy. Now, I don't have an MBA, but that's sounds like a good return on investment. [<i>Laughter</i>] Today, though, the world's largest genomics center is in China. That doesn't mean America is slipping, it does mean America isn't investing. We can't let other countries discover the products and businesses that will shape the next century and the century after that. So we've got to invest more in the kinds of basic research that led to Google and GPS and makes our economy stronger. <p>If we raise the minimum wage, we won't just put more money in workers' pockets; they'll spend that money at local businesses, who in turn will hire more people. <p>In the 2 years since I first asked Congress to raise the national minimum wage, 13 States and DC went and raised theirs. And more business owners are joining them on their own. It's on the ballot in five States this November, including Illinois. And here's the thing: Recent surveys show that a majority of small-business owners support a gradual increase to $10.10 an hour. A survey just last week showed that nearly two-thirds of employers thought the minimum wage should go up in their State, and more than half of them think it should be at least $10. So what's stopping us? Let's agree that nobody who works full time in America should ever have to raise a family in poverty. Let's give America a raise. It will make the economy stronger. <p>If we make sure a woman is paid equal to a man for her efforts, that is not just giving women a boost. Gentlemen, you want your wife making that money that she has earned. [<i>Laughter</i>] It gives the entire family a boost, and it gives the entire economy a boost. Women now outpace men in college degrees; they&mdash;and graduate degrees, but they often start their careers with lower pay. And that gap grows over time, and that affects their families. It's stupid. [<i>Laughter</i>] Let's inspire and support more women, especially in fields like science and technology and engineering and math. Let's catch up to 2014, pass a fair pay law, make our economy stronger. <p>And while we're at it, let's get rid of the barriers that keep more moms who want to work from entering the workforce. Let's do what Dean Blount did here at Kellogg. She's been working with us at the White House, helping business and political leaders who recognize that flexibility in the workplace and paid maternity leave are actually good for business. And let's offer those deals to dads too. Because we want to make sure that they can participate in child rearing. And let's make sure work pays for parents who are raising young kids. It's a good investment. <p>California adopted paid leave, which boosted work and earnings for moms with young kids. Let's follow their lead. Let's make our economy stronger. <p>Now, none of these policies I just mentioned on their own will entirely get us to where we want to be. But if we do these things systematically, the cumulative impact will be huge. Unemployment will drop a little faster, which means workers will gain a little more leverage when it comes to wages and salaries, which means consumer confidence will go up, which means families will be able to spend a little more and save a little more, which means our economy grows stronger and growth will be shared. More people will feel this recovery, rather than just reading about it in the newspapers. That's the truth. <p>And I'm going to keep making the argument for these policies, because they are right for America. They are supported by the facts. And I'm always willing to work with anyone, Democrat or Republican, to get things done. And every once in a while, we actually see a bill land on my desk from Congress. I'm all&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. And we do a bill signing, and I look at the Members, and I say, I tell them, look how much fun this is. [<i>Laughter</i>] Let's do this again. [<i>Applause</i>] Let's do it again. <p>But if gridlock prevails, if cooperation and compromise are no longer valued, but vilified, then I'll keep doing everything I can on my own if it will make a difference for working Americans. <p>I will keep teaming up with Governors and mayors and CEOs and philanthropists who want to help. Here's an example. There are 28 million Americans who would benefit from a minimum wage increase&mdash;28 million. Over the past 2 years, because we've teamed up with cities and States and businesses and went around Congress, 7 million of them have gotten a raise. So until Congress chooses to step up and help all of them, I'll keep fighting to get an extra million here and an extra million there with a raise. We'll keep fighting for this. <p>And let me just say one other thing about the economy, because oftentimes, you hear this from the critics: The notion is that the agenda I've just outlined is somehow contrary to probusiness, capitalist, free-market values. And since we're here at a business school, I thought it might be useful to point out&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;that Bloomberg, for example, I think came out with an article today saying that corporate balance sheets are the strongest just about that they've ever been. Corporate debt is down. Profits are up. Businesses are doing good. <p>So this idea that somehow any of these policies&mdash;like the minimum wage or fair pay or clean energy&mdash;are somehow bad for business is simply belied by the facts. It's not true. And if you talk to business leaders, even the ones who really don't like to admit it because they don't like me that much&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;they'll admit that actually their balance sheets look really strong and that this economy is doing better than our competitors around the world. So don't buy this notion that somehow this is an antibusiness agenda. This is a probusiness agenda. This is a pro-economic growth agenda. <p>Now, I am not on the ballot this fall. Michelle is pretty happy about that. [<i>Laughter</i>] But make no mistake: These policies are on the ballot, every single one of them. This isn't some official campaign speech or political speech, but&mdash;and I'm not going to tell you who to vote for&mdash;although, I suppose it's kind of implied. [<i>Laughter</i>] But what I have done is laid out my ideas to create more jobs and to grow more wages. And I've also tried to correct the record, because, as I said, there's a lot of noise out there. Every item I ticked off, those are the facts. It's not conjecture. It's not opinion. It's not partisan rhetoric. I laid out facts. <p>So I've laid out what I know has happened over the 6 years of my Presidency so far, and I've laid out an agenda for what I think should happen to make us grow even better, grow even faster. A true opposition party should now have the courage to lay out their agenda, hopefully, also grounded in facts. <p>There's a reason fewer Republicans are preaching doom on the deficits. It's because the deficits have come down at almost a record pace, and they're now manageable. There's a reason fewer Republicans, you hear them running about Obamacare, because while good, affordable health care might seem like a fanged threat to the freedom of the American people on Fox News&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;it's turns out, it's working pretty well in the real world. <p>Now, when push came to shove this year and Republicans in Congress actually had to take a stand on policies that would help the middle class and working Americans, like raising the minimum wage or enacting fair pay or refinancing student loans or extending insurance for the unemployed, the answer was \\"no.\\" The one thing they did vote \\"yes\\" on was another massive tax cut for the wealthiest Americans. In fact, just last month, at least one top Republican in Congress said that tax cuts for those at the top are&mdash;and I'm quoting here&mdash;\\"even more pressing now\\" than they were 30 years ago. More pressing. When nearly all the gains of the recovery have gone to the top 1 percent, when income inequality is at as high a rate as we've seen in decades, I find that a little hard to swallow, that they really desperately need a tax cut right now, it's urgent. <p>Why? [<i>Laughter</i>] What are the facts? What is the empirical data that would justify that position? Kellogg business school, you guys are all smart. You do all this analysis. You run the numbers. Has anybody here seen a credible argument that that is what our economy needs right now? Seriously. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But this is the&mdash;if you watch the debate, including on some of the business newscasts&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and the&mdash;folks are just pontificating about how important this is. Based on what? What's the data? What's the proof? If there were any credible argument that says when those at the top do well and eventually everybody else will do well, it would have borne itself out by now. We'd see data that that was true. It's not. American economic greatness has never trickled down from the top. It grows from a rising, thriving middle class and opportunity for working people. That's what makes us different. <p>So I just want to be clear here, because you guys are going to be business leaders of the future and you're going to be making decisions based on logic and reason and facts and data. And right now you've got two starkly different visions for this country. And I believe, with every bone in my body, that there's one clear choice here, because it's supported by facts. <p>And this is our moment to define what the next decade and beyond will look like. This is our chance to set the conditions for middle class growth in the 21st century. The decisions we make this year and over the next few years will determine whether or not we set the stage for America's greatness in this century just like we did in the last one; whether or not we restore the link between hard work and higher wages; whether or not we continue to invest in a skilled, educated citizenry; whether or not we rebuild an economy where everyone who works hard can get ahead. <p>And some of that depends on you. There is a reason why I came to a business school instead of a school of government. I actually believe that capitalism is the greatest force for prosperity and opportunity the world has ever known. And I believe in private enterprise&mdash;not government, but innovators and risk takers and makers and doers&mdash;driving job creation. <p>But I also believe in a higher principle, which is we're all in this together. That's the spirit that made the American economy work. That's what made the American economy not just the world's greatest wealth creator, but the world's greatest opportunity generator. And because you're America's future business leaders and civic leaders, that makes you the stewards of America's greater&mdash;greatest singlet asset, and that's our people. <p>So as you engage in the pursuit of profits, I challenge you to do so with a sense of purpose. As you chase your own success, I challenge you to cultivate more ways to help more Americans chase their success. <p>It is the American people who've made the progress of the last 6 years possible. It is the American people who will make our future progress possible. It is the American people that make American business successful. And they should share in that success. It's not just for you, it's for us. Because it's the American people that made the investments over the course of generations to allow you and me to be here and experience this success. That's the story of America. America is a story of progress: sometimes halting, sometimes incomplete, sometimes harshly challenged. But the story of America is a story of progress. <p>And it's now been 6 long years since our economy nearly collapsed. Despite that shock, through the pain that so many fellow Americans felt, for all the gritty, grueling work required to come back, all the work that's left to be done, a new foundation is laid. A new future is yet to be written. And I am as confident as ever that that future will be led by the United States of America. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"225" "\"<i>The President.</i> Good evening, everybody! Thank you to Senator Menendez, Congressman Hinojosa, and the entire CHC for inviting me. Everybody, take&mdash;you can have a seat, take a load off. [<i>Laughter</i>] I want to congratulate tonight's outstanding honorees: Jos&eacute; D&iacute;az-Balart, Eliseo Medina, and Juliet Garc&iacute;a. I want to thank all the other Members of Congress who are here tonight, including the outstanding Nancy Pelosi. Although I have to say, Nancy Pelosi was really talking mostly about the San Francisco Giants&mdash;in a Nationals town. So that just shows her courage. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to give a special thanks to two young men who rode over with me from the White House tonight. Luis and V&iacute;ctor are CHCI interns and fellows. They are also DREAMers, living and working in the country they call home and making it a better place for all of us. Their stories are inspiring. And along with the other CHCI fellows, they give me great hope for the future. They make me optimistic about what America is all about. <p>Now, 6 years ago, I came here as a candidate for this office, and I said if we worked together, we could do more than just win an election. We could rebuild America so that everybody&mdash;no matter what you look like, no matter what your last name is, no matter what God you worship, no matter who you love&mdash;everybody is free to pursue their dreams. <p>And that's exactly what we've set out to do. And today, there is progress that we should be proud of. I gave a long speech this afternoon about it because sometimes, we don't focus on what has happened over these last 6 years. Over the past 4&frac12; years, our businesses have created 10 million new jobs, the longest uninterrupted stretch of job creation in our history. In the spring, our economy grew faster than any time since 2006, and there are more job openings today than at any time since 2001. And we are going to keep working as hard as we can to help create good, middle class jobs even faster. <p>Six years ago, I told you we would confront the crisis of overcrowded classrooms and underfunded schools and help more families afford higher education. And since 2000, we have cut the Latino dropout rate by more than half. Because dropouts are down, today, our high school graduation rate is the highest on record. And since 2008, the rate of college enrollment among young Latinos has risen by 45 percent. <p>Six years ago, I said we'd take on a broken health care system that left one out of three Hispanics uninsured. Today, millions more Americans have quality, affordable health insurance that they can count on. Over the last year alone, about 10 million Americans gained health insurance, and that includes millions of Latinos. <p>Six years ago, I told you we'd restore the idea at the heart of America that we're in this together, that I am my brother's keeper and my sister's keeper. Last year, poverty among Latinos fell and incomes rose. And this week, I launched the \\"My Brother's Keeper\\" Community Challenge, asking every community in our country to publicly commit to strategies that will help put our young people on the path to success, from cradle to career. <p>So the point I want to make is, the progress we've made has been hard. Sometimes, it's been slower than we want, but that progress has been steady, and it has been real. We have done big things together, and we're going to do more. And tonight I want to make something clear: Fixing our broken immigration system is one more big thing that we have to do and that we will do. <p>Now, I know there's deep frustration in many communities around the country right now. And I understand that frustration because I share it. I know the pain of families torn apart because we live with a system that's broken. But if anybody wants to know where my heart is or whether I want to have this fight, let me put those questions to rest right now. I am not going to give up this fight until it gets done. <p>As Bob mentioned, I've taken so far actions&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President. </i>I'm about to get to that. About to get to it. [<i>Applause</i>] The actions that we've taken so far&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> You're going to want to hear it. You want to hear what I say, rather than just&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President. </i>The actions that we've taken so far are why more than 600,000 young people can live and work without fear of deportation. That's because of the actions I took and the administration took. <p>[<i>At this point, the audience disruption continued, but the President continued speaking.</i>] <p>Because of the coalition that we built together&mdash;business and labor, faith and law enforcement, Democrats and Republican created a bipartisan bill and got it through the Senate last year. When States like Alabama and Arizona passed some of the harshest immigration laws in history, my Attorney General took them on in court, and we won. <p>So you know what we've done together. You know that we've done it despite what is possibly the most uncooperative House of Representatives in history. If House Republicans brought the Senate bill up for a vote today, I would pass it&mdash;it would pass today. I would sign it today, and they know it. But instead, they've been sitting on it for more than a year. They voted to strip DREAMers of new protections and make them eligible for deportation. Not once, but twice they voted that way. <p>And this summer, when a wave of unaccompanied minors crossed part of our southwest border, my administration matched compassion for kids with a firm message to families. Today, fewer parents are sending their children on that perilous journey than they were at this time last year. And we're working to give more kids the chance to apply for asylum in their home countries and avoid that journey altogether. <p>But while we worked to deal with an urgent humanitarian problem, while we actually did something about the problem, Republicans exploited the situation for political gain. And in June, as all this was going on, Speaker Boehner told me he would continue to block a vote on immigration reform for at least the remainder of this year. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> Now, don't boo, vote. I&mdash;&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. [<i>Laughter</i>] I've said before that if Congress failed to live up to its responsibilities to solve this problem, I would act to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own, and I meant what I said. So this is not a question of if, but when. Because the moment I act&mdash;and it will be taking place between the November elections and the end of the year&mdash;opponents of reform will roll out the same old scare tactics. They'll use whatever excuse they have to try to block any attempt at immigration reform at all. And we have to be realistic. For any action to last, for it to be effective and extend beyond my administration&mdash;because I'm only here 2 more years&mdash;we're going to have to build more support of the American people so that it is sustainable and lasting. <p>And so I am going to be spending the next month, month and a half, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, I'm going to be spending that time not just talking about what we've done for the economy, but explaining why immigration reform is good for our economy and why it's good for everybody. And when opponents are out there saying who knows what, I'm going to need you to have my back. I'm going to need you to have my back. I need you to keep putting pressure on Congress, because the fact of the matter is no matter how bold I am, nothing I can do will be as comprehensive or lasting as the Senate bill. Anything I can do can be reversed by the next President. <p>To move beyond what I can do in a limited way, we are going to need legislation. And if we want that legislation to happen sooner rather than later, then there's one more thing I need you to do. And I've got to have you talk to your constituents and your communities, and you've got to get them out to vote. <p>You already know how powerful the Latino vote can be. In 2012, Latinos voted in record numbers. The next day, even Sean Hannity changed his mind and decided immigration reform was a good idea. [<i>Laughter</i>] But despite that record-breaking turnout, only 48 percent of Hispanic voters turned out&mdash;fewer than half, fewer than half. So the clearest path to change is to change that number. <i>S&iacute;, se puede, si votamos</i>&mdash;Yes, we can, if we vote! <p>Earlier this year, I had the chance to host a screening of the film \\"Cesar Chavez\\" at the White House, and I was reminded that Cesar organized for nearly 20 years before his first major victory. He never saw that time as a failure. Looking back, he said: \\"I remember . . . the families who joined our movement and paid dues long before there was any hope of winning contracts. . . . I remember thinking then that with spirit like that . . . no force on Earth could stop us.\\" <p>That's the promise of America then, and that's the promise of America now. People who love this country can change it. America isn't Congress; America isn't Washington. America is the striving immigrant who starts a business or the mom who works two low-wage jobs to give her kid a better life. America is the union leader and the CEO who put aside their differences to make the economy stronger. America is the student who defies the odds to become the first in a family to go to college, the citizen who defies the cynics and goes out there and votes, the young person who comes out of the shadows to demand the right to dream. That's what America is about. <p>And 6 years ago, I asked you to believe. And tonight I ask you to keep believing, not just in my ability to bring about change, but in your ability to bring about change. Because in the end, DREAMer is more than just a title, it's a pretty good description of what it means to be an American. Each of us is called on to stand proudly for the values we believe in and the future we seek. All of us have the chance to reach out and pull this country that we call home a little closer to its founding ideals. That's the spirit that's alive in this room. That's the spirit I saw in Luis and V&iacute;ctor and all the young people here tonight. That spirit is alive in America today. And with that spirit, no force on Earth can stop us. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"226" "\"Hi, everybody. I'm at Millennium Steel in Princeton, Indiana, to have a town hall with workers on National Manufacturing Day. Because in many ways, manufacturing is the quintessential middle class job. And after a decade of losing jobs, American manufacturing is once again adding them, more than 700,000 over the past 4&frac12; years. <p>In fact, it's been a bright spot as we keep fighting to recover from the great recession. Last month, our businesses added 236,000 new jobs. The unemployment rate fell to under 6 percent for the first time in more than 6 years. Over the past 55 months, our businesses have added 10.3 million new jobs. That's the longest uninterrupted stretch of private sector job creation in our history. And we're on pace to make 2014 the strongest year of job growth since the 1990s. <p>This progress has been hard, but it has been steady, and it is real. It is a direct result of the American people's drive and determination and the decisions made by my administration. <p>During the last decade, people thought the decline in American manufacturing was inevitable. But we chose to invest in the American auto industry and American workers. Today, an auto industry that was flatlining 6 years ago is building and selling new cars at the fastest pace in 8 years. American manufacturing is growing almost twice as fast as the rest of the economy, with new factories opening their doors at the fastest pace in decades. That's progress we can be proud of. <p>What's also true is that too many families still work too many hours with too little to show for it. And the much longer and profound erosion of middle class jobs and incomes isn't something we're going to reverse overnight. But there are ideas that we should be putting into place that would grow jobs and wages faster right now. And one of the best would be to raise the minimum wage. <p>We've actually begun to see some modest wage growth in recent months, but most folks still haven't seen a raise in over a decade. It's time to stop punishing some of the hardest working Americans. It's time to raise the minimum wage. It would put more money in workers' pockets. It would help 28 million Americans. Recent surveys show that a majority of small-business owners support a gradual increase to $10.10 an hour. The folks who keep blocking a minimum wage increase are running out of excuses. Let's give America a raise. <p>Let's do this, because it would make our economy stronger and make sure that growth is shared. Rather than just reading about our recovery in a headline, more people will feel it in their own lives. And that's when America does best. We do better when the middle class does better, and when more Americans have their way to climb into the middle class. <p>And that's what drives me every single day. Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"227" "\"Thank you so much. Good afternoon. Please be seated. To all our disabled veterans&mdash;our extraordinary wounded warriors&mdash;we gather here today, on this gorgeous autumn day in America, because each of you endured a moment that shaped the arc of your lives and that speaks to our debt as a nation. <p>Maybe it was there on the battlefield, as the bullets and shrapnel rained down around you. Maybe it was as you lay there, the medics tending to your wounds. Perhaps it was days or months later, in that hospital room, when you finally came to. Perhaps it was years later, as you went about your day, or in the midnight hour, when the memories came rushing back like a flood. <p>Wherever you were, whatever your story, it was the moment that binds each of you forever, that moment of realization that life would not be the same. Your foot. Your hand. Your arm. Your leg, maybe both. Your sight. Your peace of mind. A part of you was gone. <p>Speaking to his fellow veterans of the Civil War, the great Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., once said, \\"As I look into your eyes I feel . . . that a great trial in your youth made you different . . . different from what we could have been without it.\\" And he said, we learned \\"a lesson early which has given a different feeling to life,\\" a sense of duty that burns like a fire in the heart. <p>To Lois Pope, Art Wilson, and everyone at the Memorial Foundation and our incredible veterans service organizations who devoted so many years of effort, especially our friends at the Disabled American Veterans; to all the architects and craftspeople who lent your talents to bring this memorial to life; Members of Congress, Secretaries Jewell and McDonald; distinguished guests; and most of all, to our veterans who have come to know \\"a different feeling to life,\\" and to your families: It's a great honor to be with you here today. <p>For more than two centuries, Americans have left everything they have known and loved&mdash;their families and their friends&mdash;and stepped forward to serve: to win our independence, to preserve our Union, to defend our democracy, to keep safe this country that we love. And when the guns fall silent, our veterans return home, ready to play their part in the next chapter of our American story. As a nation, we have not always fulfilled our obligations to those who served in our name. This is a painful truth. And few have known this better than our veterans wounded in war. <p>In the first years after our Revolution, when our young Nation still resisted the idea of a standing army, veterans of the Continental Army returned to towns that could be indifferent to their service. One veteran, his hand mangled by a British musketball, was deemed, like many veterans, as \\"unfit for labor.\\" And frustrated by his inability to secure a disability pension, he wrote that \\"many of those who aided in conquering the enemy are suffering under the most distressing poverty.\\" After the Civil War, and again after the First World War, our disabled veterans had to organize and march for the benefits they had earned. Down the decades, our Nation has worked to do better, to do right by these patriots. Because in the United States of America, those who have fought for our freedom should never be shunned and should never be forgotten. So today we take another step forward. With this memorial, we commemorate, for the first time, the two battles our disabled veterans have fought: the battle over there and the battle here at home, your battle to recover, which at times can be even harder and certainly is longer. You walk these quiet grounds, pause by the pictures of these men and women&mdash;you look into their eyes, read their words&mdash;and we're somehow able to join them on a journey that speaks to the endurance of the American spirit. And to you, our veterans and wounded warriors, we thank you for sharing your journey with us. <p>Here we feel your fears: the shock of that first moment when you realized something was different, the confusion about what would come next, the frustrations and the worries, as one veteran said, \\"that maybe I wouldn't be quite the same.\\" <p>And then, here we see your resolve: your refusal, in the face of overwhelming odds, to give in to despair or to cynicism; your decision, your choice, to overcome. Like the veteran who said, \\"It's possible for a man to lose half his physical being and still become whole.\\" <p>It is here we can see your perseverance: your unyielding faith that tomorrow can be better; your relentless determination, often through years of hard recovery and surgeries and rehab, learning the simple things all over again&mdash;how to button a shirt or how to write your name, in some cases, how to talk or how to walk; and how, when you've stumbled, when you've fallen, you've picked yourself up, you've carried on, you've never given up. <p>Here we get a glimpse of the wounds within, the veteran who says, \\"I relive the war every day.\\" Because no matter what war you served in, and whether they called it \\"shell shock\\" or \\"battle fatigue\\" or the hundred&mdash;\\"1,000-yard stare\\" or posttraumatic stress, you know that the unseen wounds of war are just as real as any other, and they can hurt just as much, if not more. <p>Here we're reminded that none of you have made this journey alone. Beside each of you is a wife or a husband, mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, and neighbors and friends, who day after day, year after year, have been there, lifting you up, pushing you further, rooting you on, like the caregiver who said: \\"I love him for who he was in his heart. And he still had that.\\" Today we salute all your families and the love that never quits. <p>And finally, here we see that our wounded veterans are defined not by what you can't do, but by what you can do. Just ask Captain Dawn Halfaker. In Iraq, her Humvee was hit by an RPG. She suffered burns and broken bones, lost her right arm. She struggled physically and emotionally. But with the help of her fellow wounded warriors, she came to focus, she said, \\"not on what I had lost, but on what I still had.\\" And today, what she has is the respect of her fellow veterans that she mentors; a business of her own, one that hires veterans; and a beautiful 6-month-old son. Dawn's picture&mdash;this member of the 9/11 generation&mdash;now graces this memorial, and we are honored that she is here today. And, Dawn, please stand up. <p>I've seen Dawn's story over and over and over again, in all the wounded warriors and veterans that I have the honor to meet, from Walter Reed to Bethesda, to Bagram. I know in Dawn's life, many of you see your own. Today I want every American to see it: how, after everything you endured, after all the loss, you summoned the best in yourself and found your strength again; how many of you learned to walk again and stand again and run again; how you've competed in races and marathons and the Paralympics on Team U.S.A.; how you found joy and love, getting married, raising children; how you found new ways to serve, returning to your units or starting new businesses or teaching our children or serving your fellow veterans or leading in your communities. America, if you want to know what real strength is, if you want to see the character of our country, a country that never quits, look at these men and women. And I'd ask all of our disabled veterans here today, if you can stand, please stand; if not, please raise your hand so that our Nation can pay tribute to your service. We thank you, we are inspired by you, and we honor you. <p>From this day forward, Americans will come to this place and ponder the immense sacrifice made on their behalf, the heavy burden borne by a few so that we might live in freedom and peace. Of course, our reflection is not enough. Our expressions of gratitude are not enough. <p>Here, in the heart of our Nation's Capital, this memorial is a challenge to all of us, a reminder of \\"the obligations this country is under.\\" And if we are to truly honor these veterans, we must heed the voices that speak to us here. Let's never rush into war, because it is America's sons and daughters who bear the scars of war for the rest of their lives. Let us only send them into harm's way when it's absolutely necessary. And if we do, let's always give them the strategy and the mission and the support that they need to get the job done. When the mission is over&mdash;as our war in Afghanistan comes to a responsible end in 2 months&mdash;let us stand united as Americans and welcome our veterans home with the thanks and respect they deserve. <p>And if they come home having left a part of themselves on the battlefield, on our behalf, this memorial tells us what we must do. When our wounded veterans set out on that long road of recovery, we need to move heaven and earth to make sure they get every single benefit, every single bit of care that they have earned, that they deserve. <p>If they're hurting and don't know if they can go on, we need to say loud and clear, as family and friends, as neighbors and coworkers, as fellow citizens, and as a nation: You are not alone, it's all right to ask for help, and we're here to help you be strong again. Because our wounded warriors may have \\"a different feeling to life,\\" but when we are truly there for them, when we give them every opportunity to succeed and continue their enormous contributions to our country, then our whole Nation is stronger, and all our lives are richer. <p>So if you're an American and you see a veteran&mdash;maybe with a prosthetic arm or leg, maybe burns on their face&mdash;don't ever look away. Do not turn away. You go up, and you reach out, and you shake their hand, and you look them in the eye, and you say those words every veteran should hear all the time: \\"Welcome home. Thank you. We need you more than ever. You help us stay strong; you helped us stay free.\\" <p>To every wounded warrior, to every disabled veteran: Thank you. God bless you. God bless these United States of America.\" "
"228" "\"Hey, everybody. Thanks for joining the call. Obviously, in your States and communities, you guys are on the frontlines of public health every single day, working to keep the American people healthy and safe. And I thank you for that. <p>Right now a lot of people's attention is focused on our efforts to prevent an Ebola outbreak in the United States. And I want everybody to know that from day one, this administration has made fighting Ebola a national security priority. We don't think this is just a humanitarian issue or a public health issue, this is a national security priority. And we are working aggressively to stop the epidemic in West Africa, to stop any cases in their tracks here at home. <p>On Monday, I met with my team to review our efforts. They're here today to update you on what we're doing, to answer your questions, make sure all of you have the information that you need to keep the people in your communities healthy and safe. <p>And the American people are reasonably concerned. Ebola is a terrible disease, and the fact that in an interconnected world infectious disease can be transported across borders is one of the reasons we have to take it seriously. At the same time&mdash;as I think all of us have tried to emphasize&mdash;it's important that, as public officials, we know and reinforce the facts. Because we've got a world-class medical system, because we've put in place tough safety measures, because of the work that many of you have done in conjunction with organizations like the CDC and dealing with infectious disease generally, and because of the nature of Ebola and the fact that it's not something involving airborne transmission, the chance of an Ebola outbreak in the United States remains extremely low. <p>Procedures are in place to evaluate anybody who might be showing symptoms. In recent months, thousands of travelers arrived here from West Africa, and so far, only one case of Ebola has been diagnosed in the United States, and that's the patient in Dallas who we know, sadly, passed away, and our thoughts today are with his family. <p>But as we saw in Dallas, we don't have a lot of margin for error. If we don't follow protocols and procedures that are put in place, then we're putting folks in our communities at risk. So we have to follow the procedures and protocols that have been established based on the science. <p>I want to thank Mayor Rawlings and County Judge Clay Jenkins in Dallas for their cooperation with our team and their leadership on the ground. We're going to make sure that lessons learned in Dallas and clear procedures and protocols for health and safety officials are conveyed to all of you. Secretary Burwell and Dr. Frieden will talk to you about how we're working with hospitals across the country so that local partners are truly prepared should someone who has a history of travel to the affected countries in West Africa start showing symptoms. At the Federal level, we are always reviewing and evaluating measures that we currently have in place. Today we announced additional screening measures that will be phased in over the coming days and weeks at select airports around the country. And these measures are really just belt-and-suspenders: It's an added layer of protection on top of the procedures already in place at several airports. <p>The new measures will include additional entry screening and questions for travelers arriving from the countries affected by Ebola. It will give us the ability to isolate, evaluate, and monitor travelers as needed. And we'll be able to collect any contact information that's necessary. So you'll hear all of this from my team shortly. <p>But let me close by reminding everybody that America has got the best doctors in the world. We know how to deal with infectious disease. I'm confident that, so long as we work together and we're operating with an appropriate sense of urgency, that we will prevent an outbreak from happening here. And in fact, some of the work that we're doing together and the lessons learned from this experience will further strengthen our public health systems going into the future. Because there are going to be, unfortunately, other occasions where we know that there are infectious diseases out there, and in some cases, the transmission may be swifter, and we're going to have to be that much more ready. <p>So for the Governors and the mayors and the county officials on the line, I've instructed my teams to do whatever Federal assistance they can to make sure you're ready to respond should someone be diagnosed with Ebola in your State. We're going to have to be partners in this fight. Anybody who has any questions, information, or suggestions, that's why my team organized this call. They want to make sure that they're getting feedback from you in terms of what you think will be most helpful. <p>I want to thank you guys, not just for joining us on the call today, but, more importantly, for the critical work you do every day to keep us healthy and safe.\" "
"229" "\"Good afternoon, everybody. I want to thank Secretary Hagel, Deputy Secretary Work, Chairman Dempsey, Vice Chairman Winnefeld, and all the outstanding leaders who are here today. This is a periodic check-in that I have with not only our service commanders, but also our COCOMs. And I thought, although usually, we do this over the White House, now was a good time for me to come over to the Pentagon and have an opportunity to hear from our top military about the work that they're doing. <p>And I've said this before, and I want to repeat: We put enormous burdens and enormous strains on our men and women of the Armed Forces, and each and every time, the members of our Armed Services, our troops, perform in exemplary fashion. I think at a time when there's so much turbulence in the world, never during my Presidency has it become more apparent how good our military is, but also how they can tackle a wide range of problems and not just a narrow set of problems. It's not just the finest military in the history of the world, it's also just one of the best organizations we've ever seen at doing a whole bunch of different stuff. <p>And so I expressed my gratitude to the leadership, but also asked them to express to those under their command the thanks of the American people. <p>We had an opportunity to talk about ISIL and the campaign there. After this meeting, we'll have a National Security Council meeting in which General Lloyd Austin, who's leading Central Command, will further brief us on the progress that's been made by the coalition there. <p>Our strikes continue alongside our partners'. It remains a difficult mission. As I've indicated from the start, this is not something that is going to be solved overnight. The good news is, is that there is a broad-based consensus not just in the region, but among nations of the world that ISIL is a threat to world peace, security, and order, that their barbaric behavior has to be dealt with. And we're confident that we will be able to continue to make progress in partnership with the Iraqi Government, because ultimately, it's going to be important for them to be able to, with our help, secure their own country and to find the kind of political accommodations that are necessary for long-term prosperity in the region. <p>We had a chance to talk about the fight against Ebola, and I got a briefing from General Rodriguez. Our military is essentially building an infrastructure that does not exist in order to facilitate the transport of personnel and equipment and supplies to deal with this deadly epidemic and disease. And we are doing it in a way that ensures our men and women in uniform are safe. That has been my top priority, and I've instructed folks, we're not going to compromise the health and safety of our Armed Services. <p>But what's true is, we have unique capabilities that nobody else has. And as a consequence of us getting in early and building that platform, we're now able to leverage resources from other countries and move with speed and effectiveness to curb that epidemic. <p>We had a discussion about global security generally, including the work that, with General Breedlove, we're doing at NATO to mobilize Europe around the increased threats posed by Russian aggression in Ukraine and against some of its neighbors. We had a very successful meeting in Wales that showed the commitment from all 28 NATO countries to redouble the reassurance they can provide to frontline states to invest further in the joint capabilities that are necessary. And I very much appreciate the leadership that General Breedlove has shown on that front. <p>And I got a chance to get a briefing from Admiral Locklear of the Pacific Command about the ongoing both challenges and opportunities in the Pacific. It's been noted that our alliances in that area have never been stronger. We are very much welcomed as a Pacific power in the region. And our ability to continue to maintain a presence that ensures freedom of navigation, that international law is observed, is going to be critically important. And we need to do that in a way that also reflects our interest in cooperation and effective communication with China, which obviously is a major player in the region. <p>But the anchor of our presence there, our treaties and alliances with key countries like South Korea and Japan, obviously remain critically important. And thanks to the work of some of the gentlemen sitting around this table and their staffs, those alliances have never been in better shape. <p>Finally, we had a chance to talk briefly about defense budget and reforms. We have done some enormous work, and I want to thank everybody sitting around this table to continue to make our forces leaner, meaner, more effective, more tailored to the particular challenges that we're going to face in the 21st century. <p>But we also have to make sure that Congress is working with us to avoid, for example, some of the draconian cuts that are called for in sequestration and to make sure that, if we're asking this much of our Armed Forces, that they've got the equipment and the technology that's necessary for them to be able to succeed at their mission and that we're supporting their families at a time when, even after ending one war and winding down another, they continue to have enormous demands placed on them each and every day. <p>So I want to thank everybody around this table. A special thank you to General Austin for the enormous amount of work that's been done by CENTCOM in what is a very challenging situation. We very much appreciate him. I want to thank General Rodriguez for the great work in standing up our operations in West Africa. <p>And finally, I want to say publicly a hearty thank you to Jim Amos, who somewhere between 8 to 10 days from now&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;will be retiring from his command. He is the 35th Commandant of the Marine Corps, the first aviator to command our Marine Corps. I know that he could not be prouder of the men and women under his command. They continue to make us proud. They certainly make him proud. We want to thank him and Mrs. Amos and the entire family for the great service that they've rendered to our country. <p>So thank you very much.\" "
"230" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! Have a seat. Have a seat. Well, thank you, Secretary Vilsack, for that introduction, more importantly, all the work that you do every single day to make sure that rural America and all our natural resources and conservation strategies are working the way they're supposed to. <p>I also want to acknowledge San Dimas Mayor Curt Morris. Where's Curt? There he is right there. Thank you, sir, for your hospitality. Thanks to all the Members of Congress who are here, who make such an important contribution to our conservation agenda every single day. And I want to thank all of you who are blessed to live in the shadow of these extraordinary mountains for the work that you are making and have made so that this day could be a reality. <p>And 150 years ago, President Lincoln signed a law that forever changed the way we conserve our natural heritage. It might have seemed like an odd thing to do at the time. Civil war raged between North and South; the fate of our Union hung in the balance. Lincoln himself had never even been to California. For a good part of his life, his home State of Illinois was considered the West. <p>But descriptions and drawings and even some early photographs of the Yosemite Valley, had made their way back east: the cathedral peaks, the waterfalls, the giant sequoias. So too had stories about encroaching development that threatened the area. So President Lincoln decided to help protect a place he had never visited, for a nation he might not be able to save, and for a future he would never live to see. And that place is at the heart of what now is Yosemite National Park. <p>So it's fitting that we meet here in California, because this was the State that inspired Lincoln's actions and made possible all that followed, including this moment. Today I'm using my executive authority to designate the San Gabriel Mountains as a national monument. <p>Now, this could not have happened without the leadership of Representatives Grace Napolitano, whose district we're in, Judy Chu, Adam Schiff, the local officials and community leaders, the faith leaders, the youth groups, so many others who have driven this effort. I can see why you've been so committed to this cause. This incredible 346,000 acres of rugged slopes and remote canyons are home to an extraordinary diversity of wildlife. The rare Arroyo chub swims through the cool streams, while the California condor soars above the vistas. You can hike through the chaparral, amid wild lilacs and mountain mahogany. Maybe you can swat away some rare native insects. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But it's not just the natural beauty of the San Gabriels that makes it invaluable. Within these hills lies millennia of history, including the ancient rock art of Native peoples, the first Americans. And just as this region teaches us about our past, it has always offered us a window into the future. It was here at the Mount Wilson Observatory that Edwin P. Hubble showed the universe to be ever expanding, and it's where astronomers still explore the mysteries of space. <p>I can think of no better way to honor our past and protect our future than by preserving the San Gabriel Mountains. Not only because of its richness of history and culture and science; not only because of its scenic beauty that attracts over 3 million visitors every year, more than icons like Mount Rushmore and the Grand Tetons; but because the story of the San Gabriel Mountains is, in many ways, the story of America. It's the story of communities exploring the great West: of Native Americans and Spanish missionaries, of colonialists and rancheros, of merchants and landowners. It's the story of prospectors in search of gold, of settlers in search of a new life. <p>It's a story that continues today, with one of our Nation's most vibrant, diverse communities in the backyard of the second biggest city in the country. Over 15 million people live within 90 minutes of the San Gabriel Mountains. These mountains provide residents with roughly 30 percent of their water and 70 percent of their open space. This whole area is a huge boost to the local economy. <p>As President, I've now preserved more than 3 million acres of public lands for future generations. And I'm not finished. <p>As I said in my State of the Union, we are looking at additional opportunities to preserve Federal lands and waters, and I'll continue to do so, especially where communities are speaking up. And that's what makes this particular designation so important. We heard from the community that for a lot of urban families, this is their only big, outdoor space. And too many children in L.A. County, especially children of color, don't have access to parks where they can run free and breathe fresh air, experience nature, and learn about their environment. <p>And that was Brenda Kyle's experience. Growing up in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, she could see those peaks from her backyard. As an adult, she spotted them from downtown L.A., on TV above the Rose Parade, and from the stands at Dodgers Stadium. Sorry about the playoffs, by the way. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But when Brenda drove, she'd use these mountains as her north star, knowing that if she followed them, they'd take her home. But she never once explored them. <p>Today, she's a docent at Eaton Canyon and devotes her time to taking Latino youth to discover the wilderness of the San Gabriels, many for the first time in their lives. She takes her own nephews up there to play in the river and stand in the waterfall and spot new birds and learn from the incredible natural classroom that surrounds them. And she hopes that one day they'll take their own families to the San Gabriel Mountains and say: \\"We're thankful our forest is a national monument. We always knew it was awesome.\\" <p>And for Brenda, for the entire community, this is an issue of social justice. Because it's not enough to have this awesome natural wonder within your sight, you have to be able to access it. Right now campgrounds are crowded, parking lots are tight, and there haven't been enough resources to manage and maintain this area the way it deserves. So designating the San Gabriel Mountains as a national monument is just the first step towards a broader effort to change that. It's going to enable the Forest Service and local communities and leading philanthropists to work together to increase access and outdoor opportunities for all. <p>And we'll keep working with you to make sure that everybody in this diverse community, no matter where they come from or what language they speak, can enjoy all that this monument has to offer. <p>The notion of a national monument is interesting because it reminds us that America belongs to all of us, not just some of us. My commitment to conservation isn't about locking away our natural treasures, it's about working with communities to open up our glorious heritage to everybody&mdash;young and old, Black, White, Latino, Asian, Native American&mdash;to make sure everybody can experience these incredible gifts. <p>The San Gabriel Mountains National Monument will join a vast landscape of protected national treasures, a wilderness that the writer Wallace Stegner once called \\"a part of the geography of hope.\\" We are blessed to have the most beautiful landscapes in the world. We have a responsibility to be good stewards of those landscapes for future generations. <p>So let me once again say thank you to all of you who made this happen and for your continued commitment to preserving our magnificent natural inheritance and for ensuring that this \\"geography of hope\\" remains the birthright of all Americans, not only for today, but for generations to come. <p>Thank you, everybody. Now I'm going to sign this proclamation. <p>[<i>At this point, the President sat a table to sign the proclamation.</i>] <p><i>Audience member. </i>[<i>Inaudible.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Ah, thank you. You know what, I feel kind of lonely up here. [<i>Laughter</i>] Let's bring some of the folks who helped make this happen. Come on, guys. Let's pull them around. Can we open this up? Come on. Come on, Adam, Judy. Come on. Brenda? Where's Brenda? <p><i>Audience member. </i>Right here. <p><i>The President. </i>Come on. Come on up. Come on up here, guys. Come on up here. Here, you just go right up those stairs. <p>[<i>Supporters and advocates joined the President on stage.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Good? All right. <p>[<i>The President signed the proclamation.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> There you go.\" "
"231" "\"Hi, everybody. For the first time in more than 6 years, the unemployment rate is below 6 percent. Over the past 4&frac12; years, our businesses have created more than 10 million new jobs. That's the longest uninterrupted stretch of private sector job creation in our history. <p>But while our businesses are creating jobs at the fastest pace since the nineties, the typical family hasn't seen a raise since the nineties also. Folks are feeling as squeezed as ever. That's why I'm going to keep pushing policies that will create more jobs faster and raise wages faster, policies like rebuilding our infrastructure, making sure women are paid fairly, and making it easier for young people to pay off their student loans. <p>But one of the simplest and fastest ways to start helping folks get ahead is by raising the minimum wage. Ask yourself: Could you live on $14,500 a year? That's what someone working full time on the minimum wage makes. If they're raising kids, that's below the poverty line. And that's not right. A hard day's work deserves a fair day's pay. Right now a worker on the Federal minimum wage earns $7.25 an hour. It's time to raise that to $10.10 an hour. <p>Raising the Federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, or 10-10, would benefit 28 million American workers&mdash;28 million. And these aren't just high schoolers on their first job. The average worker who would benefit is 35 years old. Most low-wage workers are women. And that extra money would help them pay the bills and provide for their families. It also means they'll have more money to spend at local businesses, which grows the economy for everyone. <p>But Congress hasn't voted to raise the minimum wage in 7 years&mdash;7 years. And when it got a vote earlier this year, Republicans flat-out voted no. That's why, since the first time I asked Congress to give America a raise, 13 States, 21 cities, and the District of Columbia have gone around Congress to raise their workers' wages. Five more States have minimum wage initiatives on the ballot next month. More companies are choosing to raise their workers' wages. A recent survey showed that a majority of small-business owners support a gradual increase to $10.10 an hour too. And I've done what I can on my own by requiring Federal contractors to pay their workers at least $10.10 an hour. <p>On Friday, a coalition of citizens, including business leaders, working moms, labor unions, and more than 65 mayors, told Republicans in Congress to stop blocking a raise for millions of hard-working Americans. Because we believe that in America, nobody who works full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty. And I'm going to keep up this fight until we win. Because America deserves a raise right now, and America should forever be a place where your hard work is rewarded. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"232" "\"Well, good afternoon, everybody. I want to thank Chairman Dempsey for bringing us here together to review coalition operations to degrade and to ultimately destroy ISIL. I want to thank General Austin of Central Command and General Votel, down at the end, of Special Operations Command for their outstanding leadership as well. <p>At this stage, some 60 nations are contributing to this coalition, including more than 20 coalition members who are represented here today, among them, Iraq, Arab nations, Turkey, NATO allies, and partners from around the world. So this is an operation that involves the world against ISIL. <p>So far, we've seen some important successes: stopping ISIL's advance on Erbil, saving many civilians from a massacre on Mount Sinjar, retaking the Mosul Dam, destroying ISIL targets and fighters across Iraq and Syria. <p>Obviously, at this point, we're also focused on the fighting that is taking place in Iraq's Anbar Province, and we're deeply concerned about the situation in and around the Syrian town of Kobani, which underscores the threat that ISIL poses in both Iraq and Syria. And coalition airstrikes will continue in both these areas. <p>One of the things that has emerged from the discussions, both before I came and during my visit here, is that this is going to be a long-term campaign. There are not quick fixes involved. We're still at the early stages. As with any military effort, there will be days of progress, and there are going to be periods of setback. <p>But our coalition is united behind this long-term effort. Our nations agree that ISIL poses a significant threat to the people of Iraq and Syria. It poses a threat to surrounding countries. And because of the numbers of foreign fighters that are being attracted and the chaos that ISIL was creating in the region, ultimately, it will pose a threat beyond the Middle East, including to the United States, Europe, and far-flung countries like Australia that have already seen terrorist networks trying to infiltrate and impact population centers on the other side of the world. <p>So we are united in our goal to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL so that it's no longer a threat to Iraq, to the region, or the international community. But one of the things that's also been emphasized here today is, this is not simply a military campaign. This is not a classic army in which we defeat them on the battlefield and then they ultimately surrender. What we're also fighting is an ideological strain of extremism that has taken root in too many parts of the region. We are dealing with sectarianism and political divisions that for too long have been a primary political, organizational rallying point in the region. We're dealing with economic deprivation and lack of opportunity among too many young people in the region. <p>And so one of the interesting things to hear from our military leadership is the recognition that this cannot simply be a military campaign. This has to be a campaign that includes all the dimensions of our power. We have to do a better job communicating an alternative vision for those who are currently attracted to the fighting inside Iraq and Syria. It is going to be absolutely critical to make sure that the political inclusion that Prime Minister Abadi of Iraq is committed to is actually translated into real progress. It's going to require us developing and strengthening a moderate opposition inside of Syria that is in a position then to bring about the kind of legitimacy and sound governance for all people inside of Syria. <p>And so, in addition to denying ISIL safe haven in Iraq and Syria, in addition to stopping foreign fighters, in addition to the intelligence gathering and airstrikes and ground campaigns that may be developed by the Iraqi security forces, we're also going to have to pay attention to communications. We're going to have to pay attention to how all the countries in the region begin to cooperate in rooting out this cancer. And we're going to have to continue to deliver on the humanitarian assistance of all the populations that have been affected. And we have three countries here&mdash;Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey&mdash;who obviously are bearing an extraordinary burden from the displaced persons, not just recently over the last few months, but for several years now as a consequence of the civil war in Syria. That all plays a part in this campaign. <p>But I want to thank all the nations who are represented here in what is a growing coalition. I'm encouraged by the unanimity of viewpoints and the commitment of the countries involved to make sure that we're making steady progress. <p>Before I close, I do want to say something about another topic that's obviously attracted a lot of attention, and that is the situation with Ebola. We have made enormous strides in just a few short weeks in standing up a U.S. military operation in western Africa that can start building the kind of transport lines and supply lines to get workers, supplies, medicine, equipment into Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. And a number of the countries who are represented here are really stepping up and doing what's necessary in order for us to contain this epidemic. <p>But as I've said before and I'm going to keep on repeating until we start seeing more progress, the world as a whole is not doing enough. There are a number of countries that have capacity that have not yet stepped up. Those that have stepped up, all of us are going to have to do more, because unless we contain this at the source, this is going to continue to pose a threat to individual countries at a time when there's no place that's more than a couple of air flights away. And the transmission of this disease obviously directly threatens all our populations. <p>In addition, we have not only a humanitarian crisis in West Africa that threatens hundreds of thousands of lives, but we also have the secondary effects of destabilization, economically and politically, that could lead to more severe problems down the road. <p>So everybody is going to have to do more than they're doing right now. And I am reaching out directly to heads of state and government who, I believe, have the capacities to do more. I spoke yesterday with Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who agrees that everybody has to do more. And I can assure everybody that the United States will continue to do its part. <p>With respect to Ebola here in the United States, we are surging resources into Dallas to examine what exactly has happened that ended up infecting the nurse there. Obviously, our thoughts and prayers are with her and all the courageous health care workers around the country who put themselves in challenging situations in treating this disease. We are going to make sure that all the lessons learned from Dallas are then applied to hospitals and health centers around the country. <p>As I've said before, we have a public health infrastructure and systems and support that make an epidemic here highly unlikely. But obviously, one case is too many, and we've got to keep on doing everything we can, particularly to protect our health care workers, because they're on the front lines in battling this disease. And we've also now instituted some additional screening measures, starting at JFK Airport, that will then apply to a number of other airports where we know the bulk of travelers that may have come in contact with Ebola would be coming through. We're confident that we're going to be able to put those in place in the days ahead. <p>But in the meantime, our thoughts and prayers are with the nurse, who, like so many nurses and health care workers around the country, day in, day out, do what they need to do, sometimes at some risk to themselves, in order to provide the kind of care that we all depend on. We need to eliminate those risks for them, and we're confident that we can build the protocols and make sure that they are observed carefully to avoid additional repeats of what's happened in Dallas. <p>But we're going to be as vigilant as we need to be in order to make sure that this disease is properly contained. The best way for us to do that, though, is also to make sure and understand that what happens in West Africa has an impact here in the United States and in all the other countries that are represented here. <p>So thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.\" "
"233" "\"Well, obviously, the news has been dominated by the diagnosis of a second health care worker in Dallas with Ebola. And in light of this second case, I thought it was very important for me to bring together our team, including our CDC Director, Tom Frieden, to hear directly from them in terms of how we are ramping up our efforts here. <p>Obviously, initially, we want to express concern for the two health workers who have been affected. Our nurses and our health care workers are absolutely vital to the health and well-being of our families. They sacrifice for us all the time, not just in this case, but in the case of other illnesses that affect us. They are selfless, they work hard, they're often underpaid. And so our thoughts and prayers are with them, and we have to make sure that we are doing everything we can to take care of them, even as they take care of us. <p>As a consequence, what we've been doing here today is reviewing exactly what we know about what's happened in Dallas and how we're going to make sure that something like this is not repeated and that we are monitoring, supervising, overseeing in a much more aggressive way exactly what's taken place in Dallas initially, and making sure that the lessons learned are then transmitted to hospitals and clinics all across the country. <p>First of all, what I've directed the CDC to do is that as soon as somebody is diagnosed with Ebola, we want a rapid response team&mdash;a SWAT team, essentially&mdash;from the CDC to be on the ground as quickly as possible&mdash;hopefully, within 24 hours&mdash;so that they are taking the local hospital step by step through exactly what needs to be done and making sure that all the protocols are properly observed, that the use of protective equipment is done effectively, that disposal of that protective equipment is done properly. <p>The key thing to understand about this disease is that these protocols work. We know that because they've been used for decades now in Ebola cases around the world, including the cases that were treated in Emory and in Nebraska. So if they're done properly, they work. But we have to make sure that, understandably, certain local hospitals that may not have that experience are walking&mdash;walked through that process as carefully as possible, and we're going to make sure that this rapid response team can do that. <p>In addition, we are reviewing every step of what's happened since Mr. Duncan was initially brought in to the hospital in Dallas so that we understand exactly where some of the problems may have occurred and doing a thorough canvass and inventory of all the workers who had contact with Mr. Duncan, including those who engaged in some of the testing that took place. We are now communicating all these various lessons to hospitals, clinics, first responders around the country. And obviously, given all the attention that this has received, we're going to make sure that that provision of information is constant, ongoing, and being updated on a real-time basis. <p>In addition, we are working very carefully with the mayor of Dallas, the Governor of Texas, and others to make sure that, in the event any other cases arise from these health workers, that they are properly cared for in a way that is consistent with public safety. I know that people are concerned about the fact that the second health care worker had traveled. Here's what we know about Ebola: that it is not like the flu. It is not airborne. The only way that a person can contract Ebola is by coming into direct contact with the bodily fluids of somebody who is showing symptoms. In other words, if they don't have symptoms, they're not contagious. <p>What we are able to do, however, is to do what's called contact tracing so that anybody who may have had contact with someone&mdash;even if it was incidental contact, even if they weren't showing symptoms&mdash;being able to identify who those individuals are and make sure that they are then being monitored in a way that allows us to make certain that the disease does not spread further. And that's currently taking place in a very aggressive process conducted by the CDC, HHS, and the rest of our teams. <p>I want to use myself as an example just so that people have a sense of the science here. I shook hands with, hugged, and kissed not the doctors, but a couple of the nurses at Emory because of the valiant work that they did in treating one of the patients. They followed the protocols, they knew what they were doing, and I felt perfectly safe doing so. <p>And so this is not a situation in which, like a flu, the risks of a rapid spread of the disease are imminent. If we do these protocols properly, if we follow the steps, if we get the information out, then the likelihood of widespread Ebola outbreaks in this country are very, very low. <p>But I think what we've all learned over the last several weeks is that folks here in this country and a lot of nonspecialized hospitals and clinics don't have that much experience dealing with these issues. And so we're going to have to push out this information as aggressively as possible, and that's the instructions that I've provided to my team. <p>Just a couple other points. We are going to be monitoring carefully the health status of the other health care workers in Dallas. And obviously, they're concerned. We understand that many of them are scared. And we are going to make sure that we're on the ground 24/7 to provide them the kind of support, information, and assurances that they need to get through this particular challenge. <p>And finally, we're also going to be continually examining our screening processes at airports. We're making sure that, in the event that we have additional cases that involve the need for transporting those patients to specialized hospitals, that those teams are in place and those facilities are in place. And we will make sure that on a day-to-day basis we provide the public with all the information they need and any updates about what has happened not just in Dallas, but what is being done across the country. <p>I'll end with this point: We are going to have to make sure that we do not lose sight of the importance of the international response to what is taking place in West Africa. I am absolutely confident that we can prevent a serious outbreak of the disease here in the United States, but it becomes more difficult to do so if this epidemic of Ebola rages out of control in West Africa. If it does, then it will spread globally in an age of frequent travel and the kind of constant interactions that people have across borders. <p>And so it is very important for us to understand that the investment we make in helping Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea deal with this problem is an investment in our own public health. This is not simply charity&mdash;although obviously, it's important that America takes the lead in the humanitarian crisis that's taking place there&mdash;but it is also probably the single most important thing that we can do to prevent a more serious Ebola outbreak in this country, is making sure that we get what is a raging epidemic right now in West Africa under control. <p>So for that reason, last night I had a call with Prime Minister Abe of Japan to solicit greater support for the international effort. This morning I spoke with Chancellor Merkel of Germany, Prime Minister Renzi of Italy, President Hollande of France, as well as David Cameron, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, to make sure that we are coordinating our efforts and that we are putting in a lot more resources than, so far at least, the international community has put into this process. <p>So bottom line in terms of the public: I want people to understand that the dangers of you contracting Ebola, the dangers of a serious outbreak, are extraordinarily low. But we are taking this very seriously at the highest levels of government. And we are going to be able to manage this particular situation, but we have to look towards the future. And if we are not responding internationally in an effective way, and if we do not set up the kind of preparedness and training in our public health infrastructure here in the United States, not just for this outbreak, but for future outbreaks, then we could have problems. <p>So in the meantime, I want everybody to be thinking about and praying for the two health workers that have gotten sick. Those who also treated this patient with compassion and care, we just want to say thank you to them. And we are going to be doing everything we can to make sure that they're properly cared for. <p>Okay, thank you very much.\" "
"234" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! Hello. Good job, everybody. Everybody, please have a seat. Well, it is good to be back at CFPB. I want to&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience members.</i> Woo! <p><i>The President.</i> Yes, this is an enthusiastic and rowdy crowd, this group. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's what happens when you do good things. You feel good. And this group is doing great work. <p>I want to thank your Director, Rich Cordray, for hosting me here today, and I want to thank all of you for doing a great job in looking out for the financial security of all Americans. <p>Now, obviously, right now the news is dominated by Ebola, and we've got an all-hands-on-deck approach across Government to make sure that we are keeping the American people safe. But even as we meet that particular challenge, it's also important that we don't lose sight of the other challenges that we face as a nation, especially the challenge of making sure that our economy works for every single American. And that includes the challenge that brings me here today: protecting Americans from financial fraud and identity theft. <p>Now, as President, I believe that America is stronger when our middle class can count on things like affordable health insurance and Medicare and Social Security; where there are rules to protect our kids from dirty air or dirty water, rules to protect consumers from being taken advantage of. And I know you agree, those of you at CFPB, because that's your mission. <p>And that's why part of the financial reform that we passed in the wake of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression was the creation of this agency, to make sure that we are looking at every aspect of the financial system and ensuring that the American people have the basic protections that they should be able to count on. You have one mission: You're a watchdog for consumers to make sure that the American people have somebody who's got their backs. <p>And because of the good work of many of the people who are here today, Americans have saved millions because they've been protected from predatory mortgage practices. You've protected folks from deceptive credit card practices. You've set up \\"Know Before You Owe\\" to help college be a little more affordable for young people and to make sure that they know the kind of debt that they're accruing. You've simplified mortgage forms so homeowners don't get tricked in the final print. But all this work, taken together, the reason it's important is because it's not an abstraction; it saves people money and time and heartache. <p>And before you, Americans who had gotten taken advantage of often had no way of achieving some sort of compensation. Now, today, you've actually secured billions of dollars in relief for victims. You've helped to make people a little more whole after somebody engaged in fraudulent behavior. <p>Some folks in Congress fought tooth and nail to keep this agency from getting off the ground. There are some, frankly, who are still fighting to undo the rules we put in place to protect consumers. But I refuse to back down and go back to the days when mortgage lenders or financial firms could take advantage of consumers and consumers had no recourse. We're moving forward. America is better because of this agency and because of the rules that we've put in place. <p>And the good news is, is that we've got more work to do. And today we're building on the progress that's already been made by announcing new measures to protect America from identity theft and fraud. <p>Now, we've all experienced the benefits of new technologies that let us buy and sell things faster and more efficiently than ever before. But there are risks that come with these technologies as well. Last year, millions of Americans became victims of identity theft. Millions were victims of this kind of fraud. More than a hundred million Americans had information that was compromised in data breaches in some of our largest companies. And identity theft is now America's fastest growing crime. <p>These crimes don't just cost companies and consumers billions of dollars every year, they also threaten the economic security of middle class Americans who have worked really hard for a lifetime to build some sort of security. The idea that somebody halfway around the world could run up thousands of dollars in charges in your name just because they stole your number or because you swiped your card at the wrong place in the wrong time, that's infuriating. For victims, it's heartbreaking. And as a country, we've got to do more to stop it. <p>And that's why today we are launching an initiative called \\"BuySecure,\\" because you should be able to buy the things that you need without risking your identity, your credit score, or your savings. <p>First, starting next year, we're going to begin making sure that credit cards and credit card readers issued by the United States Government come equipped with two new layers of protection: a microchip in the card that's harder for thieves to clone than a magnetic strip and a PIN number you enter into the reader just as you do with an ATM. We know this technology works. When Britain switched to a chip-and-PIN system, they cut fraud in stores by 70 percent. Seventy percent. <p>Of course, no one security measure, no matter how powerful, can stop fraud on its own. So today I'm also directing Federal law enforcement to share more information with the private sector when they discover identity theft rings. <p>Folks here at the CFPB are working with banks to help make it easier for consumers to discover if fraudulent charges have been made to their account. The Federal Trade Commission will add new features to identitytheft.gov, and they're going to work with credit bureaus to dramatically cut down on the time it takes for victims to recover their stolen identities. And in the coming months I'll be bringing together industry leaders and consumer advocates for a cybersecurity summit focused on protecting consumers using the next generation of mobile payment systems and devices. <p>And I'm happy to say that the private sector is already deeply engaged in this effort. Today a group of retailers that includes some of our largest&mdash;Home Depot, Target, Walgreens, Walmart&mdash;and representing more than 15,000 stores across the country, all of them are pledging to adopt chip-and-PIN technology by the beginning of next year. American Express is pledging $10 million to replace outdated card readers at small businesses. MasterCard is pledging to provide its customers with free identity-theft monitoring and resolution support. And Citi is joining other financial institutions in making free FICO scores available to customers, because a sudden drop in your credit rating is one of the clearest signs that you've been hit by fraud. So I want to thank all the business leaders who are choosing to protect their companies and their customers from the kind of hacking that we saw too many times this past year. I want to encourage every retailer, every bank, and every credit card company to join them in this effort. <p>And even though I'm taking action today without Congress, Congress needs to do its part, as well. Today, data breaches are handled by dozens of separate State laws, and it's time to have one clear national standard that brings certainty to businesses and keeps consumers safe. <p>Let me just close by saying this. Last week, I saw a survey that asked folks from all over the world what they thought of the idea that \\"success in life is pretty much determined by forces outside of our control.\\" Of all the advanced economies on Earth, Americans, as you might expect, were the least likely to agree with that. We think our fate is in our own hands. We think that if we work hard, that we can get ahead. For all the challenges of the 21st century, for all the tough, grueling work that's been required to rebuild this economy and people rebuilding their individual lives after a terrible recession, we still believe that our destiny is written by us, not for us. We believe that this is a country where hard work should pay off and responsibility should be rewarded. <p>That's the principle all of you here at the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau deeply believe in. That's what you're fighting for every single day. That's what I'm going to keep fighting for as long as I have the opportunity to be President. And the Executive order I'm signing and the great work that the companies are doing who are participating here today is going to just be one more brick in that bridge that we provide to, hopefully, all Americans so that they can translate their dreams into reality. <p>So good job, everybody. Let me sign this. <p>[<i>At this point, the President signed the Executive order.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Rich, I should mention, by the way, that I went to a restaurant up in New York when I was&mdash;during the General Assembly, and my credit card was rejected. [<i>Laughter</i>] It turned out, I guess I don't use it enough. They were&mdash;so they thought there was some fraud going on. [<i>Laughter</i>] Fortunately, Michelle had hers. And I was trying to explain to the waitress, no, I really think that I've been paying my bills. [<i>Laughter</i>] So even I'm affected by this. <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"235" "\"Today I want to take a few minutes to speak with you&mdash;directly and clearly&mdash;about Ebola: what we're doing about it and what you need to know. Because meeting a public health challenge like this isn't just a job for government. All of us&mdash;citizens, leaders, the media&mdash;have a responsibility and a role to play. This is a serious disease, but we can't give in to hysteria or fear, because that only makes it harder to get people the accurate information they need. We have to be guided by the science. We have to remember the basic facts. <p>First, what we're seeing now is not an \\"outbreak\\" or an \\"epidemic\\" of Ebola in America. We're a nation of more than 300 million people. To date, we've seen three cases of Ebola diagnosed here: the man who contracted the disease in Liberia, came here, and sadly died; the two courageous nurses who were infected while they were treating him. Our thoughts and our prayers are with them, and we're doing everything we can to give them the best care possible. Now, even one infection is too many. At the same time, we have to keep this in perspective. As our public health experts point out, every year, thousands of Americans die from the flu. <p>Second, Ebola is actually a difficult disease to catch. It's not transmitted through the air like the flu. You cannot get it from just riding on a plane or a bus. The only way that a person can contract the disease is by coming into direct contact with the bodily fluids of somebody who is already showing symptoms. I've met and hugged some of the doctors and nurses who've treated Ebola patients. I've met with an Ebola patient who recovered, right in the Oval Office. And I'm fine. <p>Third, we know how to fight this disease. We know the protocols. And we know that when they're followed, they work. So far, five Americans who got infected with Ebola in West Africa have been brought back to the United States, and all five have been treated safely, without infecting healthcare workers. <p>And this week, at my direction, we're stepping up all of our efforts. Additional CDC personnel are on the scene in Dallas and Cleveland. We're working quickly to track and monitor anyone who may have been in close contact with someone showing symptoms. We're sharing lessons learned so other hospitals don't repeat the mistakes that happened in Dallas. The CDC's new Ebola rapid response teams will deploy quickly to help hospitals implement the right protocols. New screening measures are now in place at airports that receive nearly all passengers arriving from Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone. And we'll continue to constantly review our measures and update them as needed to make sure we're doing everything we can to keep Americans safe. <p>Finally, we can't just cut ourselves off from West Africa, where this disease is raging. Our medical experts tell us that the best way to stop this disease is to stop it at its source, before it spreads even wider and becomes even more difficult to contain. Trying to seal off an entire region of the world&mdash;if that were even possible&mdash;could actually make the situation worse. It would make it harder to move health workers and supplies back and forth. Experience shows that it could also cause people in the affected region to change their travel, to evade screening, and make the disease even harder to track. So the United States will continue to help lead the global response in West Africa. Because if we want to protect Americans from Ebola here at home, we have to end it over there. And as our civilian and military personnel serve in the region, their safety and health will remain a top priority. <p>As I've said before, fighting this disease will take time. Before this is over, we may see more isolated cases here in America. But we know how to wage this fight. And if we take the steps that are necessary, if we're guided by the science&mdash;the facts, not fear&mdash;then I'm absolutely confident that we can prevent a serious outbreak here in the United States and we can continue to lead the world in this urgent effort.\" "
"236" "\"Hi, everybody. This week, we remained focused on our fight against Ebola. In Dallas, dozens of family, friends, and others who had been in close contact with the first patient, Mr. Duncan, were declared free of Ebola, a reminder that this disease is actually very hard to catch. Across Dallas, others being monitored, including health care workers who were most at risk, were also declared Ebola-free. <p>Two Americans&mdash;patients in Georgia and Nebraska who contracted the disease in West Africa&mdash;recovered and were released from the hospital. The first of the two Dallas nurses who were diagnosed, Nina Pham, was declared Ebola-free, and yesterday I was proud to welcome her to the Oval Office and give her a big hug. The other nurse, Amber Vinson, continues to improve as well. And in Africa, the countries of Senegal and Nigeria were declared free of Ebola, a reminder that this disease can be contained and defeated. <p>In New York City, medical personnel moved quickly to isolate and care for the patient there, a doctor who recently returned from West Africa. The city and State of New York have strong public health systems, and they've been preparing for this possibility. Because of the steps we've taken in recent weeks, our CDC experts were already at the hospital, helping staff prepare for this kind of situation. Before the patient was even diagnosed, we deployed one of our new CDC rapid response teams. And I've assured Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio that they'll have all the Federal support they need as they go forward. <p>More broadly, this week we continued to step up our efforts across the country. New CDC guidelines and outreach is helping hospitals improve training and protect their health care workers. The Defense Department's new team of doctors, nurses, and trainers will respond quickly if called upon to help. <p>New travel measures are now directing all travelers from the three affected countries in West Africa into five U.S. airports, where we're conducting additional screening. Starting this week, these travelers will be required to report their temperatures and any symptoms on a daily basis for 21 days until we're confident they don't have Ebola. Here at the White House, my new Ebola Response Coordinator is working to ensure a seamless response across the Federal Government. And we have been examining the protocols for protecting our brave health care workers, and guided by the science, we'll continue to work with State and local officials to take the necessary steps to ensure the safety and health of the American people. <p>In closing, I want to leave you with some basic facts. First, you cannot get Ebola easily. You can't get it through casual contact with someone. Remember, down in Dallas, even Mr. Duncan's family&mdash;who lived with him and helped care for him&mdash;even they did not get Ebola. The only way you can get this disease is by coming into direct contact with the bodily fluids of someone with symptoms. That's the science. Those are the facts. <p>Sadly, Mr. Duncan did not survive, and we continue to keep his family in our prayers. At the same time, it's important to remember that of the seven Americans treated so far for Ebola&mdash;the five who contracted it in West Africa, plus the two nurses from Dallas&mdash;all seven have survived. Let me say that again: seven Americans treated; all seven survived. I've had two of them in the Oval Office. And now we're focused on making sure the patient in New York receives the best care as well. <p>So here's the bottom line: Patients can beat this disease, and we can beat this disease. But we have to stay vigilant. We have to work together at every level&mdash;Federal, State, and local&mdash;and we have to keep leading the global response, because the best way to stop this disease, the best way to keep Americans safe, is to stop it at its source, in West Africa. <p>And we have to be guided by the science. We have to be guided by the facts, not fear. Yesterday New Yorkers showed us the way. They did what they do every day: jumping on buses, riding the subway, crowding into elevators, heading into work, gathering in parks. That spirit&mdash;that determination to carry on&mdash;is part of what makes New York one of the great cities in the world. And that's the spirit all of us can draw upon, as Americans, as we meet this challenge together.\" "
"237" "\"Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. And thank you, Dr. Brantly, not just for the introduction, but for your extraordinary work to help save lives in Africa and here at home. <p>As many of you know, I welcomed Kent and his wonderful wife Amber to the White House last month. And I was so moved by their deep faith, a faith that grounds their unwavering commitment to service, that I thought it would be a good idea to have them back. He's gained a little weight since I last saw him. [<i>Laughter</i>] So, Amber, you've been making sure he's eating properly. But Keith [Kent; White House correction.] and Amber, you're an inspiration to me and to people around the world. And on behalf of all of us, thank you so much. Thank you. <p>As I said yesterday, we know that the best way to protect Americans from Ebola is to stop the outbreak at its source. And we're honored to be joined today by some of the extraordinary American health workers who are on the front lines of the fight in West Africa. We just had an opportunity to meet, to talk, for me to hear about their service in truly challenging conditions. <p>And some of these men and women have recently returned; others are heading there shortly. But all of them have signed up to leave their homes and their loved ones to head straight into the heart of the Ebola epidemic. Like our military men and women deploying to West Africa, they do this for no other reason than their own sense of duty, their sense of purpose, their sense of serving a cause greater than themselves. And we need to call them what they are, which is American heroes. They deserve our gratitude, and they deserve to be treated with dignity and with respect. <p>Now, over the past few weeks, I've met and spoken with doctors and nurses who have treated Ebola patients. That includes some who've been diagnosed with and beaten Ebola themselves, like Kent, and like nurse Nina Pham, who I was proud to welcome to the Oval Office. <p>And I want to say to all the doctors and nurses out there what I've told the doctors and nurses here today: Each of you studied medicine because you wanted to save lives, and the world needs you more than ever. The medical professionals and public health workers serving in Africa are a shining example of what America means to the world, of what is possible when America leads. <p>I said this at the U.N. General Assembly: When disease or disaster strikes anywhere in the world, the world calls us. And the reason they call us is because of the men and women like the ones who are here today. They respond with skill and professionalism and courage and dedication. And it's because of the determination and skill and dedication and patriotism of folks like this that I'm confident we will contain and ultimately snuff out this outbreak of Ebola, because that's what we do. <p>A lot of people talk about American exceptionalism. I'm a firm believer in American exceptionalism. You know why I am? It's because of folks like this. It's because we don't run and hide when there's a problem. It's because we don't react to our fears, but instead, we respond with common sense and skill and courage. That's the best of our history, not fear, not hysteria, not misinformation. We react clearly and firmly, even when others are losing their heads. That's part of the reason why we're effective. That's part of the reason why people look to us. And because of the work that's being done by folks like this and by folks who are right now, as we speak, in the three affected countries, we're already seeing a difference. <p>I just had a chance to be in the Situation Room. Samantha Power, our U.N. Ambassador, has been traveling through the countries and talking to professionals and seeing what's on the ground. And she was describing how, because of our military, we're already setting up Ebola treatment units ahead of schedule. We're already setting up supply lines. And she described how a Chinese airplane was landing in facilities that we had helped organize, and Liberian and Chinese and American folks are pulling supplies off and deploying it. Because we had set up the infrastructure and gotten there early, the world is now starting to respond. <p>Some of the labs that we've set up are cutting the test to see whether somebody is positive for Ebola from what was as long as 7 days now to less than a day, which means people know sooner whether they have it. They're able to get isolated quicker. They're less likely to spread it. If they don't have it, they can be with their families faster, which means there's less fear and anxiety. <p>Safe burial practices have doubled in Monrovia, and we know that the way folks were treating the deceased was a major contributor to spreading the disease. Because of the leadership that we've shown on the ground, the mood in Liberia has changed. People have a greater sense of confidence that this can be dealt with, and suddenly, you're seeing Liberian nationals who are increasingly willing to work as part of the public health teams. <p>So we're having not just effect by what we do directly, but also by a change in mindset in the countries affected and around the globe. That's what's happening because of American leadership, and it is not abstract. It is people who are willing to go there at significant sacrifice to make a difference. That's American exceptionalism. That's what we should be proud of. That's who we are. <p>Now, none of this means that the problem has been solved. I don't want anybody to lose a sense of urgency. In those countries that are affected, this is still a severe, significant outbreak, and it is going to take some time for these countries to battle back. We've got a long way to go. <p>But I do want Americans to understand why this is so important. This is not just charity, although Kent's faith is driving him to do that, and I'd like to think that that sense of faith and grace motivates all of us. But this is also practical; it has to do with our own self-interest. If we are not dealing with this problem there, it will come here. Now, we have a responsibility to look out for our health workers as well as they look out for us. And that's why on Monday, the CDC announced new monitoring and movement guidelines that are sensible, that are based on science, that were crafted in consultation with the people who are actually going there to do the work. And they're tailored to the unique circumstances of each health care worker. <p>But we have to keep in mind that if we're discouraging our health care workers, who are prepared to make these sacrifices, from traveling to these places in need, then we're not doing our job in terms of looking after our own public health and safety. What we are&mdash;what we need right now is these shock troops who are out there leading globally. We can't discourage that, we've got to encourage it and applaud it. <p>And I want America to understand: The truth is that until we stop this outbreak in West Africa, we may continue to see individual cases in America in the weeks and months ahead because that's the nature of today's world. We can't hermetically seal ourselves off. The nature of international travel and movement means that the only way to assure that we are safe is to make sure that we have dealt with the disease where right now it is most acute. <p>So yes, we are likely to see a possible case elsewhere outside of these countries. And that's true whether or not you adopt a travel ban, whether or not you adopt a quarantine. It's the nature of diseases. As long as Ebola exists in the world, no one can promise that there won't be any more cases in America or any place else. To prevent its spread and ultimately to keep Americans safe, we have to go to the source while preparing for the few cases that we see here and protecting our health care workers who are treating patients both here at home and abroad. <p>Now, the good news is that our medical system is better prepared for any additional cases, and we'll continue to work with hospitals and State and local public health agencies to improve that preparedness every single day. And although coordinating all that, nationally as well as internationally, is a process and there are constant tweaks and modifications as lessons are learned, it's all based on 40 years of experience in dealing with this disease. It's not all new, and it will get done. <p>So I guess my biggest message&mdash;and I'm pretty sure this is a message that all the folks behind me, including the ones with the white coats, would confirm&mdash;is that it's critical that we remain focused on the facts and on the science. Keep in mind that of the seven Americans treated for Ebola so far, most of them while serving in West Africa, all seven have survived. Right now the only American still undergoing treatment is Dr. Craig Spencer, who contracted the disease abroad while working to protect others. And we salute his service, and we're getting him the best care as well. <p>But we know how to treat this disease. And now that the West African nations of Senegal and Nigeria have been declared Ebola-free, we know that this disease can be contained and defeated if we stay vigilant and committed and America continues to lead the fight. We've got hundreds of Americans from across the country&mdash;nurses, doctors, public health workers, soldiers, engineers, mechanics&mdash;who are putting themselves on the front lines of this fight. They represent citizenship and patriotism and public service at its best. They make huge sacrifices to protect this country that we love. And when they come home, they deserve to be treated properly. They deserve to be treated like the heroes that they are. <p>They're Americans like Dr. Dan Chertow, who's here today. Dan is an officer in the U.S. Public Health Service who took a leave from his position at the National Institutes of Health to volunteer with Doctors Without Borders in Liberia, where he cared for over 200 Ebola patients. Dan, thank you. I'm very proud of you. Dan's right here. <p>They're Americans like Katie Curran. Her father James was the head of the CDC Task Force on HIV/AIDS when that disease first emerged. So she studied to become a public health expert in her own right. She decided to chart her own course, most recently, in a canoe. [<i>Laughter</i>] We recently read about how she and her CDC \\"disease detective\\" team traveled to a village in Sierra Leone that was so remote, they had to take canoes to reach it. And when they arrived, the chief who met them wore a Pittsburgh Steelers cap. [<i>Laughter</i>] So today Katie has completed her mission. She's on her way home. And I can promise you that, thanks to Katie and her team, America's mark on that village, our legacy for future generations there, will go far beyond sports teams. <p>We're talking about Americans like Captain Calvin Edwards. Father of four, works at the FDA in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. But like Dr. Dan Chertow, he's also an officer in the U.S. Public Health Service. We read about how on his 29th wedding anniversary, carrying a pillow from home and a copy of the New Testament he takes on deployments, he left for training to oversee a team in Liberia, not before he&mdash;but before he did, he made sure to buy his wife a dozen roses. [<i>Laughter</i>] And as he boarded the plane to Monrovia, Captain Edwards reminded his team of their oath to defend our country, and they responded with a rousing rendition of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner.\\" And they're all there right now, making us proud. <p>Of the 69 Public Health Service officers like Dr. Chertow and Captain Edwards who were chosen for this mission, not a single one declined. Not one. They all stepped forward. <p>I know that with all the headlines and all the news, that people are scared. I know that Ebola has concerned them. But the reason I'm so proud of this country is because when there are times where we need to step up and do the right thing, we do the right thing. That's who we are. That's what we do. <p>No other nation is doing as much to help in West Africa as the United States of America. When I hear people talking about American leadership and then are promoting policies that would avoid leadership and have us running in the opposite direction and hiding under the covers, it makes me a little frustrated. <p>We're at our best when we are standing up and taking responsibility, even when it requires us making sacrifices, especially when it requires us making sacrifices. And it's how we help others around the world that's important. And it's not just massive deployments of troops and equipment, as proud as we are of that, but it's also our skill and our compassion and painstaking effort and our ability to learn from mistakes that are made and our ability to work through problems that are really complicated and to see something through and not lose our heads, to have grace under pressure and apply ourselves with slow, steady effort, the kind that change and progress requires. <p>That's what I want to see from us: the pride of a nation that always steps up and gets the job done. America has never been defined by fear. We are defined by courage and passion and hope and selflessness and sacrifice and a willingness to take on challenges when others can't and others will not, and ordinary Americans who risk their own safety to help those in need, and who inspire, thereby, the example of others, all in the constant pursuit of building a better world not just for ourselves, but for people in every corner of the Earth. <p>And that's how I know we're going to manage to contain the disease in America, because like&mdash;the heroes like the ones who are here today. That's how I know we will fight this disease's spread, as more nurses and doctors and medics and lab technicians and health professionals join the effort. That's how I know that ultimately we'll end the outbreak in West Africa and we'll eliminate the threat that it poses to the world. That's how I know that we will not only save thousands, tens of thousands, potentially hundreds of thousands of lives, but also how I know that we will remain true to our ideals and our values. <p>So I put those on notice who think that we should hide from these problems. That's not who we are. That's not who I am. That's not who these folks are. This is America. We do things differently. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"238" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! Well, can everybody please give Lisbeth a big round of applause? That was a great introduction. <p>Happy Halloween, everybody. I see a lot of you came as college students. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience members.</i> We love you, Obama! We love you! <p><i>The President.</i> I love you too. Those of you who have seats, feel free to sit down. Those of you who don't, don't. [<i>Laughter</i>] I am not going to be too long. I've got to get back and trick-or-treat tonight with Michelle. Although, Malia and Sasha are a little old and&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience members.</i> Aww! <p><i>The President.</i> It's so sad. [<i>Laughter</i>] I used to be able to&mdash;I mean, we'd dress them up, and we still have the pictures. They'll resent them later, but at the time, they were fine with it. They were so cute. <p>A good thing about being President is, we never run out of Presidential M&Ms&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and so we're going to be giving those out. <p><i>Audience members.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>] [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> You want some? Is that what you said? Only to kids. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We're so proud of Lisbeth, not just for the wonderful introduction, but for being so determined about her education. And she's a really remarkable young lady. I had a chance to speak to her before we came out. It turns out she went to school with my niece and nephew. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Classical! <p><i>The President.</i> That's right. At Classical, is that right? So that was neat. <p>I have also brought some Halloween characters with me: Our Secretary of Labor, Tom Perez. They are all dressed up as really outstanding public servants. [<i>Laughter</i>] And Tom has just been doing extraordinary work. His lovely daughter is here, who's a freshman at Brown. Your great Senators, Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse. Your outstanding Congressmen, David Cicilline, is here; Jim Langevin is here. And we're proud of both of them. <p>But despite how much I love all the folks I just mentioned, the people I really came to see is you. Because every decision I make, every single day, all the policies I pursue as President, are all aimed at making sure we restore the promise of this country for your generation and for every generation that comes after. <p>Now, the good news is we've made a lot of progress since the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes. So when I first came into office, the economy was in a freefall, the auto industry was in a freefall. Banks were frozen up. We were losing 800,000 jobs a month. Over the past 55 months, our businesses have now added 10.3 million new jobs. For the first time in more than 6 years, the unemployment rate is below 6 percent. Over the past 6 months, our economy has grown at its fastest pace in more than 10 years. And in education, dropout rates are down, the national graduation rate is the highest on record, more young people are earning their college degrees than ever before. Good job, young people. <p>In energy, we're less dependent on foreign oil than any time in nearly three decades. Manufacturing&mdash;the quintessential producer of middle class jobs, the heart of Rhode Island's economy for decades&mdash;manufacturing has now created 700,000 new jobs since early 2010. Ten million Americans have gained the peace of mind that comes with having health insurance. Deficit&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> Thank you! <p><i>The President.</i> You're welcome. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Deficits have come down. Health care inflation has come down. There's almost no economic measure by which we haven't made substantial progress over this period of time. We're better off than we were. <p>So look, the progress has been hard. It's sometimes been challenging in particular States. But it's been steady and it's been real. Now, the thing is, though, what's also true is that millions of Americans don't yet feel the benefits of a growing economy where it matters most, and that's in their own lives. There are still a lot of folks who are working hard, but having trouble making ends meet. <p>I know that many of you are working while you go to school. Some of you are helping support your parents or siblings. Here in Rhode Island and across the country, there are still too many people who are working too many hours and don't have enough to show for it. And this isn't just the hangover from the great recession; some of this has to do with trends that date back 20, 30 years. And I've always said that recovering from the crisis of 2008 was the first thing we had to do, but our economy won't be really healthy until we reverse some of these longer term trends, this erosion of middle class jobs and income. <p>And here in Rhode Island, my administration recently announced a grant to help more long-term unemployed folks get the training and mentoring they need to get back to work. And all across the country, we're taking similar actions, community by community, to keep making progress. <p>We've got to harness the momentum that we're seeing in the broader economy and make sure the economy is working for every single American. We've got to keep making smart choices. And today, here at RIC, I want to focus on some commonsense steps we can take to help working families right now. In particular, I want to zero in on the choices we need to make to ensure that women are full and equal participants in the economy. <p>Now, men, I don't want you to feel neglected. I like men just fine. [<i>Laughter</i>] But part of the reason that I want this focus is because I was raised by a single mom and know what it was like for her to raise two kids and go to work at the same time and try to piece things together without a lot of support. And my grandmother, who never graduated from college, but worked her way up to become vice president of a bank, I know what it was like for her to hit the glass ceiling and to see herself passed over for promotions by people that she had trained. And so some of this is personal, but some of it is also what we know about our economy, which is, it's changing in profound ways and in many ways for the better because of the participation of women more fully in our economy. So earlier today I met with a group of women business owners and working moms and Lisbeth and your president here, and they were sharing stories that probably sound familiar to a lot of people: studying for finals after working a full shift, searching for childcare when the babysitter cancels at the last minute, using every penny of their savings so they can afford to stay home with their new baby. <p>And so I kept on hearing my own story. I kept on hearing about my mom struggling to put herself through school or my grandmother hitting that glass ceiling. And I thought about Michelle, and I told some stories about when Michelle and I were younger and getting started, and we were struggling to balance two careers while raising a family. And my job forced me to travel a lot, which made it harder on Michelle, and we would feel some of the guilt that so many people feel. We're working, we're thinking about the kids, we're wondering whether we're bad parents, we're wondering whether we were doing what we need to do on the job. That's the catch-22 of working parents: We wanted to spend time with our kids, but we also wanted to make sure that we gave them the opportunities that our hard work was providing. <p>And then, of course, I think about my daughters. And the idea that my daughters wouldn't have the same opportunities as somebody's sons, well, that's unacceptable. [<i>Applause</i>] That's not acceptable. <p>So I say all this because, to the men here, we all have a stake in choosing policies that help women succeed. Women make up about half of America's workforce. For more than two decades, women have earned over half of the higher education degrees awarded in this country. And you look at RIC's student body, almost 70 percent women. In colleges nationwide, there are more women graduating than men, which means that for the first time, America's highly educated workforce will be made up of more women than men. <p>But here's the challenge&mdash;that's all good news&mdash;the challenge is, our economy and some of the laws and rules governing our workplaces haven't caught up with that reality. A lot of workplaces haven't caught up with that reality. So while many women are working hard to support themselves and their families, they're still facing unfair choices, outdated workplace policies. That holds them back, but it also holds all of us back. We have to do better, because women deserve better. And by the way, when women do well, everybody does well. <p>So women deserve a day off to care for a sick child or sick parent without running into hardship. And Rhode Island's got the right idea. You're one of just three States where paid family leave is the law of the land. More States should choose to follow your lead. <p>It was interesting talking to some of the small-business owners in the meeting. They were saying how the Rhode Island law actually helped them do a better job recruiting and retaining outstanding employees. And so that shows you something: that this is not just a nice thing to do; it's good policy. It's good for business. It's good for the economy. <p>Without paid leave, when a baby arrives or an aging parent needs help, workers have to make painful decisions about whether they can afford to be there when their families need them most. Many women can't even get a paid day off to give birth to their child. I mean, there are a lot of companies that still don't provide maternity leave. Of course, dads should be there too. So let's make this happen for women and for men and make our economy stronger. We've got to broaden our laws for family leave. <p>Moms and dads deserve a great place to drop their kids off every day that doesn't cost them an arm and a leg. We need better childcare, daycare, early childhood education policies. In many States, sending your child to daycare costs more than sending them to a public university. <p><i>Audience member.</i> True! <p><i>The President.</i> True? [<i>Laughter</i>] And too often, parents have no choice but to put their kids in cheaper daycare that maybe doesn't have the kinds of programming that makes a big difference in a child's development. But&mdash;and sometimes, there may just not be any slots, or the best programs may be too far away. And sometimes, someone, usually mom, leaves the workplace to stay home with the kids, which then leaves her earning a lower wage for the rest of her life as a result. And that's not a choice we want Americans to make. <p>So let's make this happen. By the end of this decade, let's enroll 6 million children in high-quality preschool, and let's make sure that we are making America stronger. That is good for families; it's also good for the children, because we know investing in high-quality early childhood education makes all the difference in the world, and those kids will do better. So we need family leave, we need better childcare policies, and we need to make sure that women get an honest day's pay for an honest day's work. <p>About 28 million Americans would benefit if we raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, like Sheldon Whitehouse and Jack Reed support. And let me say this: Minimum wage&mdash;those aren't just teenage jobs that are impacted. We're not just talking about young people. I mean, my first job was at Baskin-Robbins. And I got paid the minimum wage, and it was okay. Wearing that hat and the apron was&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;yeah. <p>But that&mdash;the truth is, the average worker who would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage is 35 years old&mdash;35. A majority of low-wage workers are women. A lot of them have kids. Right now somebody working full time on the minimum wage makes $14,500 a year&mdash;$14,500. If they're a parent, that means they're below the poverty line. Nobody who works full time in America should be below the poverty line. They should not be raising their kids below the poverty line. I am not going to give up this fight. And we need Republicans in Congress to stop blocking a minimum wage increase and give America a raise. <p>And if a woman is doing the same work as a man, she deserves to pay&mdash;get paid just like the man does. Even though it's 2014, there are women still earning less than men for doing the same work. And women of color face an even greater wage gap. And at a time when women are the primary breadwinners in more households than ever, that hurts the whole family if they're not getting paid fairly. Again, men, I just want you to pay attention. When Michelle and I were starting off, there were stretches of time where Michelle was making more money than me, and I wanted to make sure she was making every dime that she deserved. [<i>Laughter</i>] Right? I don't know how I benefit by her getting paid less than a man. Right? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Right! <p><i>The President.</i> Okay! Men, I just want you to be clear. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And it starts with recent college graduates. Women often start their careers with lower pay, and then the gap grows over time, especially if they get passed over for promotions and then they get fewer raises, or they take time off to care for family members. So they&mdash;you get a situation where women doing the same work as men, but the structure, the expectations somehow is, well, they'll take time off for family, and well, once they take time off that means that they're&mdash;it's okay to pay them a little bit less. And that builds up over time. And we've got to have a reversal of those kinds of policies and that kind of mindset. We've got to catch up to the 21st century. We need to pass a fair pay law, make our economy stronger. It will be good for America, and it will be good for all families and good for all kids. <p>While we're on the topic, women deserve to make their ownhealth care choices, not politicians or insurance companies. And that's why the Affordable Care Act is so important. Insurance plans&mdash;because we passed the Affordable Care Act, insurance plans now have to cover the basics, including contraceptive care and prenatal care and maternity care. <p>That means a working mom doesn't have to put off the care she needs just so she can pay her bills on time. Tens of millions of women have new access to preventive care like mammograms with no copays, no out-of-pocket expenses. It means that a cash-strapped student doesn't have to choose between the care that she needs and the cost of textbooks. <p>So&mdash;and because of the Affordable Care Act, because of Obamacare, no&mdash;because of that law, no insurance company can deny you coverage based on a preexisting condition like breast cancer or charge you more for the same care just because you're a woman. That's the right thing to do. <p>So no matter how many times Republicans threaten to repeal this law, we're going to keep it in place, because it's working. Not only is it covering more people, not only is it protecting women and people with preexisting conditions from discrimination, but it's actually been part of the trend that's lowering health care inflation. We're actually saving money because the system is getting smarter and there's more preventive care instead of emergency care, and we're changing how health care is delivered, which is why I'm pretty sure that in 10 years, they're not going to call it Obamacare anymore. [<i>Laughter</i>] Republicans will be, like, oh, I was for that, yes. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's how that works. <p><i>Audience member.</i> We'll remember. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> You'll remember though. You'll remind them. <p>Now, to really make sure that women are full and equal participants in our economy, we can do some of this administratively. But it requires not just changing laws, it requires changing attitudes. And more and more companies are changing attitudes. And this is really good news. <p>JetBlue, for example, has a flexible work-from-home plan for its customer service reps. They've found it's led to happier, more productive employees and lower costs. Google increased paid leave for new parents&mdash;moms and dads&mdash;to 5 months. Five months. And that helped cut the rate of women leaving the company by half. And when I was having a conversation with some of the women business owners before I came out here, they were saying it's really costly when you lose a good employee and you've got to train somebody all over again. It's much more sensible from a business perspective to invest in them and make them feel like you've got their backs, and they'll stay with you. <p>And it's not just these big corporations that are embracing these policies. So Cheryl Snead, who is the CEO of Banneker Industries&mdash;where's Cheryl? She was here just a second. There she is back there. So Banneker Industries, a supply chain management firm, is based in North Smithfield. And when Cheryl was in college, she studied mechanical engineering. At the time, there weren't that many African American women in mechanical engineering. There still aren't. [<i>Laughter</i>] We're working to change that. <p>Cheryl wants to do something about that. Her company has made it a priority to find talented young women and minority students, encourage them to study science and math in college, hire them once they graduate. And what Cheryl was explaining was that having a diverse workforce, having more women in the workforce, all that makes her a stronger company. And it's not just good for the workers, it's good for business. <p>So if large businesses like Google, small businesses like Cheryl's, all see the wisdom of this, let's join them. Let's encourage more women and more girls into fields like science and technology and engineering and math. And let's work with those companies to ensure that family-friendly policies can support more women in that workforce. <p>Ann-Marie Harrington&mdash;where is Ann? Ann-Marie is right here. So Ann-Marie, she's the president of a company called Embolden, based in Pawtucket. And it provides web services to community foundations and nonprofits. Small business&mdash;about 20 employees; 21 I think she said. She just hired somebody, must have been. [<i>Laughter</i>] But she lets them work from home and keep a flexible schedule when they need to. And she says that's increased her company's productivity. <p>So I'm taking a page from these companies' playbooks. This summer I directed the Federal agencies in the executive branch to put flexible workplace policies in wherever possible, make it clear that all Federal employees have the right to request them. We want the best talent to serve our country, and that means making it a little bit easier for them to maintain that work-family balance. <p>But these are issues that are too important to hinge on whether or not your boss is enlightened. We have to raise our voices to demand that women get paid fairly. We've got to raise our voices to make sure women can take time off to care for a loved one and that moms and dads can spend time with a new baby. We've got to raise our voices to make sure that our women maintain and keep their own health care choices. We've got to raise our voices to basically do away with policies and politicians that belong to&mdash;in a \\"Mad Men\\" episode. \\"Mad Men\\" is a good show, but that's not who we want making decisions about our workplaces these days. When women succeed, America succeeds. And we need leaders who understand that. That's what we need. <p>So if you care about these policies, you got to keep pushing for them. This shouldn't be partisan. Republicans and Democrats should be supportive of all these issues. <p>I was talking to Tom Perez; he had just come back from Europe. He was talking to chambers of commerce and conservative politicians. They were all supportive of family leave, supportive of childcare, because they understood it actually made the economy more productive. This isn't a liberal or conservative agenda. <p>When I talk to women, like the ones I spoke to earlier, when I hear folks' stories from across the country, and when I think about my own mom and how she made it all work, or my grandmother, nobody is looking at these issues through partisan lenses. We're not Democrats first or Republicans first, we are Americans first. And as Americans, it's up to us to protect and restore the ideals that made this country great. <p>And that is that in this country, no matter who you are, what you look like, where you come from, whether you are male or you are female, here in America, you can make it if you try. That's the promise of America. That's the future I'm going to fight for. I want you to fight there with me. <p>Thank you, everybody. God bless you.\" "
"239" "\"Hi, everybody. On Friday, I had a discussion with working women in Rhode Island about the economic challenges they face in their own lives, challenges shared by many of you. <p>Thanks to the work we've all put in, our economy has come a long way these past 6 years. Over the past 55 months, our businesses have added 10.3 million new jobs. For the first time in 6 years, the unemployment rate is below 6 percent. And on Thursday, we learned that over the past 6 months, our economy has grown at its fastest pace since 2003. <p>But the gains of a growing economy aren't yet felt by everyone. So we've got to harness this momentum and make the right choices so that everyone who works hard can get ahead. <p>In recent weeks, I've talked about these choices, from raising the minimum wage to creating new jobs in construction and manufacturing. Today I want to focus on what I discussed with those women: the choices we need to make to help more women get ahead in today's economy. <p>Right now women make up almost half of our workers. More women are their family's main breadwinner than ever before. So the simple truth is, when women succeed, America succeeds. And we should be choosing policies that benefit women, because that benefits all of us. <p>Women deserve fair pay. Even though it's 2014, there are women still earning less than men for doing the same work. We don't have second-class citizens in this country; we shouldn't in the workplace either. So let's make sure women earn equal pay for equal work and have a fair shot at success. <p>Women deserve to be able to take time off to care for a new baby, an ailing parent, or take a sick day for themselves without running into hardship. So let's make sure all Americans have access to paid family leave. <p>Pregnant workers deserve to be treated fairly. Even today, women can be fired for taking too many bathroom breaks or forced on unpaid leave just for being pregnant. That's wrong, and we have to choose policies that ensure pregnant workers are treated with dignity and respect. <p>New parents deserve quality, affordable childcare. There's nothing like the peace of mind that comes with knowing that your kids are safe while you're at work. And the benefits that children get out of early enrichment can pay off for a lifetime. But in many States, sending your kid to daycare costs more than sending them to a public university. So let's start demanding pre-K for our kids. <p>And when most low-wage workers are women, but Congress hasn't passed a minimum wage increase in 7 years, it's long past time that women deserve a raise. About 28 million workers would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, and more than half of those workers are women. The local businesses where these workers spend their money would benefit too. So let's do this. Let's give America a raise. All of these policies are common sense. All of them are within our reach. We've just got to speak up and choose them, because they'll build a stronger America for all of us. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"240" "\"Please, everyone, have a seat. Well, on behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the White House. One hundred fifty-one years ago, as our country struggled for its survival, President Lincoln dedicated the battlefield at Gettysburg as \\"a final resting place for those who died here, that the nation might live.\\" Today the nation that lived pauses to pay tribute to one of those who died there: to bestow the Medal of Honor, our highest military decoration, upon First Lieutenant Alonzo H. Cushing. <p>Now, typically, this medal must be awarded within a few years of the action. But sometimes, even the most extraordinary stories can get lost in the passage of time. So I want to thank the more than two dozen family members of Lieutenant Cushing who are here, including his cousin, twice removed, Helen Loring Ensign, from Palm Desert, California, who will accept this medal. For this American family, this story isn't some piece of obscure history, it is an integral part of who they are. And today our whole Nation shares their pride and celebrates what this story says about who we are. <p>This award would not have been possible without the tireless efforts of supporters who worked for decades to make this day a reality. And I want to especially acknowledge Margaret Zerwekh, who is a historian from Delafield, Wisconsin, where Lieutenant Cushing was born. And there's Margaret back there. [<i>Laughter</i>] Good to see you, Margaret. Margaret is also the granddaughter of a Union veteran and lives on a property that was once owned by Cushing's father. When she discovered this story, she spent over 25 years researching, writing letters, and raising her voice to ensure that this American soldier received the recognition that he so richly he deserved. And what's more, she even managed to bring Republicans and Democrats together&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;to make this happen. Margaret, we may call on you again sometime in the next several months. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Yet this medal is about more than just one soldier or one family. It reflects our obligations as a country to the men and women in our Armed Services, obligations that continue long after they return home, after they've removed their uniforms, and even&mdash;perhaps especially&mdash;after they've laid down their lives. And so this medal is a reminder that no matter how long it takes, it is never too late to do the right thing. <p>Alonzo, or \\"Lon,\\" Cushing was raised by his widowed mother in Fredonia, New York, with his siblings, including three brothers who also fought for the Union. As the Congressman who recommended Lon to West Point wrote, \\"His mother is poor, but highly committed, and her son will do honor to the position.\\" After graduating from West Point, Lon was assigned to Battery A, Fourth United States Artillery. From Bull Run to Antietam, from Chancellorsville to Fredericksburg, Lon fought bravely and developed a reputation for his cool, his competence, and his courage under fire. <p>But it was at Gettysburg, what one newspaper later called \\"emphatically a soldiers' battle,\\" where Lon would be immortalized. It was July 3, 1863, the final day of a grueling 3-day fight. Lon commanded his battery along the wall on Cemetery Ridge, fending off punishing fire from General Lee's Confederate troops in advance of what we now know as Pickett's Charge. In the chaos and smoke, Lon and his men could barely see ahead of them. One colonel later described the \\"terrible grandeur of that rain of missiles and that chaos of strange and terror-spreading sounds.\\" <p>Lon was hit and badly wounded. His first sergeant, a soldier by the name of Frederick Fuger, urged him to go to the rear. But Lon refused and said he'd \\"fight it out or die in the attempt.\\" Bleeding and weak, he moved his remaining guns closer to the front. Over 10,000 Confederate infantrymen advanced, elbow to elbow, in rows over a mile wide. Peering through field glasses, Lon ordered his men to continue firing at the advancing columns. He used his own thumb to stop his gun's vent, burning his fingers to the bone. When he was hit the final time, as a poet later wrote, \\"His gun spoke out for him once more before he fell to the ground.\\" And Alonzo Cushing was just 22 years old. <p>In a letter to Lon's sister, Fuger wrote that the bravery of their men that day \\"was entirely due to your brother's training and example set on numerous battlefields.\\" Etched on Lon's tombstone at West Point is the simple epitaph, \\"Faithful unto death.\\" And his memory will be honored later this month, when one of our Navy's cruisers&mdash;the USS <i>Gettysburg</i>&mdash;dedicates its officer's dining hall as the \\"Cushing Wardroom.\\" <p>And here today, we know that Lon and the others who fell that day could not&mdash;we know what they could not: that Gettysburg was a turning point in the Civil War. It's also proof, if any was needed, that it was thousands of unknown young soldiers, committing unsung acts of heroism, who saved our Union and freed a people and reaffirmed our Nation as \\"one Nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\\" I'm mindful that I might not be standing here today, as President, had it not been for the ultimate sacrifices of those courageous Americans. <p>Today we honor just one of those men, Lieutenant Alonzo Cushing, who, as Lincoln said, gave their \\"last full measure of devotion.\\" His story is part of our larger American story, one that continues today. The spirit, the courage, the determination that he demonstrated lives on in our brave men and women in uniform who this very day are serving and making sure that they are defending the freedoms that Alonzo helped to preserve. And it's incumbent on all of us as Americans to uphold the values that they fight for and to continue to honor their service long after they leave the battlefield, for decades, even centuries, to come. <p>So with that, I'd like to ask Helen to join me for the reading of the citation. <p>[<i>At this point, Maj. Steven M. Schreiber,</i> <i>USMC, Marine Corps Aide to the President, read the citation. The President then presented the medal, assisted by Lt. Col. Michael P. Wagner, USA, Army Aide to the President.</i>] <p>And let me ask the Members of Congress who helped to make this happen to join us for a photograph. And let's get our Secretary and&mdash;our two Secretaries right here. Come on up.\" "
"241" "\"Thank you, everybody. Please, have a seat, have a seat. Well, good evening everybody. On behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the White House. <p>Tonight, as we near Veterans Day, we are continuing our White House music series with a salute to American patriots: our extraordinary troops, our veterans, and their families. And to help us pay tribute to these remarkable, remarkable individuals, our men and women in uniform, we've got some musical legends, like Willie Nelson, John Fogerty. We've got Mary J. Blige in the house. We've got Romeo Santos. We have Common here. Hill Harper and Logan Lerman are here as well, and we're going to be joined by Daughtry, who's playing at a big USO Show at Yokota Air Base in Japan. <p>And we've got some of the finest musicians in our military. We've got Sergeant Christiana Ball, U.S. Army, and Captain John Auer and Captain Matt Smith, United States Marine Corps. <p>So between all of these folks, we've got a little bit of rock and roll, we've got a little bit of country, little bit of everything in between. And that's fitting because here in America, no matter where you're from, no matter what music you listen to, we're all united in our respect and admiration for our brave men and women who wear our country's uniform. So let's give it up to&mdash;let's give it up for the servicemembers, the veterans, the families. We are so grateful to have you here tonight. <p>One of my greatest privileges as Commander in Chief is the opportunity to spend time with all of you and your families. I've met young men who willingly chose to move toward grenades to save their friends. I've met heroes who ran into enemy fire and carry their comrades to safety. And I have seen their families and the stress and strains that they go through, but nevertheless, they couldn't be prouder to support those family members who serve. <p>We've seen, obviously, families of the fallen who keep the spirit of their loved ones alive, and their strength then inspires the rest of us. And of course, we are inspired by our wounded warriors, whose injuries are no match for the sheer force of will that they display every single day. And some of them are joining us here from Walter Reed tonight. We are especially proud of them. So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>Just one story I want to tell, because I've gotten to know these folks pretty well. One of the wounded warriors here is Captain Luis Avila. I met Luis and his beautiful wife Claudia a few times, and their wonderful kids, and I want to just take a moment to share their story with you because I think it's representative of what it means to serve the United States of America, to be a true patriot. <p>Almost 3 years ago, just after Christmas, Luis was in his fifth deployment&mdash;this time in Afghanistan&mdash;when he was severely injured in an explosion. He lost his leg, fractured his spine, suffered two heart attacks and a traumatic brain injury. Two weeks after the explosion, he arrived in the United States in a coma and on life support. It was so dire that Claudia was forced to confront that agonizing question: Was it time for her to let him go, take him off life support? But if you have a chance to meet Claudia, she's pretty strong and pretty stubborn. And she also had faith that Luis would recover. And as she prayed during those desperate days, she began praying some of Luis's famous songs in the background: \\"Ode to Joy,\\" military marches, and some Beatles. At then he started twitching his facial muscles. And then he opened his mouth. And then, he moved his tongue on command. And the whole time, Claudia was playing music day and night. <p>And then finally, Luis woke up. He couldn't see. He couldn't eat. He couldn't talk. But he'd heard those songs. And in the months and years that followed, he kept fighting back with the help of hundreds of hours of music therapy. And today, Luis can see again, he can eat again, he can speak again. He's even playing, as I understand, a little bit of golf. [<i>Laughter</i>] And every night, he still goes to sleep with music playing. <p>So tonight we're honored to be joined by heroes like Luis and loving families like Claudia and their three boys, Luis Jr., Miguel, and Jos&eacute;. And we honor them with the beauty of music, music that has the power to inspire us and fill us with pride and, yes, sometimes to help us heal. And once this concert is over, let's pledge to carry that spirit back to our own communities and to do our part, as Americans, to always serve these men and women as well as they have served us. <p>But for now, let's have a little bit of fun. Please welcome the one and only Mr. Willie Nelson.\" "
"242" "\"Well, this morning we learned that in October our businesses added 209,000 new jobs. The unemployment rate fell again. Our private sector has now added 10.6 million new jobs over the last 56 months, and this is the strongest job growth that we have seen since the 1990s. <p>And all this is a testament to the hard work and resilience of the American people. They have been steady and strong digging themselves out of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. And what we need now to do is to make sure that we build on this momentum, because we recognize that despite the solid growth, despite the drop in unemployment, there are still a lot of folks out there who are anxious about their futures, who are having trouble making ends meet at the end of the month or saving for their kids' college education or being able to make sure that they're able to retire with dignity and respect. And so everything that we do over the next 2 years is designed and geared towards ensuring that folks who work hard in this country are able to get ahead. <p>Now, obviously, we've had a significant midterm election. As I said at the press conference, my attitude has been and will continue to be that good ideas don't necessarily come from just one party. And I'm looking forward to seeing the leaders of both Democratic and Republican caucuses this afternoon to have a chance to share with them both what I think we need to be doing to build on the economic momentum that we already have and make it even stronger, but I'm also going to be interested in listening to them in terms of areas where we think it's possible to work together, whether that is putting people back to work through stronger manufacturing here in the United States and selling more to countries around the world, one of the major topics that we're going to be discussing during my Asia trip next week; whether it's figuring out how we can build on some modest new investments that we've been making in early childhood education. We know that works. And there's strong bipartisan support around the country for some of those investments. Let's see if we can do more. <p>All these issues are ones in which there's a strong possibility of bipartisan cooperation, as long as we set politics aside for a moment and focus on the people who actually sent us here. <p>In the meantime, in these regular meetings that I'm having with my Cabinet, I've been emphasizing to them from day one and will reiterate in this meeting the fact that separate and apart from legislative activity, we have the capacity to continually improve how we deliver services to the American people. I think part of what's happened over a course of several decades is that people sometimes feel as if the Federal Government is distant, that it's not customer friendly, that there's too much bureaucracy. <p>And because of the fine work of many of the members of this Cabinet, what we've been able to do is start chipping away at some of the old ways of doing business and start instituting new ways of doing business that improve customer service, that make sure that people are getting the help they need. <p>This week, I had a chance to welcome and have a conversation with our new Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Bob McDonald, who is coming from the private sector, but also is coming from West Point and an extraordinary legacy of service in our Armed Forces. And what we're already seeing is that Bob is able to start skinning down the wait times for people in terms of getting appointments that they need, but also building on successes that have been taking place over the last several years, reducing homelessness, for example. With our HUD Secretaries Donovan and now Castro, we've reduced veterans homelessness by 30 percent. And a lot of that's not by virtue of new legislation, it's just by us focusing more on these problems and managing them better and continually listening to the American people to see how we can be more helpful. <p>So there are a lot of opportunities for us to do that here today. We're going to, I think, take an inventory of the progress that's being made in various departments. We're also going to focus on the fact that between now and the end of the year there's still some immediate work that needs to be done. <p>We have made progress in building the kind of public health infrastructure we need to deal with any eventualities with respect to Ebola, but it is still a concern both here domestically but most importantly, still a concern internationally. So we'll get reports from Sylvia Burwell as well as Susan Rice and others who have been actively involved in that fight. And Ron Klain, who's here, will tell us how the work we need to be doing with Congress can help advance and ultimately stamp out this epidemic overseas to make sure that the American people are safe. <p>We also have some significant national security issues. We've got to make sure that our efforts against ISIL are properly funded, and so that will&mdash;there will be an opportunity for Secretary of Defense Hagel to brief us on the progress in our campaign against ISIL in Iraq and some of the work we're doing in Syria. <p>So bottom line is that, as I've told my White House staff and I've shared in the past with many of my Cabinet, we are extraordinarily privileged to be in a position where every single day we can have a positive impact in some way on the lives of the American people. And when I started out on this journey with Joe Biden, and we traveled around the country, we were constantly reminded of the hard work, of the sense of community, the sense of family that exists in every pocket and every corner of this country, the same kinds of values that Joe grew up on and I grew up on. <p>And what we want to do is to make sure that between now and the time that a next administration takes over, that every single day, in every single agency, we are constantly finding ways to build on those values and to make sure that we are making this country safer and more prosperous. And I know that based on the conversations I've had with this Cabinet, there is no lack of enthusiasm or energy in achieving that goal. All right? <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"243" "\"Hi, everybody. This weekend, I depart for Asia to advance American leadership and promote American jobs in a dynamic region that will be critical to our security and prosperity in the century ahead. The democracies, progress, and growth we see across the Asia-Pacific would have been impossible without America's enduring commitment to that region, especially the service of generations of Americans in uniform. As we approach Veterans Day, we honor them and all those who've served to keep us free and strong. <p>We salute that greatest generation who freed a continent from fascism and fought across Pacific islands to preserve our way of life. We pay tribute to Americans who defended the people of South Korea, soldiered through the brutal battles of Vietnam, stood up to a tyrant in Desert Storm, and stopped ethnic cleansing in the Balkans. <p>And we celebrate our newest heroes from the 9/11 generation, our veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. For more than 13 years, we have been at war in Afghanistan. Next month, our combat mission will be over, and America's longest war will come to a responsible end. <p>But the end of a war is just the beginning of our obligations to those who serve in our name. These men and women will be proud veterans for decades to come, and our service to them has only just begun. So as we welcome our newest veterans home, let's honor them by giving them the thanks and respect they deserve. And let's make sure we're there for their families and children too, because they've also made great sacrifices for America. <p>Let's honor our veterans by making sure they get the care and benefits they've earned. That means health care that's there for them when they need it. It means continuing to reduce the disabilities claim backlog. And it means giving our wounded warriors all the care and support they need to heal, including mental health care for those with posttraumatic stress or traumatic brain injury. Some of the most moving moments I've experienced as Commander in Chief have been with our wounded warriors. Some have to learn how to walk again, talk again, write their names again. But no matter how hard it is, they never give up. They never quit. And we can't ever quit on them. <p>Let's honor our veterans by making sure they get their shot at the American Dream that they risked their lives to defend, by helping them find jobs worthy of their skills and talents and making sure the post-9/11 GI bill stays strong so more veterans can earn a college education. When our veterans have the opportunity to succeed, our whole Nation is stronger. And let's work together to end the tragedy of homelessness among veterans once and for all, because anyone who has defended America deserves to live in dignity in America. <p>Finally, let's honor our veterans by remembering that this isn't just a job for Government, it's a job for every American. We're all keepers of that sacred trust that says, if you put on a uniform and risk your life to keep us safe, we'll do our part for you. We'll make sure you and your family get the support you need. We'll have your backs, just like you had ours. <p>So this Veterans Day and every day, let's make sure all our veterans know how much we appreciate them. If you see a veteran, go on up and shake their hand. Look them in the eye. Say those words that every veteran deserves to hear: \\"Welcome home. Thank you. We need you more than ever to help us stay strong and free.\\" And then, let's come together, as Americans, to make sure we're there for them and their families for all the years of all their lives. <p>God bless our veterans and their families, and God bless the United States of America.\" "
"244" "\"<i>President Obama. </i>Thank you so much. <i>Xi&agrave;w</i><i>& 468;</i><i> h</i><i>&"
"245" "\"I want to thank all my fellow leaders and the Trade Ministers for joining us here today. I know we all have very busy schedules, so I'm going to keep my remarks brief. <p>We're here today because the Trans-Pacific Partnership is a high priority for our nations and for the region. As President, strengthening American leadership in the Asia-Pacific has been one of my top foreign policy priorities. And central to that objective is working with some of our most important trading partners to try to find ways in which we can facilitate increased growth for all of us, increased investment for all of us, improved jobs prospects for all of us. <p>And what we are seeing is momentum building around a Trans-Pacific Partnership that can spur greater economic growth, spur greater jobs growth, set high standards for trade and investment throughout the Asia-Pacific. And I don't think I have to explain to the press why this region is so important. This is the fastest growing, most populous, most dynamic region in the world economically. <p>During the past few weeks, our teams have made good progress in resolving several outstanding issues regarding a potential agreement. Today is an opportunity at the political level for us to break some remaining logjams. To ensure that TPP is a success, we also have to make sure that all of our people back home understand the benefits for them: that it means more trade, more good jobs, and higher incomes for people throughout the region, including the United States. And that's a case that I'll continue to make to Congress and the American people. And I know that the leaders here are committed to making that case as well. <p>This has the potential for being a historic achievement. It's now up to all of us to see if we can finalize a deal that is both ambitious and comprehensive. The stronger the agreement, the greater the benefits to our people. <p>So to all my fellow leaders, I want to thank you not just for your participation here today, but more importantly, for the mandate that you have given to your negotiating teams to engage in some very serious work that promises to deliver greater prosperity, trade, and commerce between our nations in the future. <p>Thank you very much. Thank you, guys.\" "
"246" "\"[<i>The President's remarks were joined in progress.</i>] <p>&mdash;&mdash;have shown us last night's events were spectacular, and this is a extraordinary setting for our meeting. And I very much appreciate the work that you've done to develop a very productive agenda during this year's APEC meeting. <p>I'd like to say to all my colleagues who are assembled here, it's good to be back with you at APEC. This forum has been able to provide an extraordinarily important forum for generating ideas that boost regional and then global integration and has helped to provide jobs and support growth in all of our economies. <p>Our meeting comes at a very important time for the global trading system. Just 1 year ago, we celebrated the conclusion of a historic trade facilitation agreement in Bali. As was just mentioned, that agreement has been breaking down over certain issues, although I'm actually confident that there's an opportunity for us to resolve them fairly soon. But it does underscore how challenging it is to maintain and continue to grow our multilateral trading system. <p>So we're going to need to focus on restoring and rebuilding the WTO's negotiating function. A strong multilateral trading system that holds us together and a common framework of rules has always been a bedrock of a healthy, global economy. <p>Meanwhile, APEC continues to play a central role in promoting economic integration through regional and bilateral trade agreements. If these agreements are ambitious, they can be stepping stones to greater integration rather than stumbling blocks. <p>APEC has been the incubator of ambitious trade agreements at the center of our agenda. This is where the trade facilitation agreement started. It was APEC's work that led to the Information Technology Agreement, the ITA, which we are now negotiating to expand. So it's fitting that we're here with our APEC colleagues to share the news that the United States and China have reached an understanding on the ITA that we hope will contribute to a rapid conclusion of the broader negotiations in Geneva. We think that's good news. And I very much thank President Xi's efforts in that regard. <p>APEC is often at its best and most effective on the more technologic&mdash;the more technical cooperation to boost the flow of goods and services across our borders. This is the small details, day to day, that remove bottlenecks to trade and reduce the cost of transactions. <p>In February, I signed an Executive order establishing a single window, for example, to speed the processing of cargo flows in and out of the United States. We welcome APEC's commitment to help all our economies streamline procedures and build capacity so we can meet our goals of reducing the time and the costs of border crossings by 10 percent by next year. <p>I want to welcome APEC's endorsement of ideas we discussed in Honolulu to create more transparent procedures for citizens and businesses to comment on proposed new regulations, which I think represents an important step forward for businesses that want to cooperate seamlessly across borders and jurisdictions. These efforts are not always large and public; they don't always get a lot of attention. But they represent the important strides in bringing our people closer together and making our economies stronger. <p>And finally, I want to commend China for focusing this year on what APEC can do to contribute to the realization of the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific. The goal of FTAAP was announced in 2006, and as leaders noted, the many regional initiatives will contribute to the eventual realization. We see our engagement in the Trans-Pacific Partnership as a contribution towards that effort. I look forward to the day when all of our economies can be linked together in a high-standard, 21st-century agreement. And I think that the work and the efforts of President Xi in setting this agenda here today will help facilitate that. So we thank you very much, Mr. President, for your extraordinary hospitality.\" "
"247" "\"President Xi, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: Thank you for your extraordinary hospitality and the honor of this state visit, which is a reflection of the deep ties between our countries and our peoples. <p>I'm told that one of your great Chinese authors once wrote, \\"Originally, there was no path, but after many people travel a certain way, a path is forged.\\" <p>Thirty-five years ago, our two nations established diplomatic relations. Since then, many people&mdash;Chinese and Americans&mdash;have traveled between us. Businesspeople, tourists, students and teachers, scientists and researchers. And as a result, a new path has been forged. <p>Among those who traveled that path was President Xi, who on an exchange program as a younger man visited our State of Iowa and stayed with a local family. Mr. President, as a result of the ties you forged then, families in Iowa still welcome young men and women from China into their homes and communities. <p>That path has also been traveled by my wife Michelle and our two daughters, who visited China earlier this year. As I was on my visit 5 years ago, they were deeply moved by the history and majesty of this nation and its people. And Michelle even tried her hand at tai chi. <p>Now this path is being walked in new ways. We recently witnessed an inspiring sight: a Chinese plane landing in Liberia with supplies to fight Ebola, and it was unloaded by Chinese and Americans and Liberians, working together, shoulder to shoulder. And today we showed that we can bring that same spirit to bear as leaders in the fight against climate change. <p>In closing, I'd like to recall a Chinese saying that reflects this spirit of possibility: \\"Nothing is too difficult, as long as people have resolve.\\" And so I propose a toast: To our people and the resolve we share, I wish the best of health to President Xi, his family, and the people of China, may we continue to walk the path of friendship and cooperation for the benefit of ourselves and for the world. <i>Ganbei. </i>\" "
"248" "\"Well, Mr. President, it is a pleasure to be back in China. I congratulate you and the people of China for hosting a successful APEC summit. I am grateful for your outstanding hospitality and the honor of this state visit. <p>This is the 35th anniversary of diplomatic ties between our two countries, as you noted. Since then, the trade and ties, the people-to-people exchanges between our countries have surged. And we've shown that when we cooperate, the United States and China can make important contributions to security and to progress in this region and around the world. <p>And this visit is an opportunity to continue discussions President Xi and I began in California last year and our meetings since. Yesterday evening and this morning we had the chance to discuss in depth our priorities and our vision for the U.S.-China relationship. As I've said before, I strongly believe that our two nations have an enormous stake in each other's success. America's presence in the Asia-Pacific, I believe, has benefited China. Conversely, a growing China has become one of our largest trading partners. As I said in my speech on Monday, the United States welcomes a China that is peaceful, prosperous, and stable, and I look forward to continuing the discussion with President Xi on areas where our countries can work together even more. <p>As we've noted, there are important differences that we have, both practically as well as our vision for our respective countries and our conduct of foreign policy. But what I've been very encouraged by is your willingness, Mr. President, to engage in a honest and constructive dialogue around those differences and ensuring that we manage them in a peaceful and effective way. <p>So I want to thank you and the Chinese people for your extraordinary hospitality. I look forward to our discussions and to ensuring that the U.S.-China relationship continues to deliver results for China, for the United States, and for the world. <i>Xi&eacute;xi&eacute;.</i>\" "
"249" "\"Well, I want to thank once again President Thein Sein for welcoming us, not only for the excellent arrangements that were made for the EAS and the U.S.-ASEAN summit, but also the opportunity to exchange ideas face to face. <p>In part because of President Sein's leadership, the democratization process in Myanmar is real, and we can point to specific changes that are making a difference. Domestically, we've seen political prisoners that have been released. We have seen a effort to end the practice of children being recruited into the army. There is a genuine prospect for a cease-fire between some of the armed groups that have been fighting in Myanmar for decades. <p>But in our discussions, we recognized that this process is still incomplete. So, specifically, we had the opportunity to discuss elections that are scheduled for next year and the need for those elections to be fair, inclusive, transparent, and that the constitutional amendment process that has begun needs to reflect the ability of all voices in Myanmar's society to participate. <p>We also discussed the specific situation in Rakhine State and the need to work towards a situation in which the Muslim minority there is protected and their rights are respected and they are able to fully enjoy the opportunities of this society. <p>And we discussed the opportunities for changes in the economy&mdash;legal reforms, regulatory reforms&mdash;that can allow the incredible natural resources and talents of Myanmar to fully access the opportunities of the world market. <p>And I thanked President Thein Sein for his efforts to end the arms trade with North Korea and to participate with us in building a strong nonproliferation regime here in this&mdash;Southeast Asia. <p>So we recognize that change is hard and that it doesn't always move in a straight line, but I am optimistic about the possibilities of Myanmar. I am optimistic about the continuing strengthening of bilateral ties between our two countries. And I committed to President Sein as well as his delegation and the people of Myanmar that all those who are sincere in pursuing reform will always have a strong ally in the United States of America. We look forward to working together.\" "
"250" "\"Well, I just had an excellent roundtable discussion with Members of Parliament as well as the Speaker of the lower and upper chamber&mdash;I may not be describing the term properly&mdash;as well as Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who I will have an opportunity to visit later tomorrow. <p>It was an excellent discussion about this transition process that's taking place here in Myanmar around consolidating some of the gains that have already been made, but also pushing further to institute a genuine democracy here in this country that can serve the needs of all people. I've been very impressed by not only the quality of the Members of Parliament, but also their determination to move forward. And they represent different parties, but they're unified in wanting to see a better life for the people of this country. <p>And I want to thank the National Democratic Institute, NDI, as well as the work that we're doing through USAID to try to provide some of the technical skills and resources necessary for what is a new experience for many people, and that is running a democratic process and having a Parliament. And I'm very proud of the work that the United States is doing in partnering with this country in advancing some of these goals. <p>There were a lot of discussions that I think would be familiar with every country. How do we make sure that we're protecting minority rights? What's the balance between decentralization and centralization? How do majority parties and opposition parties work together for the good of the country, but how do you prevent the kind of acrimony or institutional entrenchment that over time erodes democracy? There are certain unique circumstances involved in this transition. The large number of ethnic groups in the country, the existing armed conflicts that have gone on for many years between some of the ethnic groups and the Government, and the fact that the military is still a very powerful institution and managing how it transitions to greater civilian participation&mdash;these are all questions that we've seen in many other countries both in the region and around the world. And in the United States, we've had to wrestle with many of these questions as well, both in our founding and over the course of our democracy. <p>But what I'm encouraged by is the commitment of all the individuals here to try to make this work. And I think that if with strong leadership and commitment the attitude that I've heard today continues in the years to come, then I'm confident that what we will see is a completely new day for Myanmar. But the work is not yet done, and the goal of the United States here is to be a strong partner in the process. Like every good friend, we will praise what works. There will be times where we offer constructive criticism about the lack of progress in certain areas or where reform efforts have stalled. <p>But our consistent aim and goal will be to see that this transition is completed so that it delivers concrete benefits for the people, whether that's improved incomes for ordinary people; whether it means that farmers have greater access to productive lands; whether it means young people are getting a high-quality education; whether it means that religious minorities are adequately protected. The test in the end will be is it making people's lives better. These aren't abstract conversations, and I think all Members of Parliament here recognize that. <p>So I very much appreciate all of you sharing this moment with me, and it will inform my conversations with President Thein Sein this evening as well as my meetings with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi tomorrow when I travel down to Yangon. All right? <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"251" "\"Thank you very much, Mr. President. It is a great pleasure to be back in this beautiful country and to once again have the opportunity to consult closely with all of our ASEAN partners. <p>Today I'm looking forward to continuing to build on the strong partnership between ASEAN and the United States that already exists. President Thein Sein, I want to thank you for your hospitality and for bringing together this excellent summit. I think Myanmar has done a tremendous job chairing ASEAN this year and has shown solid leadership on issues of critical importance to the entire region. <p>As has already been noted in the EAS that we just attended, ASEAN is at the heart of Asia's rapid growth. Its people are ambitious and energetic and talented, and I'm looking forward to spending time tomorrow with young leaders from across Southeast Asia. And as a strong relationship between the United States and ASEAN is essential to realizing our shared vision for the future of the Asia-Pacific, I intend to continue to invest in these efforts not only during our summits, but more importantly, on a day-to-day basis. <p>During the past 6 years, we've made great strides in elevating and expanding this partnership, but I think we all agree we can still do more. And that's why the United States is committed to strengthening ASEAN, both as an institution and as a community of nations bound by our shared interests and values. And so whether we are working on economic issues, social issues, security issues, disaster relief, enhancing educational opportunities for all the young people of the region, strengthening our public health infrastructure to ensure that we can handle an outbreak of disease&mdash;in each and every one of these cases, I believe that we are going to be stronger together than when we act individually. And we are very much invested in building the capacity not just of individual nations, but between nations so that together we can become stronger, more capable partners to each other and meet the regional and global challenges ahead. So thank you very much, Mr. President, and I look forward to hearing the remarks from our fellow leaders.\" "
"252" "\"Well, I've just had an opportunity to speak with an excellent cross-section of civil society organizations here in Myanmar: women's organizations, organizations focused on rule of law, you have the press association, the press council represented here, organizations championing the rights of the disabled, labor organizations, student organizations, groups that are concerned with the plight of ethnic minorities here. <p>And one thing that's become clear from this conversation is that there is a vibrant civil society here, one that is committed to democracy and transparency and accountability. And it is U.S. policy to make sure that these civil society groups are supported and that they have the space in which to let their ideas and their concerns be expressed. <p>And as many of you know, I got my start in public life not as a politician, but actually as a community organizer. I very much believe that when ordinary people have the means to make themselves heard and to organize with each other to present their concerns that society is better. And nowhere is that more true than in a country like Myanmar that is transitioning from a military dictatorship to a democracy. <p>So I very much appreciate all the ideas that have been shared here. I think that what is most important from all the groups is that the laws are applied in a fair way; that we don't see the Government acting with impunity simply because a group may represent ideas that the Government hasn't approved of or that in some ways challenges the status quo, but that everybody's voice is allowed to be heard. <p>Not everybody at this table, by the way, agrees on every issue. We heard different perspectives on some very controversial issues, including what's happening in Rakhine State. But the fact that you can have open dialogue like this means that those problems can be solved. And if those ideas are suppressed, then nothing will change. <p>So I'm very pleased to have spent time with you, and I want to assure you that the United States will continue to be a partner with the people of Myanmar. And we'll continue to engage the Government to provide more space and more opportunity for freedom of the press, freedom of association, rule of law, transparency, and accountability. All right? <p>Thank you so much, everybody.\" "
"253" "\"Thank you so much! Thank you, everybody. Everybody, please have a seat. Hello, Brisbane! Oh, it's good to be back in Australia. I love Australia, I really do. The only problem with Australia is, every time I come here, I've got to sit in conference rooms and talk to politicians instead of go to the beach. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>To Chancellor Story, Professor H&oslash;j, faculty and staff, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, and most of all, the students of the University of Queensland: It is great to be here at UQ. I know that we are joined by students from universities across this city and some high school students as well. And so I want to thank all of the young people especially for welcoming me here today. <p>On my last visit to this magnificent country 3 years ago, I had the privilege to meet some of the First Australians; we're joined by some today. So I want to begin by acknowledging the traditional owners of this land and by paying my respects to your elders, past and present. <p>This university is recognized as one of the world's great institutions of science and teaching. Your research led to the vaccine that protects women and girls around the world from cervical cancer. Your innovations have transformed how we treat disease and how we unlock new discoveries. Your studies have warned the world about the urgent threat of climate change. In fact, last year, I even tweeted one of your studies in my 31&mdash;to my 31 million followers on Twitter. [<i>Laughter</i>] Just bragging a little bit. I don't think that's quite as much as Lady Gaga, but it's still pretty good. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's still not bad. <p>I thank Prime Minister Abbott and the people of Brisbane and Queensland for hosting us at the G-20 summit. This city, this part of Australia, is just stunning. \\"Beautiful one day, and then perfect the next.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] That's what I understand. We travel a lot around the world. My staff was very excited for \\"Bris Vegas.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] When I arrived they advised I needed some four-X. [<i>Laughter</i>] You have some? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Part of the reason I have fond memories of Australia is I spent some time here as a boy when I was traveling between Hawaii and Indonesia, where I lived for several years. And when I returned 3 years ago as President, I had the same feelings that I remembered as a child: the warmth of the people of Australia, the sense of humor. I learned to speak a little \\"strine.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm tempted to \\"give it a burl.\\" That's about as far as I can go, actually. <p>But I do want to take this opportunity to express once again the gratitude of the American people for the extraordinary alliance with Australia. I tell my friends and family and people that I meet that there is an incredible commonality between Australia and the United States. And whether that's because so many of us traveled here as immigrants, some voluntary, some not; whether it's because of the wide open spaces and the sense of a frontier culture, there's a bond between our two countries. <p>And Australia really is everything that you would want in a friend and in an ally. We're cut from the same cloth: immigrants from an old world who build a new nation. We're inspired by the same ideals of equality and opportunity, the belief everybody deserves a fair go, a fair shot. And we share that same spirit&mdash;that confidence and optimism&mdash;that the future is ours to make, that we don't have to carry with us all the baggage from the past, that we can leave this world a better, safer, more just place for future generations. And that's what brings me here today: the future that we can build together, here in the Asia-Pacific region. <p>Now, this week, I've traveled more than 15,000 miles, from America to China to Burma to Australia. I have no idea what time it is right now. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm completely upside down. But despite that distance, we know that our world is getting smaller. One of Australia's great writers spoke of this, a son of Brisbane and a graduate of this university, David Malouf. And he said, \\"In that shrinking of distance that is characteristic of our contemporary world, even the Pacific, largest of oceans, has become a lake.\\" Even the Pacific has become a lake. <p>And you see it here on this campus, where you welcome students from all across Asia and around the world, including a number of Americans. You go on exchanges, and we're proud to welcome so many of you to the United States. You walk the streets of this city, and you hear Chinese, Vietnamese, Bahasa Indonesia, Korean, Hindi. And in many neighborhoods, more than half the people you meet were born somewhere else. This is a global city in a globalized world. <p>And I often tell young people in America that, even with today's challenges, this is the best time in history to be alive. Never in the history of humanity have people lived longer, are they more likely to be healthy, more likely to be enjoying basic security. The world is actually much less violent today&mdash;you wouldn't know it from watching television&mdash;than it once was. <p>And that's true here in the Asia-Pacific as well. Countries once ravaged by war, like South Korea and Japan, are among the world's most advanced economies. From the Philippines to Indonesia, dictatorships have given way to genuine democracies. In China and across the region, hundreds of millions of people have been lifted from poverty in the span of one generation, joining a global middle class. Empowered by technology, you&mdash;the young people, in particular, of this region&mdash;are connecting and collaborating across borders and cultures like never before as you seek to build a new future. <p>So the opportunities today are limitless. And I don't watch a lot of Australian television, so&mdash;as you might imagine, because I'm really far away. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I don't know whether some of the same tendencies that we see in the United States&mdash;a focus on conflict and disasters and problems&mdash;dominate what's fed to us visually every single day. But when you look at the facts, opportunities are limitless for this generation. You're living in an extraordinary time. <p>But what is also true that&mdash;is that alongside this dynamism, there are genuine dangers that can undermine progress. And we can't look at those problems through rose-tinted glasses. North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, that's a problem. Disputes over territory, remote islands and rocky shoals that threaten to spiral into confrontation. <p>The failure to uphold universal human rights, denying justice to citizens and denying countries their full potential. Economic inequality and extreme poverty that are a recipe for instability. And energy demands in growing cities that also hasten trends towards a changing climate. Indeed, the same technologies that empower citizens like you also give oppressive regimes new tools to stifle dissent. <p>So the question that we face is, which of these futures will define the Asia-Pacific in the century to come? Do we move towards further integration, more justice, more peace? Or do we move towards disorder and conflict? Those are our choices. Conflict or cooperation? Oppression or liberty? Here in Australia, 3 years ago, in your Parliament, I made it clear where the United States stands. We believe that nations and peoples have the right to live in security and peace; that an effective security order for Asia must be based not on spheres of influence or coercion or intimidation, where big nations bully the small, but on alliances of mutual security, international law, international norms that are upheld, and the peaceful resolution of disputes. <p>We believe in open markets and trade that is fair and free; a level playing field where economies play by the same rules; where the purpose of trade is not simply to extract resources from the ground, but to build true partnerships that raise capacity and living standards in poor countries; where small-business owners and entrepreneurs and innovators have the freedom to dream and create and flourish; and how well a country does is based on how well they empower their individual citizens. <p>And we believe in democracy: that the only real source of legitimacy is the consent of the people; that every individual is born equal with fundamental rights, inalienable rights; and that it is the responsibility of governments to uphold these rights. This is what we stand for. That is our vision, the future America is working towards in the Asia-Pacific, with allies and with friends. <p>Now, as a Pacific power, the United States has invested our blood and treasure to advance this vision. We don't just talk about it, we invest in this vision. Generations of Americans have served and died in the Asia-Pacific so that the people of the region might live free. So no one should ever question our resolve or our commitment to our allies. <p>When I assumed office, leaders and people across the region were expressing their desire for greater American engagement. And so as President, I decided that&mdash;given the importance of this region to American security, to American prosperity&mdash;the United States would rebalance our foreign policy and play a larger and lasting role in this region. And that's exactly what we've done. <p>Today, our alliances, including with Australia, are stronger than they have ever been. American exports to this region have reached record levels. We've deepened our cooperation with emerging powers and regional organizations, especially in Southeast Asia. We expanded our partnerships with citizens as they've worked to bolster their democracies. And we've shown that, whether it's a tsunami or an earthquake or a typhoon, when our friends are in need, America shows up. We are there to help. In good times and in bad, you can count on the United States of America. <p>Now, there have been times when people have been skeptical of this rebalancing. They've&mdash;they're wondering whether America has the staying power to sustain it. And it's true that in recent years, pressing events around the world demand our attention. As the world's only superpower, the United States has unique responsibilities that we gladly embrace. We're leading the international community in the fight to destroy the terrorist group ISIL. We're leading in dealing with Ebola in West Africa and in opposing Russia's aggression against Ukraine, which is a threat to the world, as we saw in the appalling shoot-down of MH17, a tragedy that took so many innocent lives, among them your fellow citizens. And as your ally and friend, America shares the grief of these Australian families, and we share the determination of your nation for justice and accountability. So yes, we have a range of responsibilities. That's the deal. It's a burden we gladly shoulder. <p>But even in each of these international efforts, some of our strongest partners are our allies and friends in this region, including Australia. So meeting these other challenges in the world is not a distraction from our engagement in this region, it reinforces our engagement in this region. Our rebalance is not only about the United States doing more in Asia, it's also about the Asia-Pacific region doing more with us around the world. <p>So I'm here today to say that American leadership in the Asia-Pacific will always be a fundamental focus of my foreign policy. It won't always make the headlines. It won't always be measured in the number of trips I make, although I do keep coming back. [<i>Laughter</i>] But day in and day out, steadily and deliberately, we will continue to deepen our engagement using every element of American power: diplomacy, military, economic, development, the power of our values and our ideals. <p>And so with the time I have left, I want to describe specifically what America intends to do in the coming years. First, the United States will continue strengthening our alliances. With Japan, we'll finalize new defense guidelines and keep realigning our forces for the future. With the Republic of Korea, we'll deepen our collaboration, including on missile defense, to deter and defend against North Korean threats. With the Philippines, we'll train and exercise more to prepare for challenges from counterterrorism and piracy to humanitarian crises and disaster relief. And here in Australia, more U.S. marines will rotate through to promote regional stability, alongside your \\"diggers.\\" <p>Although I will say when I went out to Darwin to inaugurate the new rotation of our U.S. marines there, that the mayor, I think it was, took out crocodile insurance, which disturbed me. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, I was flattered that he took out insurance on my behalf. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I did ask my Ambassador what this was all about. [<i>Laughter</i>] And he described to me how crocodiles kill more people than sharks, and there are just a lot of things in Australia that can kill you. [<i>Laughter</i>] But that's an aside. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We have an ironclad commitment to the sovereignty, independence, and security of every ally. And we'll expand cooperation between allies, because we believe we're stronger when we stand together. <p>The United States will continue to modernize our defense posture across this region. We'll deploy more of our most advanced military capabilities to keep the peace and deter aggression. Our presence will be more distributed, including in Southeast Asia with partners like Singapore. And we'll increase military training and education, including working with the military partners we have in this region around the respect for human rights by military and police. And by the end of this decade, a majority of our Navy and Air Force fleets will be based out of the Pacific, because the United States is and will always be a Pacific power. <p>And keep in mind, we do this without any territorial claims. We do this based on our belief that a region that is peaceful and prosperous is good for us, and it's good for the world. <p>The United States will continue broadening our cooperation with emerging powers and emerging economies. We intend to help Vietnam pursue economic reforms and new maritime capabilities. We'll continue to move ahead with our comprehensive partnership with Indonesia, which is a strong example of diversity and pluralism. We'll continue to expand ties with Malaysia, a growing center of entrepreneurship and innovation. And we support a greater role in the Asia-Pacific for India, which is the world's largest democracy. <p>The United States will continue expanding our engagement with regional institutions, because together, we can meet shared challenges, from preventing the horror of human trafficking to countering violent extremism, to stemming the flow of foreign terrorist fighters. Together, we can improve maritime security, upholding the freedom of navigation and encouraging territorial disputes are resolved peacefully. We'll work with partners to develop the East Asia Summit into the region's leading forum for addressing political and security challenges. And we'll support ASEAN's effort to reach a code of conduct with China that reinforces international law in the South China Sea. <p>And speaking of China, the United States will continue to pursue a constructive relationship with China. By virtue of its size and its remarkable growth, China will inevitably play a critical role in the future of this region. And the question is, what kind of role will it play? I just came from Beijing, and as I said there, the United States welcomes the continuing rise of a China that is peaceful and prosperous and stable and that plays a responsible role in world affairs. It is a remarkable achievement that millions of people have been lifted out of poverty in China because of the extraordinary growth rates that they've experienced. That is a good thing. We should want and welcome that kind of development. <p>And if in fact China is playing the role of a responsible actor that is peaceful and prosperous and stable, that is good for this region, it's good for the world, it's good for the United States. So we'll pursue cooperation with China where our interests overlap or align. And there are significant areas of overlap: more trade and investment, more communications between our militaries to prevent misunderstandings or possible conflict, more travel and exchanges between our people, and more cooperation on global challenges, from Ebola to climate change. <p>But in this engagement, we are also encouraging China to adhere to the same rules as other nations, whether in trade or on the seas. And in this engagement, we will continue to be frank about where there are differences, because America will continue to stand up for our interests and principles, including our unwavering support for the fundamental human rights of all people. <p>We do not benefit from a relationship with China or any other country in which we put our values and our ideals aside. And for the young people here, practicality is a good thing. There are times where compromise is necessary. That's part of wisdom. But it's also important to hang on to what you believe, to know what you believe and then be willing to stand up for it. And what's true for individuals is also true for countries. <p>The United States will continue to promote economic growth that is sustained and shared. So we're going to work with APEC to tear down barriers to trade and investment and combat the corruption that steals from so many citizens. We'll keep opposing special preferences for state-owned companies. We'll oppose cybertheft of trade secrets. We'll work with partners to invest in the region's infrastructure in a way that's open and transparent. And we'll support reforms that help economies transition to models that boost domestic demand and invest in people and their education and their skills. <p>We'll keep leading the effort to realize the Trans-Pacific Partnership to lower barriers, open markets, export goods, and create good jobs for our people. But with the 12 countries of the TPP making up nearly 40 percent of the global economy, this is also about something bigger. It is our chance to put in place new, high standards for trade in the 21st century that uphold our values. So, for example, we are pushing new standards in this trade agreement, requiring countries that participate to protect their workers better and to protect the environment better and protect intellectual property that unleashes innovation and meet baseline standards to ensure transparency of&mdash;and rule of law. It's about a future where instead of being dependent on a single market, countries integrate their economies so they're innovating and growing together. That's what TPP does. That's why it would be a historic achievement. That's why I believe so strongly that we need to get it done, and not just for our countries, but for the world. <p>But that's also why it's hard, because we're asking all these countries at various stages of development to up their game. And it requires big transitions for a lot of these countries, including for the United States. And TPP is just one part of our overall focus on growing the global economy. That's what the G-20 meetings are all about. <p>Over the last few years, the United States has put more people back to work than all other advanced economies combined. But America can't be expected to just carry the world economy on our back. So here in Brisbane, the G-20 has a responsibility to act: to boost demand and invest more in infrastructure and create good jobs for the people of all our nations. <p>As we develop, as we focus on our economy, we cannot forget the need to lead on the global fight against climate change. Now, I know that's&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;I know there's been a healthy debate in this country about it. [<i>Laughter</i>] Here in the Asia-Pacific, nobody has more at stake when it comes to thinking about and then acting on climate change. <p>Here, a climate that increases in temperature will mean more extreme and frequent storms, more flooding, rising seas that submerge Pacific islands. Here in Australia, it means longer droughts, more wildfires. The incredible natural glory of the Great Barrier Reef is threatened. Worldwide, this past summer was the hottest on record. No nation is immune, and every nation has a responsibility to do its part. <p>And you'll recall at the beginning, I said the United States and Australia has a lot in common. Well, one of the things we have in common is, we produce a lot of carbon. Part of it is this legacy of wide-open spaces and the frontier mentality and this incredible abundance of resources. And so, historically, we have not been the most energy efficient of nations, which means we've got to step up. <p>In the United States, our carbon pollution is near its lowest levels in almost two decades. I'm very proud of that. Under my climate action plan, we intend to do more. In Beijing, I announced our ambitious new goal: reducing our net greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by the year 2025, which will double the pace at which we're reducing carbon pollution in the United States. Now, in a historic step, China made its own commitment, for the first time, agreeing to slow, peak, and then reverse the course of China's carbon emissions. And the reason that's so important is because if China, as it develops, adapts the same per capita carbon emissions as advanced economies like the United States or Australia, this planet doesn't stand a chance, because they've got a lot more people. <p>So them setting up a target sends a powerful message to the world that all countries&mdash;whether you are a developed country, a developing country, or somewhere in between&mdash;you've got to be able to overcome old divides, look squarely at the science, and reach a strong global climate agreement next year. And if China and the United States can agree on this, then the world can agree on this. We can get this done. And it is necessary for us to get it done. Because I have not had time to go to the Great Barrier Reef&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and I want to come back, and I want my daughters to be able to come back, and I want them to be able to bring their daughters or sons to visit. And I want that there 50 years from now. Now, today I'm announcing that the United States will take another important step. We are going to contribute $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund so we can help developing nations deal with climate change. So along with the other nations that have pledged support, this gives us the opportunity to help vulnerable communities with an early warning system, with stronger defenses against storm surge, climate-resilient infrastructure. It allows us to help farmers plant more durable crops. And it allows us to help developing countries break out of this false choice between development and pollution; let them leapfrog some of the dirty industries that powered our development, go straight to a clean energy economy that allows them to grow, create jobs, and at the same time, reduce their carbon pollution. <p>So we've very proud of the work that we have already done. We are mindful of the great work that still has to be done on this issue. But let me say, particularly again to the young people here: Combating climate change cannot be the work of governments alone. Citizens, especially the next generation, you have to keep raising your voices, because you deserve to live your lives in a world that is cleaner and that is healthier and that is sustainable. But that is not going to happen unless you are heard. <p>It is in the nature of things, it is in the nature of the world that those of us who start getting gray hair are a little set in our ways, that interests are entrenched, not because people are bad people, it's just that's how we've been doing things. And we make investments, and companies start depending on certain energy sources, and change is uncomfortable and difficult. And that's why it's so important for the next generation to be able to step in and say, no, it doesn't have to be this way. You have the power to imagine a new future in a way that some of the older folks don't always have. <p>And the same is true when it comes to issues of democracy and human rights. There are times where when we speak out on these issues we are told that democracy is just a Western value. I fundamentally disagree with that. Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, they have built thriving democracies. Filipinos showed us the strength of people power. Indonesians just voted in a historic election. I just came from Burma; this is a place that for 40 years was under the grip of a military junta, one of the most closed and oppressive nations on Earth. And there, I was inspired by citizens and civil society and Parliamentarians who are now working to sustain a transition to a democratic future. I had a town hall meeting with young people like you, in which they were asking, what does it mean to create rule of law? And how should we deal with ethnic diversity in our city? You could feel the excitement. What does a free press look like, and how does it operate? And how do we make sure that journalism is responsible? And this incredible ferment and debate that's taking place. <p>Those young people, they want the same things that you do. The notion that somehow, they're less interested in opportunity or less interested in avoiding arbitrary arrest or less interested in being censored is fundamentally untrue. Today, people in Hong Kong are speaking out for their universal rights. <p>And so here in Asia and around the world, America supports free and fair elections, because citizens must be free to choose their own leaders, as in Thailand, where we are urging a quick return to inclusive, civilian rule. We support freedom of assembly and freedom of speech and freedom of the press, a free and open Internet, strong civil societies, because the voices of people must be heard and leaders must be held accountable, even though it's uncomfortable sometimes. I promise you, if you lead a country, there are times where you are aggravated with people voicing opinions that seem to think you're doing something wrong. [<i>Laughter</i>] You'd prefer everybody just praise you. I understand. [<i>Laughter</i>] But that's not how societies move forward. <p>We support strong institutions and independent judiciaries and open government, because the rule of force must give way to the rule of law. <p>And in that same fashion, the United States will continue to stand up for the inherent dignity of every human being. Now, dignity begins with the most basic of needs: a life free of hunger and disease and want. So yes, we'll speak out on behalf of human rights, but we are also going to invest in the agriculture that allows farmers to feed their families and boost their incomes. We'll invest in the development that promotes growth and helps end the injustice of extreme poverty in places like the Lower Mekong Delta. We intend to partner with all the countries in the region to create stronger public health systems and new treatments that save lives and realize our goals of being the first AIDS-free generation. <p>And what we've learned from the Ebola outbreak is that in this globalized world, where the Pacific is like a lake, if countries are so poor that they can't afford basic public health infrastructure, that threatens our health. We cannot build a moat around our countries, and we shouldn't try. What we should be doing is making sure everybody has some basic public health systems that allow for early warning when outbreaks of infectious disease may occur. That's not just out of charity. It is in our self-interest. <p>And again, I want to speak to young people about this. When we talk about these issues of development, when we invest in the well-being of people on the other side of the globe, when we stand up for freedom, including occasionally having to engage in military actions, we don't do that just because we are charitable. We do that because we recognize that we are linked and that if somebody, some child is stricken with a curable disease on the other side of the world, at same point, that could have an impact on our child. <p>We'll advance human dignity by standing up for the rights of minorities, because no one's equality should ever be denied. We will stand up for freedom of religion&mdash;the right of every person to practice their faith as they choose&mdash;because we are all children of God and we are all fallible. And the notion that we, as a majority, or the state, should tell somebody else what to believe with respect to their faith is against our basic values. <p>We will stand up for our gay and lesbian fellow citizens, because they need to be treated equally under the law. We will stand up for the rights and futures of our wives and daughters and partners, because I believe that the best measure of whether a nation is going to be successful is whether they are tapping the talents of their women and treating them as full participants in politics and society and the economy. <p>And we're going to continue to invest in the future of this region, and that means you, this region's youth&mdash;all of you&mdash;your optimism, your idealism, your hopes. I see it everywhere I go. I spend a lot of time with young people. I spend a lot of time with old people too. But I prefer spending time with young people. [<i>Laughter</i>] I meet them in Tokyo and Seoul and Manila and Jakarta. It's the spirit of young men and women in Kuala Lumpur and Rangoon, who are participating in our Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative. And like you, they're ready to lead. <p>To the young woman with an idea who dreams of starting her own business&mdash;if she just had a network, if she just had the capital&mdash;America wants to be her partner, because we believe in the entrepreneur that you can be, the innovations you can spark, and the jobs you can create. And when you succeed, we'll all be more prosperous. To the young man who's working late in a clinic, tending to a patient, who dreams not just of treating diseases, but preventing them&mdash;\\"If I just had the resources, if I just had the support\\"&mdash;we want to be your partner, because we believe in the advocate that you can be and in the families you can reach and the lives you can save. And when you succeed, our world will be better. <p>To the young woman tired of the tensions in her community, who dreams of helping her neighbors see beyond differences&mdash;if she could just start a dialogue, if she knew how others had walked the same path&mdash;well, America wants to be your partner, because we believe in the activist that you can be and the empathy that you can build and the understanding you can foster between people. And when you succeed, our world will be a little more peaceful. <p>And to the young man who believes his voice isn't being heard, who dreams of bringing people like him together across his country&mdash;if he just knew how to organize and mobilize them&mdash;we want to be your partner, because we believe in the leaders that you can be, in the difference you can make to ignite positive change. And when you succeed, the world will be a little more free. <p>So that's the future we can build together. That's the commitment America is making in the Asia-Pacific. It's a partnership not just with nations, but with people, with you, for decades to come, bound by the values we share, guided by the vision we seek. I am absolutely confident we can advance the security and the prosperity and the dignity of people across this region. And in pursuit of that future, you will have no greater friend than the United States of America. <p>So thank you very much. God bless Australia. God bless America. God bless our great alliance. Thank you.\" "
"254" "\"Hi, everybody. Over the past year, more than 10 million Americans have gained the financial security and peace of mind that comes with health insurance. More than 7 million people enrolled in affordable coverage by visiting healthcare.gov or going to the marketplace in their State. On average, they're paying just $82 a month for coverage. For a lot of people, that's less than a cell phone bill or a cable bill. Insurance companies can no longer deny you coverage just because you have a preexisting condition, and they now have to cover free preventive care like checkups and mammograms. <p>If you missed your chance to get covered last year, here's the good news. Starting November 15, today, you can go online or call 1-800-318-2596 and get covered for 2015. And we've spent the last year improving and upgrading healthcare.gov to make it faster and easier to use. <p>If you already buy insurance through the online marketplace, now is the time to take a look at some of the new options for next year. You might be able to save more money or find a plan that fits your family's needs even better than the one you've got now. If you haven't signed up for insurance yet, this is your chance. Odds are, you'll qualify for tax credits to help you afford it. <p>But this window won't stay open forever. You only have 3 months to shop for plans, so it's worth starting right away. And it might make a big difference for your family's bottom line. <p>Last year, I got an e-mail from a woman named Amy Williams, in Augusta, Georgia. She and her husband are self-employed in the trucking business. For years, they paid about $1,200 a month for their health insurance. Then, they checked out healthcare.gov. They found a plan with coverage they liked, and it was way less expensive. She says that they've saved around $13,000 on their premiums this year alone. <p>Stories like Amy's are why we fought so hard to pass the Affordable Care Act: to help more families breathe a little easier. In part because this law is working, health care prices have grown at their slowest rate in nearly 50 years. And this year, insurance premiums for families who are covered through an employer grew at a rate tied for the lowest on record. <p>So spread the word. Tell your friends and family members to get covered. Talk to folks in your church or your classroom. Tell them to take a few minutes to check out healthcare.gov or cuidadodesalud.gov or call 1-800-318-2596. It can make a big difference in their lives. Let them know that it's easy, it's affordable, and that they have just 3 months, starting today, November 15, to sign up. Together, we can make sure that even more of America gets covered in the year ahead. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"255" "\"<i>Terrorist Attack in Jerusalem, Israel </i><p>Well, I've got my team here to talk about Ebola. But before I do, I want to just make mention of the horrific attacks that took place in Jerusalem. <p>We know that two attackers senselessly and brutally attacked innocent worshippers in a synagogue during their morning prayers. Obviously, we condemn in the strongest terms these attacks. A number of people were wounded, and four people were killed, including three American citizens. So this is a tragedy for both nations, Israel as well as the United States. And our hearts go out to the families who obviously are undergoing enormous grief right now. <p>Secretary Kerry has spoken to Prime Minister Netanyahu. President Abbas has strongly condemned the attacks. Tragically, this is not the first loss of life that we have seen in recent months. Too many Israelis have died. Too many Palestinians have died. And at this difficult time, I think it's important for both Palestinians and Israelis to try to work together to lower tensions and to reject violence. <p>The murderers for today's outrageous acts represent the kind of extremism that threatens to bring all of the Middle East into the kind of spiral from which it's very difficult to emerge. And we know how this violence can get worse over time. But we have to remind ourselves that the majority of Palestinians and Israelis overwhelmingly want peace and to be able to raise their families, knowing they're safe and secure. The United States wants to work with all parties involved to make that a reality and to isolate the kinds of extremists that are bringing about this terrible carnage. <p><i>Ebola </i><p>I now want to turn to the topic of this meeting, the Ebola situation. Obviously, some of the attention on the crisis has ebbed over the last several weeks, but the challenges remain. We have seen most recently Dr. Martin Salia, a surgeon who contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone. He was flown back to the United States, to the Nebraska facility, to try to get treated. Unfortunately, he was already in critical condition and, sadly, passed away early Monday morning. So our thoughts and prayers are with his family's. <p>Beyond this tragedy, though, we've established that when Ebola is promptly diagnosed and treated, then we have a great chance of curing it. Of the eight patients who were treated promptly in the United States, all eight have recovered. They are Ebola free, and they are back with their families. <p>And after the first incident of Ebola with&mdash;in Dallas and the unfortunate passing of Mr. Duncan, we promptly acted based on some of the lessons that were learned from Dallas. We've put in place new protocols for protective gear for our health workers. We ramped up our training and outreach for health workers. We've added screening for travelers to the United States. We're funneling all these passengers into five airports. And we put in place rules for public health workers to monitor travelers for 21 days after they arrive here. As we saw in New York with Dr. Craig Spencer, one of the courageous health workers who has voluntarily traveled to the region to try to fight this disease, our efforts to identify, isolate, and then treat Ebola patients can work. America has proven that it can handle the isolated cases that may occur here. <p>But as long as the outbreak continues to rage in the three countries in West Africa&mdash;Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea&mdash;this is still going to be a danger, not just for America, but for the entire world. <p>We are nowhere near out of the woods yet in West Africa. The good news is, in parts of Liberia, our efforts, both civilian and military, are really paying dividends. And we are seeing the curve bending, so that we are on track&mdash;with diligence, dealing with the hotspots that may still reemerge&mdash;to actually get a handle on that disease. <p>We're still seeing an increase of cases in Sierra Leone, although our British counterparts are doing an excellent job working with us and the international community to coordinate the situation there. In Guinea, the numbers are lower than in Sierra Leone or Liberia, but they're often in very remote areas that are hard to reach, and some of the international coordination still needs to improve. <p>The bottom line, though, is that we know how to treat this disease, given that it has emerged as such a large, significant outbreak in these areas&mdash;and we recently saw some cases in Mali. It underscores how important it is to continue to push forward until we stamp out this disease entirely in that region. Until we do, there are threats of additional outbreaks. And given the nature of international travel, it means that everybody has some measure of risk. <p>Here at home, we've made great progress in preparing our health care system to deal with any possible threat. Our scientists continue to make progress with vaccines and treatments, but we've got plenty of work to do. <p>So all of this means that, although we should feel optimistic about our capacity to solve the Ebola crisis, we cannot be complacent simply because the news attention on it has waned. We have to stay with it. And that's why I'm calling Congress to make sure that it approves before it leaves the emergency funding request that we put forward to respond to Ebola, both domestically and internationally. <p>The funding is going to help us strengthen our domestic health systems so that we can respond to any future cases that may arise in the United States, wherever they might happen. It's going to devote much-needed resources to sustain our efforts in West Africa. It will accelerate the testing and approval of Ebola vaccines and treatments. And it's going to help vulnerable countries to, in the future, prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks of various communicable diseases before they become epidemics. <p>And that, ultimately, is good for our public health. The more we can catch these things early where they begin, the less risks we have over the long term. And as I've said before, in some ways, we are lucky Ebola is a very difficult disease to transmit. If we have a comparably lethal disease that is airborne, we have much bigger problems. So this gives us an opportunity to start putting in place the kind of public health detection infrastructure around the globe that is necessary should additional pandemics or epidemics or outbreaks arise. <p>All this makes it necessary for Congress to act. This is not a Democratic issue. It is not a Republican issue. This is a basic issue of the health and safety of the American people. And so I hope that Congress is on the case on this issue before they leave. All right? Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"256" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you, everybody. Everybody, have a seat. Well, thank you, Alberto, for that introduction and, more importantly, for your outstanding leadership of the Miami-Dade public schools. I thank all of you for joining us. We are here to take another step toward making sure that all of our kids get the education that they need in the 21st century. <p>And it's great to welcome so many committed educators to the White House. If you need, by the way, a note to excuse your absence&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;let me know. [<i>Laughter</i>] You're all kind playing hooky today. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We've got superintendents here from more than a hundred school districts, as close as just across the river in Arlington, to across the continent in Alaska. And we are joining a lot of folks over the Internet as well. In a few minutes, all of you are going to sign a pledge to make sure that your districts are doing what it takes to be ready for the future. And we've also got some people here who share your commitment to education, including Members of Congress and our Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan. Where is Arne Duncan? Where is he? He's gone! [<i>Laughter</i>] He's playing hooky too! [<i>Laughter</i>] No, I think&mdash;I'm sure he's got some very important things&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. Yes. Poor Arne, he's being called out right now. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Look, as President, every decision I make is aimed at one goal, and that is to restore opportunity for everybody who's willing to work hard in our society. Six years after the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes, our businesses have added over 10.6 million new jobs during the course of 56 months. For the first time in more than 6 years, the unemployment rate is below 6 percent. And we've made gains in education, thanks to the hard work of school leaders like you. Dropout rates are down. The graduation rate is the highest on record. More young people are earning college degrees than ever before. <p>But in a 21st-century economy where the most valuable skill you can sell is knowledge&mdash;and the capacity to learn new knowledge&mdash;we've got to do more to offer our children a world-class education. We've got to make high-quality pre-K available to every child so that they get the benefit of early enrichment and they come to school prepared. We have to encourage more young people&mdash;especially young women and minority students&mdash;to study in the fields of the future, like math, technology, engineering, science. We need to keep working to redesign our high schools to offer more hands-on learning opportunities that can lead directly to jobs and careers and can engage students in different ways based on their interests and their learning styles. <p>We need teachers who know how to make learning come alive, with personalized instruction and project-based learning. And we've got to do more to make sure that our teachers are supported and receive the kind of professional training and best practices&mdash;and I personally think higher pay&mdash;that's going to encourage the best and the brightest continue to be in the field. We've got to make sure that no striving young person is priced out of a college education. <p>These are all critical ingredients to our effort at continuous improvement in education. And one of the things that we also need to do is to yank our schools into the 21st century when it comes to technology and providing the tools and training that teachers need to use that technology to prepare all of our students for the competition that they're going to face globally. <p>Other countries are doing this. They are trying to outeducate us today so that they can outcompete us tomorrow. South Korea is replacing all of its textbooks with digital content and training all of its teachers to use technology in the classroom. Singapore is equipping every school with broadband that's over 40 times faster than the connection in the average American home. So we're going to have to step up our game if we're going to make sure that every child in America can go as far as their dreams and talents will take them. <p>And that's why, last year, I launched an initiative called ConnectED. It's a 5-year plan to close the technology gap in our schools and connect 99 percent of Americans&mdash;students to high-speed Internet. <p>And this is why it's important. Right now fewer than 40 percent of public schools have high-speed Internet in their classrooms, less than half. That's not good, since we invented the Internet. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's not good. [<i>Laughter</i>] It means that in most American schools, teachers cannot use the cutting-edge software and programs that are available today. They literally don't have the bandwidth. And even in schools where there is high-speed Internet, so often, there aren't enough computers to go around, so only a small percentage of our classrooms have the 1-to-1 ratio of students to computers or tablets. And that means that, in too many schools, if a teacher wants to use the Internet for a lesson, then kids have to crowd around one desk to follow along or they have to break up into groups and sequentially come in. <p>Now, I've said before, in a country where we expect free Wi-Fi with our coffee&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;the least we can do is expect that our schools are properly wired. And when many of us can't go even an hour&mdash;my staff, it's like every 2 minutes&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;without reaching for a tablet or a smartphone, we've got to make sure these devices are within reach of our students. Because outside of school, they're certainly understanding how to use technology. That's where they're living. And if we aren't incorporating that into how they are learning in the classroom, then we're not doing our job. We've got to bring the world to every child's fingertips, because they're already more technologically savvy than we are, but if they think that the school is 20, 30 years behind, then they're going to lose interest in school. <p>So earlier this year, I announced new steps toward making the vision of ConnectED a reality. The FCC decided to double its investment in broadband for schools, investing an additional $2 billion over 2 years. That's a step that will connect more than 15,000 schools and 20 million students to high-speed Internet. And that investment will help some of the school districts represented in this room. Then, just this week, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler unveiled his plan to help us finish the job and reach our ultimate goal of connecting 99 percent of students within five years. <p>But as I've said from the day that we launched this initiative, this is not just a role for government or the Federal Government. We also asked some of America's foremost tech companies to help bring our schools into the 21st century. And their response has been inspiring. So far, 10 companies have made commitments totaling more than $2 billion. So Apple, for example, has pledged $100 million, which is going to 114 schools across 29 States. Students will get iPads. Teachers will get McBooks&mdash;or MacBooks, depending on how you say it. [<i>Laughter</i>] Classrooms will get Apple TV. <p>And that's just one of many commitments. Students are using software from Adobe to design new animal species, software from Autodesk to create fuel-efficient cars. Teachers are using presentation software from Prezi to help kids understand how solar systems work. Other companies are providing hundreds of millions of dollars in software, eBooks, teacher training. And 100,000 high-need students will receive free wireless service. For students who spend hours on the bus every day, that means that they're going to be able to keep working while they're commuting, in between texting their friends, of course. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Schools in all 50 States are already taking advantage of these commitments. And you can find out how your school district could benefit at whitehouse.gov/connectED. <p>So today I'm proud to announce that two companies that provide online courses are getting on board. EdX has already offered its Advanced Placement-level courses for free. Now it's making the certification for those courses free as well. So if you're a student who's mastered the material, but can't afford the certification that proves it, EdX will provide it. They're offering more than a dozen training courses to teachers nationwide for free. <p>And for the next year, the company Coursera will offer free credentials for district-approved professional development courses to any teacher, anywhere in the country. Because all the wireless devices and fancy software in the world won't make a difference unless we have great teachers in the classroom. <p>And early on, when I was still in Chicago, as a senator, and I got interested in this issue, sometimes, you'd walk in the classroom, there would be brand new computers, but the students who were sitting at the computers, all they were doing were doing&mdash;the same problem sets that they were getting on mimeograph or Xerox before&mdash;now they were doing on the computer screen. There was no sense of how to use the tool in a powerful way. And that's why we very much appreciate the offerings by these companies, understanding that we want to make this as accessible as possible. <p>So the&mdash;closing the technology gap is going to take more than fiber-optic cable, it's going to take more than portable hotspots and wireless projectors. It will take more than policymakers in Washington or even Silicon Valley CEOs. It's going to take teachers, principals, superintendents who get it, who understand the power of these tools when used creatively and who are willing to make changes and push reforms and test new ideas. And we want to help you do that. <p>So today we're making two new tools available. First, because we know a lot of school districts aren't sure what digital infrastructure to invest in or how to pay for it or what they'll get out of it, we've put together an infrastructure guide to help you make the best decisions based on your resources and needs. <p>Second, we've created a \\"learning toolkit\\" with goals and checklists for teachers and principals so they can turn these tools into better outcomes for students. And this is all based on best practices that have been collated from around the country. And over the next year, my administration will convene 12 regional summits for superintendents and principals nationwide to help more districts get ready for the future. <p>So you've got the resources. We've got some of the money coming out of ConnectED. We've got the companies participating. Now we're going to work with you on a regional basis, State by State so that we can start stitching all this together to actually deliver to kids in the classroom. <p>Now, a lot of you are already doing this. So Karen Tarasevich&mdash;where is Karen? There she is. I'm glad she wasn't with Arne somewhere playing hooky. [<i>Laughter</i>] Karen is the superintendent in the West Warwick Public Schools in Rhode Island. It's a city with higher than average unemployment, and a lot of students' families don't have computers at home. So they came up with a \\"one-to-one\\" initiative to help solve both problems. Every student gets a laptop to use at home and at school. And parents are encouraged to use the laptops, too, to take online job training courses. So there's a booth set up at every parents' night where moms and dads can sign up. <p>And then you've got Mary Wegner, superintendent of the Sitka, Alaska, School District. Where is Mary? She came a long way. There she is. Yes, give her a hand for coming from Alaska. I was wondering why it was so cold today. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, this is a remote place. You can only get to Sitka by plane or by boat. <p>So how many transfers did you have to make to finally get here? <p><i>Sitka School District Superintendent Mary Wegner.</i> Three. <p><i>The President.</i> Three. That's not bad. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So, 6 years ago, the technology in the schools was so outdated, only a few people could even print documents, and logging on to the Internet could take 20 minutes. Today, with the help of the Recovery Act, the whole district has Wi-Fi. The ratio of computers to students is 4 to 1 and falling. Kids are Skyping in class with experts from all over the world on a whole range of subjects. And Sitka is now in the top tier of districts in the State. It's been transformative. <p>Darryl Adams is the superintendent of the Coachella Valley Unified School District in California. Where is he? There you go. Good to see you. One of the poorest school districts in the country. And a few years ago, Coachella started providing every student from pre-K to high school with a tablet of their own. Is that one of them that you&mdash;yes? [<i>Laughter</i>] You didn't take that from a student, did you? [<i>Laughter</i>] Okay. <p>They paid for it through a bond measure, which voters overwhelmingly approved. So the whole community is committed to their children's education. Many students still don't have Internet access at home, but the district found a solution for that too. They're putting Wi-Fi routers on school buses and parking them across the district every night. This is really smart, right? So you've got underutilized resources&mdash;buses in the evening&mdash;you put the routers on, disperse them, and suddenly, everybody is connected. Now it's not just students who can get online, it's their families as well. <p>So I know a lot of superintendents have stories like these. You've found innovative ways to reach your students and improve your schools. And today, the best news of all is you're taking the next step&mdash;along with 1,200 other superintendents nationwide&mdash;by signing the \\"Future Ready District Pledge.\\" Don't sign yet. [<i>Laughter</i>] Because we're all going to do it together, and it will be fun. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So it's a vision for digital learning in classrooms across America: helping schools and families make the leap to high-speed Internet, supporting teachers and principals who use technology in innovative ways, and helping every student gain access to digital devices and high-quality digital content. And it's a promise to help other school districts do the same. That's key. This can't stop with you. Every kid needs every superintendent in America to sign this pledge and then follow through on the pledge. Our kids need every school district to make these commitments. Every child&mdash;whether they live in a big city, quiet suburb, the furthest reaches of rural America, poor districts, rich districts&mdash;every child deserves a shot at a world-class education. That's the promise we make as a nation. That's what makes our Nation great: this fundamental belief that no matter who you are, where you come from, what you look like, you can make it in this country if you work hard. You have access to the tools to achieve. If we keep working at this, that's a promise we can make real for this generation and generations to come. <p>All right. So with that, I think all the superintendents are ready to sign this pledge for our kids. Everybody, get your tablets out. You ready? All right, go at it. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>At this point, school superintendents in the audience signed the \\"Future Ready District Pledge\\" on tablet computers.</i>] <p>You're being tested. [<i>Laughter</i>] All right. You've got 10 more seconds. I see some people lagging behind. [<i>Laughter</i>] All right, time. [<i>Laughter</i>] Everybody get it? <p><i>Audience members.</i> Yes. <p><i>The President.</i> Okay. If you didn't, if you're still figuring it out&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I won't tell. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But let me just close by saying this. I&mdash;we're so inundated, I think, with news of mayhem and mishap and war and disease. I think sometimes we forget how much good work is just being done day in and day out by a lot of good people who just care about their kids, care about their communities. In your districts, I know there are just extraordinary teachers and principals who are putting everything they've got into making sure our kids are getting a great education. And you've got parents who are stepping up and volunteering and helping to make those schools work. So as you disperse, one message I want you to deliver to all of them from the White House, from the President of the United States, is even if you're not getting a lot of attention, even if you're not making a lot of headlines, what you're doing every single day is making the biggest possible difference in the life of this country. And I couldn't be prouder of you. All right? <p>Thank you, everybody.\" "
"257" "\"<i>The President.</i> Well, as many of you know, one of my top priorities is making sure that we've got affordable, high-quality childcare and early childhood education for our young people across the country. Today I am pleased to sign a bill into law that will&mdash;is going to bring us closer to that goal. That's the reauthorization of the Child Care and Development Block Grant program. I want to thank bipartisan Members of Congress who are here today. <p>This law is going to do several important things. It's going to improve the quality of child care by requiring more training for caregivers and more enrichment for children. It's going to improve child safety by instituting background checks for staff and better inspection of facilities. It's going to give working parents a little more peace of mind. If you receive subsidies to pay for your childcare, you know that if you get a raise on your job or you find a job, your kids aren't automatically losing their care because your status has changed midstream. <p>I first proposed legislation to accomplish some of these goals back in 2010. When we couldn't get it through Congress, we began a rulemaking process to try to do this through executive efforts, and Sylvia Burwell, the HHS Secretary, is here. Because the legislation has now passed, we are actually ending the rulemaking process because we've now got a law, and we're going to be able to focus on implementing the law. <p>And I want to thank all the legislators here. It's a good step forward. It shows that Democrats and Republicans, when it comes to making sure our kids are getting the best possible education, are united. And that's good for our kids, and that's good for our country. <p>So with that, I'm going to make sure that I sign this properly, using all these pens. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>[<i>At this point, the President began signing the bill.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> I love signing bills. I'd like doing it more often. [<i>Laughter</i>] What do you say, guys? [<i>Laughter</i>] Yeah, it's good. <p>[<i>The President continued signing the bill.</i>] <p><i>Senator Thomas R. Harkin.</i> Well, I would note for the record that this is the 21st bill from the Committee that Lamar and I chair and have ranking membership on&mdash;21st bill that you've signed into law in the last 2 years. <p><i>The President.</i> Well, the&mdash;that's because you and Lamar are some pretty productive legislators who actually are focused on getting stuff done. And we're very proud of you, and we're proud of all the legislators who are here today. So congratulations, everybody. Good. Good job. [<i>Applause</i>] Great job, guys.\" "
"258" "\"My fellow Americans, tonight I'd like to talk with you about immigration. <p>For more than 200 years, our tradition of welcoming immigrants from around the world has given us a tremendous advantage over other nations. It's kept us youthful, dynamic, and entrepreneurial. It has shaped our character as a people with limitless possibilities, people not trapped by our past, but able to remake ourselves as we choose. But today, our immigration system is broken, and everybody knows it. <p>Families who enter our country the right way and play by the rules watch others flout the rules. Business owners who offer their workers good wages and benefits see the competition exploit undocumented immigrants by paying them far less. All of us take offense to anyone who reaps the rewards of living in America without taking on the responsibilities of living in America. And undocumented immigrants who desperately want to embrace those responsibilities see little option but to remain in the shadows or risk their families being torn apart. It's been this way for decades. And for decades, we haven't done much about it. <p>When I took office, I committed to fixing this broken immigration system. And I began by doing what I could to secure our borders. Today, we have more agents and technology deployed to secure our southern border than at any time in our history. And over the past 6 years, illegal border crossings have been cut by more than half. Although this summer there was a brief spike in unaccompanied children being apprehended at our border, the number of such children is now actually lower than it's been in nearly 2 years. Overall, the number of people trying to cross our border illegally is at its lowest level since the 1970s. Those are the facts. <p>Meanwhile, I worked with Congress on a comprehensive fix, and last year, 68 Democrats, Republicans, and Independents came together to pass a bipartisan bill in the Senate. It wasn't perfect. It was a compromise. But it reflected common sense. It would have doubled the number of border patrol agents while giving undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship if they paid a fine, started paying their taxes, and went to the back of the line. And independent experts said that it would help grow our economy and shrink our deficits. <p>Had the House of Representatives allowed that kind of bill a simple yes-or-no vote it would have passed with support from both parties, and today, it would be the law. But for a year and a half now, Republican leaders in the House have refused to allow that simple vote. <p>Now, I continue to believe that the best way to solve this problem is by working together to pass that kind of commonsense law. But until that happens, there are actions I have the legal authority to take as President&mdash;the same kinds of actions taken by Democratic and Republican Presidents before me&mdash;that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just. <p>Tonight I am announcing those actions. First, we'll build on our progress at the border with additional resources for our law enforcement personnel so that they can stem the flow of illegal crossings and speed the return of those who do cross over. Second, I'll make it easier and faster for high-skilled immigrants, graduates, and entrepreneurs to stay and contribute to our economy, as so many business leaders have proposed. Third, we'll take steps to deal responsibly with the millions of undocumented immigrants who already live in our country. I want to say more about this third issue, because it generates the most passion and controversy. Even as we are a nation of immigrants, we're also a nation of laws. Undocumented workers broke our immigration laws, and I believe that they must be held accountable, especially those who may be dangerous. That's why, over the past 6 years, deportations of criminals are up 80 percent. And that's why we're going to keep focusing enforcement resources on actual threats to our security: felons, not families; criminals, not children; gang members, not a mom who's working hard to provide for her kids. We'll prioritize, just like law enforcement does every day. <p>But even as we focus on deporting criminals, the fact is, millions of immigrants in every State, of every race and nationality, still live here illegally. And let's be honest: Tracking down, rounding up, and deporting millions of people isn't realistic. Anyone who suggests otherwise isn't being straight with you. It's also not who we are as Americans. After all, most of these immigrants have been here a long time. They work hard, often in tough, low-paying jobs. They support their families. They worship at our churches. Many of their kids are American-born or spent most of their lives here, and their hopes, dreams, and patriotism are just like ours. As my predecessor President Bush once put it, \\"They are a part of American life.\\" <p>Now, here's the thing: We expect people who live in this country to play by the rules. We expect that those who cut the line will not be unfairly rewarded. So we're going to offer the following deal: If you've been in America for more than 5 years; if you have children who are American citizens or legal residents; if you register, pass a criminal background check, and you're willing to pay your fair share of taxes, you'll be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily without fear of deportation. You can come out of the shadows and get right with the law. That's what this deal is. <p>Now, let's be clear about what it isn't. This deal does not apply to anyone who has come to this country recently. It does not apply to anyone who might come to America illegally in the future. It does not grant citizenship or the right to stay here permanently or offer the same benefits that citizens receive. Only Congress can do that. All we're saying is, we're not going to deport you. <p>I know some of the critics of this action call it amnesty. Well, it's not. Amnesty is the immigration system we have today: millions of people who live here without paying their taxes or playing by the rules, while politicians use the issue to scare people and whip up votes at election time. <p>That's the real amnesty: leaving this broken system the way it is. Mass amnesty would be unfair. Mass deportation would be both impossible and contrary to our character. What I'm describing is accountability, a commonsense, middle-ground approach: If you meet the criteria, you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law. If you're a criminal, you'll be deported. If you plan to enter the U.S. illegally, your chances of getting caught and sent back just went up. <p>The actions I'm taking are not only lawful, they're the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican President and every single Democratic President for the past half century. And to those Members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed, I have one answer: Pass a bill. <p>I want to work with both parties to pass a more permanent legislative solution. And the day I sign that bill into law, the actions I take will no longer be necessary. Meanwhile, don't let a disagreement over a single issue be a deal breaker on every issue. That's not how our democracy works, and Congress certainly shouldn't shut down our Government again just because we disagree on this. Americans are tired of gridlock. What our country needs from us right now is a common purpose, a higher purpose. <p>Most Americans support the types of reforms I've talked about tonight. But I understand the disagreements held by many of you at home. Millions of us, myself included, go back generations in this country, with ancestors who put in the painstaking work to become citizens. So we don't like the notion that anyone might get a free pass to American citizenship. <p>I know some worry, immigration will change the very fabric of who we are or take our jobs or stick it to middle class families at a time when they already feel like they've gotten the raw deal for over a decade. I hear those concerns. But that's not what these steps would do. Our history and the facts show that immigrants are a net plus for our economy and our society. And I believe it's important that all of us have this debate without impugning each other's character. <p>Because for all the back and forth of Washington, we have to remember that this debate is about something bigger. It's about who we are as a country and who we want to be for future generations. <p>Are we a nation that tolerates the hypocrisy of a system where workers who pick our fruit and make our beds never have a chance to get right with the law? Or are we a nation that gives them a chance to make amends, take responsibility, and give their kids a better future? <p>Are we a nation that accepts the cruelty of ripping children from their parents' arms? Or are we a nation that values families and works together to keep them together? <p>Are we a nation that educates the world's best and brightest in our universities, only to send them home to create businesses in countries that compete against us? Or are we a nation that encourages them to stay and create jobs here, create businesses here, create industries right here in America? <p>That's what this debate is all about. We need more than politics as usual when it comes to immigration. We need reasoned, thoughtful, compassionate debate that focuses on our hopes, not our fears. I know the politics of this issue are tough. But let me tell you why I have come to feel so strongly about it. <p>Over the past years, I have seen the determination of immigrant fathers who worked two or three jobs without taking a dime from the government and at risk any moment of losing it all, just to build a better life for their kids. I've seen the heartbreak and anxiety of children whose mothers might be taken away from them just because they didn't have the right papers. I've seen the courage of students who, except for the circumstances of their birth, are as American as Malia or Sasha, students who bravely come out as undocumented in hopes they could make a difference in the country they love. <p>These people&mdash;our neighbors, our classmates, our friends&mdash;they did not come here in search of a free ride or an easy life. They came to work and study and serve in our military and, above all, contribute to America's success. <p>Tomorrow I'll travel to Las Vegas and meet with some of these students, including a young woman named Astrid Silva. Astrid was brought to America when she was 4 years old. Her only possessions were a cross, her doll, and the frilly dress she had on. When she started school, she didn't speak any English. She caught up to other kids by reading newspapers and watching PBS, and she became a good student. Her father worked in landscaping. Her mom cleaned other people's homes. They wouldn't let Astrid apply to a technology magnet school, not because they didn't love her, but because they were afraid the paperwork would out her as an undocumented immigrant. So she applied behind their back and got in. Still, she mostly lived in the shadows, until her grandmother, who visited every year from Mexico, passed away, and she couldn't travel to the funeral without risk of being found out and deported. It was around that time she decided to begin advocating for herself and others like her, and today, Astrid Silva is a college student working on her third degree. <p>Are we a nation that kicks out a striving, hopeful immigrant like Astrid, or are we a nation that finds a way to welcome her in? Scripture tells us that we shall not oppress a stranger, for we know the heart of a stranger; we were strangers once too. <p>My fellow Americans, we are and always will be a nation of immigrants. We were strangers once too. And whether our forebears were strangers who crossed the Atlantic or the Pacific or the Rio Grande, we are here only because this country welcomed them in and taught them that to be an American is about something more than what we look like or what our last names are or how we worship. What makes us Americans is our shared commitment to an ideal: that all of us are created equal and all of us have the chance to make of our lives what we will. <p>That's the country our parents and grandparents and generations before them built for us. That's the tradition we must uphold. That's the legacy we must leave for those who are yet to come. <p>Thank you. God bless you, and God bless this country we love.\" "
"259" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you, everybody. Please, please, have a seat. Well, hello, everybody. Welcome to the White House. <p>If you've ever been in a situation where you're a little self-conscious because you feel like maybe everybody in the room is a little smarter than you&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;today you are right. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's how I'm feeling, because it&mdash;today it's my pleasure to welcome a truly extraordinary group of men and women, some of the world's greatest scientists and researchers, and I've got the extraordinary honor of presenting them with our Nation's highest honor for scientific and technological achievement, the National Medals of Science and the National Medals of Technology and Innovation. <p>Now, to join us in celebrating these innovators, I want to welcome the Members of Congress who are here with us. We also have Interior Secretary Sally Jewell. We've got my Science Adviser, John Holdren; National Science Foundation Director France Cordova; Deputy Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Michelle Lee, who&mdash;whose work helps to oversee the granting of these awards; and our National Science and Technology Medals Foundation Chair, James Rathmann. <p>Now, as many of you know, every year I host the White House Science Fair. These boys and girls are as young as 6 years old. Sometimes, their projects are a little messy. [<i>Laughter</i>] There was the cannon that fired the marshmallow into the White House wall&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and left a little mark, which is still there. <p>Earlier this year, I also hosted the first White House Maker Faire. The participants there were a little older. And I met a giant, 17-foot-tall, 2,000-pound robotic talking giraffe. [<i>Laughter</i>] We had a little chat, and that was unique. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But the boys and girls and all the makers and thinkers across the country who I welcome here are an inspiration. It's one of the favorite things that I have the pleasure of doing as President. They're often at the beginning of a lifetime of asking questions and pushing boundaries and discovering things that hadn't been discovered before and innovating in ways that transform our world. And ultimately, that's what America is about. That's one of the things that makes America exceptional: this sense that we push against limits and that we're not afraid to ask questions. And when that spirit, that sense of possibility, is truly unleashed, then you get the remarkable men and women that you see here today. <p>Their achievements span disciplines, span industries. There is a common thread, though, that runs through their stories. At a young age, an encouraging parent or captivating teacher was able to whet their appetite for the scientific process. <p>Unmatched opportunities and generous funding at American universities drew some of them here from distant shores. Because the American scientific community empowers young researchers, some of today's honorees, at a very young age, conducted their own experiments, ran their own labs, published their own findings. Our country's diversity, our&mdash;its infrastructure, its universities, and our willingness to take risks on new ideas made America the place to start new businesses and new ventures. And the results of the work of the people we honor today have transformed our world. Because of these men and women, we can use a thumb drive to store a universe of information on a postage-sized gadget, unconnected to a power source, and have the data intact a century later. <p>In fact, I've got a little gift here. [<i>Laughter</i>] Apparently, this was for my library. I was going to&mdash;I was told I could store all my documents on this thing. [<i>Laughter</i>] So I'm keeping it in my pocket. <p>We can manufacture better blood-clotting agents and water filtration systems, like those used in the aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear accident. Using breakthrough algorithms, we can model our planet's future climate and the tiny valves in our own hearts. And we can treat cancer, strokes, macular degeneration. In short, because of these innovators, our lives are healthier, our economy is stronger, our futures brighter. <p>Today's honorees are also a reminder of the power of perseverance. They achieved their most meaningful gains when they were optimistic in the face of skepticism and doubt, when they crept out onto that farthest limb, and equipped with scientific reason to believe in their own theories and because they weren't afraid to fail once in a while. They figured that eventually they'd crack open some mystery that hadn't been solved and the world would catch up. <p>So 1 month after Neil Armstrong landed on the Moon, Eli Harari came to America from Israel to study the effects of radiation on electronics in space. The physics he learned as a Ph.D. student at Princeton led him to cofound SanDisk, and eventually, to the creation and commercialization of flash storage technology. And today, his technology is in millions of portable electronic devices, which our lives would be completely different without. Certainly, Malia and Sasha's lives would be completely different without them. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>At the time he invented it, though, his technology was too early for consumer goods, and SanDisk almost went out of business. But with patience, he drove costs down, opened large-scale markets. Describing his experience in America, he said, \\"We could not have done it anywhere else in the world.\\" <p>Mary Shaw stumbled into computer science in high school, and as a college student, she walked into a busy engineering building in search of the computer lab. And she says, \\"When I first showed up, they handed me a user manual and told me to go read it, and silly me, I thought it was an invitation, so I did read it, and I came back.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>She applied to Carnegie Mellon the same year they formed a graduate degree program in computer science, and she's been there ever since, pioneering new ways to educate students in computer science and converting the emerging field into a curriculum and also textbooks used all across the Nation. <p>Douglas Lowy and John Schiller have collaborated for nearly 30 years. And together, they developed the technology that led to the vaccine to prevent the cancer-causing HPV virus. When they presented their research to drug companies, many told them that while their data looked good, a vaccine against this sexually transmitted disease just wasn't going to work. But with the help of NIH research funding, they helped create one of the most successful preventive treatments in decades, potentially saving the lives of millions of young women and girls. So the story&mdash;I'm just giving you a sample&mdash;the story of these trailblazers reflect our larger American experience: our story of constant transformation, pushing against limits. These folks represent the spirit that has always defined us, one of restless inquiry, searching for the right solution to any problem; an inclination to dream big and to tinker and to pull things apart and put them back together again; an insistence on making our dreams come true. <p>As Thomas Kailath, one of our honorees today, says, \\"Scientists are intrinsically hopeful and believe in grand answers and that if we work hard enough, we can find some of them in our lifetime.\\" And that's a good phrase: \\"intrinsically hopeful.\\" I'm intrinsically hopeful. [<i>Laughter</i>] I am. I&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. That's who I am. That's who we are as a people, as Americans, as a nation. We've had to fight to make stories like the ones here in this room not only possible, but sometimes likely. <p>Now, that can't happen when half of our Nation's high schools don't offer calculus and more than a third of our high schools don't offer physics. So that's why we're going to need more science classes on the course schedule. That's why we need teachers with math and science backgrounds, educators who can show their students how chemistry and computer science can open the door to a whole new world. <p>That's why, 5 years ago, I launched my campaign to get more kids in STEM classes and later set a goal of training a hundred thousand new STEM teachers over the course of the next decade, not just to teach, but to teach math and science. And we partnered with 200 organizations like the Carnegie Foundation in New York and AT&T to pursue that goal. Today we're announcing that our many partners will invest an additional $28 million toward increasing the number of STEM teachers in the classroom across the country. And that's worthy of applause&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;because we need to be focused on that. <p>Four years ago, we called on business leaders from America's leading companies to join us in this effort. And since then, this coalition has raised tens of millions of dollars to help strengthen many of our country's most effective STEM education programs and get them broadened out across the country. And today we can announce that over the next 2 years, this coalition will help bring these programs to an additional 1 million students across America. So this is extraordinary work. <p>Finally, part of preserving America's scientific edge is making sure we continue to welcome the best and brightest minds from around the world. So Thomas Kailath came to this country from India at the age of 22, with a research assistantship that took him to MIT and then Stanford, where he made critical contributions in information theory and statistics and mentored more than a hundred scholars along the way. <p>After he came here as a foreign student from Israel, Eli Harari cofounded SanDisk with two colleagues, one from India, another from China. Alexandre Chorin, whose accomplishments led to a sea change in the way a generations of mathematicians use computers, sums up his experience this way: \\"I came here as a foreigner on an American fellowship, received the opportunity to study at great schools and work at great universities, and have been treated as if I belonged.\\" <p>Treated as if I belonged. You do belong, because this is America and we welcome people from all around the world who have that same striving spirit. We're not defined by tribe or bloodlines. We're defined by a creed, an idea. And we want that tradition to continue. But too often, we're losing talent because, after the enormous investment we make in students and young researchers, we tell them to go home after they graduate. We tell them, take your talents and potential someplace else. <p>So part of staying competitive in a global economy is making sure that we have an immigration system that doesn't send away talent, but attracts it. We want them to initiate new discoveries and start businesses right here in the United States. So that's what I'll be talking about a little bit tonight. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's part of keeping America prosperous and keeping America strong. The&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>So I want to congratulate these extraordinary men and women for their accomplishments. I want to thank each of you for the contributions that you've made to our country and the world: your passion, your persistence, your \\"intrinsic hopefulness.\\" <p>And it is now my privilege to present the National Medals of Science and the National Medals of Technology and Innovation. <p>So we're going to read some citations here. <p>[<i>At this point, Lt. Cmdr. Timothy J. Myers, USN, Navy Aide to the President, read the citations and the President presented the medals, assisted by Lt. Cmdr. Jillian C. Malzone, USCG, Coast Guard Aide to the President.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Let's give a big round of applause to all our awardees. We are&mdash;we couldn't be prouder of all of you. <p>And I hope, for those who are watching or those who read stories or reports about this, that we're all reminded once again of the role of science and discovery and invention and reason in our lives. Sometimes, we spend a lot of time lifting up sports heroes, and nobody is a bigger sports fan than I am. We extol the virtues of our singers and our movie stars, and I like entertainment too. But we have to remind ourselves constantly that so much of what has set us apart economically, culturally, is our commitment to science. And we have to continue to broaden opportunities for young scientists, especially girls and minority students, to enter into the field, and we have to remind them of how exciting it is to be able to shape the world, unlock its secrets, make new stuff. That's who we are. <p>So, hopefully, in addition to being able to highlight the extraordinary work of some extraordinary individuals, that we're going to go out there and remind ourselves once again about why science and discovery and invention is so important. All right? <p>I hope all of you have a wonderful reception. I hear the food here is pretty good. [<i>Laughter</i>]\" "
"260" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Las Vegas! Good to see you again; you were here 2 years ago. It's good to be back at Del Sol High School. Go Dragons! <p>Let me just say that whenever I fly to Vegas on Air Force One, the plane is a little more crowded. [<i>Laughter</i>] For some reason, folks want to come to Vegas. But today it was also crowded with a whole bunch of people who have been passionate about making sure America always remains a nation of immigrants, including your Senator, Harry Reid; the leader of the Democrats in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi; some extraordinary Members of Congress who have been leading on immigration reform. They are doing unbelievable work, and I want to just name a couple of them&mdash;and if I forget somebody, make sure I don't get into trouble&mdash;from left to right, we've got Xavier Becerra, Ben Lujan, Luis Gutierrez, Dina Titus, Steve Horsford, and Bob Menendez. We've got the son-in-law of Cesar Chavez and a hero to farmworkers in his own right, Arturo Rodriguez. <p>And I just want to&mdash;and since we're on farmworkers, a legend, somebody who has just been a great friend to working people all across the country, Dolores Huerta. Good to see you. Love you. <p>I'm so inspired by the introduction by Astrid. Last night, I spoke directly to the American people about immigration, and you heard me talk about Astrid. And if you watched her introduction just now, you heard her talk a little bit about herself. <p>She was brought here as a little girl and grew up believing in America and in her identity as an American, just like Malia or Sasha. And then, as she grew up, she found out that she was undocumented, which meant she couldn't do all the things her friends could do. She feared that she and her brother could be separated from their dad. And then one day, she decided to start advocating for her fellow DREAMers and to stand up for her family and to fight to make a difference in this country that she loves. <p>And part of what makes America exceptional is that we welcome exceptional people like Astrid. It makes us stronger. It makes us vibrant and dynamic. It makes us hopeful. We are a nation of immigrants, and that means that we're constantly being replenished with strivers who believe in the American Dream. And it gives us a tremendous advantage over other nations. It makes us entrepreneurial. It's a&mdash;it continues the promise that here in America, you can make it if you try, regardless of where you come from, regardless of the circumstances of your birth. <p>Now, our immigration system has been broken for a very long time, and everybody knows it. As Americans, we believe in fairness, the idea that if we work hard and play by the rules, we can get ahead. But too often, the immigration system feels fundamentally unfair. You've got families who try to come here the right way, but sometimes, get separated or stuck in line for years. You've got business owners who are doing the right thing by their workers, offering good wages and benefits, and then you've got companies that are ignoring minimum wage laws or overtime laws, taking advantage of undocumented immigrants, and as a consequence, undercutting the employers who are doing the right thing. <p>All of us take offense to the idea that anybody can reap the rewards of living in America without its responsibilities. And folks like Astrid and Astrid's parents&mdash;who desperately want to make amends, embrace the responsibilities of living here&mdash;they're forced to either live in the shadows or risk having their families torn apart. <p>We've known about this for years. And we've known we can do better. And for years, we haven't done much about it. Well, today, we're doing something about it. <p>Now, when I took office, I committed to fixing this broken system. And I began by doing what I could to secure our borders, because I do believe in secure borders. And over the past 6 years, illegal border crossings have been cut by more than half. Don't let all the rhetoric fool you. There was a brief spike this summer in unaccompanied children being apprehended at the border, but it was temporary, and the number of such children is now actually lower than it's been in nearly 2 years. Overall, the number of people trying to cross our border illegally is at its lowest level since the 1970s, when I was in high school. And I've got gray hair now&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;so it's been a long time. <p>And nearly 2 years ago, I came here, Del Sol High School, right in this gymnasium, and I said that the time had come for Congress to fix our broken immigration system. And I laid out some basic principles for reform that a lot of different parties could agree on. And what was remarkable was the consensus that started to develop. We had business leaders and labor leaders and evangelical leaders and law enforcement leaders; we had Republicans, and we had Democrats and Independents, and they all said that, yes, we should secure our borders, we should bring our legal immigration system into the 21st century, and then, once and for all, we should give the 11 million people living in the shadows a chance to make amends and earn their citizenship the right way. <p>So those were our principles. We laid them out. We were very clear. And after I laid out those principles, we then went to work with Congress. And we started in the Senate. And you ended up with a big majority of Democrats and Republicans and Independents all coming together in the Senate to pass a bipartisan bill based on these principles. <p>The Senate bill wasn't perfect; it was a compromise. That's how things work in Congress. That's how things work in a democracy. Not everybody was satisfied with every provision, but it was a good, solid, commonsense bill that would have made our immigration system a lot better. <p>It would have doubled the number of Border Patrol agents. So for those who wanted more border security, that was in the bill. It would have made the legal immigration system smarter and fairer. It would have given the opportunity for young people who are talented and who have gotten a degree&mdash;maybe in computer science or some technical field&mdash;to stay here and work and contribute and create a business and create more jobs. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Thank you, Mr. President! <p><i>The President.</i> You're welcome. It would have given&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. And it would have given millions of people that chance to get right with the law. But it wasn't just a gift. They would have had to pay a fine. They would have had to learn English. They would have had to get to the back of the line. They would have had to pay back taxes. <p>It was a sensible bill, and all these Members of Congress, they worked on it and were supportive of it. And independent experts&mdash;not me&mdash;people who analyze the economy for a living, they said that over two decades, the new law would grow our economy, shrink our deficits. In other words, it would help to solve some big problems in a bipartisan way. And nobody was happier than me. And when it passed the Senate, we said, all right, let's send it over to the House, we've got the votes in the House. We've got Democrats and Republicans who were prepared to vote for it in the House. <p>It has now been 512 days&mdash;a year and a half&mdash;in which the only thing standing in the way of that bipartisan bill and my desk so that I can sign that bill, the only thing that's been standing in the way is a simple yes-or-not vote in the House of Representatives. Just a yes-or-no vote. If they had allowed a vote on that kind of bill, it would have passed. I would have signed it. It would be the law right now. <p>There are&mdash;these leaders right here tried to make it happen. Nancy Pelosi kept on saying to her&mdash;John Boehner, let's just call the bill, see where it goes. There are Republicans who worked hard on this bill too, and they deserve credit. Because even though it wasn't necessarily popular in their party, they knew it was the right thing to do. <p>But despite that, the party leadership in the House of Representatives would not let it come forward. And I cajoled, and I called, and I met. I told John Boehner, I'd&mdash;you know, I'll wash your car, I'll walk your dog&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;whatever you need to do, just call the bill. That's how democracy is supposed to work. And if the votes hadn't been there, then we would have had to start over. But at least give it a shot. And he didn't do it. <p>And the fact that a year and a half has gone by means that time has been wasted. And during that time, families have been separated. And during that time, businesses have been harmed. And we can't afford it anymore. <p>So, Las Vegas, I have come back to Del Sol to tell you I'm not giving up. I will never give up. I will never give up. [<i>Applause</i>] I will not give up. <p><i>Audience members.</i> <i>Si, se puede!</i> <i>Si, se puede!</i> <i>Si, se puede!</i> <p><i>The President.</i> So we're not giving up. We're going to keep on working with Members of Congress to make permanent reform a reality. But until that day comes, there are actions that I have the legal authority to take that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just. And this morning I began to take some of those actions. <p>So I talked about&mdash;I thought&mdash;I talked about what I could do based on talking to all the legal experts, talking to the Office of Legal Counsel. And not everything that we want to do we can do, but they told me what we could do. And I wasn't going to sit idly by and not do at least what I was authorized to do. <p>So first, we're providing more resources to law enforcement so they can stem the flow of illegal crossings at our border and speed up the return of those who do cross over. I want to repeat that: Border security is important. <p>Second, we're making it easier for high-skilled immigrants, graduates, entrepreneurs to stay and contribute to our economy. <p>Third, we're going to take steps to deal responsibly with millions of undocumented immigrants who are already here. Now, as I did last night, I want to spend some extra time talking about the third step, because this is the one that brings up the strongest passions on both sides. <p>The truth is, undocumented workers broke our immigration laws. They didn't follow the rules in terms of how they were supposed to come. And I believe they should be held accountable. And some have proven to break other laws. Some are dangerous. That's why over the past 6 years, deportations of criminals are up 80 percent. And that's why we'll keep focusing enforcement resources on actual threats to our security. But that means felons, not families. That means criminals, not children. It means gang members, not moms who are trying to put food on their&mdash;on the table for their kids. <p>So essentially, what we're doing is what law enforcement does every day. We've got limited resources, and so we're going to prioritize who are the folks who should be subject to removal, and that means that we've got to make sure that we've got clear rules in terms of how we're enforcing the law. <p>But even as we focus on deporting criminals, the fact is, millions of immigrants, they live here. And many of them have been here a very long time. And they're found in every State, and they're of every race and every nationality. I know a lot of people focus on the Latino community, but the truth is that&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member. </i>[<i>Inaudible</i>]&mdash;does not qualify! <p><i>The President.</i>&mdash;&mdash;the truth is that they're not just&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member</i>. We love you! <p><i>Audience members.</i> <i>Si, se puede! Si, se puede! Si, se puede!</i> <p><i>The President.</i> But the truth is&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> President Obama&mdash;[<i>inaudible</i>]. <p><i>Audience member</i>. We love you! <p><i>The President.</i> The&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> That's right: Not everybody will qualify under this provision. That's the truth. And&mdash;that's the truth. That's why we're still going to have to pass a bill. That's why we're still going to have to pass a bill. <p>So listen, I heard you, and what I'm saying is, we're still going to have to pass a bill. This is not&mdash;this is a first step. It's not the only step. We're still going to have to do more work. So let&mdash;I've heard you. I've heard you, young man. I've heard you, and I understand. I've heard you. But what I'm saying is, this is just a first step. So young man, I'm talking to a lot of people here. I've been respectful to you, I want you to be respectful to me, all right? [<i>Applause</i>] Okay. <p>Now, understand that not everybody who comes here is Latino. All right? Sometimes, that's the face of immigration. Let me tell you, I'm from Chicago. And we've got some Irish immigrants whose papers aren't in order. We've got some Polish immigrants whose papers are not in order. We've got some Ukrainian folks. Down in Florida we've got some Haitian folks. This is not just a Latino issue, this is an American issue. [<i>Applause</i>] This is an American issue. <p>And what we have to do is be honest that tracking down, rounding up, and deporting millions of people is not realistic. That's not who we are. Most undocumented immigrants are good, decent people. They have been here for a long time. They work, often in the toughest, most low paying jobs. They're trying hard to support their families. They worship at our churches. Their kids go to school with our kids. <p>They're&mdash;so the fact is that even Republicans who say that they don't want to pass this bill that was passed by these legislators, they're not serious about trying to deport 10, 11 million people. [<i>Laughter</i>] They&mdash;that's all rhetoric. Now, what we do expect is that people who are here play by the rules. You shouldn't get rewarded for cutting in line. <p>So we've offered the following deal: If you've been in America for more than 5 years, if you have children who are American citizens or legal residents, if you register, you pass a background check, you are willing to pay your fair share of taxes, then you're going to be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily without fear of deportation. You can come out of the shadows, get right with the law. <p>Now, let's be clear on what this deal is and what it isn't. This action doesn't apply to anybody who has come to this country recently. You can't show up for a week and then suddenly apply. You can't. Because borders mean something. It doesn't apply to anybody who might come illegally in the future. While I support a path to citizenship&mdash;and so do all these legislators here&mdash;this action doesn't grant citizenship or the right to stay permanently or receive the same benefits that citizens receive. Only Congress can do that. All we're saying is, we're not going to deport you and separate you from your kids. <p>Now, if you've taken responsibility, you've registered, undergone a background check, you're paying taxes, you've been here for 5 years, you've got roots in the community, you're not going to be deported. And I know some critics call this action amnesty. It's not amnesty. Amnesty really is the system we've got today. You've got millions of people who are living here, but they're not obliged to pay their taxes or play by the rules, and then, politicians just use the issue to scare people and whip up votes at election time. <p>So they just&mdash;they want to keep the system as is: people living in the shadows, maybe providing cheap labor, not subject to any worker protections, and then, you pretend like you're being tough on immigration. That's not the right way to do it. That's the real amnesty, just talking, leaving this broken system the way it is. <p>The bottom line is, mass amnesty would be unfair. But mass deportation would be both impossible and contrary to our country's character. That's not who we are. That's not who we are. <p>So what we are offering is accountability. It is accountability. It's a commonsense, middle-ground approach. If you meet the criteria, you can come out of the shadows, you can get right with the law. If you are a criminal, you're going to be deported. If you plan to enter the United States illegally, your chances of getting caught and sent back are going up. <p>And for those who don't qualify under this rule, we're still going to need legislation. But the actions I've taken are not only lawful, they're the kinds of actions taken by every Republican President and every Democratic President for the past half century. Ronald Reagan took action to keep families together. The first President Bush took action to shield about 40 percent of undocumented immigrants at the time. This isn't something I'm doing as if it's never been done. This kind of thing has been done before. <p>So when Members of Congress question my authority to make our immigration system work better, I have a simple answer: Pass a bill. Pass a bill. Nobody is stopping them from passing a bill. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Pass a bill! Pass a bill! Pass a bill! <p><i>The President.</i> Pass a bill. I mean, I got to admit, these days I don't always listen to all the commentary&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but I understand that some of them are already saying that my actions \\"sabotage\\" their ability to pass a bill and make immigration work better. [<i>Laughter</i>] Why? I didn't dissolve parliament. That's not how our system works. [<i>Laughter</i>] I didn't steal away the various clerks in the Senate and the House who manage bills. They can still pass a bill. I don't have a vote in Congress. Pass a bill. You don't need me to call a vote to pass a bill. Pass a bill. <p>Because the actions I've taken are only a temporary first step. I don't have the authority to do some really important reforms. We should be creating new programs for farmworkers. We should be adding visas for the high-tech sector. We should be creating a pathway to citizenship. But only Congress can do that. <p>The House could still pass the bipartisan Senate bill before the end of the year. They still have time. They've still got&mdash;what are you guys scheduled to be in for, another 4 weeks? Right after Thanksgiving, call the bill. It's been sitting there. And if they don't want to pass that bill, then I pledge to work with Republicans and Democrats next year to pass a more permanent legislative solution. And the day I sign that bill into law, then the actions that I've taken will no longer be necessary. And I'll give everybody credit. I'll be happy to have John Boehner and Mitch McConnell alongside Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi and Luis Gutierrez and Bob Menendez and all these folks. We'll all have a nice signing ceremony. <p>So I just want to emphasize this issue. Because I hear some people say, well, we're in favor of immigration reform, but we don't think that it should be done without Congress. Well, Congress, go ahead and do it. <p>And meanwhile, Washington should not let disagreements over one issue be a deal breaker on every issue. That's not how our democracy works. Congress certainly should not shut down the Government again over this. Because Americans are tired of gridlock. We are ready to move forward. And we don't want to&mdash;and we just want sensible, commonsense approaches to problems. <p>Now, this debate deserves more than the usual politics, because for all the back and forth in Washington, as I said last night, this is about something bigger. This is about who we are. Who do we want to be? <p>America is not a nation that accepts the hypocrisy of workers who mow our lawns, make our beds, clean out bedpans, with no chance ever to get right with the law. We're a nation that gives people a chance to take responsibility and make amends and then create a better future for their kids. <p>America is not a nation that should be tolerating the cruelty of ripping children from their parents' arms. We're a nation that values families, and we should work together to keep them together. <p>America attracts talent from all around the world. We educate the world's young people in our universities, and then, we just send them home, even if they're wanting to start a business or they've got some specialized skill. We just send them home, and then they compete against us. We should be encouraging the best and the brightest to study here and stay here and invest here and create jobs here and businesses here and industries here. You look at Silicon Valley, 30, 40 percent of the companies that we now take for granted that have changed our lives, they were started by immigrants. <p>So that's what this issue is all about. And that's why it deserves reasoned and thoughtful and compassionate debate. And that's why we have to focus not on our fears, we've got to focus on our hopes. You know, every day we receive thousands, tens of thousands of letters and e-mails at the White House. And as you can imagine, for the past few days, a lot of them have been about immigration. They've come from good, decent people on both sides of this debate. And I want to&mdash;I want everybody here to understand, there are folks who are good, decent people who are worried about immigration. They're worried that it changes the fabric of our country. They're worried about whether immigrants take our&mdash;take jobs from hard-working Americans. And they're worried because they're feeling a lot of economic stress, and they feel as if maybe they're the ones paying taxes and nobody else is taking responsibility. So they've urged me not to act. <p>And I hear them. And I understand them. But you know, I've also got a lot of letters and e-mails reminding me why we had to act: from American family members of hard-working immigrants who feared their families could be torn apart; from DREAMers who had proudly stepped out of the shadows and were willing to live without fear, even though it was a big risk for them; from Republicans who don't agree with me on anything, but are tired of their party refusing to vote on reform. <p>One Republican who wrote me said this. He said he supported my decision, and he said&mdash;and I'm quoting&mdash;\\"I believe that a human being, created in the very image of Almighty God, is the greatest resource that we have in this country.\\" <p>We're not a nation that kicks out strivers and dreamers who want to earn their piece of the American Dream. We're a nation that finds a way to welcome them. We make them earn it, but we welcome them in as fellow human beings, fellow children of God. And we harness their talents to make the future brighter for everybody. <p>We didn't raise the Statue of Liberty with her back to the world, we did it with her light shining as a beacon to the world. And whether we were Irish or Italians or Germans crossing the Atlantic or Japanese or Chinese crossing the Pacific, whether we crossed the Rio Grande or flew here from all over the world, generations of immigrants have made this country into what it is. It's what makes us special. <p>And whether we fled famine or war or persecution, whether we had the right documents or connections or skills, whether we were wealthy or poor, we all shared one thing, and that was hope that America would be the place where we could finally build a better life for ourselves and for our children and for future generations. Hope that America is the place where we could make it. <p>That's what makes us Americans. It's not what we look like. It's not what our last name is. It's not where we come from. It's not how we pray. What makes us American is a shared commitment to an ideal that all of us are created equal, all of us have a chance to make our lives what we will. <p>For generations, America&mdash;by choice and Americans by birth have come together to renew that common creed and move this country forward that brought us to this moment. That is the legacy that we now have to deliver to the next generation. <p>Thank you, Nevada. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"261" "\"Hi, everybody. Today, I'm at Del Sol High School in Las Vegas to talk with students and families about immigration. <p>We're a nation of immigrants. It has always given America a big advantage over other nations. It keeps our country young, dynamic, and entrepreneurial. But today, our immigration system is broken, and everybody knows it. <p>That's why, nearly 2 years ago, I came to this school and laid out principles for immigration reform. And 5 months later, Democrats, Republicans, and Independents in the Senate came together to pass a commonsense compromise bill. That bill would have secured our border, while giving undocumented immigrants who already live here a pathway to citizenship if they paid a fine, started paying their taxes, and went to the back of the line. Independent experts said it would grow our economy and shrink our deficits. <p>Now, had the House of Representatives allowed a yes-or-no vote on that kind of bill, it would have passed with support from both parties. Today it would be the law, but for a year and a half Republican leaders in the House have refused to allow that simple vote. Now, I still believe that the best way to solve this problem is by working together&mdash;both parties&mdash;to pass that kind of bipartisan law. But until that happens, there are actions I have a legal authority to take as President, the same kinds of actions taken by Democratic and Republican Presidents before me, that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just. <p>I took those actions this week. We're providing more resources at the border to help law enforcement personnel stop illegal crossings and send home those who do cross over. We'll focus enforcement resources on people who are threats to our security: felons&mdash;not families, criminals&mdash;not children. And we'll bring more undocumented immigrants out of the shadows so they can play by the rules, pay their fair share of taxes, pass a criminal background check, and get right with the law. <p>Nothing about this action will benefit anyone who has come to this country recently or who might try and come to America illegally in the future. It does not grant citizenship or the right to stay here permanently, or offer the same benefits that citizens receive. And it's certainly not amnesty, no matter how often the critics say it. Amnesty is the immigration system we have today, millions of people living here without paying their taxes or playing by the rules. And the actions I took this week will finally start fixing that. <p>As you might have heard, there are Members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better. Well, I have one answer for that: Pass a bill. The day I sign it into law, the actions I've taken to help solve this problem will no longer be necessary. <p>In the meantime, we can't allow a disagreement over a single issue to be a deal breaker on every issue. That's not how our democracy works. This debate deserves more than politics as usual. It's important for our future. It's about who we are and the future we want to build. <p>We are only here because this country welcomed our forebears and taught them that being American is about more than what we look like or where we come from. What makes us Americans is our shared commitment to an ideal that all of us are created equal and all of us have the chance to make of our lives what we will. That's the country we inherited, and it's the one we have to leave for future generations. <p>Thank you. God bless you, and have a great weekend.\" "
"262" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you so much. And, everybody, have a seat. Well, welcome to the White House. This is one of my favorite events. Once a year, we set aside this event to celebrate people who have made America stronger and wiser and more humane and more beautiful with our highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. This year we honor 18. Unfortunately, Stephen Sondheim could not be with us today. I'm going to be presenting him with this award at our 2015 ceremony. <p>We give thanks to public servants who have devoted their lives to their fellow citizens. When Edward Roybal told Speaker Tip O'Neill that he was starting a Congressional Hispanic Caucus, there were so few Hispanics in Congress that Tip joked they could fit the whole caucus in a phone booth. But Edward saw beyond the times. <p>As a Congressman from Los Angeles for 30 years, he fought for bilingual education, bilingual proceedings in our judicial system, and to make sure Hispanic Americans counted&mdash;literally. Thanks to him, the Caucus&mdash;the Census was revised to more accurately count Latinos. Although his roots in America went back hundreds of years, he championed the cause of immigrants and spoke up for vulnerable communities and was one of few in the early 1980s calling for more AIDS research. He left us nearly a decade ago, but Edward Roybal was and remains a hero to so many, not just Latinos, but all Americans. <p>Every girl in Little League, every woman playing college sports, and every parent&mdash;including Michelle and myself&mdash;who watches their daughter on a field or in the classroom is forever grateful to the late Patsy Takemoto Mink. I am particularly grateful because she was my Congresswoman for a long time. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Denied admission to medical school because she was a woman, Patsy went on to law school and coauthored title IX, banning gender discrimination in our schools. Patsy was many \\"firsts,\\" including the first woman of color in Congress, and to those of us in Hawaii, she represented the very best of public service and the Aloha spirit. <p>And if she was a first, she dedicated her life to making sure that she would not be the last. From championing civil rights to fighting for gender&mdash;fighting against gender discrimination, Patsy was a passionate advocate for opportunity, equality, and realizing the full promise of the American Dream. <p>When John Dingell's father, a New Deal Democrat, passed away in 1955, John stepped up. And over the course of six decades, a congressional career longer than any in history, John built a peerless record of his own. He gaveled in the vote for Medicare, helped lead the fight for the Civil Rights Act. For more than half a century, in every single Congress, John introduced a bill for comprehensive health care. That is, until he didn't have to do it anymore. [<i>Laughter</i>] And&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>I could not have been prouder to have John by my side when I signed the Affordable Care Act into law. John will retire at the end of this session, but at 88, he's still going strong. And his life reminds us that change takes time; it takes courage and persistence. But if we push hard enough and long enough, change is possible. As a University of Chicago student, Abner Mikva stopped by the local Democratic headquarters and asked to volunteer. And I love this story. A committeeman asked, \\"Who sent you?\\" and Ab said, \\"Nobody.\\" And the committeeman said, \\"We don't want nobody nobody sent.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] That's Chicago for you. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Despite that abrupt dismissal, Ab went on to devote his life to public service: reformed Illinois's criminal code, defended free speech and consumer rights; in 1993, stuck down&mdash;struck down the Pentagon's ban on gays in the military. He was overturned on that one, but history proved him right. And he inspired the next generation, including me. <p>After I graduated from law school, he offered me the chance to be his law clerk. I declined, but was extraordinarily grateful, and he forgave me&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;for which I was also grateful. Ab transcends any single moment in recent political history. But he had a hand in shaping some of the best of it. So we've got some extraordinary public servants on this stage. <p>We also give thanks for innovators who've changed our world. Mildred Dresselhaus's high school yearbook contained commentary from her classmates. They printed a mathematical tribute: \\"Mildred equals brains plus fun. In math and science, she's second to none.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Growing up in New York during the Great Depression, this daughter of Polish immigrants had three clear paths open to her: teaching, nursing, and secretarial school. Somehow, she had something else in mind. And she became an electrical engineer and a physicist and rose in MIT's ranks, performed groundbreaking experiments on carbon, became one of the world's most celebrated scientists. And her influence is all around us: in the cars we drive, the energy we generate, the electronic devices that power our lives. When she arrived at MIT in 1960, only 4 percent of students were women. Today, almost half are, a new generation walking the path that Millie blazed. <p>Robert Solow's father was a businessman who handled a lot of documents. And when Robert became an economist, his dad joked, we do the same thing: deliver papers. [<i>Laughter</i>]<i> </i>But Bob's influence extends far beyond the page. More than just about any living economist, he has shaped economic policy, and with it, the lives of people everywhere. His insights into how technological progress drives growth transformed our thinking about how to build prosperity, leading to more investments in research and education&mdash;in other words, more investments in people. <p>When he won the Nobel Prize, a colleague wrote, \\"Economists' faces lit up all over the world.\\" And this isn't exactly an irrationally exuberant group, economists. [<i>Laughter</i>] They don't usually get real fired up. [<i>Laughter</i>] But Bob isn't just admired by his peers, he is adored. And he continues to be a leading voice on the economic challenges of our times, especially when it comes to reversing income inequality and growing the economy for everybody, always pushing our nation to do better for everybody, for all. <p>So we give thanks to public servants, we give thanks to innovators, and we give thanks to performers who have captivated our hearts and our minds. The Onion once ran this headline: \\"Court Rules Meryl Streep Unable To Be Tried by Jury As She Has No Peers.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, I think this is, like, the third or fourth award Meryl's gotten since I've been in office, and I've said it publicly: I love Meryl Streep. I love her. Her husband knows I love her. Michelle knows I love her. There's nothing either of them can do about it. [<i>Laughter</i>] But she's done it all for her craft. She's sung Abba, which, you know, that's something. [<i>Laughter</i>] She learned violin, wore a nun's habit, faced down a charging lion, mastered every accent under the Sun. She inhabits her characters so fully and compassionately, saying, \\"It's the greatest gift of human beings that we have this power of empathy.\\" <p>And off screen, as an advocate for women and girls, she uses that gift to help others write the life stories of their choosing and to encourage greater empathy in the rest of us. So Meryl is truly one of America's leading ladies. <p>And then there's Stevie. Don't get Michelle talking about Stevie Wonder now. [<i>Laughter</i>] Early copies of Stevie Wonder's classic album \\"Talking Book\\" had a simple message, written in Braille: \\"Here is my music. It is all I have to tell you how I feel. Know that your love keeps my love strong.\\" This is, by the way, the first album I ever bought with my own money. I was 10 years old, maybe 11, with my own cash. I didn't have a lot of it. And I listened to that&mdash;that thing got so worn out, had all scratches. Young people, you won't remember this, but you'd have albums. [<i>Laughter</i>] And they'd get scratched. <p>For more than 50 years, Stevie has channeled his \\"Innervisions\\" into messages of hope and healing, in becoming one of the most influential musicians in American history. A musical prodigy with an electrifying voice, Stevie's blend of R&B and jazz and funk and blues and soul and whatever else you've got speaks of love and loss, justice and equality, war and peace. But what really defines Stevie's music is the warmth and humanity that resonates in every note. Some of his songs helped us to fall in love. Others mended our hearts. Some motivated us on the campaign trail. [<i>Laughter</i>] And thanks to Stevie, all of us have been moved to \\"Higher Ground.\\" <p>Alvin Ailey was born during the Depression in small-town Texas. And by the time he was 27, he had founded a dance company of his own in New York City. It became a place where artists of all races had a home. All that mattered was talent. The dances he choreographed were a blend of ballet, modern, and jazz, and they used the blues and spirituals as well. And through him, African American history was told in a way that it had never been told before: with passionate, virtuoso dance performances that transfixed audiences worldwide. <p>Alvin said that \\"dance came from the people and that it should always be delivered back to the people.\\" Alvin Ailey delivered, both through his life and through the dance company that will forever bear his name. <p>When Isabel Allende learned that her grandfather in Chile was dying, she started writing him a letter. Night after night, she returned to it, until, she realized, she was actually writing her first novel. She never really stopped. Her novels and memoirs tell of families, magic, romance, oppression, violence, redemption&mdash;all the big stuff. But in her hands, the big became graspable and familiar and human. And exiled from Chile by a military junta, she made the U.S. her home; today, the foundation she created to honor her late daughter helps families worldwide. She begins all her books on January 8, the day she began that letter to her grandfather years ago. \\"Write to register history,\\" she says. \\"Write what should not be forgotten.\\" <p>On the night that the Berlin Wall fell, only one American network anchor was there reporting live. A reporter remembers Ben Bradlee standing in the Post newsroom, watching Tom Brokaw at the Brandenburg Gate and wondering aloud, \\"How do we beat that?\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"Brokaw's got this.\\" <p>At pivotal moments, Tom got it. He reported on Watergate, snuck a camera into Tiananmen Square, sat down for the first one-on-one with Mikhail Gorbachev by an American TV reporter, covered every Presidential election since 1968. We've welcomed him into our home at dinnertime and Sunday mornings. We've trusted him to tell us what we needed to know and to ask questions that needed asking. I know, because I've been on the receiving end of some of those questions. [<i>Laughter</i>] Many of him know&mdash;many know him as the chronicler of the \\"Greatest Generation,\\" and today we celebrate him as one of our Nation's greatest journalists. <p>And we give thanks to trailblazers who bent the arc of our Nation towards justice. In the 1950s, golfer Charlie Sifford won the Negro National Open five times in a row. But by the time he became the first African American to earn a PGA Tour card, most of his best golf was behind him. <p>On the tour, Charlie was sometimes banned from clubhouse restaurants. Folks threatened him, shouted slurs from the gallery, kicked his ball into the rough. Charlie's laughing about that&mdash;my ball is always in the rough. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And because golf can be a solitary sport, Charlie didn't have teammates to lean on. But he did have his lovely wife Rose. And he had plenty of guts and grit and that trademark cigar. And Charlie won on the Tour twice, both after age 45. But it was never just about the wins. As Charlie says, \\"I wasn't just trying to do this for me, I was trying to do it for the world.\\" <p>Speaking of trailblazers, to some, Marlo Thomas will always be \\"That Girl,\\" who followed her dreams to New York City and, kind of, was running around Manhattan, having fun, on her own terms. To others, she's the creative mind behind \\"Free to Be . . . You and Me,\\" whose songs taught a generation of kids that they were strong and beautiful just the way they were. <p>As a founder of the \\"Ms. Foundation,\\" Marlo helped turn women's hopes and aspirations into concrete social and economic progress. And she's helped build the hospital her father founded, St. Jude's, into one of the premier pediatric hospitals in the world. She recalls her dad saying: \\"There are two types of people in the world: the givers and the takers. The takers sometimes eat better, but the givers always sleep better.\\" I love that saying. Marlo Thomas sleeps very well because she's given so much. <p>Raised on an Oklahoma reservation by a Cheyenne mother and a Hodulgee Muskogee father, Suzan Shown Harjo grew up to become one of the most effective advocates for Native American rights. And through her work in government and as the head of the National Congress of American Indians and the Morning Star Institute, she has helped preserve a million acres of Indian land, helped develop laws preserving tribal sovereignty. She has repatriated sacred cultural items to tribes, while expanding museums that celebrate Native life. Because of Suzan, more young Native Americans are growing up with pride in their heritage and with faith in their future. And she has taught all of us that Native values make American stronger. <p>On June 21, 1964, three young men&mdash;two White and one Black&mdash;set out to learn more about the burning of a church in Neshoba County, Mississippi: James Earl Chaney, 21 years old; Andrew Goodman, 20 years old; and Michael Henry Schwerner, 24 years old. Young men. And in that Freedom Summer, these three Americans refused to sit on the sidelines. Their brutal murder by a gang of Ku Klux Klan members shook the conscience of our Nation. It took 44 days to find their bodies, 41 years to bring the lead perpetrator to justice. <p>And while they are often remembered for how they died, we honor them today for how they lived: with the idealism and the courage of youth. James, Andrew, and Michael could not have known the impact they would have on the civil rights movement or on future generations. And here today, inspired by their sacrifice, we continue to fight for the ideals of equality and justice for which they gave their lives. Today we are honored to be joined by James's daughter Angela, Andrew's brother David, and Michael's wife Rita. <p>And finally, we give thanks to a person whose love for her family is matched by her devotion to her Nation. To most Americans, Ethel Kennedy is known as a wife, mother, and grandma. And in many ways, it's through these roles that she's made her mark on history. As Bobby Kennedy's partner in life, she shared his commitment to justice. After his death, she continued their work through the center she created in his name, celebrating activists and journalists and educating people around the world about threats to human liberty. <p>On urgent human rights issues of our time, from juvenile justice to environmental destruction, Ethel has been a force for change in her quiet, flashy&mdash;unflashy, unstoppable way. As her family will tell you, and they basically occupy this half of the room&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;you don't mess with Ethel. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>She's gone to extraordinary lengths to build support for the causes close to her heart, including helping to raise money for ALS research this summer by pouring a bucket of ice water over her head. [<i>Laughter</i>] As you may know, she nominated me to do it as well. And as you may know, I chose to write a check instead. [<i>Laughter</i>] I grew up in Hawaii. I don't like pouring ice water on top of my head. [<i>Laughter</i>] That is probably the only time I've ever said no to Ethel, by the way. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Ethel is the matriarch of a patriotic family, and with her encouragement, many of her children and grandchildren are carrying on the Kennedy tradition of public service. She is an emblem of enduring faith and enduring hope, even in the face of unimaginable loss and unimaginable grief. And she has touched the lives of countless people around the world with her generosity and her grace. It gives me great pleasure to present this award, which her brother-in-law, President Kennedy, reestablished more than 50 years ago. <p>Ladies and gentlemen, these are the recipients of the 2014 President Medal of Freedom. Let's give them a big round of applause. [<i>Applause</i>] Yay! <p>Well, you don't just get applause. You actually get a medal. [<i>Laughter</i>] So the&mdash;let's read the citations. <p>[<i>At this point, Lt. Cmdr. Jillian C. Malzone, USCG, Coast Guard Aide to the President, read the citations, and the President presented the medals, assisted by Maj. Matthew R. Newell, USAF, Air Force Aide to the President.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Well, what an extraordinary group. Let's give them all a big round of applause one more time. <p>We thank all of them for the gifts they've given to us: the incredible performances, the incredible innovation, the incredible ideas, the incredible expressions of the human spirit. And not only have they made the world better, but by following their example, they make us a little bit better every single day. <p>We are truly grateful to them. And on behalf of Michelle and myself, please enjoy the reception. And God bless you all. Thank you.\" "
"263" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, Chicago. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so much. Everybody, have a seat. Thank you. Thank you very much. Happy early Thanksgiving, everybody. It is good to be home. Although, it's cold in Chicago. [<i>Laughter</i>] It was 60 degrees in Washington. It's not 60 degrees here. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Let me begin by thanking the Copernicus Center. <i>Dzien dobry</i> to everybody. We appreciate you. Thank you so much. <p><i>Situation in Ferguson, MO/Public Response to Grand Jury Decision/Law Enforcement Reform Efforts </i><p>I hope you don't mind&mdash;because obviously, there's a lot of stuff in the news&mdash;I actually need to begin by saying a few words about what's happened over the past day, not just in Ferguson, Missouri, our neighbor to the south, but all across America. <p>As many of you know, a verdict came down&mdash;or a grand jury made a decision yesterday that upset a lot of people. And as I said last night, the frustrations that we've seen are not just about a particular incident. They have deep roots in many communities of color who have a sense that our laws are not always being enforced uniformly or fairly. That may not be true everywhere, and it's certainly not true for the vast majority of law enforcement officials, but that's an impression that folks have, and it's not just made up. It's rooted in realities that have existed in this country for a long time. <p>Now, as I said last night, there are productive ways of responding and expressing those frustrations, and there are destructive ways of responding. Burning buildings, torching cars, destroying property, putting people at risk&mdash;that's destructive, and there's no excuse for it. Those are criminal acts, and people should be prosecuted if they engage in criminal acts. <p>But what we also saw&mdash;although, it didn't get as much attention in the media&mdash;was people gathering in overwhelmingly peaceful protest, here in Chicago, in New York, in Los Angeles, other cities. We've seen young people who were organizing and people beginning to have real conversations about how do we change the situation so that there's more trust between law enforcement and some of these communities. And those are necessary conversations to have. <p>We're here to talk about immigration, but part of what makes America this remarkable place is, being American doesn't mean you have to look a certain way or have a certain last name or come from a certain place; it has to do with a commitment to ideals, a belief in certain values. And if any part of the American community doesn't feel welcomed or treated fairly, that's something that puts all of us at risk, and we all have to be concerned about it. <p>So my message to those people who are constructively moving forward, trying to organize, mobilize, and ask hard, important questions about how we improve the situation, I want all those folks to know that their President is going to work with them. And I think you'll find a lot of&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. Separate and apart from the particular circumstances in Ferguson, which I've&mdash;I am careful not to speak to because it's not my job as President to comment on ongoing investigations and specific cases, but the frustrations people have generally, those are rooted in some hard truths that have to be addressed. And so I&mdash;those who are prepared to work constructively, your President will work with you. And a lot of folks, I believe, in law enforcement and a lot of folks in city halls and Governor's offices across the country want to work with you as well. <p>So as part of that, I've instructed Attorney General Eric Holder not just to investigate what happened in Ferguson, but also identify specific steps we can take together to set up a series of regional meetings focused on building trust in our communities. And next week, we'll bring together State and local officials and law enforcement and community leaders and faith leaders to start identifying very specific steps that we can take to make sure that law enforcement is fair and is being applied equally to every person in this country. <p>And we know certain things work. We know that if we train police properly, that that improves policing and makes people feel that the system is fair. We know that when we have a police force that is representative of the communities it's serving, that makes a difference. And we know that when there's clear accountability and transparency when something happens, that makes a difference. So there are specific things we can do, and the key now is for us to lift up the best practices and work, city by city, State by State, county by county, all across this country, because the problem is not just a Ferguson problem, it is an American problem. And we've got to make sure that we are actually bringing about change. <p>The bottom line is, nothing of significance, nothing of benefit results from destructive acts. I've never seen a civil rights law or a health care bill or an immigration bill result because a car got burned. It happened because people vote. It happened because people mobilize. It happened because people organize. It happens because people look at what are the best policies to solve the problem. That's how you actually move something forward. <p>So don't take the short-term, easy route and just engage in destructive behavior. Take the long-term, hard, but lasting route of working with me and Governors and State officials to bring about some real change. <p>And to those who think that what happened in Ferguson is an excuse for violence, I do not have any sympathy for that. I have no sympathy at all for destroying your own communities. But for the overwhelming majority of people who just feel frustrated and pained because they get a sense that maybe some communities aren't treated fairly or some individuals aren't seen as worthy as others, I understand that. And I want to work with you, and I want to move forward with you. Your President will be right there with you. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Thank you, Mr. President! <p><i>The President.</i> All right? So that's what we need to focus on. Let's be constructive. <p><i>Immigration Reform </i><p>Now, I appreciate your patience, because I know you came here to talk about immigration. But this is relevant, because part of what America is about is stitching together folks from different backgrounds and different faiths and different ethnicities. That's what makes us special. And look, let's face it, sometimes, that's hard. Sometimes, that's hard to do. But it's worthwhile; it's worth doing. <p>If you go to&mdash;I was just traveling in Asia&mdash;you go to Japan, they don't have problems with certain folks being discriminated against because mostly everybody is Japanese. [<i>Laughter</i>] You know? I mean&mdash;but here, part of what's wonderful about America is also what makes our democracy hard sometimes, because sometimes, we get attached to our particular tribe, our particular race, our particular religion, and then we start treating other folks differently. And that sometimes has been a bottleneck to how we think about immigration. If you look at the history of immigration in this country, each successive wave, there have been periods where the folks who were already here suddenly say, well, I don't want those folks. Even though the only people who have the right to say that are some Native Americans. <p>Now, it is fitting that I've come here, back home to Chicago. Because Chicago has always been a city of immigrants. And that's still true in the neighborhoods that define this city. Especially on the North Side up here. I mean, there's&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;we've got everything up here. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>No, you go to the public schools around here, and you got 50, 60, 70 different languages being spoken. From Andersonville to Chinatown, from Devon to Greektown, Pilsen, Ukrainian Village, immigrants have made this \\"City of Broad Shoulders\\" their home. We are Swedish and Polish and German and Italian. Everybody is Irish on St. Patrick's Day. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>We've got names like Pat Quinn, our Governor, and Luis Gutierrez, our Congressman; Jan Schakowsky, another Congresswoman; Brad Schneider, Congressman; Rahm Emanuel&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. All mixed up. [<i>Laughter</i>] I don't mean Rahm. I mean all of us, together. [<i>Laughter</i>] It is true that Rahm speaks a language that can't be translated in front of children. [<i>Laughter</i>] Although, he's a mayor now, so he doesn't do that anymore, I'm sure. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Anyone who's driven along the Kennedy has seen the silhouettes of steeples jabbing at the sky, steeples as diverse as the houses of worship that they belong to and the immigrants that built them and the communities who call those neighborhoods home to this day. <p>Today we're here at a Polish community center, and I just&mdash;I was just meeting with a group of Chicago's business and civic leaders, representing people who come here from Mexico and China and Poland and Ireland. <p>You just heard Billy Lawless, who was a successful business owner back in Galway. But he says&mdash;and I'm quoting here&mdash;\\"I had a thing for the United States. I always wanted to see if I could hack it with you guys.\\" And so, 16 years ago, Billy comes to Chicago, opens up an Irish pub, because there was a shortage of Irish pubs in Chicago, clearly. [<i>Laughter</i>] Then, he opened another restaurant, then another, and then another. And 4 months ago, Billy and his wife became American citizens, and they voted for the very first time as Americans on November 4. And you can often find their son, also named Billy, charming the heck out of customers at all hours of the day and night. Together, they've gone from employing 10 workers to employing more than 250 workers. <p>And you just heard what Billy said: \\"This is what we immigrants do.\\" One study a few years ago found that immigrants start more than a quarter of all new businesses in the United States&mdash;one-quarter of them. Another study found that immigrants and their children start over 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies. Think about that. But it makes sense, because being a nation of immigrants gives us this huge entrepreneurial advantage over other nations. If you were willing to strike out, go to someplace new, build from scratch, you've got that sense of being willing to take risks and being able to build something from scratch; you have that spirit. That's part of what the American spirit is all about. It's part of what drove us westward across the frontier, not feeling like what's in front of you is the only thing that's possible, but that something else is possible. <p>And because of those businesses started by immigrants, we all benefit. It means more jobs. It means more growth for everybody. Now, as I said last week, our immigration system has been broken for a long time. Families who try to come here the right way can get stuck in line for years. Business owners who treat their employees right often see the competition exploit undocumented workers to undercut businesses. All of us, I think, don't like the idea that somebody can reap the rewards of living in America without its responsibilities. And there are people who desperately want to embrace those responsibilities, but they have no way of coming out of the shadows and getting right with the law. So everybody is stuck with a system that doesn't work for anybody. <p>Now, a year and a half ago, we had a big majority&mdash;Democrats, Republicans, Independents&mdash;in the United States Senate, and they came together, they passed a bipartisan bill to fix this broken system. And the bill wasn't perfect. It didn't have everything I wanted; it didn't have everything that everybody&mdash;anybody wanted. But it did reflect common sense. It was this huge improvement. <p>We would have doubled the number of Border Patrol agents. So if you are concerned about illegal migration, it would have made our borders that much tougher. It would have made our legal immigration system smarter and fairer and reduce some of the backlog that hampers families from getting here. It would have given millions of people a chance to earn their citizenship the right way. And independent experts said that, over the next two decades, the new law would grow our economy and shrink our deficit. <p>And had the House of Representatives allowed a simple yes or no vote on that kind of bill, it would have passed. That's all they needed to do, just call the bill. It would be law right now. We'd be well on our way to solving the problems in the system. I'd be implementing those provisions. But for a year and a half, over 500 days, Republican leaders in the House simply refused to allow a vote. They wouldn't let it come to the floor. <p>Now, I still believe the best way to solve this problem is by working together to pass that kind of commonsense law. When I was talking to Billy and the other civic leaders, there were things that can only be solved by Congress. But until then, there are actions I have the legal authority to take that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just. And I took them last week. They were the right thing to do. <p>So we're devoting more resources for law enforcement to stem the flow of illegal crossings at the borders and to speed the return of those who do cross over. We're initiating smarter reforms so high-skilled immigrants and graduates and entrepreneurs can stay and contribute to our economy. And I'm taking new steps to deal responsibly with the millions of undocumented immigrants who already live here, including here in Chicago. <p>Now, I've said this before, so I just want to be clear, and I say it in front of immigrant rights groups all the time: Undocumented workers who broke our immigration laws should be held accountable. There's a particular category, and that's those who may be dangerous. It's a small minority, but it's a significant one. And that's why, over the past 6 years, deportations of criminals are up 80 percent. And we'll keep focusing our limited enforcement resources on those who actually pose a threat to our security. Felons, not families. Gangs, not some mom or dad who are working hard just trying to make a better life for their kids. <p>But even&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> Sorry, Mr. President, but that has been a lie. You have been deporting families&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <i>The President.</i> All right. Okay. <p><i>Audience member</i>. I will never thank you for continuing deportation&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The President</i>. All right. That's fine. You've made your point. All right. <p><i>Audience member. </i>Sit down! <p><i>Audience member.</i> Not one more! Stop deportations! <p><i>Audience member.</i> Not one more! <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>]&mdash;to a lot of people that you did not take into account. [<i>Inaudible</i>]&mdash;and going into our communities and labeling people with families as criminals. And that is not the truth! You cannot keep saying felons, not families. <p><i>The President.</i> Okay, I've heard you. All right. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Republicans are also not the only ones playing. You've got Rahm Emanuel over there who advised against reform. <p><i>The President.</i> Okay. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Republicans are also not the only ones playing. [<i>Inaudible</i>]&mdash;deportations. <p><i>The President.</i> I understand. The&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> Listen, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Young lady. Don't just start yelling, young ladies. Sir, why don't you sit down too. Listen&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Audience member.</i> There is no justice anywhere&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The President.</i> The&mdash;here, can I just say this? All right, I've listened to you. I heard you. I heard you. I heard you. All right? Now, I've been respectful. I let you holler. All right? So let me just&mdash;let me&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. Nobody is removing you. I've heard you. But you've got to listen to me too. All right? So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. And I understand you may agree&mdash;disagree. I understand you may disagree. But we've got to be able to talk honestly about these issues. All right? <p>Now, you're absolutely right that there have been significant numbers of deportations. That's true. But what you're not paying attention to is the fact that I just took action to change the law. Now&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. So that's point number one. <p>Point number two: The way the change in the law works is that we're reprioritizing how we enforce our immigration laws generally. So not everybody qualifies for being able to sign up and register, but the change in priorities applies to everybody. <p>The point is that, though I understand why you might have yelled at me a month ago&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;although, I disagree with some of your characterizations&mdash;it doesn't make much sense to yell at me right now, when we're making changes. <p>So the point is&mdash;but the point is, let's make sure that you get the facts and that you know exactly what we're doing. And then if you have disagreements, then you can work through all the immigrant rights organizations that we work with to try to address some of your concerns. Right? So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. But what&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but here's what won't work. What won't work is folks&mdash;what won't work is folks just shouting at each other. All right? So I've been respectful. I responded to your question. I'd ask you now to let me speak to all the other people who are here. All right? Okay. <p>Now&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p><i>Audience member.</i> [<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>Audience members.</i> Boo! <p><i>The President.</i> Okay. It's good to be back in Chicago. [<i>Laughter</i>] So&mdash;because everybody has got something to say. But I'm not going to be able to have a conversation with each of you separately. [<i>Laughter</i>] So there are other ways of engaging. Just sit down. I just went off script for a pretty long time. [<i>Laughter</i>] I don't mind. I know people are passionate about this. But be respectful of everybody who's here. All right? <p>Now, let me get to the point that I was making, which is, even if we deported all the criminals, folks who had actually done bad things, there are millions of people here who are good people, but have still broken the immigration laws. And they're found in every State, every race, every nationality. Tracking down and rounding up and deporting millions of people is not realistic. It's not who we are. It's not what America should be. <p>On the other hand&mdash;and this sometimes is not acknowledged&mdash;if you came here illegally, you are cutting in front of the line of the folks who were trying to come here legally, which also is not fair. That's not fair. That doesn't make people bad people. But it does mean that you cut in front of the line, because there are a lot of folks who are waiting to try to get here legally. <p>So the deal that we're putting forward is this: If you've been here for more than 5 years, if you have children who are citizens or legal residents, if you register and pass a criminal background check and pay your fair share of taxes, then you can apply to stay temporarily. You can come out of the shadows. You can get right with the law. <p>This isn't amnesty or legalization or even a pathway to citizenship, because that's not something I can do. That is something only Congress can do. It also doesn't apply to anyone who has come to this country recently or might come illegally in the future, because borders do mean something. So it's accountability. It's a commonsense approach that allows me to exercise legal authorities that I have in order to make sure that we're preventing families from being broken apart. <p>And I am the first one to acknowledge that part of the reason that this has become important to me is, you're right, there have been times where families got broken apart, while I've been President. And it's heartbreaking. And it's not right. So until Congress does a complete fix, what we're saying is, if you have deep ties here and you start paying your fair share of taxes, then we won't deport you and separate you from your kids. <p>And we will not&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. And even if you do not fully qualify, we will still try to reprioritize how we're enforcing the laws&mdash;which we have to do&mdash;in a way that is less likely to break families apart. Because the system is broken. <p>And one of the reasons why this is important is because immigrants are good for the economy. We keep on hearing that they're bad. But a report by my Council of Economic Advisers put out last week shows how the actions we're taking will grow our economy for everybody. By 2024, the actions that I'm taking will add at least $90 billion to our gross domestic product. And this economic growth will reduce our deficit by $25 billion. And these actions will grow our labor force by nearly 150,000 people, and they will boost wages for American-born workers. <p>Now, if we passed a comprehensive law, it would be even better. We'd grow even faster, and the deficit would come down even faster. But even the steps we're taking now will make a difference. <p>And these actions are lawful. They're not only lawful, they're the kinds of actions that have been taken by every President for the past 50 years. When I hear some of my Republican friends talk about this, I try to remind them: President Reagan took action to keep families together. The first President Bush took action to shield about 1.5 million people. That was about 40 percent of undocumented immigrants in America at the time. <p>So when folks in Congress question my authority to make our immigration system work better, I've one answer: Pass a bill. Pass a bill. [<i>Applause</i>] Go ahead and pass a bill. I want to work with both parties on a more permanent legislative solution. I know that's what Luis Gutierrez wants and Jan Schakowski wants and Brad Schneider wants. They've been at the forefront fighting for a more permanent solution. And the day I sign a comprehensive immigration bill into law, then the actions I take will no longer be necessary. <p>But in the meantime, I'm going to do what I can to make this system work better. And in the meantime, Washington shouldn't let disagreements over one issue be a deal breaker on every issue. That's not how our democracy works. You can't disagree with one thing and then just say, all right, I'm going to take my ball away and go home. [<i>Laughter</i>] And Congress certainly should not shut down the Government again over this. Americans are tired of gridlock. We're ready to move forward. <p>As you can imagine, I've gotten a lot of letters and a lot of emails about immigration over the past few days. And some have said it was a mistake for me to act. But then, others remind me why I had to. One letter I got last week came from Brett Duncan of Dawsonville, Georgia. And Brett is a Republican, and so he doesn't really agree with me about anything. [<i>Laughter</i>] Well, maybe everything. His ancestors came over from Scotland before the Civil War, so his immigration status is pretty much settled. [<i>Laughter</i>] But he's done missionary work overseas. He knows what it's like to be a stranger. And over the years, he's gotten to know a lot of the new immigrants in his community. And here's what he said. He said: \\"Their children are as American as I am. It would be senseless to deport their parents. It would be bad for America.\\" \\"I believe,\\" Brett wrote, \\"that a human being, created in the very image of Almighty God, is the greatest resource we have in this country.\\" <p>So we're not a nation that kicks out strivers and dreamers who want to earn their piece of the American Dream. We are a nation that fundamentally is strong, is special, is exceptional, because we find ways to welcome people, fellow human beings, childrens of God, into the fold, and harness their talents to make the future brighter for everybody. <p>We didn't raise the Statue of Liberty with her back to the world. We did it facing the world, her light, her beacon shining. And whether we are&mdash;whether we crossed the Atlantic or the Pacific or the Rio Grande, we all shared one thing, and that's the hope that America would be the place where we could believe as we choose and pray as we choose and start a business without paying a bribe or&mdash;and that we could vote in an election without fearing reprisal and that the law would be enforced equally for everybody, regardless of what you looked like and what your last name was. <p>That's the ideal that binds us all together. That's what's at stake when we have conversations about immigration. That's what's at stake when we have conversations about Ferguson: Are we going to live up to those ideals of who we are as a people? And it falls on all of us to hand down to our kids a country that lives up to that promise, where America is the place where we can make it if we try. <p>So thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"264" "\"<i>The President.</i> Good afternoon, everybody. <p><i>Audience members</i>. Good afternoon. <p><i>The President</i>. Please have a seat. Normally we do this outside. The weather is not cooperating today. But I want to, first of all, on behalf of Malia and Sasha, wish everybody an early happy Thanksgiving. I am here to announce what I'm sure will be the most talked about executive action this month. Today I'm taking an action, fully within my legal authority&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;the same kind of action taken by Democrats and Republican Presidents before me&mdash;to spare the lives of two turkeys, Mac and Cheese, from a terrible and delicious fate. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to thank Joel Brandenberger, the president of the National Turkey Federation; Gary Cooper, its chairman; and his son Cole Cooper, who personally raised Mac and Cheese. Give them a big round of applause for&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. Cole is keeping a pretty careful eye there on Cheese. [<i>Laughter</i>] Uh-oh, he's not&mdash;he's getting pretty excited about this. <p>Thanks to all those who voted online to pick the official National Thanksgiving Turkey. Cheese wants you to know that he won. [<i>Laughter</i>] Mac, the alternate, is not so badly off either. Let's face it, if you're a turkey, and you're named after a side dish&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;your chances of escaping Thanksgiving dinner are pretty low. So these guys are well ahead of the curve. They really beat the odds. <p>It is important to know that turkeys have always had powerful allies. Many of you know that Benjamin Franklin once wrote: \\"I wish the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country. He is a bird of bad moral character. The turkey is, in comparison, a much more respectable bird.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] I think these two turkeys would agree with Mr. Franklin. And they'll get to live out the rest of their days, respectably, at a Virginia estate with 10,000 [1,000; White House correction.] acres of roaming space. <p>I know some will call this amnesty&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but don't worry, there's plenty of turkey to go around. [<i>Laughter</i>] In fact, later this afternoon Michelle, Malia, and Sasha and I will take two turkeys that didn't make the cut to a local food pantry that works hard year round to make sure that folks in our Nation's Capital have food and clothes&mdash;food to eat and clothes to wear. I want to thank Jaindl Turkey Farm in Pennsylvania for donating, once again, those birds for&mdash;it's, in fact, been 6 years in a row that they've made these contributions&mdash;and for making Thanksgiving dinner possible for some of our fellow Americans. <p>Finally, the Washington Post recently questioned the wisdom of the whole turkey pardon tradition. Typically, on the day before Thanksgiving, the story went, the man who makes decisions about wars, virus outbreaks, terrorism cells, and other dire matters of state, chooses to pardon a single turkey, plus an alternate. Tell me about it. It is a little puzzling that I do this every day&mdash;every year. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I will say that I enjoy it because, with all the tough stuff that swirls around in this office, it's nice, once in a while, just to say: Happy Thanksgiving. And this is a great excuse to do it. <p>Tomorrow is a pretty special moment when we give thanks for the people we love, and where we're mindful of the incredible blessings that we have received. We remember the folks who can't spend their holiday at home, especially the brave men and women in uniform who help keep our country secure. And we celebrate a holiday that, at its best, is about what makes this Nation great, and that's its generosity and its openness and, as President Franklin Roosevelt once said, our commitment to make a country in which no one is left out. <p>Now, because I know everyone wants to get out of town, Mac and Cheese included&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;it is time for me to engage in the official act. So let's see what we can do here with Cheese. <p>Careful there! Careful, Cole. <p>Come on, girls. [<i>Laughter</i>] Don't, don't. Come on. They always keep a little bit of a distance. You got to be right next to him. All right, are we ready? All right? Cheese, you are hereby pardoned from the Thanksgiving dinner table. [<i>Laughter</i>] Congratulations. Gobble, gobble. <p>He looks pretty happy about it. [<i>Laughter</i>] All right, if you want to take Cheese down, that's okay. [<i>Laughter</i>] He&mdash;I will tell you, though, turkeys don't have the best looking heads. [<i>Laughter</i>] You know what I'm saying? <p><i>Cole Cooper.</i> They're beautiful. <p><i>The President.</i> You think they're beautiful? <p><i>Cole Cooper.</i> I think they're beautiful. <p><i>Gary Cooper.</i> And if you think about it, they're red, white, and blue, so they're American and patriotic too. <p><i>The President.</i> There's a patriotism element to it. [<i>Laughter</i>] Absolutely. You guys want to pet him? <p><i>Malia Obama.</i> No. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. How you doing? Good to see you. Appreciate you. <p>Thank you, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving.\" "
"265" "\"On behalf of the Obama family&mdash;Michelle, Malia, Sasha, Bo, and Sunny&mdash;I want to wish you a very happy Thanksgiving. Like many of you, we'll spend the day with family and friends, catching up, eating some good food, and watching a little football. Before we lift a fork, we lend a hand by going out to the community to serve some of our neighbors in need. And we give thanks for each other and for all of God's blessings. <p>Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday because, more than any other, it is uniquely American. Each of us brings our own traditions and cultures and recipes to the table, but we all share this day, united by the gratitude for the bounty of this Nation. And we welcome the contributions of all people&mdash;no matter their origin or color or beliefs&mdash;who call America home and who enrich the life of our Nation. It is a creed as old as our founding: \\"E pluribus unum\\"&mdash;that out of many, we are one. <p>We're reminded that this creed, and America itself, was never an inevitability, but the result of ordinary people in every generation doing their part to uphold our founding ideals, by taking the blessings of freedom and multiplying them for those who would follow. As President Kennedy once wrote, even as we give thanks for all that we've inherited from those who came before us, \\"the decency of purpose, steadfastness of resolve and strength of will, for the courage and the humility, which they possessed,\\" we must also remember that \\"the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.\\" <p>Today we are grateful to all Americans who do their part to live by those ideals, including our brave men and women in uniform overseas and their families, who sacrifice so much to keep America safe. To our servicemembers who are away from home, we say an extra prayer for you and your loved ones, and we renew our commitment to take care of you as well as you've taken care of us. <p>We're grateful to the countless Americans who serve their communities in soup kitchens and shelters, looking out for those who are less fortunate and lifting up those who have fallen on hard times. This generosity, this compassion, this belief that we are each other's keepers, is essential to who we are, not just on this day, but every day. <p>You know, it's easy to focus on what separates us. But as we gather with loved ones on this Thanksgiving, let's remember and be grateful for what binds us together: our love of country, our commitment to justice and equality, our belief that America's best days are ahead and that her destiny is ours to shape and that our inherited ideals must be the birthright of all of our children. <p>That's what today is all about: that out of many, we are one. So thank you, God bless you, and from my family to yours, happy Thanksgiving.\" "
"266" "\"As I said last week in the wake of the grand jury decision, I think Ferguson laid bare a problem that is not unique to St. Louis or that area and is not unique to our time, and that is, a simmering distrust that exists between too many police departments and too many communities of color. The sense that in a country where one of our basic principles, perhaps the most important principle, is equality under the law, that too many individuals, particularly young people of color, do not feel as if they are being treated fairly. <p>And as I said last week, when any part of the American family does not feel like it is being treated fairly, that's a problem for all of us. It's not just a problem for some. It's not just a problem for a particular community or a particular demographic. It means that we are not as strong as a country as we can be. And when applied to the criminal justice system, it means we're not as effective in fighting crime as we could be. <p>And as a consequence, what I've been able to do today, thanks to excellent work by Eric Holder, our Attorney General, who had to fly down to Atlanta to start a conversation down there around these issues, as well as the outstanding leaders around this table, is to begin a process in which we're able to surface an honest conversation between law enforcement, community activists, academics, elected officials, the faith community, to try to determine what the problems are and, most importantly, try to come up with concrete solutions that can move the ball forward. <p>And one of the most powerful things that happened today was I had the opportunity to meet with some young people, including a couple of young outstanding leaders from the Ferguson community, Brittany Packnett and Rasheen Aldridge, who both served on the Ferguson committee, live in the area, and I think have been hearing from a lot of young people in that area. <p>And what made me concerned was the degree to which they feel as if they are not heard or that the reality of what they experienced has been denied. What made me greatly encouraged was how clear their voices were when they were heard and how constructive they are in wanting to solve these problems. And I think anybody who had the chance to listen to them here today felt the same way. <p>We also heard from law enforcement and were reminded of what a tough job it is to be in law enforcement. Whether you're in a big city or in a small community, as Eric Holder put it, police officers have the right to come home. And if they're in dangerous circumstances, we have to be able to put ourselves in their shoes and recognize that they do have a tough job. I don't think those realities are irreconcilable. In fact, I'm convinced that if we work hard, that we can make sure that police officers and the communities they serve are partners in battling crime, partners in making sure everybody feels safe; that we can build confidence and we can build trust, but it's not going to happen overnight, and it's not going to result just from a conversation around a table in Washington. It's got to result in concrete steps that we are able to lift up in communities all around the country and institutionalize. In order to advance that goal, here are a couple of specific steps that we're taking. First of all, I want to thank Chuck Ramsey, the Commissioner of the Philadelphia Police Department, as well as Laurie Robinson, who is a professor of criminology, law, and society at George Mason University and a former Assistant U.S.&mdash;a former Assistant Attorney General. <p>They are going to cochair a Task Force that is not only going to reach out and listen to law enforcement and community activists and other stakeholders, but is going to report to me specifically in 90 days with concrete recommendations, including best practices for communities where law enforcement and neighborhoods are working well together: How do they create accountability, how do they create transparency, how do they create trust, and how can we at the Federal level work with the State and local communities to make sure that some of those best practices get institutionalized? <p>So this is not going to be an endless report that ends up collecting dust on a shelf. My expectation is concrete recommendations that we can begin to operationalize both at the Federal, State, and local levels. And the good news is, is that we've got two folks who are respected by activists and respected by law enforcement, and I'm confident they're going to do an outstanding job. I want them to help us make sure that crime continues to go down and while community trust in the police goes up. <p>Second, one of the issues that came up during the response to the&mdash;Ferguson back in August was the issue of military equipment being utilized in the face of protests that may be taking place in the community. It raised a broader issue as to whether we are militarizing domestic law enforcement unnecessarily, and is the Federal Government facilitating that? <p>I have now received a review that I had ordered from all the agencies involved in this program, the 1033 Program. I will be signing an Executive order that specifies how we are going to make sure that that program is accountable, how we're going to make sure that that program is transparent, and how are we going to make sure that we're not building a militarized culture inside our local law enforcement? <p>Third, I'm going to be proposing some new community policing initiatives that will significantly expand funding and training for local law enforcement, including up to 50,000 additional body-worn cameras for law enforcement agencies. And I look forward to working with Congress to make sure that in addition to what I can do administratively and with resources that we've already got, that we are in a conversation with law enforcement that wants to do the right thing to make sure that they're adequately resourced for the training and the technology that can enhance trust between communities and police. <p>And finally, as I mentioned, Eric Holder is going to be working in parallel with the Task Force to convene a series of these meetings all across the country, because this is not a problem simply of Ferguson, Missouri, this is a problem that is national. It is a solvable problem, but it is one that, unfortunately, spikes after one event and then fades into the background until something else happens. What we need is a sustained conversation in which, in each region of the country, people are talking about this honestly and then can move forward in a constructive fashion. <p>Let me just close by saying this: There was a cautionary note, I think, from everybody here that there have been commissions before, there have been task forces, there have been conversations, and nothing happens. What I try to describe to people is why this time will be different. And part of the reason this time will be different is because the President of the United States is deeply invested in making sure that this time is different. When I hear the young people around this table talk about their experiences, it violates my belief in what America can be to hear young people feeling marginalized and distrustful, even after they've done everything right. That's not who we are. And I don't think that's who the overwhelming majority of Americans want us to be. <p>And I think there may be a convergence here where we've got outstanding law enforcement officials who recognize that times have changed and want to be responsive. I know that Richard Beary of the International Association of Chiefs of Police spoke about how eager they are to work with us. I think that we've got activists on the ground who don't always get attention because it's oftentimes the people who aren't being constructive that get attention, but there are folks there who are working really hard. I think there's a maturity to the conversation right now that can lead us to actually getting some concrete results. <p>And in the 2 years I have remaining as President, I'm going to make sure that we follow through, not to solve every problem, not to tear down every barrier of mistrust that may exist, but to make things better. And that's how progress is always made in this great country of ours. All right? <p>Thank you very much, everybody.\" "
"267" "\"Thank you, everybody! It is good to be back. Thank you. Thank you so much. Everybody, please have a seat. Thank you. Well, to Secretary Burwell, to Francis Collins, Tony Fauci, your teams, to all of you, thanks so much for welcoming me here today. It is wonderful to be back to America's laboratory, even if I don't always understand what you're doing. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Last year, I welcomed Francis and some of you to the White House to launch our BRAIN Initiative to unlock the mysteries of the mind and to pursue new cures for disease. And Francis promoted me at the time to \\"scientist in chief.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Which made me very proud, although I sort of felt guilty that I hadn't studied more chemistry. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But the work you do here is remarkable, and I just got a fascinating tour of your vaccine research center. I have to say, I was very impressed with how you can clone a virus gene into a vaccine vector, then subject it to gel electrophoresis. [<i>Laughter</i>] And then pipet the samples into a 96-well microplate. [<i>Laughter</i>] Run it through the world's most advanced multiparameter flow cytometer. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, but&mdash;it was impressive. I've been tinkering around the White House, setting up a similar system. [<i>Laughter</i>] We use it for brewing beer. [<i>Laughter</i>] But it works well for your work also. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Now, the last time I was here at NIH, early in my Presidency, I came to announce a historic boost in funding for biomedical research. Because part of American leadership in the world&mdash;one of the things that has always marked us as exceptional&mdash;is our leadership in science and our leadership in research. And here at NIH, you have always been at the forefront of groundbreaking innovations. You've helped pioneer new treatments for everything from cancer to heart disease, to HIV/AIDS. And as a consequence, you've helped not just Americans, but people around the world, live longer, fuller lives. You've saved countless lives in every corner of the globe. And so to Francis and Tony and all your directors and staff and the researchers that you fund across the country and around the globe, you deserve great thanks for your leadership and your service and your patriotism and your lifesaving work. <p>And that brings me back to today. This past summer, as Ebola spread in West Africa, I told my team that fighting this disease had to be a national security priority and a priority across agencies and across our Government. I realize that here in the United States, some of the attention has shifted away recently. That's sort of how our attention spans work sometimes. Ebola is not leading the news right now. But I wanted to come here because every day, we are focused on keeping the American people safe. Every day, the NIH is at the forefront of this mission. NIH personnel have volunteered and deployed to West Africa. Some have served in medical labs, testing for Ebola. Some of your clinicians&mdash;members of the U.S. Public Health Service&mdash;have deployed to care for health care workers who got infected in the line of duty. <p>When Nina Pham, one of the two Dallas nurses who were infected, needed treatment, Tony and his team stepped up, and you were ready. You manned shifts around the clock, day and night. You remembered your training. You displayed great skill and professionalism. You reminded the world that it is possible to treat Ebola patients effectively and safely without endangering yourselves or others. And all that has made an enormous difference. Like a lot of Americans, I know you fell in love with Nina. She was so sweet and big smile, optimism, sense of service, and reminded us&mdash;she reminded us of the incredible sacrifices that our tireless nurses make every day, and we can never thank them enough. And I know Tony thanks Nina for teaching him how to FaceTime. [<i>Laughter</i>] And after she was released, Ebola-free, I was proud to welcome Nina to the Oval Office and give her a big hug, and she's now back home in Texas, recovering, getting stronger. And we remember what she told the world when she was released: \\"Throughout this ordeal, I have put my trust in God and my medical team.\\" And we thank everyone on her team at the NIH Clinical Center who delivered such remarkable care to Tina. <p>But the point is, is that the work that you have done has continued even if the cameras have gone elsewhere. And the urgency remains, because if we are going to actually solve this problem for ourselves, we have to solve it in West Africa as well. And one of the great virtues of what you've done here at NIH is reminded people that science matters and that science works. It's not always going to be immediate. Sometimes, it's going to be iterative, and there are going to be some trials, and there are going to be some errors and false starts and blind alleys, but the basic concept of subjecting hypotheses to tests and seeing if they work and being able to document them and replicate them&mdash;the basic concept of science&mdash;and making judgments on the basis of evidence, that's what's most needed during difficult, challenging moments like the ones that we had this summer and that we continue to have in West Africa. <p>So, last week, just in time for Thanksgiving, NIH and your partners gave us something new to be thankful for, and that was news of the first successful step&mdash;completion of the phase 1 clinical trials&mdash;of a potential Ebola vaccine. And on my tour just now, Doctors Nancy Sullivan and Mario Roederer showed me how they and their teams did it. And I have to say, both Nancy and Mario were really good teachers and were very patient with my rudimentary questions, and the lasers were really cool. [<i>Laughter</i>] No potential Ebola vaccine has ever made it this far. So this is exciting news. But it's also a reminder of the importance of Government-funded research and our need to keep investing in basic research. [<i>Applause</i>] All right?<i> </i><p>Because Nancy, as she was talking about the steps that had been taken, showed me&mdash;this is the kind of mementos scientists keep, I guess&mdash;is there was, like, some numbers on a little chart&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;from back in 1999?&mdash;in which she had first done some experiments, some trials, on the Ebola virus. So this is the product not just of last year's work, it's the product of over a decade of inquiry and work. And at the time, when&mdash;Nancy was explaining when she first had some breakthroughs in understanding the Ebola virus, nobody really gave a hoot. Until you do. And that's part of how science works. You make investments, and you pursue knowledge for knowledge's sake, in part because it turns out that knowledge may turn out useful later, and you don't always know when. <p>Now, last week's news is still just a first step. There are no guarantees. But Dr. Cliff Lane, who is here, is working with Liberian officials to begin large-scale tests in that country. And other potential Ebola vaccines are also in the works. I know that here at NIH, you're also working on potential treatments for Ebola. And as you move ahead on all these fronts, I want you to know you have your President's full support and the administration's full support. <p>You are a vital part of our fight against Ebola, across our Government. Today we released an update on our efforts, here in the United States and abroad. And it shows that, because we've stepped up our efforts in recent months, we're more prepared when it comes to protecting Americans here at home. We're screening and monitoring arrivals from the affected countries. We've equipped more hospitals with new protective gear and protocols. We've conducted outreach and training of hundreds of thousands of health care workers. <p>A few months ago, only 13 States could test for Ebola; today, 36 States can. Previously, there were only three facilities in the country deemed capable of treating an Ebola patient, including NIH. Today we're announcing that we now have 35 treatment centers designated to care for a patient with Ebola. So this is important progress. And we're going to just keep on at it. And throughout, we are going to be guided by the science. Not by speculation, not by fear, not by rumor, not by panic&mdash;by science. <p>Now, part of what the science and epidemiology and experience has taught us&mdash;and I've said this all along&mdash;is, the best way to fight this disease, to protect Americans, is to stop it at its source. And that's why the United States continues to lead the global response in West Africa. Some 3,000 of our servicemembers and civilians are now on the ground: manning that air bridge, moving in supplies, building treatment units. I called some of our troops in West Africa on Thanksgiving to express gratitude, and they were inspiring, the can-do spirit that they displayed. <p>The new medical unit we built in Liberia to treat health workers opened last month and has begun discharging patients Ebola-free. We've ramped up the capacity to train hundreds of new health workers per week. We've helped improve burial practices across Liberia. And as a consequence, we've seen some encouraging news: a decline in infection rates in Liberia. And meanwhile, over the last few months, the United States has helped rally the international community. We've mobilized more than $2 billion in commitments to this fight because this has to truly be a global effort. But that money would not be there had it not been for U.S. leadership. <p>So our strategy is beginning to show results. We're seeing some progress. But the fight is not even close to being over. As long as this disease continues to rage in West Africa, we could continue to see isolated cases here in America. In West Africa, this remains the worst Ebola epidemic in history by a long shot. And although we've made some progress in Liberia, we've still got work to do. We've&mdash;are seeing that we still have a lot of work in Guinea and it's actually been getting worse in Sierra Leone despite some good efforts from our British partners. And this can still spread to other countries, as we've seen in Mali. Every hotspot is an ember that if not contained, can become a new fire. So we cannot let down our guard, even for a minute. And we can't just fight this epidemic, we have to extinguish it. <p>Now, much of the progress we've made&mdash;and the progress we still need to make&mdash;depends on funding. This is an expensive enterprise. And that money is running out. We cannot beat Ebola without more funding. If we want other countries to keep stepping up, we will have to continue to lead the way. And that's why I'm calling on Congress to approve our emergency funding request to fight this disease before they leave for the holidays. It's a good Christmas present to the American people and to the world. <p>The funding we're asking for is needed to keep strengthening our capacity here at home so we can respond to any future Ebola cases. The funding allows us to keep making progress in West Africa. Remember, we have to extinguish this disease. This is not something that we can just manage with a few cases here and there; we've got to stamp it out. The funding is needed to speed up testing and approval of any promising Ebola vaccines and treatments, including those here at the NIH. It's needed to help us partner with other countries to prevent and deal with future outbreaks and threats before they become epidemics. This is something I want to just focus on for a second. Tony and I were fondly reminiscing about SARS and H1N1. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's what these guys do for fun. [<i>Laughter</i>] And we were lucky with H1N1 that it did not prove to be more deadly. We can't say we're lucky with Ebola because obviously, it's having a devastating effect in West Africa, but it is not airborne in its transmission. <p>There may and likely will come a time in which we have both an airborne disease that is deadly. And in order for us to deal with that effectively, we have to put in place an infrastructure&mdash;not just here at home, but globally&mdash;that allows us to see it quickly, isolate it quickly, respond to it quickly. And it also requires us to continue the same path of basic research that is being done here at the NIH that Nancy is a great example of. So that if and when a new strain of flu, like the Spanish flu, crops up 5 years from now or a decade from now, we've made the investment, and we're further along to be able to catch it. It is a smart investment for us to make. It's not just insurance, it is knowing that down the road, we're going to continue to have problems like this, particularly in a globalized world, where you move from one side of the world to the other in a day. <p>So this is important now, but it's also important for our future and our children's future and our grandchildren's future. And the last few elections, the American people have sent Washington a pretty clear message: Find areas where you agree, don't let the areas where you disagree shut things down, work together, and get the job done. <p>I cannot think of a better example of an area where we should all agree than passing this emergency funding to fight Ebola and to set up some of the public health infrastructure that we need to deal with potential outbreaks in the future. How do you argue with that? That is not a partisan issue. That is a basic, commonsense issue that all Americans can agree on. <p>Now, I have to say, I've been very encouraged so far by the bipartisan support in our various visits with Members of Congress. They&mdash;for the most part, people have recognized, this is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue, it's about the safety and security of the American people. So let's get it done. This can get caught up in normal politics. We need to protect the American people, and we need to show the world how America leads. <p>I have to tell you, I traveled to Asia; we had the G-20 summit. If America had not led, if I had not been able to go to CDC, make a major announcement about the commitments we were going to make, be able to go to the United Nations and basically call on other countries to step up and know that we were following through with our own commitments, had we not done that, the world would not have responded in the same way. American leadership matters every time. We set the tone, and we set the agenda. <p>Now, in closing, I want to leave with a story that speaks to what we have to do. Nancy Writebol is from Charlotte, North Carolina. She's a mom, grandma, wife, also a Christian missionary. Along with her husband, she went to Liberia. And she was doing God's work: caring for Ebola patients. It's hard to imagine a greater expression of the Christian ethic. And she was then infected herself. So she was brought back to Emory in Atlanta; she received excellent care. Nancy was released in August. She is Ebola-free. She continues to recover. And she said this about how people treat her, even today: \\"You have some people that just totally wrap their arms around you and shake your hand. And then, you have other people that stand 10 feet away.\\" <p>Some people wrap their arms around you. Some people stand 10 feet away. This disease is not just a test of our health systems, it is a test of our character as a nation. It asks us who we are as Americans. When we see a problem in the world, like thousands of people dying from a disease that we know how to fight, do we stand 10 feet away or 10,000 miles away, or do we lead and deploy and go to help? <p>And I know what kind of character I want to see in America, and I know the kind of character that's displayed by people here at NIH and some of your colleagues that are deployed right now in Liberia. That's who we are. We don't give in to fears. We are guided by our hopes, and we are guided by our reason, and we are guided by our faith, and we're guided by our confidence that we can ease suffering and make a difference. And we imagine new treatments and cures, and we discover, and we invent, and we innovate, and we test, and we unlock new possibilities. <p>And when we save a life and we help a person heal, we go up to them and we open our arms, and we wrap our arms around them with understanding and love and compassion and reason. That's what you do here at NIH. It's what we do as Americans. That's who we are. That's who we'll always be. <p>Thank you very much. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\" "
"268" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, everybody! <i>Kahee.</i> Well, thank you so much. Everybody, please have a seat, please have a seat. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Love you! <p><i>The President.</i> Love you back. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's good to see you. <p><i>Audience member.</i> We love you, man! <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you. <p><i>Audience member.</i> Love you more! [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Well, welcome to the 2014 White House Tribal Nations Conference. Five years ago, when we held this meeting for the first time, it was historic, the largest-ever gathering of tribal leaders at the White House. And we got some valuable work done. So we thought, hey, this is a pretty good idea, let's do this again. And now we're meeting for the sixth time. This conference has become an institution. <p>And I want to thank every tribal leader here for making that happen, especially those of you who come year after year, committed to making our nation-to-nation relationship as strong as it can be. <p>I also want to thank the Members of Congress who are here today. I want to thank Sally Jewell, our outstanding Secretary of Interior. Sally is also the Chair of the White House Council on Native American Affairs. And I'm proud to have Native Americans serving with dedication and skill in my administration, including somebody I love, Jodi Gillette of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. Everybody here knows Jodi, my Special Assistant for Native American Affairs, as well as Raina Thiele, who is Denaina and Yup'ik and works in the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs. <p>If I could, I'd give a shout-out to every nation here today. Each is a unique and cherished part of our American community. To all of my adopted Crow brothers and sisters, <i>hine wabeh itchik.</i> It is a good day. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Grand Jury Decision in Death of Eric Garner in New York City </i><p>I hope you'll allow me this indulgence before I get started talking about what we have accomplished and what we still have to accomplish, because one of the things about being President is, news breaks, and it's important for people to hear how I feel and how I'm thinking about some important issues that we face in this Nation. <p>Some of you may have heard there was a decision that came out today by a grand jury not to indict police officers who had interacted with an individual named Eric Garner, in New York City, all of which was caught on videotape and speaks to the larger issues that we've been talking about now for the last week, the last month, the last year, and sadly, for decades, and that is, the concern on the part of too many minority communities that law enforcement is not working with them and dealing with them in a fair way. And there's going to be, I'm sure, additional statements by law enforcement. My tradition is not to remark on cases where there may still be an investigation. But I want everybody to understand that this week, in the wake of Ferguson, we initiated a Task Force whose job it is to come back to me with specific recommendations about how we strengthen the relationship between law enforcement and communities of color and minority communities that feel that bias is taking place; that we are going to take specific steps to improve the training and the work with State and local governments when it comes to policing in communities of color; that we are going to be scrupulous in investigating cases where we are concerned about the impartiality and accountability that's taking place. <p>And as I said when I met with folks both from Ferguson and law enforcement and clergy and civil rights activists, I said this is an issue that we've been dealing with for too long, and it's time for us to make more progress than we've made. And I'm not interested in talk, I'm interested in action. And I am absolutely committed as President of the United States to making sure that we have a country in which everybody believes in the core principle that we are equal under the law. <p>So I just got off the phone with my Attorney General, Eric Holder. He will have more specific comments about the case in New York. But I want everybody to know here, as well as everybody who may be viewing my remarks here today, we are not going to let up until we see a strengthening of the trust and a strengthening of the accountability that exists between our communities and our law enforcement. <p>And I say that as somebody who believes that law enforcement has an incredibly difficult job; that every man or woman in uniform are putting their lives at risk to protect us; that they have the right to come home, just like we do from our jobs; that there's real crime out there that they've got to tackle day in and day out; but that they're only going to be able to do their job effectively if everybody has confidence in the system. <p>And right now, unfortunately, we are seeing too many instances where people just do not have confidence that folks are being treated fairly. And in some cases, those may be misperceptions, but in some cases, that's a reality. And it is incumbent upon all of us, as Americans, regardless of race, region, faith, that we recognize this is an American problem, and not just a Black problem or a Brown problem or a Native American problem. This is an American problem. When anybody in this country is not being treated equally under the law, that's a problem. And it's my job as President to help solve it. [<i>Applause</i>] All right? <p><i>Relations Between Tribal Nations and the Federal Government </i><p>Now, when I visited the Crow Nation in Montana, I was a candidate for this office, and I made it a point to meet with tribal leaders on the campaign trail as often as I could, because I wanted to make sure our country did better by our First Americans. Talk was cheap, and there had been too many promises that hadn't been kept. And I tried to make sure that I didn't overpromise. I had tried to make clear to the leaders that I met with that I wasn't going to be able singlehandedly to reverse hundreds of years of history, but what I could do is listen and learn and partner with you. <p>I wanted to change the relationship between our governments, to elevate your voices in Washington and give your tribes greater say over the decisions that affect the lives of your people every day. And I wanted to turn the page on a history that is riddled with too many broken promises, write a new chapter with a spirit of respect and trust. And today, more than 6 years later, I'm proud of everything that we've done to make that happen. Together, we've strengthened your sovereignty: giving more power to tribal courts and police, restoring hundreds of thousands of acres of tribal trust lands. We've expanded opportunity: permanently reauthorizing the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, speeding up the process for businesses signing leases in Indian Country, building roads, expanding high-speed Internet access, and moving forward on renewable energy projects. We've delivered justice: resolving legal disputes that had dragged on for decades, untying your hands when it comes to dealing with domestic violence. <p>So as I said earlier, as I said on the campaign trail, we haven't solved every problem, but I've been able to keep a promise to all of you that I would learn and I would listen and I'd treat you with the respect that you deserve. And we have more work to do, but when we&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. We have more work to do, but when we step back, we see there's virtually no area in which we haven't made significant progress together. We can take pride in that. <p>And I made another promise that I'd visit Indian Country as President. And this June, I kept that promise. I know that the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is here. Where are you all? So Michelle and I traveled to their reservation in North Dakota. It was a day I'll never forget. We attended the annual Cannon Ball Flag Day powwow. [<i>Laughter</i>] Students were singing Lakota national&mdash;the Lakota national anthem. There was a drum group that performed a veterans' song as American flags flew in the breeze&mdash;and it was breezy. It did make me think about, I'm glad I was there during the summer. [<i>Laughter</i>] But this drum group was honoring a tribal citizen who served in our&mdash;each was honoring a tribal member who had served in our military. People of all ages wore the traditional regalia with pride. And it was clear how deeply this nation values its culture and its history. And it was clear how deeply they cared for each other, especially their young people. <p>And so it was arranged for me to meet with some of these young people. And Michelle and I, before the powwow, sat down with a group of Lakota young adults. There was no press, no teachers, no parents. It was just us. And folks were invited to say whatever was on their minds. And these young people could not have been more poised, and they could not have been more thoughtful. And they talked about their families and their friends and their dreams of the future. But they also talked about the pain in their hearts and the obstacles they had had to overcome and the problems they had seen with loved ones who had been brought down by drugs or alcohol or violence or poverty. <p>One young man was raising his four little brothers by himself. All of them knew somebody that they loved who had attempted suicide, committed suicide, died in a car accident before their time. Some of them had spent time living in a bus. And there were tears in that room pretty much the entire conversation and the sense that schools weren't always preparing them properly and that they weren't sure about the possibilities of a better future. <p>And Michelle and I were honored that these young people opened up to us. But more importantly, we were moved because they were like Malia and Sasha, just as smart, just as hopeful, just as beautiful. But at their core, there was a nagging doubt that they would have the opportunities that my daughters had. And nothing gets me more frustrated than when I hear that. Nothing gets me angrier than when I get a sense that our young people early in life are already feeling like opportunities are foreclosed to them, because that's not who we are. <p>And so Michelle and I ended up staying longer than we had planned, and we got a lot of hugs in, and we walked away shaken because they&mdash;some of these kids were carrying burdens no young person should ever have to carry. And it was heartbreaking. And we told them, because they were such extraordinary young people&mdash;strong and talented and courageous&mdash;we said, you've got to believe in yourselves, because we believe in you. And we want to give those young people and young Native Americans like them the support they deserve. We have to invest in them and believe in them and love them. And if we do, there's no question of the great things they can achieve, not just for their own families, but for their nation and for the United States. <p>And the truth is those young people were representative of young people in every tribe, in every reservation in America. And too many face the same struggles that those Lakota teenagers face. They're not sure that this country has a place for them. Every single one of them deserves better than they're getting right now. They are our children, and they deserve the chance to achieve their dreams. <p>So when Michelle and I got back to the White House after our visit to Standing Rock, I told my staff&mdash;I brought Sally in, and I brought Arne Duncan in, and I brought whoever else was involved in youth and education and opportunity and job training, and I said, you will find new avenues of opportunity for our Native youth. You will make sure that this happens on my watch. <p>And as I spoke, they knew I was serious because it's not very often where I tear up in the Oval Office. I deal with a lot of bad stuff in this job. It is not very often where I get choked up, so they knew I was serious about this. <p>And so here is what I want you to know that we're working on as a consequence of these conversations. Number one, today we're releasing a report on the unique challenges that Native youth face, because we cannot solve these challenges without a comprehensive picture of the problem. <p>Number two, I'm instructing every member of my Cabinet to experience what Michelle and I did at Standing Rock: to sit down with Native young people and hear firsthand about their lives. Sally Jewell has already done it. Arne Duncan&mdash;have already started. I want everybody to do it. <p>And the Department of Education has launched a new initiative with a handful of tribes called the Native Youth Community Projects. And the idea is, we're working with tribes to give schools and students intensive support across a range of areas, from nutrition to mental health, to culturally relevant curriculum. We know that learning about the history and language and traditions of one's people can make a huge difference in a child's education. And in the long run, if it's done right, it will help more of them be prepared for college and careers. We want to help make that happen. <p>Number three, to cultivate the next generation of Native leaders, we're creating a national network called Generations Indigenous to remove the barriers that stand between young people and opportunity. And the first class of Gen-I Youth Ambassadors are here today. We are launching a new National Tribal Youth Network to connect and support talented young people in your nations. And next year, we will hold the first White House Tribal Youth Gathering. It will look a lot like this conference, only younger. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's all right; you see my gray hair. I can't say nothing about that. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Number four, the budget I submit to Congress in February will include smarter, stronger investments in several areas that are really important to Native youth, especially education. We're going to invest in connecting tribal schools to high-speed Internet. We're going to fill them with the best teachers and principals. We're going to make sure that children and families get the support they need to stay secure and healthy. And we are going to keep fighting to meet our obligations to your nations. <p>We're going to fight to reauthorize the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act, because every young person deserves a safe place to live. We're going to keep promoting economic growth in Indian Country, because every young person deserves the chance to work and get ahead. <p>We're going to keep working with your communities to deal with the very real impacts of climate change. And I want to thank the tribal leaders who have advised me on how to do that as members of my Task Force on Climate Preparedness and Resilience. <p>I also want to recognize those tribes that have done exceptional work in their response to climate change, including two that we named Climate Action Champions this morning: the Blue Lake Rancheria Tribe and the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians. And we're going to keep working with all of you to protect your natural resources and restore tribal homelands, resolve disputes over water rights, to make sure your sacred lands are protected for future generations. <p>The United States shares a sacred bond with our Native nations. We have a sacred responsibility to all our young people, including Native youth. Every day that I have the honor to serve as your President, I will do everything I can to meet that responsibility and honor that trust and to do right by your nations and your children and future generations. <p>And&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. Which brings me back to what I said at the beginning: Because too many promises haven't been kept, I've tried not to overpromise. But when I've made a promise, I've tried to make sure that I meet that commitment. So when Michelle and I said goodbye to those teenagers in Standing Rock, we told them we wanted to return their hospitality, and we asked them to come visit us at the White House. And a bunch of them told us later they didn't think they were ever going to hear from us again. [<i>Laughter</i>] Because they said, you know what, we've had a lot of adults make promises to us that didn't get kept. Well, 2 weeks ago, they came by, and we took them out for pizza. [<i>Laughter</i>] And they got a tour of the White House. And they met with officials from across my administration. And everybody here who had a chance to meet them said how terrific they were. <p>And I understand that on their last night in Washington, their hotel had a blackout, and sitting together in their pajamas in the dark, they did what I understand was a very Lakota thing to do. They wrote a song about their trip. And so I'm going to just go over what the song says. It&mdash;here's how it went. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm not going to sing it though. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience members</i>. Sing! <p><i>The President</i>. And I'm sure it sounds better in Lakota. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>It says: \\"We returned from the White House. We knew without a doubt we were the first of many voices of Indian Country. So if you hear this song, listen and learn it to sing along. We are all one family. Let's not make this just a dream.\\" <p>We're all one family. [<i>Applause</i>] We're all one family. Your nations have made extraordinary contributions to this country. Your children represent the best of this country and its future. Together, we can make sure that every Native young person is treated like a valuable member not only of your nation, but of the American family; that every Native young person gets an equal shot at the American Dream. That's what I'm working for. That's what you're working for. I'm proud every single day to be your partner. \\"We are all one family. Let's not make this just a dream.\\" <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you.\" "
"269" "\"<i>The President</i>. Thank you! Please, please have a seat. Thank you so much. <p>First of all, can everybody please give Chionque a big round of applause for her great story? We are proud of what she has achieved and the spirit that she represents. When it comes to higher education, we spend a lot of time crunching numbers and statistics. But ultimately, what matters&mdash;and what has so many of you here today, many of you who have made this your life work&mdash;is making sure that bright, motivated young people like Chionque, and all the students who are here, have the chance to go as far as their talents and their work ethic and their dreams can take them. <p>And that's why we're here today. In January, we held our first College Opportunity Summit with about 140 higher education leaders and organizations over in the White House. This time, we've got so many folks, we had to move to a different building. That is a good sign. [<i>Laughter</i>] You would have been a fire hazard over in EEOB. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And all we did was ask a simple question: What can we do, collectively, to create more success stories like Chionque's? And you, collectively, have responded in a big way, with commitments to give more of our young people that chance. Private and community colleges, philanthropists and business leaders, heads of nonprofits and heads of school districts. This did not require a single piece of legislation, a single new stream of funding. What it required was a sense of urgency and a sense of focus and a recognition, this should not be a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. Making sure more of our young people have access to higher education and can succeed and complete their work and get their degree, that has to be an American issue. [<i>Applause</i>] An American issue. <p>And this is especially important at a time when we face multiple challenges, both internationally and domestically, challenges that are entirely solvable, but so often don't get solved because rather than having a sense of common good, we focus on our differences. Rather than having a sense of national purpose, a common sense of opportunity, we give in to those forces that drive us apart. <p>We think about what's happened over the last year, 2 years, 6 years, our economy keeps improving. More Americans are working. More Americans have health care. Manufacturing has grown. The deficit has shrunk. Foreign oil is down. Crime is down. Graduation rates are up. Clean energy is up. So, objectively speaking, America is outpacing most of the world. And when I travel overseas, people look at us with envy and are puzzled as to why there seems to be so much anxiety and frustration inside America. <p>And my response is that when it comes to our economy, yes, our economy is growing, but we find an increasing divergence between those who have the skills that today's jobs require and those who don't. So the economy becomes more stratified. When it comes to the cost of college, there's a frustration in a middle class that feels like folks at the top can afford it, folks at the bottom get help, there's nobody who's looking out for folks in the middle. And given accelerating costs and the recognition that this is going to be the key ticket to the middle class, that elicits great frustration. When it comes, as we've seen, unfortunately, in recent days, to our criminal justice system, too many Americans feel deep unfairness when it comes to the gap between our professed ideals and how laws are applied on a day-to-day basis. <p>I should mention, before I came here I had a chance to speak with Mayor de Blasio in New York, and I commended him for his words yesterday and for the way New Yorkers have been engaging in peaceful protests and being constructive. He was just in the White House with us on Monday, as we started taking some concrete steps to strengthen the relationship between law enforcement and communities of color, and I intend to take more steps with leaders like him in the months ahead. But beyond the specific issue that has to be addressed&mdash;making sure that people have confidence that police and law enforcement and prosecutors are serving everybody equally&mdash;there's the larger question of restoring a sense of common purpose. <p>And at the heart of the American ideal is this sense that we're in it together; that nobody is guaranteed success, but everybody has got access to the possibilities of success; and that we are willing to work not just to make sure our own children have pathways to success, but that everybody does; that at some level, everybody is our kid, everybody is our responsibility. We are going to give back to everybody. <p>And we do that because it's the right thing to do, and we do it because, selfishly, that's how this country is going to advance and everybody is going to be better off. And big challenges like these should galvanize our country. Big challenges like these should unite us around an opportunity agenda that brings us together, rather than pulling us apart. <p>We are at our best when we rise to what the moment demands, whether it's putting more people back to work, making sure those jobs pay a decent wage so that incomes and wages go up; whether it's educating more of our kids for the 21st century; whether it's fixing our broken immigration system; and to do what many of you have done and made as the cause of your life, and that is, opening the doors of higher education to more of our fellow Americans. These are big challenges, but they are solvable as long as we feel a sense of urgency and we work together. <p>And that's why I was so heartened by the January meeting, and that's why I'm even more encouraged by this meeting. <p>Our higher education system is one of the things that makes America exceptional. There's no place else that has the assets we do when it comes to higher education. People from all over the world aspire to come here and study here. And that is a good thing. <p>America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free. We sent a generation to college. We cultivated the most educated workforce in the world. Along with our innovation mentality, our risk taking, our entrepreneurial spirit, it was that foundation that we laid&mdash;broad-based, mass education&mdash;that drove our economy and separated us from the rest of the world. Nothing was more important&mdash;the skills of our people, the investment we made in human capital. We were ahead of the curve. <p>But what's happened is, other countries figured it out. They took a look at our policies, and they figured out the secret sauce. [<i>Laughter</i>] They set out to educate their own kids so they could outcompete ours, understanding that in today's knowledge economy, jobs and businesses will go wherever you can find the most skilled, educated workers. Now, I don't want them&mdash;I don't want businesses to have to look anywhere other than the United States of America. I want to make sure we lead the world in education once again, not just because it's right to help more young people chase their dreams, but because it's critical to our economic future. <p>Now, the reason we're here is because we understand that although at the top end, our universities are doing unbelievable work and are still the envy of the world, for a lot of working families, for a lot of middle class kids, a lot of folks who are trying to join that middle class, higher education increasingly feels out of reach. You&mdash;a lot of college quads may not look like they've changed much over the last century. The people who attended them have. There are more minorities. There are more first-generation college goers. Working adults are returning to get degrees so that they can reach for opportunities that right now are foreclosed to them. Students are more likely than in the past to study part time. They hold full-time jobs. They have families. We used to think of these as atypical students; today, they're increasingly the norm. <p>But too many students who take the crucial step of enrolling in college don't actually finish, which means they leave with the burden of debt, without the earnings and the job benefits of a degree. So we've got to change that. All of us have a stake in changing that. <p>On the one hand, we've got good news, which is, 20, 30, 40, 50 years ago, college was still seen as a luxury; now everybody understands some form of higher education is a necessity. And that's a good thing, which means more folks are enrolling and more folks are seeking the skills that they'll need to compete. But if they're simply enrolling and not graduating, if they're enrolling and not getting the skills that they need, then we're not delivering on the promise. In fact, we're adding another burden to these folks. <p>And I get letters all the time seeing what that burden means, heartbreaking letters that I'll get sometimes from kids who thought they were doing the right thing, have $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 worth of debt, now feel as if they made a bad mistake trying to get a higher education. Now, as a nation, we don't promise equal outcomes, but we were founded on the idea everybody should have an equal opportunity to succeed. No matter who you are, what you look like, where you come from, you can make it. That's an essential promise of America. Where you start should not determine where you end up. And so I'm glad that everybody wants to go to college. You are too. But I want to make sure that it actually works for them. <p>And what that means is that we're going to have to make sure that more students can make it all the way across the graduation stage, not with debt that might limit their choices, but with the skills that will prepare them for the workforce. That's going to be critical. <p>It's why we're going to have to help more college&mdash;more families afford college. And that's why we've offered grants and tax credits that go farther than before. We've helped over 700 community college partners with over 1,000 employers to provide training for good jobs that need to be filled. We've reformed student loans so that more money goes to students rather than banks. And I took executive actions to&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;took an executive action to give Americans the chance to cap their direct student loan payments at 10 percent of their monthly income so people can pursue careers that may not be wildly lucrative, but are critically important to our society. <p>One thing we certainly shouldn't be doing is making it harder for more striving young kids to finish their education and depriving America of their talents and discoveries. And I bring this up because there's a bill that Republican leadership in the House are voting&mdash;have brought up that would force talented young people and productive workers and community leaders to leave our country. The immigration issue is, I recognize, one that generates a lot of passion, but it does not make sense for us to want to push talent out rather than make sure that they're staying here and contributing to society. So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. <p>Rather than deport students and separate families and make it harder for law enforcement to do its job, I just want Congress to work with us to pass a commonsense law to fix that broken immigration system. And there's a lot that Congress could do to help more young people access and afford higher education. I'd like to see us spend more time on that. <p>But in the meantime, there's a lot that you and I can do together even if Congress doesn't act. So that's why we convened the College Opportunity Summit in January, calling for action. We've already seen a lot of progress. More than 2,000 colleges are waiving application fees for low-income students. That's a big deal. Georgia State University, just to cite one example, is developing a new system to give small grants to students who might be a little behind on their bills. You've got the Posse Foundation planning to provide over 500 STEM scholarships over the next 5 years. <p>And what we heard from you is that in order to meet our goal of producing many more college graduates, we've got to draw on all of higher education, which means community colleges, big public universities, small liberal arts colleges. Everybody has got to be a part of the solution. And so that's what we did. Now hundreds of you have announced new commitments. I'm going to highlight a few of them in four different areas that we know are critical to student success. So you guys can pat yourselves on the back&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;as I mention some of the work that's been done as a consequence of this convening. <p>First, you told us that colleges and universities want to work together on these challenges. So rather than settle for islands of excellence, we asked you to collaborate and build networks where you can share best practices, test them out, and get a greater collective impact. <p>The National Association of System Heads, for example, has organized 11 State systems of colleges and universities behind one big goal, and that is to produce 350,000 more graduates by 2025. The University Innovation Alliance, which is a group of 11 public research universities from all over the country, has committed to producing 68,000 more college graduates by 2025. <p>And so what's happening is, these groups are partnering to develop and test new ideas like improving remedial math classes for underprepared students, using data and technology to figure out when a student may not have chosen the right major or is having trouble making it to class regularly so that they can intervene early, guide that student back on track. Maybe they need text messages reminding them to go to class&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;not a bad idea. [<i>Laughter</i>] Maybe they need to be paired up with a peer tutor. <p>My mom had an analog version of this. [<i>Laughter</i>] She used to wake me up when I was living overseas before dawn, and she'd make me study every morning and make sure I was keeping up with my English lessons. And it worked. And so nagging works. [<i>Laughter</i>] It does. Michelle and I are big believers in nagging. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Second, we know that the path to college begins long before students set on campus. We need our school leaders working with college presidents to make sure students are on track for college, that they're taking the right courses, filling out the right financial aid forms, applying to more schools, making sure they're prepared. That's what drives many of your promising tutoring and mentoring organizations. And that's why school districts and community organizations are partnering with colleges and universities to make sure that the pipeline is working, that low-income students are better prepared to succeed in college. So the Riverside County Education Collaboration in California has set a goal of increasing FAFSA completion by 30 percent, and they're working to ensure that fewer students need remedial classes when they get to college. <p>Third, we know that a lot of young people, especially low-income students, need a little more support and guidance as they prepare for and apply to college. This is something that Michelle is passionate about, because she knows firsthand the difference a good counselor can make for a kid who may be the first in her family to go to college. So Michelle is going to talk more about this and her Reach Higher initiative later today. I know that you will enjoy hearing her more than me. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's what happens. [<i>Laughter</i>] But both of us&mdash;just to give you a little preview&mdash;want to make sure that every child gets the kind of support that Malia and Sasha get. <p>And finally, we know that many of the high-tech, high-wage jobs of the future are going to be in STEM: science, technology, engineering, math. Many of you have committed to increasing the number of women and underrepresented minorities who pursue STEM studies. Some of you have pledged to prepare more K-through-12 teachers in STEM so they can inspire our future innovators. Others are engaging middle, high school, and college students in hands-on math and science learning to spark an interest in STEM careers. <p>So these are just a few examples, a small sample of the commitments that all of you have already announced, and we're looking forward to seeing what comes out of the work that you engage in in the coming months. And in the meantime, my administration is going to keep doing our part to support your efforts. <p>Today we're announcing a handful of executive actions that we can take immediately to expand college opportunity, including prioritizing grants for evidence-based projects, sponsoring research on improving college completion, increasing the number of AmeriCorps service opportunities to help more low-income students access college. <p>And our challenge going forward is to make sure your outstanding commitments mean something where it matters most: in the lives of young people. That's what Jeff Nelson, a former teacher who's here today, wanted to do. Where's Jeff? There he is, right here. I'm going to brag on Jeff for a second. [<i>Laughter</i>] Seven years ago, he cofounded a nonprofit called OneGoal. And it had one goal&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and so is aptly named&mdash;to help more low-performing, low-income high school students not only get into college, but make sure they've got the continued support to succeed once they get to college. <p>And one of their students is a young man from Chicago named Caleb Navarro. Is Caleb here too? Couldn't make it? <p><i>Audience member. </i>[<i>Inaudible</i>]&mdash;still hear. <p><i>The President</i>. Well, next time you got to bring him. [<i>Laughter</i>] But he'll hear about it that I was talking about him? I'll bet he will. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>So by the time Caleb was a sophomore, he wasn't doing all that well in school. He wasn't motivated to try harder; starting to give up on himself. The folks at OneGoal saw a spark of something that was special in Caleb. Once he joined their program, he started to believe that maybe he was capable of achieving more. Expert teachers helped him focus on academics and taught him how to stick with his studies, even when it was hard. Caleb started taking AP classes, something he wouldn't have imagined for himself a couple years earlier. He gave up his lunch hour to take an extra class. Now, that's serious, giving up your lunch hour. [<i>Laughter</i>] He started out with a GPA of 2.4, ended up with a 3.8 GPA. Today, Caleb is a freshman at Dominican University, studying biochemistry, on track to graduate from college. <p>Now, Caleb could have been on his way to becoming just another statistic. He was a good kid, so it might not have been that he completely crashed and burned. But what was likely, the trajectory was one in which he underestimated what was possible. He shortchanged himself. He lowered his expectations. And because of just some key interventions at a critical moment in his life, he's now studying stuff that I don't understand. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And if we can replicate Caleb's story, if everybody who's represented here, each of you are touching 10, 50, 100, 1,000 Calebs all across the country in a sustained way, figuring out what works, being honest when the evidence says something doesn't work and trying something different, investing in these kids in a sustained way, teaching each other how to have an impact&mdash;if we can replicate Caleb's story across the country, imagine what discoveries he and students like him might make; what businesses they may start; what entire industries may be launched; what new sources of energy may be discovered; what lifesaving medicines might be produced; what a set of Calebs can do to change the world. <p>That's the power, that's the purpose of higher education: to give everybody that chance. Because everybody has got that spark. Some know it earlier; others know it later. I happen to be an example of somebody who&mdash;it came a little later. [<i>Laughter</i>] But everybody has got a Caleb out there. And we've got to make sure that they have the chance not only to fulfill their potential, but by doing so, creating that chance for us to fulfill this country's potential. <p>We are coming out of this recession with the most diverse, most digitally fluent, in many ways, most sophisticated generation in American history. Anybody who's interacting with young people today comes away impressed. But they're also concerned, because these kids are growing up at a time when a lot of people have lost faith in institutions and are inherently skeptical about what's possible. And I want to make sure young people with that spark never lose sense of what's possible. <p>If all of us work together&mdash;teachers, parents, nonprofits, corporations, school districts, university system&mdash;if we make sure they remain the best educated generation in American history, there is no limit to what they can achieve, there's no limit to what this country can achieve. <p>So I want to thank you all for the important work you do. Stay at it. And I look forward to seeing you at the next summit. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless America. Thank you, everybody.\" "
"270" "\"Merry Christmas, everybody! We saw this party going on out back and we thought we'd join you. <p>I want to thank Secretary Jewell for not only the introduction, but for all that you and everybody who's part of the Interior Department and the Park Service do to protect the magnificent outdoors for our children and for future generations. And I want to thank Jonathan Jarvis, Dan Wenk, and everybody at the National Park Service and the National Park Foundation for putting on this special event each and every holiday season. <p>I want everybody to give it up for our charming Christmas hosts tonight, Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson. We have so enjoyed the incredible performers, including the one and only Patti LaBelle. And finally, thanks to all of you, who are here and watching at home, for joining us to celebrate this wonderful holiday tradition. <p>Back in 1923, school kids here in Washington wrote a letter to the White House asking if they could put a Christmas tree on the South Lawn. And more than 90 years and a few different evergreens later&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;the National Christmas Tree still stands as a symbol of hope and holiday spirit, and we still gather as a country each year to light it. <p>We still have school kids involved too. But this year, they've given all the State and territory trees surrounding the National Christmas Tree their first digital upgrade. Young women from all 50 States used their computers, using their coding skills to control the colors and patterns of the lights on these trees. So thanks to those wonderful students, it is incredibly impressive. It's actually one of the few things that Tom Hanks cannot do. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>But while lighting the tree has entered into the 21st century, the story that we remember this season dates back more than 2,000 years. It's the story of hope: the birth of a singular child into the simplest of circumstances, a child who would grow up to live a life of humility and kindness and compassion, who traveled with a message of empathy and understanding, who taught us to care for the poor and the marginalized and those who are different from ourselves. And more than two millennia later, the way he lived still compels us to do our best to build a more just and tolerant and decent world. <p>It's a story dear to my family as Christians. But its meaning is one embraced by all peoples across our country and around the world, regardless of how they pray or whether they pray at all, and that's to love our neighbors as ourselves, to be one another's keepers, to have faith in one another and in something better around the bend. Not just at Christmastime, but all the time. <p>And finally, this Christmas, we count our blessings and we give thanks to the men and women of our military, who help make those blessings possible. And as we hold our loved ones tight, let's remember the military families whose loved ones are far from home. They are our heroes, and they deserve our heartfelt gratitude and our wholehearted support. <p>So on behalf of Michelle, Malia, Sasha, mom-in-law, and our reindeer Bo and Sunny&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I want to wish all of them and I want to wish all of you a very, very merry Christmas and a holiday filled with joy. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\" "
"271" "\"Well, it is a great pleasure to welcome these newly elected Governors to the Oval Office. They represent a wide variety of States, but they all have a common interest, and that is, making sure that their constituents&mdash;who are also my constituents&mdash;are able to gain opportunity, work hard, prosper, feel secure. And that happens best when we work together, whether we're talking about Democrats and Republicans and Independents working together or whether we're talking about State, Federal, and local officials working together. <p>So I'm looking forward to having a great conversation with them on how we can build on some of the progress that's already been made. This morning we had a great jobs report showing over 300,000 new jobs created. We now have seen 57 straight months of private-sector job growth and the most jobs created this year since the 1990s. That's due to a lot of factors, but the main reason is because we've got great businesses and great workers. But what we want to make sure is that government is not an impediment, but is instead an accelerant of that kind of job growth, and I know that all the Governors here feel the same way. <p>So I'm looking forward to talking to them about how we can help on education, transportation, the health and safety of their people. And my main message to them is that we're here to help. The good news about Governors is, they usually don't have time to be ideological because people expect them to deliver. And that's very much my attitude going into my last 2 years of office. So I look forward to having an opportunity to get to know all of them individually, but also to be able to deliver on behalf of their people. All right? <p>Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you so much.\" "
"272" "\"Hi, everybody. Just in time for the holiday season, we now have another piece of good news about the pace of our economic recovery. Last month, our businesses created 314,000 new jobs. And that's not a fluke. It keeps up the solid pace of job creation we've seen all year long. November was the 10th month in a row we've added more than 200,000 jobs. So far this year, our economy has created 2.65 million new jobs. That's the most of any year since the 1990s, even with a full month to go. All told, our businesses have created 10.9 million new jobs over the past 57 months. And that's the longest streak of private-sector job creation on record. <p>We also know that the upswing in job growth this year has come in industries with higher wages. Overall, wages are on the rise. And that's some very welcome news for millions of hard-working Americans. Because even though corporate profits and the stock market have hit alltime highs, the typical family isn't bringing home more than they did 15 years ago. And that still has to change. And a vibrant jobs market gives us the opportunity to keep up this progress and begin to undo that decades-long middle class squeeze. <p>But first, we need the outgoing Congress to pass a budget and keep our Government open. A Christmas shutdown is not a good idea. Then, when the new Congress convenes in January, we need to work together to invest in the things that support faster growth in higher paying jobs. <p>Building new roads and bridges creates jobs. Growing our exports creates jobs. Reforming our outdated tax system and our broken immigration system creates jobs. Raising the minimum wage would benefit nearly 28 million American workers, giving them more money to spend at local businesses, and that helps those businesses create jobs. <p>America, we still have a lot of work to do together. But we do have real, tangible evidence of our progress: 10.9 million new jobs, 10 million more Americans with health insurance. Manufacturing has grown. Our deficits have shrunk. Our dependence on foreign oil is down. Clean energy is up. More young Americans are graduating from high school and earning college degrees than ever before. Over the last 4 years, this country has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and every advanced economy combined. <p>The United States of America continues to outperform much of the world. And we are going to keep it up until every American feels the gains of a growing economy where it matters most: in your lives. <p>Thanks, and have a great weekend.\" "
"273" "\"<i>The President.</i> Well, good evening, everybody. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Good evening. <p><i>The President.</i> Welcome to the White House. Michelle and I love this event. Everybody looks so nice. [<i>Laughter</i>] This is one of our favorites. And as Lily used to say, that's the truth. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, I&mdash;as a President, I cannot stick out my tongue. That might cause an international incident. <p>But I want to start the evening by thanking David Rubenstein and the Kennedy Center Trustees and the Kennedy Center's new President, Deborah Rutter. Where's Deborah? Yay! I want to thank George and Michael Stevens, who produce this event every year. Lately, they've won an Emmy for it just about every year as well. So we are very proud to have them here. In fact, Michelle and I call this the \\"Stevens season.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>President Kennedy once wrote, \\"The life of the arts, far from being an interruption, a distraction, in the life of a nation, is very close to the center of a nation's purpose&mdash;and is a test of the quality of a nation's civilization.\\" <p>I think Tom Hanks will agree that President Kennedy was probably envisioning \\"Joe Versus the Volcano\\" when he wrote that. [<i>Laughter</i>] Although, I have to say, \\"Big\\" was on last night. And that&mdash;you know, so things balance out. [<i>Laughter</i>] But it's clear that the group on stage with me tonight understands what President Kennedy understood: that our art is a reflection of us not just as people, but as a nation. It binds us together. Songs and dance and film express our triumphs and our faults, our strengths, our tenderness in ways that sometimes words simply cannot do. And so we honor those who have dedicated their lives to this endeavor: those who have tapped into something previously unspoken or unsung or unexpressed; those who have shown us not simply who they are, but who we all are; those who are able to tap into those things we have in common and not just those things that push us apart. <p>Now, I'm going to start with somebody who I know all of you think about whenever I sing, and that's Reverend Al Green. [<i>Laughter</i>] I've been keeping his traditions alive. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>Audience member.</i> Do it again. Do it again. <p><i>The President.</i> No, I'm not going to do it again. I'm not going to do it. [<i>Laughter</i>] No. No. That was, like, a one-time thing. My voice didn't crack. It was a fluke. I can sing a little, but I cannot sing like Al Green. Nobody can sing like Al Green. [<i>Applause</i>] Nobody can sing like Al Green. That soul, that light falsetto. His music can bring people together. In fact, he says he can hardly go anywhere without a fan coming up to him, pulling out a picture of one of their kids, and telling him which one of his songs helped that child enter the world. [<i>Laughter</i>] I embarrassed the Reverend. Look at him, he's all, like, \\"Oh man. \\"[<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Al was born in Forrest City, Arkansas, one of 10 kids packed into a 2-bedroom house. In his early twenties, he signed with Hi Records and helped bring Memphis soul into the spotlight with songs like \\"Tired of Being Alone.\\" <i>Audience member.</i> Mm-hmm. <p><i>The President.</i> Mm-hmm. \\"Let's Stay Together,\\" \\"Take Me to the River.\\" <p><i>Audience members.</i> Mmm. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> They're thinking about all those songs and how it brought people together. [<i>Laughter</i>] In the 1970s, he became a pastor at his church in Memphis, and later, he started churning out a string of gospel hits that earned him eight Grammys. And as the years passed, he's woven together his gospel and soul careers, recently collaborating with the Roots, John Legend, and his Memphis neighbor, Justin Timberlake. [<i>Laughter</i>] And of course, he's still singing from the pulpit on Sunday. As he says, \\"The greatest thing that ever happened to me . . . the little boy from Arkansas, was that amidst all the doubts . . . I found peace.\\" For the peace he found and the soul he has shared with all of us, tonight we honor the Reverend Al Green. <p>On the night of Patricia McBride's farewell performance at the New York City Ballet, the crowd showered her with 13,000 roses. Thankfully, they cut the thorns off first. [<i>Laughter</i>] And that is fitting, because when you hear about Patricia, you hear about somebody who is all rose and no thorn, legendary for her good cheer, her sweetness, her unabashed joyfulness. And that personality translated to the stage, where her humor and grace was matched only by her power and stamina and incredible athleticism. She's one of the most versatile dancers we've ever seen. <p>Patricia became the principal dancer at the New York City Ballet when she was just 18 years old, the youngest to ever hold that role, and she kept at it for 28 years, longer than anybody else in history. By the time she was finished, some of our greatest choreographers had written dozens of pieces just for her, which is not bad for a shy young girl who grew up in the shadow of World War II, putting glue on the toes of her dance shoes to make them last longer. <p>She's the daughter of a single mom who worked as a bank secretary in a day when most mothers didn't work outside the home, who pinched pennies from that job and paid the 75 cents for each dance lesson. Today, Patricia hasn't forgotten where she came from. She and her husband Jean-Pierre are in charge of the critically acclaimed Charlotte Ballet, which offers a program that gives dance scholarships to young people in need. So for sharing her spirit and her smile in so many ways, tonight we honor Patricia McBride. <p>In \\"Nine to Five,\\" Lily Tomlin plays an undervalued employee whose chauvinist boss steals her ideas and screams at her to get coffee. [<i>Laughter</i>] Finally, she and two coworkers get so fed up, they kidnap him. They get to work changing the office. Working moms get treated better. Productivity rises. The top brass are thrilled. It's basically a live-action version of the working family policies I've been promoting for years. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's the&mdash;we've sent DVDs to all the Members of Congress to try to get them on the program. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>That role has Lily written all over it. It's edgy, a little dark, but fundamentally optimistic. She's created countless characters, from Ernestine, the telephone operator, to Lucille the Rubber Freak, to Edith Ann, the 5&frac12;-year-old philosopher&mdash;all of them kind of oddballs, like Lily&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;all portrayed with incredible warmth and affection, like Lily. She pushed boundaries as well. On her 1973 variety show, \\"Lily,\\" she and Richard Pryor performed a skit called \\"Juke and Opal,\\" about two Black folks hanging out in a diner. [<i>Laughter</i>] One reviewer called it \\"the most profound meditation on race and class that I have ever seen on a major network,\\" which says something both about Lily and the major networks. [<i>Laughter</i>] That was ad-libbed, by the way. <p>[<i>At this point, actor Lily Tomlin whispered something to the President</i>.] <i>The President</i>. [<i>Laughter</i>] In her one-woman show, \\"The Search of Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe,\\" written by her brilliant partner, Jane Wagner&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;yay, Jane&mdash;Lily played a dozen characters, transforming instantly into men and women, young, old, crazy, and sane. <p>And this versatility has led to a flood of awards: Emmys, Tonys, a Grammy, Oscar nomination. She's just inches away from an EGOT. [<i>Laughter</i>] And now she's a Kennedy Center honoree. When asked what she hoped her tribute tonight would look like, she said, \\"What I'd like to see is a big stream of gay drag artists come out as Ernestine.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] I haven't talked to George Stevens. I don't know whether this has been arranged. [<i>Laughter</i>] Although, I'd like to see it too. I think that would be fun. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I can promise that your contributions to American stage and screen will live on. For her genius, her compassion, for just being funny, we honor tonight Lily Tomlin. <p>About 40 years ago, a young singer-songwriter named Gordon Sumner was known to wear a yellow-and-black, striped sweater. Ever since, he's been known by one name: Sting. Now, not everybody can pull off a name like Sting, but this guy can. His wife Trudie calls him Sting. Apparently, his kids call him Sting. [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"POTUS\\" is a pretty good nickname&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;but let's face it, it's not as cool as \\"Sting.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] I kind of wish I was called \\"Sting.\\" I'm stuck with \\"POTUS.\\" The&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. <p>But everybody knows that Sting is more than just a name. He is an all-around creative force. There's his singular voice on classics from the Police: \\"Roxanne,\\" \\"Every Breath You Take,\\" \\"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic.\\" There's his incredible solo career, the songwriting that shape-shifts between rock and jazz and reggae and rhythms drawn from all around the world. He's acted in films. He's topped the classical charts. He just opened a musical on Broadway. The guy once turned down a chance to be a Bond villain. Who does that? [<i>Laughter</i>] Sting, apparently. I mean, look at him. He's too cool, right? [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Because just being a celebrity was never Sting's goal. This is a man who comes from humble roots. He's the son of a milkman and a hairdresser. When he was a child, he was so tall that his classmates called him Lurch. They've regret that now. [<i>Laughter</i>] That's payback right there. He's here. You, whoever you are, you're out there. So&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. Before he had any success as a singer, he had worked as a teacher, a construction worker, and in a tax office. And if a few things had gone differently, we could be living in a world with a really hip, cool tax clerk named Lurch. [<i>Laughter</i>] Instead, we've got Sting: artist, truth teller, a champion of human rights, a champion of our environment. And for all those reasons, and the fact that his music is spectacular and beautiful&mdash;for all those reasons, tonight we honor Sting. <p>One of four kids in his family in Concord, California, Tom Hanks once said his idea of a good time growing up was to take a bus to Sacramento. [<i>Laughter</i>] In the years since, Tom has flown a rocket to outer space, he's fallen in love with a mermaid, he's faced down Somali pirates, mooned the President of the United States. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm glad he got that last one out of his system before this evening. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Tom's career began just like so many Hollywood legends: dressing in drag for a show called \\"Bosom Buddies\\"&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;kung-fu fighting the Fonz on \\"Happy Days.\\" But he first won our hearts in comedy, with big hits like \\"Big\\" and \\"Splash.\\" I did watch \\"Big\\" last night. It's&mdash;that's a great movie. I love that movie. [<i>Laughter</i>] Got kind of choked up at the end when&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. And as the years passed, he told us \\"there's no crying in baseball,\\" \\"life is like a box of chocolates.\\" He told \\"Houston, we have a problem.\\" And as a cartoon cowboy, he showed us we can always keep our faith in a little boy. But Tom isn't known simply for his characters, he's known for his character. For his tremendous support of our veterans, he's in the Army Ranger Hall of Fame. For his support of the space program, he has an asteroid named after him. Through Tom, we've seen our World War II heroes not simply in sepia tones somewhere in the distance, but as they truly were: gritty, emotional, flawed, human. Through Tom, we saw the courageous faces behind an AIDS epidemic often overshadowed by stigma and bigotry. Through Tom, again and again, we've seen our passion and our resolve and our love for each other. As his friend Steven Spielberg once said, \\"If Norman Rockwell were alive today, he would paint a portrait of Tom.\\" <p>And people have said that Tom is Hollywood's everyman, that he's this generation's Jimmy Stewart or Gary Cooper. But he's just Tom Hanks. And that's enough. That's more than enough. And for that, we honor him tonight&mdash;Mr. Tom Hanks. <p>So, Reverend Al Green, Patricia McBride, Lily Tomlin, Sting, Tom Hanks&mdash;charm, soul, spirit, spunk&mdash;they've helped us better understand ourselves and each other. And, as President Kennedy expressed, they've helped us center our purpose as a nation, and together reflect the quality of our society. For that, we cannot thank them enough. We are so glad to be able to celebrate these extraordinary people. Thank you for everything that you've given to us over the years and for what you're going to give us in the future. <p>Congratulations. God bless you all. Please join me in saluting one last time our extraordinary Kennedy Center Honorees for this evening.\" "
"274" "\"Thank you very much. Everybody, have a seat, have a seat. Thank you very much. Thank you. Well, thank you for that introduction, Elliott, and your service. Thanks to all of my members of the Cabinet who are here today. And welcome, everybody who is here as well as joining us online. <p>My message here is simple: Thank you. I'd like to come bearing raises and perks and&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]. But I can't. [<i>Laughter</i>] But what I can do is tell you how important you are not just to me, but to the country. <p>Many of you do what you do at extraordinary sacrifice. You could work at a lot of places. You made a decision at some point in your life to serve your country. Your country is stronger because you made that decision. You keep America running&mdash;our airports, our Embassies, our financial system. You take care of our troops and their families. You do it without fanfare. In fact, doing your job right often means nobody hears about you. [<i>Laughter</i>] They only report when something goes wrong or when there's a shutdown and suddenly somebody notices, \\"Oh, we need that, and nobody is doing it.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And in recent years, it's gotten more challenging for so many of you. You work under tough circumstances, whether it's sequestration, pay freeze, shutdown, and more importantly, a political climate where folks too often talk down government for cheap applause. <p>So my main message is, thank you. But part of my message today also is to recognize that we do have an issue that we've got to address, and that is, Americans don't trust government like we used to. Part of that is a very deliberate strategy of trying to undermine government. Part of it is political opportunism. But part of it is our need to constantly adapt to the demands of a 21st century. <p>That's why we need you, and that's why we need the best and brightest of coming generations to serve. And that's why those of us who believe that government can and must be a force for good; those of us that believe that together, we can keep our country safe and guarantee basic security and make sure everybody has a shot at success; those of us who believe, as President Lincoln did, that there are some things we should and must do on our own, but there are some things that we can and should do better together; those of us who believe in both individual initiative, but also the common good&mdash;we've got to work harder to make sure that government works. <p>We have to constantly ask ourselves, how can we serve Americans better? How can we yank this Government into the 21st century and make it smarter and faster and more responsive? Because if all we're doing is hunkering down and trying to push back against complaints and criticisms&mdash;many of which are unfair&mdash;but we're not engaging in self-reflection and trying to figure out how every single day we can be doing our jobs a little bit better, then we're failing the American people, and we're failing an incredible tradition that helped to build this country that you are a part of. <p>So I've got a couple suggestions in this process; I want to know yours. But first, I want to just offer a few examples of people who ask themselves that question: How can I do it better every single day and, as a consequence, make this country stronger? Case study number one: When the Ebola outbreak began, Gary Penner and the State Department's Medical Services team helped swiftly transport American aid workers with Ebola to the United States for lifesaving treatment. And then Gary traveled to our Embassies in Liberia and Sierra Leone and Guinea to brief all our personnel in the region on the steps they should take to stay safe. And at a time of stress and fear, Gary and his team helped keep people calm and prepared and healthy. And so Gary's been an integral part of a team that, as we speak, is in West Africa saving lives. And for that, we want to thank Gary. <p>Example number two: We worked with the international community to destroy Syria's declared chemical weapons, which have made the region and the world safer. And it was Kevin Tokarski's job to help get those stockpiles out of Syria and onto a ship so they could be taken away and destroyed. You probably never heard of Kevin's team at the Transportation Department. That's what happens when you do your job well. [<i>Laughter</i>] Fortunately for the world, they did their job well, and we thank you, Kevin, for not making news and getting those chemical weapons out. <p>Example number three: Although everybody here is doing remarkable work, let's face it, usually, what we do isn't rocket science&mdash;unless it is. [<i>Laughter</i>] So Julie Kramer White is helping America launch a new era of space exploration. Julie is NASA's Chief Engineer for <i>Orion</i>, the new spacecraft that could carry humans farther into space than we've ever seen before. I'm sure you were all as proud as I was to see <i>Orion</i>'s first successful flight test last Friday. America was already the first nation to land a rover on Mars; when an American is the first human to set foot there, we'll have Julie and her team to thank. And at that point, I'll be out of the Presidency, and I might hitch a ride. [<i>Laughter</i>] So thank you, Julie, for your great work. <p>I could go on indefinitely. Our senior leaders here and around the globe are the best of the best. I have to tell you, by the way, increasingly, we're attracting folks from the private sector to come and work with us and help brainstorm with us around issues, and it always amuses me when they have been around here for a while and they report back to me, \\"Wow, these people are really smart; they really work hard.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] \\"Yes, it shouldn't surprise you.\\" But it's a testament to the fact that, too often, you don't get that notice. And with your help, we're working to give you a little more support to keep attracting the new talent that we're going to need for the future. <p>So first, we're creating a new initiative called the White House Leadership Development Program for Future Senior Career Executives. Talented civil servants are going to have a chance to rotate through different agencies on high-priority assignments, and then they'll bring back their new expertise to their home agency. We want great ideas to have the chance to spread. We want people to get new experiences that reenergize them, reinvigorate them. We want those ideas to cross-pollinate across agencies. We want the next generation of leaders to have the experience of solving problems and building relationships across the Government. Because one thing that we have to acknowledge is that our Government often statutorily was organized for the needs of the 1930s or forties or sixties, and too often, we get stovepiped at a time when we need people with different skillsets and different agencies to be working together. So this is a terrific opportunity for folks to create networks across Government. <p>Second, we want to do more to recruit, develop, and retain exceptional civil servants, and nobody knows how to do that better than you. So we're creating a White House Advisory Group on Senior Executive Service Reform, and it's going to include leaders from large and small agencies as well as rising leaders. We want to hear from them too. And we also want to make sure you're hearing from your employees. Every year, they give feedback through the Federal employee survey, but too few of you see it. So starting today, all of you are going to have access to a website where we've assembled that feedback in a way that's clear and easy to read. It's called unlocktalent.gov. It's worth checking out. <p>One of the things that we know in the private sector about continuous improvement is, you've got to have the folks right there on the front lines able to make suggestions and know that they're heard and to not simply be rewarded for doing an outstanding job, but to see their ideas implemented in ways that really make a difference. Because most of the time, people get involved in government because they want to make a difference. And there's no greater satisfaction than when you see something that you identified as a better way of doing things implemented. <p>Third, in recognition of those who go above and beyond every day, we're creating an award to recognize outstanding service. I'm surprised this hasn't been done before, but we're going to start. When an American needs something from their Government, whether an education grant or a passport or help turning a great idea into a small business, they're interacting with many of you. You can make enormous differences in the lives of individual Americans every single day. <p>We are going to honor the people who do this job best. Because ultimately, that's what it's about, making sure our Government serves the American people. And I'm going to keep doing everything I can to support you and your teams. I want you to know that I've got your back, because I know that for many of you, this job is more than just a paycheck, it's a chance to serve the country that you love. That's why some of the best civil servants never quite leave the job. Even after they retire, or could retire, they keep on serving. <p>Which brings me to two public servants that many of you know. When Elton Lester began his career at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department was still pretty new. He was the only person of color in the General Counsel's office. And today, thanks in part to Elton's efforts, HUD's workforce has grown more diverse. And now Elton helps oversee every one of HUD's insured housing and assisted housing programs even though, after more than 40 years in public service, he could retire. He could be getting a check every month and not working. And that's dedication: that he's still showing up, because he knows his stuff and he wants to make a difference. <p>Dwight Ink was a member of the civil service under seven Presidents, briefed President Eisenhower, led the recovery effort after the 1964 Alaskan earthquake. I confess I didn't know there was an earthquake in Alaska in 1964. [<i>Laughter</i>] I was 3 at the time. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>When he was 70, he retired&mdash;kind of. He stayed active on the issue he's most passionate about, and that's strengthening the civil service; helped lead public administration organizations; wrote articles about how to make Government better. Today, Dwight is 92. He's still at it. He and his wife Dona are here with us here today. I'd ask all of you to join me in giving Dwight and all the retired civil servants here a big round of applause. [<i>Applause</i>] There's Dwight back there. <p>So there's&mdash;that's the kind of spirit of service that built America. That's the commitment that keeps America strong. And now it's up to us to build upon the work that generations of public servants have done to make our nation stronger and more prosperous. And every day, I am proud to be your partner. This is going to continue to be a tough environment. There's not going to be a lot of new money flowing. There is going to continue to be ideological battles about&mdash;for those who think that the market is king and there's no room for any kind of regulatory efforts to make our air and water cleaner or to make our workers be in a safer work environment, to assure that every child, not just some, get opportunity. It's going to continue to be easy copy for the press to focus on the 1 thing that goes wrong instead of the 99 things that go right. That's not going to change. <p>But what I tell my team in the White House every single day and I want to tell all of you, and some of you know this, and some of you have lived it&mdash;Dwight certainly has: There is no greater opportunity to help more people, to make a bigger difference&mdash;in some cases to help millions, in some cases to help billions around the world&mdash;than to be in the positions that we are privileged to be in right now. <p>And for the short time that we're on this Earth, I always tell my daughters there are two things you need to learn. One is you need to learn how to love and make connections with people, to show empathy and be able to stand in somebody else's shoes and understand what it is to be a friend or a spouse or a parent. And the other thing is being useful, just being of use: knowing that when you wake up every day, you have the chance to maybe make sure that somebody who didn't have a job last week has a job; to make sure that somebody who is driving to work gets there safely because the road is safe; to make sure that somebody who didn't have health care now has it and, as a consequence, are able to catch that disease before it kills them; to make sure that some child somewhere that doesn't have much of a chance suddenly gets that chance, and their whole world, their whole life suddenly unfolds differently because of what you did. <p>What an incredible privilege that is. What better way to spend your careers than what you do right now. I want you to wake up every day knowing that the President of the United States appreciates you for making that difference. <p>Thank you. God bless you. God bless America.\" "
"275" "\"<i>The President.</i> Thank you. Hey! Give Elajah&mdash;give Alajah a big round of applause. Thank you so much. Everybody have a seat. <p>Now, Alajah clearly knows where power is. [<i>Laughter</i>] She knows who has clout and who does not. You did a wonderful job. I'm so proud of you. Good job. <p><i>Student Alajah Lane of West Education Campus in Washington, DC.</i> Thank you. <p><i>The President.</i> You're welcome. [<i>Laughter</i>] In addition to Alajah, we have some important personages here. I want to thank, first of all, America's Secretary of Education&mdash;somebody who is so passionate about making sure every child gets a chance in this country&mdash;Arne Duncan. Where's Arne? We've got some of early education's strongest supporters in Congress from both parties who are here. We've got Bob Casey from the great State of Pennsylvania. We've got Representatives Richard Hanna&mdash;where's Richard? There he is&mdash;Jared Polis, Bobby Scott. <p>I want to thank the business leaders and philanthropists and mayors, all who came here from across America to make big new commitments to our kids. And I know we've got thousands of parents and teachers and alumni from Head Start and Early Head Start watching this live in New Orleans and Fort Lauderdale. So please give them a shout-out as well. Thank you, guys. <p>Now, you may know that last week brought some good economic news, building on the momentum that we've seen over the past couple of years. Over the first 11 months of 2014, our economy has created more jobs than in any full year since the 1990s. So already&mdash;we've still got a month to go&mdash;we've already seen more jobs created this year than any time in over a decade. Over the last 4 years, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and every other advanced economy combined. Overall wages are rising again, which is a welcome sign for millions of families. So for all the work we have left to do, America is outpacing most of the world. And if we seize this moment, we have the chance to lead the next century just like we led the last one and make sure that citizens in this country, our children, can have a better life than we did. <p>But in order to reach our full potential, kids like Alajah need a chance to reach their full potential. Because what makes America exceptional isn't just the size of our economy or the&mdash;our influence around the globe. That is a byproduct of a more fundamental fact about America: the promise we make to our children; the idea that no matter who they are, what they look like, where they start, how much their parents earn, they can make it if they try. It's the essential promise of America, that where you start should not and will not determine how far you can go. <p>And we're here today because it's never too early in a child's life to begin delivering on that promise. I'm preaching to the choir now, but I'm going to go ahead and preach. [<i>Laughter</i>] Study after study shows that children who get a high-quality early education earn more over their lifetimes than peers who don't. They're more likely to finish school. They're less likely to go to prison. They're more likely to hold a job. They're more likely to start a stable family of their own, which means that you have a generational transmission of the early starts that kids can get. Early education is one of the best investments we can make not just in a child's future, but in our country. It's one of the best investments we can make. <p>Today, my Council of Economic Advisers is putting out a report showing that for every dollar we invest now, we can save more than $8 later on, by boosting graduation rates, increasing earnings, reducing violent crime. And the study also shows that access to high-quality, affordable childcare means more employment and higher incomes for working parents, especially working moms. Not surprising there. I mean, men, we're getting better, but&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;we're not where we need to be. And moms, all too often, are juggling between work and childcare. When we have good, high-quality early childhood education, then suddenly, we're freeing up everybody to be on the field. <p>So early education is a win for everybody. It saves taxpayer dollars. It gives our children a better chance. And some States are proving that it's possible to give every child that chance. For 16 years, every child in Oklahoma has been guaranteed a preschool education. Georgia is building on their successful preschool program by launching something called \\"Talk With Me Baby\\"&mdash;which sounds like an Al Green song, but is actually&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;I'm not singing. I'm not. But it's actually a program to make sure make sure language learning begins at the very first weeks of a child's life. Now, let's face it, Oklahoma and Georgia are not places where I do particularly well politically. They're not known as wild-eyed liberal States. But it just goes to show you that this is an issue that's bigger than politics. It's not a red issue or a blue issue, it's about doing what's best for our kids, for our country, and that's an American issue. And we've had some terrific Republican as well as Democratic Governors and mayors who have really taken leadership on this issue because they recognize it's a good investment. <p>And that's why, in my 2013 State of the Union Address, I laid out a plan to make sure our children have every opportunity they deserve from the moment they are born. And I asked Congress to work with me to make high-quality pre-K available to every 4-year-old in America. Now, Congress hasn't gotten that done yet, but Democrats and Republicans came together to take some steps in the right direction, with new grants that will expand preschool for children across the country. <p>And in the nearly 2 years since I called on Congress to take action, we've seen 34 States, along with cities and communities across our country, take action on their own. All told, they're invested&mdash;they've invested more than a billion dollars in our children. In Michigan, a Republican Governor signed the nation's second largest State budget increase for early education into law. Last month, voters in Denver approved a ballot measure to renew and expand their preschool program through 2026. In New York, Mayor de Blasio made pre-K for all a centerpiece of his campaign. And this year, more than 50,000 children are enrolled in New York City preschools, more than twice as many as in 2013. So&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;must be a New Yorker here. <p>So we're making progress. But here's the thing: For all the progress we've made, for all the children who are on a better path, today, fewer than 3 in 10 4-year-olds are enrolled in high-quality preschool. It's not that working parents don't want their kids to be in safe, high-quality learning environments every day. It's that they can't afford the costs of private preschool. And for poor children who need it most, the lack of access to a great preschool can affect their entire lives. We've got kids in this country who are every bit as talented as Malia and Sasha, but they're starting out the race a step behind. And they deserve better. And the whole country will do better if we fix that. So that's what this day is all about. I'm pleased to announce that my administration will award $750 million of new investment in our youngest Americans. Secretary Duncan is awarding $250 million in new Preschool Development Grants to 18 States. We're giving tens of thousands more children the opportunity to go to high-quality preschool. Almost 3,000 preschool students in Nevada, for example, will be able to attend full-day preschool, instead of a half-day program. Montana will create new high-quality preschool programs that will serve kids in 16 communities, including eight communities on Indian lands. <p>And in order to create a full pipeline of learning programs, from birth all the way to the beginning of kindergarten, Secretary Burwell is announcing the winners of a $500 million competition that will bring early care and education to more than 30,000 infants and toddlers next year. So our children&mdash;childcare centers will partner with our Early Head Start Centers to help kids from virtually every State, from rural Virginia to my hometown of Chicago. <p>So we're stepping up, but as all of you I'm sure have already heard, investing in our kids is not just the job of the Federal Government, it's the job of all of us. So in my State of the Union Address this year, I promised to pull together a coalition of elected officials and business leaders and philanthropists who were willing to help more kids access the high-quality preschool that they need. And here you are. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Today we are delivering on that promise with a new campaign called \\"Invest in Us.\\" I want to highlight a few commitments that have been made by people in this room because I think it shows how much interest there is in this issue, how much evidence there is behind making the kinds of investments for our kids that we're talking about. <p>So first of all, you're bringing entire communities together on behalf of children. In Northeast Ohio, for example, Cuyahoga County, the city of Cleveland, local schools, businesses, foundations, and child welfare agencies have all embraced a single plan to ensure that all 3- and 4-year olds have access to high-quality education. So today the greater Cleveland community is announcing $10.2 million in new investments in early childhood programs. And that's going to make a difference. Susie Buffett is leading an effort that will invest $15 million in Omaha. That's making a difference, bringing folks together. <p>Second, as important as preschool is, you're working to make sure a great education starts even earlier. The George Kaiser Family Foundation reaches out to new parents in Tulsa with a hospital visit before the baby even goes home. After that, they provide parenting classes and literacy programs all the way through a child's third birthday, because they believe that every parent can be a teacher and every home can be a preschool. And as a consequence, they're committing $25 million, in additional dollars, to help achieve that goal. <p>Number three, you're supporting early education programs that we already have. So the Foundation for Child Development is working with the New York City Department of Education to help train early-learning teachers. Disney is giving away $55 million worth of books and apps for young learners. And judging by trick or treating here at the White House this year, if Disney wanted to throw in some of those princess costumes from \\"Frozen,\\" that will make a difference. [<i>Laughter</i>] I mean, there were a lot of Elsas. They just kept on coming, sort of nonstop. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>And finally, you're investing in new, innovative approaches that have the chance to transform the way we teach our children. So thanks to neuroscientists and psychologists and child development experts, we know more about how young minds work than ever before. So we've got the Bezos Family Foundation announcing a $5 million commitment to turn these new insights into new tools for teachers and parents so that our children get the most out of the time and money that we invest in them. And J.B. Pritzker and M.K. Pritzker, their Family Foundation is committing $25 million to build on cutting-edge research to help our most vulnerable children succeed. <p>So all told, in addition to what we're going to be doing at the Federal level, organizations here today are making more than $330 million in new commitments. [<i>Applause</i>] That's worth applauding. And that's pretty extraordinary. That's real money. Even in Washington, that's real money. [<i>Laughter</i>] But it's also just the beginning. So I'm calling on all Americans across our country to make their own commitments to our children. And I'm asking our Members of Congress for their commitment as well. Outside Washington, giving our children a fair shot from the earliest age is a priority that crosses party lines. So I hope that the new Congress next year will work with me to make pre-K available for all of our kids. It will not just grow the economy for everybody, it will change young lives forever. <p>Just ask Chuck Mills. Where is Chuck? Chuck is here. There's Chuck, right there. Chuck was born in 1962, youngest of six children, raised by a single mom. A lot of the kids in the neighborhoods where Chuck grew up did not finish school, and a lot of those young people ended up in prison. But in 1966, Chuck's mom saw a flier at a church for a new program called Project Head Start. Chuck became part of just the second class of Head Start students, and 2 years later, he had learned so much that he skipped kindergarten and went straight to first grade. And Chuck's been overachieving ever since. [<i>Laughter</i>] Graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy, Captain Mills piloted Marine One for two different Presidents. That is something that you want the best people for. [<i>Laughter</i>] Today, Chuck is the founder and CEO of not one, but two companies in Northern Virginia. \\"My life,\\" Chuck said, \\"can be summed up in the words, 'Wasn't supposed to.'\\" <p>\\"Wasn't supposed to.\\" Well, that's not just Chuck's story; that's America's story. America is a nation that \\"wasn't supposed to.\\" Our entire story is improbable. All of us are here because this country gave someone in our family a chance to beat the odds. None of us were supposed to. Those of us lucky enough to share in this country's promise now have a responsibility to ensure that for all the young people coming behind us who aren't supposed to, that they have those same opportunities. <p>There are a whole bunch of Chucks out there, all across the country. We have to invest in them. We have to invest in our communities. We have to invest in us. And if we do that, if we give every child the same chance that we got, then America will remain the greatest nation on Earth. And I thank all of you for the extraordinary efforts you are making in fulfilling that promise. All right? <p>Thank you. And God bless you. God bless America.\" "

Yay. Well, we're happy to be back. As you can see, I brought a little help this year. So I'm excited&mdash;welcome to Toys for Tots. Your first year. We're going to break you in slowly, okay? <p>But let me start&mdash;we're not going to talk long because we're here to actually do some work. But I want to just thank everybody who has been involved in this effort. Of course, Lieutenant General Osman, who has just been a tremendous partner for so many years. His leadership is really at the heart of what makes this drive possible. <p>But also Lieutenant General Richard Mills, Lieutenant Colonel David Johnson, and First Sergeant Lowery as well. Let's give them all a round of applause&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The President</i>. Yay! <p><i>The First Lady</i>. &mdash;&mdash;for their tremendous leadership. <p>Thank you all for all the hours that you spend picking up the donations, sorting in warehouses all throughout the area. This wouldn't be possible without you and, of course, your wonderful families here who help to make this possible. <p>We have a couple of other folks here. We've got White House Communications Agency folks and their families. Let's give you guys a round of applause. Thank you all so much for your work. <p><i>The President</i>. Yay! WHCA! <p><i>The First Lady</i>. And of course, to all of the marines from Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, plus their spouses and all of our military kids. Yay, you guys. <p><i>The President.</i> Yay! <p><i>The First Lady.</i> As General Osman said, this is the sixth year that I've been involved in Toys for Tots. And every year it's just a tremendous privilege to be able to be a part of making Christmas just a little brighter for a few kids across the country. <p>And we try to make it a big deal at the White House. We create competitions. I think this year the office that collected the most toys got a Bo and Sonny visit. [<i>Laughter</i>] So we did a good job this year. I think this year we're bringing in about a thousand toys from the White House. And so we're proud of our team at the White House for participating. <p>But we still have a lot of time. And one of the things that I just want to remind the public is that there's still time to donate. And we really want to urge folks out there to do everything in their power to donate to Toys for Tots. <p>And if you need to find out where to go, all you have to go&mdash;do is go to the Toys for Tot website. People can donate online. They can go by one of the dropoff centers. And each year, I kind of remind people that at times, one of the challenges is making sure we have enough toys for the older kids. It's always fun to buy the Barbie dolls and the coloring books, but we have to remember that there are teenagers out there too that need those gifts. And we try to make it a point to make sure that we're buying cool clothes for kids and electronic products and educational materials for teenagers as well. <p>So if you haven't already donated, don't forget our teenagers. They are looking for a merry Christmas as well. <p>So with that, I'm going to turn it over to my new helper, who I brought along with me. He is&mdash;he doesn't need any introductions. I don't know how good he'll be with sorting&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;because he doesn't usually deal in shopping in any kind of way. But we'll watch him closely to see if he can figure out which ones are girls, zero to 2, or unisex. It gets really complicated. So watch him, because he could really make your work harder. <p>So with that, it's my pleasure to introduce my husband, the President of the United States. <p><i>The President.</i> Hey! Thank you. Thank you. I'm the big elf. [<i>Laughter</i>] I'm like Will Ferrell. [<i>Laughter</i>] It is great to be here. I'm not going to talk long. I just want to say thanks to all of you for participating. I want to say thank you to Toys for Tots. Quick statistic: Since it started in the 1940s, Toys for Tots has distributed more than 469 million toys to more than 216 million children. I mean, that's a lot of dollhouses, that's a lot of Ninja Turtles. <p>But really what Toys for Tots is about is generosity and giving back. All of us are so blessed. Look at these beautiful kids here and wonderful families. And we are lucky. We're lucky, first and foremost, to live in the United States of America, and we're lucky to be able to look after our kids, and there are parents out there who love their kids just as much, but are going through a tough time. And for us to be able to make sure that that holiday spirit extends a little bit beyond just our family, but to people all around the country, it is a wonderful contribution. <p>While I'm here, I just want to say thank you to our Marine Corps for their extraordinary work. Our men and women in uniform and our military families don't just work to keep us safe, they're also strengthening our country here at home. They're volunteering at schools, congregations, our communities. With our combat mission coming to a close in Afghanistan, it means more of our extraordinary military members are going to be home for the holidays, back where they belong. And that is the most important blessing of all. <p>But what's also great is that we're now seeing our incredible military&mdash;some who may be leaving the military&mdash;able to provide that same dedication, that same sense of service to organizations throughout the country, sometimes in a volunteer capacity, sometimes in a professional capacity. And we are very proud of that. Lieutenant General Osman is just a great example of the ongoing spirit of duty and service that is instilled in our Armed Forces. So we are so grateful to all of you. With that, I want to wish everybody a merry Christmas, a happy New Year, and let's get sorting. I am positive that girls, zero to 2, that's perfect for the \\"Call of Duty\\" video game. [<i>Laughter</i>] Isn't that right? <p><i>The First Lady.</i> The what video game? <p><i>The President.</i> See, she didn't even get the joke. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The First Lady.</i> I wasn't listening. <p><i>The President.</i> She wasn't listening to me. [<i>Laughter</i>] Thank you, everybody. God bless you.\" "
"277" "\"[<i>The President joined the meeting in progress.</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> I'm so sorry I'm late, people. Usually, I've been on&mdash;I'm a pretty timely guy. [<i>Laughter</i>] But it seems like there's quite a few things on my agenda today. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I think we're going to bring in the pool. And I'm just going to make some quick remarks at the top, and then everybody can fill me in on the great work that the Council's been doing. Tell me when you're ready, everybody. All good? <p>[<i>At this point, someone said \\"We're all set\\" to the President</i>.] <p>Well, good morning, everybody. I just want to offer a few thoughts before you return to the meeting. Obviously, we've seen some significant economic progress here in the United States over the last year. Our businesses have added almost 11 million jobs over the past 57 months. This year, our economy has already created more jobs [than; White House correction.] in any year since the 1990s, with still a month to go. All told, since 2010, we've created more jobs here in the United States than Japan, Europe, and all advanced nations combined. <p>And one of the reasons that we've been able to create so many jobs here in the United States is because our exports have been strong. Last year, our businesses sold a record $2.3 trillion of \\"Made in America\\" goods and services. And these exports support more than 11 million American jobs, typically, by the way, jobs that pay higher wages. <p>And so this Council is designed to build on this progress. It is in part a factor in the progress that we've made. We've had some terrific suggestions from some of our leading businesses, but also some small businesses and medium-sized businesses who are starting to sell overseas. The recommendations that have been generated by these&mdash;the Council have then been implemented by our various agencies. And we're here not to rest on our laurels, but rather to continue to make a big push to sell even more overseas. <p>I've said before, I will go anywhere around the world to go to bat for American companies and American workers. We're going to keep on pushing trade agreements that benefit American companies and American workers and ensure that we've got a fair and even playing field, particularly in the fastest growing markets. We're going to work with Congress to try to renew trade promotion authority and secure approval for a very ambitious Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, which would create a higher standard for trade in the fastest growing, most populous and dynamic region in the world, the Asia-Pacific region. <p>We're also announcing&mdash;because manufacturing has been a real bright spot in our growing economy&mdash;some additional measures to boost manufacturing here in the United States so we can sell more manufacturing goods overseas. We're announcing today more than $290 million in new investments to launch two additional high-tech manufacturing hubs. One is going to be focusing on flexible computer chips that can be woven into everything from the gears in a helicopter to the fabric in your shirt. Another is going to focus on advance sensors that can dramatically cut energy costs for our factories. So far, we have launched 8 of these hubs, and we intend to get 16 done, so we're more than half of the way there. And they're helping us to compete for the next generation of manufacturing. One of the reasons that manufacturing has been growing faster here than the overall economy is because of real savings on the energy front, outstanding workers, but also, because our companies have retooled and once again made that investment in innovation that has been the hallmark of American manufacturing for years. <p>I also want to thank many of the folks around this room who've been working with us to find ways that we can increase and improve the pipeline for skilled workers going into the companies that ultimately end up exporting goods and services overseas. To make sure that our workers have those skills, today my Secretary of Labor, Tom Perez, is announcing a $100 million competition to help expand apprenticeship programs across our country. Many of the companies around this table have helped design it or are already participating in these apprenticeship programs. They give talented, motivated young people the chance to get an outstanding career. They get a pathway, a door open to them, that allows them to succeed and secure a position in the middle class, and it helps us recruit the kind of workers that are going to keep us competitive for years to come. <p>Finally, we've got real opportunities to make some bipartisan progress this year on some areas that will make us more competitive in this global marketplace. For example, today, our companies face the highest corporate tax rate in the world on paper. There are so many loopholes that some end up paying a much lower rate; some pay the full freight. It distorts our allocation of capital. It makes us less competitive relative to businesses that are headquartered overseas. We need to fix that. And I think that there's genuine interest on both the Democratic and Republican side in making that happen. <p>And so I just want to thank everybody on the Export Council for the outstanding work that you've already done. I'm looking forward to hearing about the recommendations that you have generated during the course of this meeting. And rest assured that I will be your partner for the remainder of my time in this office, making sure that we have the strongest, most competitive companies, the best workers, the best research and development, and the highest exports that we've ever seen in our history. All right? <p>Thank you very much. <p>Thanks, pool. Thank you, pool. <p><i>Director of Central Intelligence John O. Brennan/Central Intelligence Agency's Rendition, Detention, and Interrogation (RDI) Program </i><p><i>Q. </i>Mr. President, do you agree with John Brennan that the CIA's interrogation program saved lives? <p><i>The President.</i> We're talking about exports, Jon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News]. Thank you. All right. <p>[<i>At this point, the press pool was escorted out of the room, and the meeting continued.</i>] <p><i>President's Export Council Chairman W. James McNerney, Jr.</i> Listen, thank you very much, Mr. President. If you look historically at the PEC, there has never been a time in its history where the administration, you personally, and the people on your Cabinet have supported this group to a greater extent. And we feel that engagement, and your presence here today once again makes that point. It energizes us, and I think it moves the agenda along. What we did today, we focused heavily on trade with Ambassador Froman. I'd like to maybe come back and get your perspective on how we're going to move that forward. Everybody in the room is leaning forward in every kind of way to get that done. <p>I think we reported out on the basis of six of our subcommittees' recommendations we're going to send to you, which you will get in due course. I think the other thing we talked about was a fact-finding trip we made to Turkey and Poland, which I think gave everybody in this group an on-the-ground understanding of the leadership&mdash;the impact of the leadership of Penny and Mike and others on furthering our&mdash;on furthering things along. <p>But I think if there were two things I would just sort of tee up&mdash;and I know we have limited time with you&mdash;one would be getting these things done. We all think it's the right time, and you've suggested that to us at the BRT and some other places. Any comments you'd have for us to help you get it done. <p>And then the other thing that came up is China. You've spent a lot of time with President Xi personally connecting. Penny is going to take the leadership role, starting in Chicago next week, JCCT. We're trying to engage. But any comments on China would be&mdash;those are sort of the themes that came out of the group this morning. <p><i>The President.</i> Yes. Well, if you heard from Mike Froman, then you heard from&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Chairman McNerney.</i> The Oracle. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i>&mdash;&mdash;the guy who's in the trenches on these trade negotiations. I'll just give you a couple of quick top lines. <p>First of all, I'm much more optimistic about us being able to close out an agreement with our TPP partners than I was last year. Doesn't mean that it's a done deal, but I think the odds of us being able to get a strong agreement are significantly higher than 50-50, whereas last year I think it was still, sort of, up for grabs. <p>The question then becomes, assuming we are able to get the kind of agreement that is good for American workers and good for American businesses, how do we proceed in Congress? I think that despite the fact that we had an election I did not&mdash;I wasn't that happy with&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;the dynamics really don't change in terms of the number of votes in the House and the Senate that are there to be gotten for a good trade deal. But we have to make the case. And I think we can make a very strong case that what we're doing here is really setting a higher bar that will give us more access to markets, will give us greater IP protection, will make sure that U.S. companies both in goods and in services are less disadvantaged by nontariff barriers and state support and procurement practices in these countries than they've been in the past. <p>The pushback that we're going to get domestically derives from a couple of sources. One is from not just labor&mdash;not just organized labor, but a public perception generally that trade has resulted in an erosion of our manufacturing base as companies moved overseas in search of lower wage labor. And my essential response to those arguments is not to deny that there have been some consequences to China's accession to the WTO and offshoring, but rather, that that horse is out of the barn. We are now in the worst of all worlds where they have access to our markets, much of that shift in search of low-wage labor has already occurred, and yet we don't have the access to those markets that are growing and no levers to force these other countries to increase their labor standards and their environmental standards. <p>So that instead of fighting the last war, what we need to be doing is looking forward. And there's no doubt that what Mike is negotiating creates higher labor standards and greater access than the status quo. And that's what we should be measuring against. <p>I'll give you just one very specific example, and that's Vietnam. I mean, Vietnam is probably the most interesting country involved in these negotiations: A, it's still a one-party system that provides workers very few rights, if any; and yet, in order to be part of TPP, they're having to make some pretty radical shifts in how they treat workers. Now, it's&mdash;they're not going to suddenly have the same labor standards as Germany does, but there's going to be an improvement. And by us establishing a baseline for labor rights even in a country that has traditionally had no labor rights, we're improving our position, not deteriorating our position. <p>The same is true for the other set of critics that we may receive, and that is from the environmental community, although, there's a&mdash;divisions between the large environmental groups. As I said at the BRT, I don't know exactly what Malaysia's environmental rules are, but I guarantee you, they are lower than ours. [<i>Laughter</i>] And it&mdash;for us to be able to include in a TPP agreement basic environmental standards is a win for us. It puts us not at a disadvantage, it puts us at more of an advantage. <p>The final criticism&mdash;not the final, but another criticism that we're going to receive domestically is this issue of&mdash;what's the term of art in terms of lawsuits? <p><i>Q. </i>[<i>Inaudible</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Right. And we've looked at the facts, and generally speaking, I think the language that's being used allows every country to maintain its public health and safety and welfare provisions. Really, what we're trying to get at here is making sure that foreign companies are not treated differently than domestic companies. That's the primary concern, is a discriminatory application of rules in ways that are arbitrary. And I think that that's something that all of us should agree on. <p>The big bugaboo that's lifted up there is tobacco companies suing poorer countries to make sure that antismoking legislation is banned or at least tying them up with so much legislation&mdash;or so much litigation that ultimately, smaller countries cave. <p>Those are issues that I think can be negotiated. There are some areas of particular sensitivity or concern. But overall, the principle that we should make sure that U.S. companies, when they invest or export to other countries, are abiding with their safety rules, but that those public health and safety rules are not being discriminatorily applied or a ruse in order to keep us out. That should be something everybody is in favor of. <p>So in terms of timing, how TPP happens versus TPA, I think regardless of the sequence, we're going to have to make the sale, and it's going to be very important for business to be out there and champion this and show that this is ultimately good for you, for your suppliers, for your workers. And if you look at all the major exporters, you take a Boeing, presumably in every congressional district, you've got to find&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>Chairman McNerney</i>. A bunch of suppliers. <p><i>The President</i>. &mdash;&mdash;a bunch of suppliers who are making the case, and their workers are making the case. So it's not just a bunch of CEOs calling, but it's people who understand that they've got a stake in it. So I think that's on the labor front. On China, all of what we're doing with TPP has a direct application to China. China is actually not that complicated. They will take whatever they can get. They will exploit every advantage that they have until they meet some resistance. But they have a great interest in the relationship with the United States and recognize the interdependence that has evolved between our two economies. <p>And so the key with China, I think, is to continue to simply press them on those areas where trade is imbalanced, whether it's on their currency practices, whether it's on IP protection, whether it's on their state-owned enterprises. The business investment treaty that they have shown an interest in negotiating could end up being a significant piece of business. We actually saw some movement during my last trip on issues surrounding technology. And I think that it's indicative of their interest in trying to get this right. <p>And by the way, if we get&mdash;there's been some suggestion that by doing TPP we're trying to contain or disadvantage China. We're actually not. What we are trying to do is make sure that rather than a race to the bottom in the region, there's a reasonable bar within which we can operate. And we hope that then China actually joins us in not necessarily formally being a member of TPP, but in adopting some of the best practices that ensure fairness in operations. <p>So&mdash;and the climate change announcement that we made was very significant. For those of you who are impacted by the power plant rule that the EPA is initiating here, it's good to know that one of the arguments that's always been made about us dealing with climate change or environmental issues generally here in the United States is, well, it puts us at a disadvantage with China. Well, we're trying to take away that excuse by making sure that China is also abiding by higher standards and in a verifiable way. So we're going to be focused on that. Okay? <p><i>Chairman McNerney.</i> Do you have time for one more question? <p><i>The President.</i> One more question. <p><i>Chairman McNerney.</i> I think one of the things we talked about this morning with Vice President Biden was Russia sanctions. And I think, by and large, the business community, while there's some debate about exactly to what degree this, that, or the other thing, that these have been implemented very successfully and very methodically, worked well with the business community to maximize impact, while minimizing impact to us. <p>And so there was a pretty robust discussion that I think many of us in the room ended up saying, whether we're in the third inning or the eighth inning, just keep moving. And then, there's a lot of support in the business community for what you're doing, keeping Europe lined up, which is our biggest concern. Merkel seems to be hanging in there. And anyway, the Vice President gave us a very robust discussion. Any views from you? I know you've talked to a lot of your peers on the subject. <p><i>The President.</i> Joe has been very close to this, so he probably gave you a pretty sound overview. I think you identified what's been important in this process, and that is our ability to keep Europe in lockstep with us. There may be some movement out of Congress for us to get out ahead of Europe further. We have argued that that would be counterproductive. And we may need some help from the business community in making that argument to the soon-to-be chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and others. <p>Putin does not have good cards, and he actually has not played them as well as sometimes the Western press seems to give him credit for. There's been an improvisational quality to this whole process because the situation in Ukraine actually took Russia by surprise. And it's working for him politically, domestically, but profoundly damaging in terms of their economy long term, not just short term. <p>Where Putin will succeed is if it creates a rift in the transatlantic relationship. If you start seeing Europe divided from the United States, that would be a strategic victory. And I'm intent on preventing that. And the way to prevent it is making sure that we are taking into account the very real economic impact on Europe from these sanctions, being measured in terms of how we apply them, and having some strategic patience. <p>The notion that we can simply ratchet up sanctions further and further and further, and then, ultimately, Putin changes his mind I think is a miscalculation. What will ultimately lead to Russia making a strategic decision is if they recognize that Europe is standing with us and will be in it for the long haul and we are in fact patient. And if they see that there aren't any cracks in the coalition, then, over time, you could see them saying that the costs to their economy outweigh whatever strategic benefits that they get. <p>So you've got, I'm sure, everything about Ukraine, soup to nuts, from Joe. I'll just emphasize as a takeaway for the business community that we are being&mdash;we have been successful with sanctions precisely because we've been systematic about it and made sure there wasn't a lot of daylight between us and the Europeans. That should continue. And even though sometimes, it's tempting for us to say we can go further, it won't benefit&mdash;it won't do us any good if it means suddenly, Europe peels off and then are backfilling various things that U.S. companies are obliged to abide by. <p>All right? <p><i>Chairman McNerney.</i> Terrific. Thank you very much. <p><i>The President.</i> Thank you for the great work you're doing. Keep it up.\" "
"278" "\"Hi, everybody. It's the holidays, a season to give thanks for our many blessings: the love of family, the joy of good friends, the bonds of community, the freedom we cherish as Americans, the peace and justice we seek in the world. <p>As we go about our days, as we gather with loved ones and friends, it's important to remember: Our way of life&mdash;the freedom, prosperity and security that we enjoy as Americans&mdash;is not a gift that is simply handed to us. It has to be earned, by every generation. And no one sacrifices more to preserve our blessings than our extraordinary men and women in uniform. <p>That's why, on Monday, I'll be visiting our troops at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey, to salute them for their service and thank them for their sacrifices. Since our nation was attacked on 9/11, these men and women, like so many others in uniform, have met every mission we've asked of them. They deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq. In more than a decade of war, this 9/11 generation has worked with the Afghan people to help them reclaim their communities and prevent terrorist attacks against our own country. <p>Now, many of our troops are returning from Afghanistan, and on Monday, I'll be proud to help welcome them home. That's because, this month, our combat mission in Afghanistan will be over. Our war in Afghanistan is coming to a responsible end. <p>Of course, the end of our combat mission in Afghanistan doesn't mean the end of challenges to our security. We'll continue to work with Afghans to make sure their country is stable and secure and is never again used to launch attacks against America. The troops I'll visit on Monday have been part of our mission to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL in Iraq and Syria. They've been supporting our efforts in West Africa to fight the Ebola epidemic and save lives. Because in time of crisis and challenge, the world turns to America for leadership. And when the world calls on America, we call on the brave men and women of our armed forces to do what no one else can. <p>So this holiday season, as we give thanks for the blessings in our own lives, let's also give thanks to our men and women in uniform who make those blessings possible. Even as some are coming home for the holidays, many more will be far from their families, who sacrifice along with them. <p>There are so many ways we can express our gratitude to our troops, their families and our veterans. Everyone can do something. To find out what you can do, just go to joiningforces.gov. As a nation, as Americans, let's always keep striving to serve them as well as they have always served us. <p>Thank you, have a great weekend, and God bless our troops and their families.\" "
"279" "\"Thank you! Thank you so much. Everybody, have a seat. Merry Christmas, everybody. Give it up for Santa's biggest, baddest elf: our host, The Rock. Dwayne is tough as nails on the outside, but as you heard earlier, he is a big softie on the inside. Even played me once on \\"Saturday Night Live.\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] You can see the resemblance. I have a little more hair. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I want to thank all the incredible performers for dazzling us with their talents tonight. Give them a big round of applause. And we want to thank all the people behind the scenes who've helped make this wonderful event possible every single year. <p>For 33 years, \\"Christmas in Washington\\" has benefited a remarkable institution, Children's National Medical Center. That's where dedicated medical professionals provide world-class care to our most precious resource&mdash;our children&mdash;every single day of the year. Of course, this holiday is all about the birth of a child more than 2,000 years ago. A young soon-to-be mother and her husband of modest means traveled to Bethlehem and sought shelter for the night, and they found it in a manger. And in the lowliest of surroundings, a Savior was born who would change the world. <p>Jesus Christ lived a life of peace, of love and kindness and forgiveness. He ministered to the poor and to the sick, to the stranger and the outcast on society's margins. His life of service teaches us that our individual salvation is wrapped up in the salvation of others. And two millennia later, it lifts the hearts of billions around the world, Christians and non-Christians alike. <p>In the hustle and bustle of Christmas season, may we all do our best to follow his example, to reach out to someone whose Christmas isn't so jolly, to turn our blessings into kindness and compassion, to treat one another the way we would like to be treated. That's the real Christmas spirit. <p>To all our men and women in uniform serving far from home and to the families who miss them, we thank you for your service and sacrifice, and we're thinking of you this holiday season. And to every American, from the Obama family to yours, merry Christmas. God bless you, and God bless America. <p>Thank you very much.\" "
"280" "\"<i>The President.</i> Hello, McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst! Thank you, General Martin, for the introduction and for your great leadership of the Air Force Expeditionary Center. I want to thank all the outstanding leaders for coming to welcome me here today, including General Maggie Boor and Colonel James Hodges. I want to thank the folks who are the backbone of our military: Give a big round of applause for your incredible senior NCOs. <p>Now, this is one of our Nation's premier joint military bases. Everybody's here. We've got Army. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> We've got Navy. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> We've got Air Force. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President.</i> We've got Marines. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! <p><i>The President. </i>And we've got some Coast Guard. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hooah! [<i>Laughter</i>] <p><i>The President.</i> Who's that one Coast Guard? There you go. That was loud, right there. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>All of you come together as one great American team. And I know that we also have some spouses and families here today. Your wives, your husbands, your partners, your sons, your daughters&mdash;they serve as well. They make their own sacrifices, especially when you're deployed. So our military families are the heroes on the homefront. Give it up for our remarkable military families. <p>We've got some outstanding elected officials who support the mission of this facility each and every day. I want to thank Governor Christie for joining us here today. We've got some outstanding Members of Congress who are here: Bob Menendez, Cory Booker, Congressmen Jon Runyan, Congressman Donald Norcross, and incoming Congressman Tom MacArthur. And they were already lobbying me about the base on the way in, so they're doing a good job. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>It is great to be back. I was here last year and visited with some of you on my way to the Jersey Shore. Christie and I went down to Asbury Park, spent some time on the boardwalk. We played a little Frog Bog. Chris's kids taught me how to hit the hammer to get those little frogs into the buckets. It was hard. And then, Christie beat me at football toss, which really aggravated me. [<i>Laughter</i>] And he bragged about it afterwards, which is okay, but I will get a rematch at some point. But we weren't there just to have fun. We came because, after Hurricane Sandy, people across this State&mdash;including those of you here at this base&mdash;you had to pick yourselves up, pull together, rebuild, show that here in New Jersey, here in America, we are stronger than any storm. Like a friend of mine from New Jersey likes to say, \\"Wherever this flag's flown, we take care of our own.\\" And that's what we do here in New Jersey. That's what we do all across America. <p>And this facility exemplifies that spirit. For nearly a century, our flag has flown right here. Millions of Americans passed through the old Fort Dix. This was where they shipped out. This was where they were welcomed home. One of them was Don Drysdale, Hall of Fame Dodgers pitcher. And he had the same thought as a lot of new recruits at basic training: \\"What the hell am I doing here?\\" [<i>Laughter</i>] Another recruit remembered, \\"I cleaned a lot of latrines with toothbrushes.\\" <p>Among those who were demobilized here was a soldier from Tennessee, serial number 53310761, a guy named Sergeant Elvis Presley. He was all shook up. [<i>Laughter</i>] His homecoming was a little different though. Apparently, the King drove off in a limo. [<i>Laughter</i>] Now, if it were up to me, I'd give all you all limos when you come home. <p>Because part of the message I'm here to deliver on behalf of the American people is very simple: It's just to say thank you. Thank you for your extraordinary service. I thank you as your President because you inspire me. And of all the privileges I have in serving in this office, nothing comes close to the honor of serving as your Commander in Chief. <p>And I also thank you on behalf of more than 300 million Americans. We Americans may disagree and debate and argue sometimes. That is part of our democracy. It is messy sometimes. Sometimes, it results in some gridlock in Washington. But whether liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican, White, Black, Brown, rich, poor, no matter how we pray, no matter who we love, when it comes to our troops, when it comes to you and your families, as Americans we stand united. We are proud of you, we support you, and we can never thank you enough. <p>And that's especially true now, during the holidays. We can gather with family and friends because you're willing to hug yours goodbye and step forward to serve. After a long day, we can come home because you're willing to leave your home and deploy. We get to celebrate birthdays and anniversaries and holidays, go to soccer games and go to dance recitals because you're willing to miss those of your family. We're free and safe and secure over here because you're willing to serve over there. <p>That's the noble spirit of your sacrifice. That's the selfless character of our military. Those are the precious gifts that you give America, not just this time of year, but all year, every year. You never stop serving. You never stop giving. You guys are like Santa in fatigues. [<i>Laughter</i>] Although, I'll bet one of those C-130s is a little more efficient than Santa's sleigh. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Wooo! <p><i>The President. </i>I figured I'd get something out of our guys on that. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>I also wanted to be here, though, because after more than a decade of war, our Nation is marking an important milestone. Ever since our country was attacked that awful September morning, 9/11, our Nation's been at war in Afghanistan. Many people here have deployed there, or to Iraq, and you've deployed multiple times in some cases. There are people here who've lost really good friends, patriots who made the ultimate sacrifice, including 54 fallen heroes from this base, who we will honor forever. <p>For more than a year, Afghan forces have been in the lead to secure their country, and that means more of our troops have been coming home, including right here to this joint base. So let me just say to all of you who have returned from Afghanistan in recent weeks, on behalf of a grateful nation, I want to say welcome home. You're home for the holidays. And we're glad to have you back. <p>Now, this month, in just 2 weeks, the transition that we're making in Afghanistan will be complete. Afghans will take full responsibility for their security. This month, after more than 13 years, our combat mission in Afghanistan will be over. This month, America's war in Afghanistan will come to a responsible end. <p>Now, that doesn't mean everything's great in Afghanistan. Afghanistan's still a very dangerous place. But I want you and every American who has served in Afghanistan to be proud of what you've accomplished there. Because your generation&mdash;the 9/11 generation&mdash;has met every mission that's been given to you. You helped decimate the core Al Qaida leadership and deliver justice to Usama bin Laden. He will not be attacking here anymore. You helped to prevent terrorist attacks against this country. You helped push back the Taliban. You helped train Afghan forces to take the lead. You helped make possible a historic election this year and the first democratic transfer of power in Afghanistan's history. And despite all their challenges, Afghans are now looking to the future. And that's all because of you. That makes us safer, and it gives them a chance for a better future. <p>Now, even as our combat mission ends, our commitment to Afghanistan endures. We'll continue to have a limited military presence there because we've got to keep training and equipping Afghan forces, and we've got to conduct counterterrorism missions because there are still remnants of Al Qaida there. After all the sacrifices you've made, we want to preserve the gains that you've made. We want a stable and secure Afghanistan. And we want to make sure that country is never again used to launch attacks against the United States of America. <p>Now, this year is also a reminder that even as our combat mission ends in Afghanistan, there are still challenges to our security around the globe. In times of crisis, people around the world look to one nation to lead, and that is the United States of America. Even our critics, when they get into trouble, they're calling us. And when the world calls on America, we call on you, our men and women in uniform, because nobody can do what you can do. <p>One news article said it best: When our forces train here, folks who live nearby might \\"feel the ground shake,\\" because no other military in the world is as good as you, as ready as you, as capable as you, able to go as far, able to go as fast as you do and perform your basic missions. Nobody. Nobody in history has been able to do what you've done. <p>Which means we're leading the global coalition against the brutal terrorist group ISIL in Iraq and Syria. And you are doing your part, supporting the aerial refueling that keeps our aircraft in the skies and the airlift that moves our people and equipment into place. Some folks from this base are there right now doing incredible work. And to them, and to all our troops far from home and their families for the holidays, you are in our thoughts, our prayers, and we can't wait till you come home too. <p>Just look at the difference that you and the rest of our military have made. Rescuing thousands of innocent Iraqi men, women, and children that were trapped up on a mountain in danger of slaughter&mdash;you saved them. Airdropping food and water and medicine, saving countless lives&mdash;America led the way. That's what we do. <p>Along with our coalition partners, we are hammering these terrorists, taking out their fighters, their commanders, hundreds of vehicles and tanks, nearly 200 oil and gas facilities, the infrastructure that funds their terror. More than a thousand fighting positions, checkpoints, buildings, barracks&mdash;we're taking them out. That's because of the work that you do. We're cutting their command and control and supply lines and making it harder for them to maneuver. <p>In Iraq, local forces have held the line in some places and pushed back ISIL in other places. In Syria, our airstrikes are inflicting heavy losses on ISIL fighters and leaders. Because of you, we have blunted their momentum, and we have put them on the defensive. And these terrorists are learning the same thing that the leaders of Al Qaida have learned the hard way: They may think that they can chalk up some quick victories, but our reach is long. We do not give up. You threaten America, you will have no safe haven. We will find you. And like petty tyrants and terrorists before you, the world is going to leave you behind and keep moving on without you, because we will get you. That's thanks to you. <p>Now, this campaign in Iraq will take time. But make no mistake, our coalition isn't just going to degrade this barbaric terrorist organization, we're going to destroy it. And because this isn't just a military effort, we're going to keep working with those in the Middle East who believe in tolerance and opportunity and peace, because that's what the region needs. These terrorists only know how to destroy. And we know how to do something bigger, how to build the security and peace and justice that we can build with others. But none of that would be possible without you. That's American leadership. That's the difference you make. <p>In the same way that we're leading the fight against ISIL, we're leading the global fight against Ebola in West Africa. And you've been doing your part: deploying to Liberia and Senegal, improving airfields, setting up the logistics and command-and-control, building the infrastructure, manning that air bridge, airlifting food and equipment and personnel. You have been out front. <p>And if you doubt the impact that you're having, take a look at what's going on there. With your help, we've built new treatment centers. We're training more health care workers. We're delivering medicine and supplies. Other countries are now willing to come in because you laid the foundation. And this is still a terrible epidemic, and the world has to keep on stepping up, but in Liberia, where we focused our efforts, cases are starting to decline. Ultimately, we will have saved thousands of lives because of you. <p>As one of our American commanders said, \\"Everywhere I go, Liberians are waving; hope is what we're providing.\\" Or what&mdash;as one West African put it, \\"We've always loved America, and for them to come in and help at a time like this reinforces that.\\" That's the difference you're making. There are people who are alive today because of what you guys do. That's American leadership. <p>So stepping back for a moment, we're at a turning point. When I took office, we had nearly 180,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. By the end of this month, we'll have fewer than 15,000 in those two countries. We've now brought home about 90 percent of our troops&mdash;90 percent. The time of deploying large ground forces with big military footprints to engage in nation-building overseas, that's coming to an end. And going forward, our military will be leaner. But as your Commander in Chief, I'm going to make sure we keep you ready for the range of missions that we ask of you. We are going to keep you the best trained, the best led, the best equipped military in the history of the world because the world will still be calling. <p>And that's why it was so important that folks in Congress&mdash;Democrats and Republicans&mdash;came together and passed legislation that I'm going to sign to keep our Government open and funded for the coming year. And that includes military operations: the support and commissaries that your families depend on, a pay raise for you, health care for our wounded warriors and our veterans. You've always been there for us; we've got to be there for you. <p>And let me make one other point. At this time of transition, I know some of you will be returning to civilian life. I was talking about this with the two generals that I rode over with. We want to make sure you can enjoy the American Dream that you helped to defend. So we'll keep helping you with the transition assistance and the credentialing and the licensing to help find civilian jobs worthy of your incredible talents. <p>We're going to keep funding the post-9/11 GI bill and keep working with colleges and universities to help you and your families realize your dream of a higher education. And as many of you know, Michelle, the First Lady, Vice President Biden's wife, Jill Biden, everybody at Joining Forces, we're all going to be saying to every company in America: If you want somebody who's going to get the job done, hire a military spouse. Hire a veteran. That's the difference you can make here at home. Because that's also American leadership: the jobs and the opportunity and the country that we can build together as one American team. You understand that. You've trained for it. And when you get in the job, that's what you deliver every single time. <p>So I want to leave you with a story of somebody who has a special understanding of the American spirit. I just met them before I came out here, but before I came out, Yeoman Carrie Chavez and Staff Sergeant Ashley Montgomery, they did the Pledge of Allegiance and sang our national anthem, and I had a chance to take a picture with them out back. And I asked them where they're from, and they're from Jersey, of course. [<i>Laughter</i>] And, in fact, Ashley said that her dad had served at this facility 30 years earlier. So I asked her, had she ever left the base&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;and she said, yes, she had been deployed at four other bases. But that's one example of American service: a generation passing the baton to the next generation; entire families who have served our country nobly, dating back in some cases over a century. <p>But then there's another part of the American story. There's another young man I met. His name is Nelson Rieu, and Nelson's here today. Wave, Nelson. There's Nelson. Now, the reason I want to tell Nelson's story is because, unlike Ashley, Nelson wasn't born here on base, he wasn't born in Jersey. He was born in the Republic of Congo. And when his country slipped into civil war, he and his mother became refugees. And that was a terrible civil war. Over a million people died in that civil war. That was a hard life. When he was 20 years old, he and his mom got some incredible news&mdash;\\"the best thing that's ever happened to me,\\" he says. He had the chance to come to America. <p>So they land in Los Angeles, and Nelson said it was like being in a movie, all these glistening buildings and freeways. And they settled in Arizona. And Nelson barely spoke a word of English. So he took high school classes: English, American history; he earned his high school diploma. And then he signed up to serve a country that wasn't even yet fully his own. He raised his hand, took the oath, and joined the United States Air Force. And then, this past Fourth of July, he put on his uniform, he raised his hand again, and he took another oath to become a citizen of the United States. \\"The Fourth of July,\\" he says, \\"is my new American birthday.\\" <p>And today, Airman First Class Nelson Rieu is an engineering apprentice here on base, helping to keep his fellow airmen safe. And at 24 years old, he dreams of someday joining the Special Forces. And he says, \\"Freedom is the reason why I am in this country and [why I] wanted to be part of those who sustain that freedom. It's a great feeling to know you're the backbone of the greatest nation on Earth.\\" <p>So you think about that. You've got folks whose dads were born on&mdash;or who were born on base and who served going back generations. But then, you've got new Americans with that same patriotism, that same sense of what we're about as Americans, that same creed that we can all pledge allegiance to, regardless of what we look like or where we come from. We're fighting on the same team for the same values and the same ideals. <p>So thank you for your patriotism, Nelson. <p>And that's one of the things that makes America exceptional and what makes our military the absolute best in the world. It's not just your training or your equipment or your technology, although all that's important. What makes us special, what makes us the best, is all of you. It's your character and your willingness to say, \\"Send me.\\" Your dedication to duty and your courage and your readiness to defend our values and our ideals of freedom and liberty, not just for us, but for people all around the world. <p>You are the backbone of the greatest nation on Earth, and you will always be that. And for that, America is eternally grateful, and I am incredibly proud to serve as your Commander in Chief. <p>So happy holidays, everybody. God bless you. God bless your families. God bless our Armed Forces. God bless the United States of America. Thank you.\" "
"281" "\"Good afternoon. Today the United States of America is changing its relationship with the people of Cuba. <p>In the most significant changes in our policy in more than 50 years, we will end an outdated approach that, for decades, has failed to advance our interests, and instead, we will begin to normalize relations between our two countries. Through these changes, we intend to create more opportunities for the American and Cuban people and begin a new chapter among the nations of the Americas. <p>There's a complicated history between the United States and Cuba. I was born in 1961, just over 2 years after Fidel Castro took power in Cuba and just a few months after the Bay of Pigs invasion, which tried to overthrow his regime. Over the next several decades, the relationship between our countries played out against the backdrop of the cold war and America's steadfast opposition to communism. We are separated by just over 90 miles. But year after year, an ideological and economic barrier hardened between our two countries. <p>Meanwhile, the Cuban exile community in the United States made enormous contributions to our country: in politics and business, culture and sports. Like immigrants before, Cubans helped remake America, even as they felt a painful yearning for the land and families they left behind. All of this bound America and Cuba in a unique relationship, at once family and foe. <p>Proudly, the United States has supported democracy and human rights in Cuba through these five decades. We've done so primarily through policies that aimed to isolate the island, preventing the most basic travel and commerce that Americans can enjoy anyplace else. And though this policy has been rooted in the best of intentions, no other nation joins us in imposing these sanctions, and it has had little effect beyond providing the Cuban Government with a rationale for restrictions on its people. Today, Cuba is still governed by the Castros and the Communist Party that came to power half a century ago. <p>Neither the American nor Cuban people are well served by a rigid policy that's rooted in events that took place before most of us were born. Consider that for more than 35 years, we've had relations with China, a far larger country also governed by a Communist Party. Nearly two decades ago, we reestablished relations with Vietnam, where we fought a war that claimed more Americans than any cold war confrontation. <p>That's why, when I came into office, I promised to reexamine our Cuba policy. As a start, we lifted restrictions for Cuban Americans to travel and send remittances to their families in Cuba. These changes, once controversial, now seem obvious. Cuban Americans have been reunited with their families and are the best possible ambassadors for our values. And through these exchanges, a younger generation of Cuban Americans has increasingly questioned an approach that does more to keep Cuba closed off from an interconnected world. <p>While I've been prepared to take additional steps for some time, a major obstacle stood in our way: the wrongful imprisonment, in Cuba, of a U.S. citizen and USAID subcontractor, Alan Gross, for 5 years. Over many months, my administration has held discussions with the Cuban Government about Alan's case and other aspects of our relationship. His Holiness Pope Francis issued a personal appeal to me, and to Cuba's President Raul Castro, urging us to resolve Alan's case and to address Cuba's interest in the release of three Cuban agents who've been jailed in the United States for over 15 years. <p>Today Alan returned home, reunited with his family at long last. Alan was released by the Cuban Government on humanitarian grounds. Separately, in exchange for the three Cuban agents, Cuba today released one of the most important intelligence agents that the United States has ever had in Cuba, and who has been imprisoned for nearly two decades. This man, whose sacrifice has been known to only a few, provided America with the information that allowed us to arrest the network of Cuban agents that included the men transferred to Cuba today, as well as other spies in the United States. This man is now safely on our shores. <p>Having recovered these two men who sacrificed for our country, I'm now taking steps to place the interests of the people of both countries at the heart of our policy. <p>First, I've instructed Secretary Kerry to immediately begin discussions with Cuba to reestablish diplomatic relations that have been severed since January of 1961. Going forward, the United States will reestablish an Embassy in Havana, and high-ranking officials will visit Cuba. <p>Where we can advance shared interests, we will: on issues like health, migration, counterterrorism, drug trafficking, and disaster response. Indeed, we've seen the benefits of cooperation between our countries before. It was a Cuban, Carlos Finlay, who discovered that mosquitoes carry yellow fever; his work helped Walter Reed fight it. Cuba has sent hundreds of health care workers to Africa to fight Ebola, and I believe American and Cuban health care workers should work side by side to stop the spread of this deadly disease. <p>Now, where we disagree, we will raise those differences directly, as we will continue to do on issues related to democracy and human rights in Cuba. But I believe that we can do more to support the Cuban people and promote our values through engagement. After all, these 50 years have shown that isolation has not worked. It's time for a new approach. <p>Second, I've instructed Secretary Kerry to review Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. This review will be guided by the facts and the law. Terrorism has changed in the last several decades. At a time when we are focused on threats from Al Qaida to ISIL, a nation that meets our conditions and renounces the use of terrorism should not face this sanction. <p>Third, we are taking steps to increase travel, commerce, and the flow of information to and from Cuba. This is fundamentally about freedom and openness and also expresses my belief in the power of people-to-people engagement. With the changes I'm announcing today, it will be easier for Americans to travel to Cuba, and Americans will be able to use American credit and debit cards on the island. Nobody represents America's values better than the American people, and I believe this contact will ultimately do more to empower the Cuban people. <p>I also believe that more resources should be able to reach the Cuban people. So we're significantly increasing the amount of money that can be sent to Cuba and removing limits on remittances that support humanitarian projects, the Cuban people, and the emerging Cuban private sector. <p>I believe that American businesses should not be put at a disadvantage and that increased commerce is good for Americans and for Cubans. So we will facilitate authorized transactions between the United States and Cuba. U.S. financial institutions will be allowed to open accounts at Cuban financial institutions. And it will be easier for U.S. exporters to sell goods in Cuba. <p>I believe in the free flow of information. Unfortunately, our sanctions on Cuba have denied Cubans access to technology that has empowered individuals around the globe. So I've authorized increased telecommunications connections between the United States and Cuba. Businesses will be able to sell goods that enable Cubans to communicate with the United States and other countries. <p>These are the steps that I can take as President to change this policy. The embargo that's been imposed for decades is now codified in legislation. As these changes unfold, I look forward to engaging Congress in an honest and serious debate about lifting the embargo. <p>Yesterday I spoke with Raul Castro to finalize Alan Gross's release and the exchange of prisoners and to describe how we will move forward. I made clear my strong belief that Cuban society is constrained by restrictions on its citizens. In addition to the return of Alan Gross and the release of our intelligence agent, we welcome Cuba's decision to release a substantial number of prisoners whose cases were directly raised with the Cuban Government by my team. We welcome Cuba's decision to provide more access to the Internet for its citizens and to continue increasing engagement with international institutions like the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross that promote universal values. <p>But I'm under no illusion about the continued barriers to freedom that remain for ordinary Cubans. The United States believes that no Cuban should face harassment or arrest or beatings simply because they're exercising a universal right to have their voices heard, and we will continue to support civil society there. While Cuba has made reforms to gradually open up its economy, we continue to believe that Cuban workers should be free to form unions, just as their citizens should be free to participate in the political process. <p>Moreover, given Cuba's history, I expect it will continue to pursue foreign policies that will at times be sharply at odds with American interests. I do not expect the changes I'm announcing today to bring about a transformation of Cuban society overnight. But I am convinced that through a policy of engagement, we can more effectively stand up for our values and help the Cuban people help themselves as they move into the 21st century. <p>To those who oppose the steps I'm announcing today, let me say that I respect your passion and share your commitment to liberty and democracy. The question is how we uphold that commitment. I do not believe we can keep doing the same thing for over five decades and expect a different result. Moreover, it does not serve America's interests or the Cuban people to try to push Cuba towards collapse. Even if that worked&mdash;and it hasn't for 50 years&mdash;we know from hard-earned experience that countries are more likely to enjoy lasting transformation if their people are not subjected to chaos. We are calling on Cuba to unleash the potential of 11 million Cubans by ending unnecessary restrictions on their political, social, and economic activities. In that spirit, we should not allow U.S. sanctions to add to the burden of Cuban citizens that we seek to help. <p>To the Cuban people, America extends a hand of friendship. Some of you have looked to us as a source of hope, and we will continue to shine a light of freedom. Others have seen us as a former colonizer intent on controlling your future. Jos&eacute; Mart&iacute; once said, \\"Liberty is the right of every man to be honest.\\" Today I'm being honest with you. We can never erase the history between us, but we believe that you should be empowered to live with dignity and self-determination. Cubans have a saying about daily life: <i>\\"No es facil\\"</i>&mdash;it's not easy. Today, the United States wants to be a partner in making the lives of ordinary Cubans a little bit easier, more free, more prosperous. <p>To those who have supported these measures, I thank you for being partners in our efforts. In particular, I want to thank His Holiness Pope Francis, whose moral example shows us the importance of pursuing the world as it should be, rather than simply settling for the world as it is; the Government of Canada, which hosted our discussions with the Cuban Government; and a bipartisan group of Congressmen who've worked tirelessly for Alan Gross's release and for a new approach to advancing our interests and values in Cuba. <p>Finally, our shift in policy towards Cuba comes at a moment of renewed leadership in the Americas. This April, we are prepared to have Cuba join the other nations of the hemisphere at the Summit of the Americas. But we will insist that civil society join us so that citizens, not just leaders, are shaping our future. And I call on all of my fellow leaders to give meaning to the commitment to democracy and human rights at the heart of the Inter-American Charter. Let us leave behind the legacy of both colonization and communism, the tyranny of drug cartels, dictators, and sham elections. A future of greater peace, security, and democratic development is possible if we work together, not to maintain power, not to secure vested interests, but instead to advance the dreams of our citizens. <p>My fellow Americans, the city of Miami is only 200 miles or so from Havana. Countless thousands of Cubans have come to Miami, on planes and makeshift rafts, some with little but the shirt on their back and hope in their hearts. Today, Miami is often referred to as the capital of Latin America. But it is also a profoundly American city, a place that reminds us that ideals matter more than the color of our skin or the circumstances of our birth, a demonstration of what the Cuban people can achieve and the openness of the United States to our family to the South. <i>Todos somos Americanos.</i> <p>Change is hard, in our own lives and in the lives of nations. And change is even harder when we carry the heavy weight of history on our shoulders. But today we are making these changes because it is the right thing to do. Today America chooses to cut loose the shackles of the past so as to reach for a better future, for the Cuban people, for the American people, for our entire hemisphere, and for the world. <p>Thank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\" "
"282" "\"<i>Audience member.</i> Happy Hanukkah, Mr. President! <p><i>The President.</i> Well, Happy Hanukkah to you! [<i>Laughter</i>] You stole my line. [<i>Laughter</i>] Happy Hanukkah, everybody. <p><i>Audience members.</i> Happy Hannukah. <p><i>The President.</i> Welcome to the White House. I want to welcome the Members of Congress who are here today. We've got some Bronfman Fellows, here from the&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]&mdash;who are here from the State of Israel. Obviously, the bonds between our two countries are unbreakable, and with the help of young people, they're only going to grow stronger in the years to come. <p>Every year, Michelle and I like to invite just a few friends over for a little Hanukkah celebration&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;nothing fancy. Actually, this is the second year we've invited so many friends that we're hosting two parties instead of one. This is our first party. It is the best party. [<i>Laughter</i>] Don't tell the others though. <p>I want to begin with today's wonderful news. I'm told that in the Jewish tradition, one of the great mitzvahs is <i>pidyon shvuyim</i>. [<i>Applause</i>] No, no&mdash;my Hebrew is not perfect, but I get points for trying. But it describes the redemption, the freeing of captives. And that's what we're celebrating today, because after being unjustly held in Cuba for more than 5 years, American Alan Gross is free. <p>Alan has dedicated his life to others, to helping people around the world develop their communities and improve their lives, including Israelis and Palestinians. He's a man of deep faith who once worked for the Jewish Federation of Greater Washington. Five years ago, he was arrested by Cuban authorities simply for helping ordinary Cubans, including Cuba's small Jewish community, access information on the Internet. And ever since, those who have loved and cared for Alan never stopped working to bring him home: Judy, his wife of 44 years, and their daughters, including his oldest daughter, who walked down the aisle without her dad on her wedding day; his mother, who passed away this year without being able to see her son one last time; his whole family, including his sister-in-law Gwen Zuares, who joins us here today&mdash;where is Gwen? Hey, Gwen&mdash;his rabbi, his friends at his congregation in Maryland, Am Kolel, who kept him in their prayers every Shabbat; Jewish and other faith leaders across the country and around the world, including His Holiness Pope Francis; and Members of Congress and those of us in the United States Government. <p>And Alan's fought back. He spoke out from his cell, he went on a hunger strike. With his health deteriorating, his family worried he might not be able to make it out alive. But he never gave up, and we never gave up. <p>As I explained earlier, after our many months of discussion with the Cuban Government, Alan was finally released this morning on humanitarian grounds. I spoke to him on his flight. He said he was willing to interrupt his corned beef sandwich to talk to me. [<i>Laughter</i>] I told him he had mustard in his mustache; I couldn't actually see it. [<i>Laughter</i>] But needless to say, he was thrilled. And he landed at Andrews in a plane marked \\"The United States of America.\\" He's going to be getting the medical attention that he needs. He's back where he belongs: in America, with his family, home for Hanukkah. And I can't think of a better way to mark this holiday, with its message that freedom is possible, than with the historic changes that I announced today in our Cuba policy, which are&mdash;[<i>applause</i>]. Now, these are changes that are rooted in America's commitment to freedom and democracy for all the Cuban people, including its small, but proud, Jewish community. And Alan's remarks about the need for these changes was extremely powerful. <p>So what brings us together is not just lox and latkes&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;although, I have heard the latkes here are outstanding. Am I wrong? Not as good as your mom's, but they're good. <p>We're here to celebrate a story that took place more than 2,000 years ago, when a small group of Maccabees rose up to defeat their far more powerful oppressors. In the face of overwhelming odds, they reclaimed their city and the right to worship as they chose. And in their victory, they found there wasn't enough oil to keep the flame in their temple alive. But they lit the oil they had, and miraculously, the flame that was supposed to burn for just 1 night burned for 8. The Hanukkah story teaches us that our light can shine brighter than we could ever imagine with faith, and it's up to us to provide that first spark. <p>This is something that Inbar Vardi and Mouran Ibrahim know very well. They are Israeli ninth-graders at Hand in Hand, which is a bilingual school in Jerusalem. For more than a decade, it's brought Jewish and Arab children together. So Inbar is Jewish; Mouran is Muslim. <p>Just 2 weeks ago, their school's first-grade classroom was set on fire by arsonists. In the weeks that followed, they and their classmates could have succumbed to anger or cynicism, but instead, they built this menorah, one of four that we brought here from Israel this year. Each of its branches are dedicated to one of the values their school is founded on, values like community and dignity and equality and peace. Inbar and Mouran flew here from Israel along with Rebecca Bardach, the mother of the&mdash;of a first-grader and second-grader at Hand in Hand, and in just a few minutes the three of them are going to join us in lighting the Hanukkah candles here at the White House. <p>So Inbar and Mouran and their fellow students teach us a critical lesson for this time in our history: The light of hope must outlast the fires of hate. That's what the Hanukkah story teaches us. That's what our young people can teach us: that one act of faith can make a miracle, that love is stronger than hate, that peace can triumph over conflict. And during this Festival of Lights, let's commit ourselves to making some small miracles ourselves and then sharing them with the world. <p><i>Audience members. </i>Amen! <p>I now want to invite Rabbi Bradley Shavit Artson to the podium, who can lead us in the blessings for the candle lighting. Rabbi.\" "
"283" "\"<i>The President.</i> Yay! Hello, everybody! <p><i>Audience members.</i> Hello! <p><i>The President.</i> Happy Hanukkah! <p><i>Audience members.</i> Happy Hanukkah! <p><i>The President.</i> This is a particularly good-looking Hanukkah crowd. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> It's good. [<i>Laughter</i>] It's good. <p><i>The President.</i> It's very impressive. <p>Now, every year, Michelle and I like to invite just a few friends over for a small Hanukkah celebration. [<i>Laughter</i>] Nothing fancy. This is the second year we've invited so many friends that we ended up having to have two Hanukkah parties. We had one earlier this afternoon. I have to tell you, this is the better party. Don't tell anybody because&mdash;&mdash; <p><i>The First Lady.</i> Because he said that earlier. <p><i>The President.</i> I said that earlier. [<i>Laughter</i>] But I really mean it this time. <p><i>The First Lady. </i>Okay.<i> </i><p><i>The President</i>. Yes. We are blessed to have so many friends and dignitaries here. I want to welcome Israeli Ambassador Ron Dermer, who's here, and his wife Rhoda; all our friends from the State of Israel, who remind us that the bonds between our two countries are unbreakable. <p>We have leaders from across my administration, including our outstanding Secretary of the Treasury, Jack Lew; Council of Economic Advisers Chair Jason Furman. <p><i>The First Lady</i>. Yay, Jason! Jason! <p><i>The President</i>. Give Jason some more&mdash;Jason actually is the guy who gives me the job reports every month. Ever since he's come on, they've been really good. So give Jason a big round of applause. <p>National Economic Council Director Jeff Zients is here. We've got the Governor of Maryland, Martin O'Malley. We've got all kinds of Members of Congress here, including our DNC Chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz; the president of the Anti-Defamation League, Abe Foxman; and a member of my team who's leaving to become ADL's next president, Jonathan Greenblatt. <p>Now, I'm going to begin by saying what a glorious day this is because, after 5 years, American Alan Gross is free. As all of you know, he was arrested 5 years ago by Cuban authorities simply for helping ordinary Cubans&mdash;including a small Jewish community in Cuba&mdash;just for accessing information on the Internet. Today, after 1,840 days, he is back where he belongs, with his wife Judy and his family. And as you heard Alan say today, this is his best Hanukkah. From his cell, Alan once wrote, \\"I refuse to accept that my country would leave me behind.\\" And he is right. We're committed to the principle that no American ever gets left behind. We do everything in our power to bring Americans home. So we thank all those who helped to make sure that Alan was never forgotten. And as now we're moving forward, we know that the historic changes I announced today will mean greater opportunity and progress for both Americans and for Cubans, including the small, but proud, Jewish community in Cuba. <p>So we are here to celebrate a story that took place more than 2,000 years ago, when a small group of Maccabees rose up to defeat their far more powerful oppressors. In the face of&mdash;what do we got playing there? [<i>Laughter</i>] What you got on your phone? I was trying to figure out the ringtone. [<i>Laughter</i>] <p>Where was I? Small group of Maccabees&mdash;right! Rose up to defeat their far more powerful oppressors. In the face of overwhelming odds, they reclaimed their city and the right to worship as they choose. <p>And after their victory, the Maccabees found there wasn't enough oil to keep the flame in their temple alive. But they lit the oil that they had. And miraculously, the flame that was supposed to burn for just 1 night burned for 8. The Hanukkah story teaches us that our light can shine brighter than even we could imagine, with a little bit of faith and making sure that it's up to us to provide that first spark. <p>The menorahs that we're about to light remind us of our power to make miracles happen. It was one of four that were brought here from Israel, and was built by children in Yemin Orde, a village in Israel founded in 1953 to provide a safe haven to orphans and young immigrants after the Holocaust. More than 60 years later, Yemin Orde still gives children in Israel a shot at a brighter future. And tonight Atakalit Tesfaye, a graduate of Yemin Orde, will help us light the Hanukkah candles. <p>He will be joined by Dr. Adam Levine. Now, I just want to be clear, this is not&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;Adam Levine, People's magazine's Sexiest Man Alive&mdash;[<i>laughter</i>]&mdash;although he's a pretty sexy guy. [<i>Laughter</i>] This is actually Dr. Adam Levine, Time's Person of the Year. Along with his compatriots, Adam, who recently returned from Liberia, has been doing heroic work for Ebola patients, saving lives. <p>Yemin Orde is just one village. But the story of Hanukkah teaches us that there's no such thing as a futile act of courage or a small act of faith. One doctor can save a life. One school can help a child. That life, that child, may change a village. One person can be the spark that changes the world. <p>So as we gather with family and friends, let's give thanks to the miracles that we've been blessed with in our own lives, miracles large and small&mdash;same ringtone. [<i>Laughter</i>] And during this Festival of Lights, let's commit ourselves to making new miracles and to sharing them with the world. <p>I'd now like to invite Rabbi Angela Buchdahl, from Manhattan, to lead us in the blessing and candle lighting.

"284" "\"Hi, everybody. As 2014 comes to an end, we can enter the New Year with new confidence that America is making significant strides where it counts. <p>The steps we took nearly 6 years ago to rescue our economy and rebuild it on a new foundation helped make 2014 the strongest year for job growth since the 1990s. Over the past 57 months, our businesses have created nearly 11 million new jobs. And in a hopeful sign for middle class families, wages are on the rise again. <p>Our investments in American manufacturing have helped fuel its best stretch of job growth since the nineties. America is now the number one producer of oil and gas, saving drivers about 70 cents a gallon at the pump over last Christmas. The auto industry we rescued is on track for its strongest year since 2005. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, about 10 million Americans have gained health insurance in the past year alone. And since I took office, we have cut our deficits by about two-thirds. <p>Meanwhile, around the world, America is leading. We're leading the coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. We're leading the global fight to combat the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. We're leading global efforts to address climate change, including last month's joint announcement with China. We're turning a new page in our relationship with the Cuban people. <p>And in less than 2 weeks, after more than 13 years, our combat mission in Afghanistan will be over, and our war there will come to a responsible end. Today, more of our troops are home for the holidays than at any time in over a decade. Still, many of our men and women in uniform will spend this Christmas in harm's way. And as Commander in Chief, I want our troops to know: your country is united in our support and gratitude for you and your families. <p>The 6 years since the financial crisis have demanded hard work and sacrifice on everyone's part. But as a country, we have every right to be proud of what we've got to show for it: more jobs, more insured, a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, booming energy. <p>Pick any metric you want&mdash;America's resurgence is real. And we now have the chance to reverse the decades-long erosion of middle class jobs and incomes. We just have to invest in the things that we know will secure even faster growth in higher paying jobs for more Americans. We have to make sure our economy, our justice system, and our government work not only for a few, but for all of us. And I look forward to working together with the new Congress next year on these priorities. <p>Sure, we'll disagree on some things. We'll have to compromise on others. I'll act on my own when it's necessary. But I'll never stop trying to make life better for people like you. <p>Because thanks to your efforts, a new foundation is laid, a new future is ready to be written. We have set the stage for a new American moment, and I'm going to spend every minute of my last 2 years making sure we seize it. <p>On behalf of the Obama family, I wish all of you a very merry Christmas. <p>Thanks, and have a wonderful holiday season.\" "
"285" "\"<i>The President.</i> Merry Christmas, everybody! Now, we're not going to take too much of your time, because today is about family and being together with the ones you love. And luckily for me, that means I get a little help on the weekly address as well. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> The holidays at the White House are such a wonderful time of year. We fill the halls with decorations, Christmas trees, and carolers, and this year, we invited more than 65,000 people to join us. Our theme was \\"A Children's Winter Wonderland,\\" and Americans, young and old, had a chance to come together and celebrate the season. <p><i>The President.</i> And today our family will join millions across the country in celebrating the birth of Jesus, the birth not just of a baby in a manger, but the message that has changed the world: to reach out to the sick, the hungry, the troubled, and above all else, to love one another as we would be loved ourselves. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> And we hope that this holiday season will be a chance for us to live out that message: to bridge our differences and lift up our family, friends, and neighbors and to reconnect with the values that bind us together. And as a country, that also means celebrating and honoring those who have served and sacrificed for all of us: our troops, veterans, and their families. <p><i>The President.</i> In just a few days, our combat mission in Afghanistan will be over. Our longest war will come to a responsible end. And that gives us an opportunity to step back and reflect upon all that these families have given us. We're able to gather with family and friends because our troops are willing to hug theirs goodbye and step forward to serve. After a long day, we can come home because they're willing to leave their families and deploy. We can celebrate the holidays because they're willing to miss their own. <p><i>The First Lady.</i> And so, as our troops continue to transition back home&mdash;back to our businesses, our schools, our congregations, and our communities&mdash;it's up to all of us to serve them as well as they've served us. And you can visit joiningforces.gov to find out how you can honor and support the troops, veterans, and military families in your communities. That's something we can do not only during the holiday season, but all year round. <p><i>The President.</i> So merry Christmas, everybody. May God bless you all. And we wish you and your family a happy and healthy 2015.\" "
